Lots of buzz suddenly about the possibility of a sharp fall in the dollar .
The Canadian dollar is back at parity with the greenback ; there are rumors that the Saudis are planning to diversify into euros , and maybe even that the Chinese might break the dollar peg .
A nice summary at Barry Ritholtz ’s blog The Big Picture .
I could say that I saw this coming ; the problem is that I ’ve been seeing it coming for several years , and it keeps not arriving ( and I do n’t know if this is really it , even now . )
The argument I and others have made is that the U.S. trade deficit is , fundamentally , not sustainable in the long run , which means that sooner or later the dollar has to decline a lot .
But international investors have been buying U.S. bonds at real interest rates barely higher than those offered in euros or yen — in effect , they ’ve been betting that the dollar wo n’t ever decline .
So , according to the story , one of these days there will be a Wile E. Coyote moment for the dollar : the moment when the cartoon character , who has run off a cliff , looks down and realizes that he ’s standing on thin air – and plunges .
In this case , investors suddenly realize that Stein ’s Law applies —
“ If something can not go on forever , it will stop ” – and they realize they need to get out of dollars , causing the currency to plunge .
Maybe the dollar ’s Wile E. Coyote moment has arrived – although , again , I ’ve been wrong about this so far .
Much more about all this in a thoroughly incomprehensible paper I recently published in the European journal Economic Policy .

Congressman Rick Renzi , an Arizona Republican , was locked in a close re-election battle last fall when the local United States attorney , Paul Charlton , was investigating him for corruption .
The investigation appears to have been slowed before Election Day , Mr. Renzi retained his seat , and Mr. Charlton ended up out of a job — one of eight prosecutors purged by the White House and the Justice Department .
The Arizona case adds a disturbing new chapter to that scandal .
Congress needs to determine whether Mr. Charlton was fired for any reason other than threatening the Republican Party ’s hold on a Congressional seat .
Mr. Renzi was fighting for his political life when the local press reported that he was facing indictment for a suspect land deal .
According to The Wall Street Journal , federal investigators met unexpected resistance from the Justice Department in getting approval to proceed and , perhaps as a result , the investigation was pushed past the election .
Mr. Renzi’s top aide , Brian Murray , admitted this week that when reports surfaced that his boss was being investigated , he had called Mr. Charlton ’s office asking for information .
Mr. Charlton ’s office did the right thing , according to Mr. Murray ’s account : it refused to comment .
Weeks later , Mr. Charlton was fired .
Being a typical Generation X male , itâ€™s no wonder Iâ€™ve always loved the movie Fight Club .
Here we have Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden , all lean muscle and crazy blue eyes , smiling like a shark , raging against the great dark plagues of his generation :
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes , working jobs we hate so we can buy [ things ]
Â we do n’t need .
We ’re the middle children of historyâ€ ¦
No purpose or place .
We have no Great War. No Great Depression .
Our great war is a spiritual war … our great depression is our lives .
Tyler was insane , of course â€ “ anyone who has seen the movie instantly understands that emulating Tyler Durden would involve psychosis , a padded cell , or life in prison , but thatâ€™s not really the point .
The point is that Tyler Durden symbolizes ourÂ outrage against the darker version of the American Dream : the endless parade of television commercials , consumerism , and materialism ; the lack of meaning and purpose ; the rat race ; the great spiritual vacuum .
I do not pretend to be an expert on David Fincherâ€™s remarkable movie or the Chuck PalahniukÂ novel from which it sprang , Â nor will I attempt to examine Fight Clubâ€™s themes comprehensively .
Iâ€™m just a fan of the movie .
Nothing more .
And this is my attempt to capture what I affectionately call Tyler Durdenâ€™s Tips for Living : filtered for sanity and common sense by yours truly and brought to you in Tylerâ€™s ( or his alter egoâ€™s ) own words .
1. Donâ€™t be a Mindless Consumer
We ’re consumers .
We are by - products of a lifestyle obsession .
Murder , crime , poverty , these things do n’t concern me .
What concerns me are celebrity magazines , television with 500 channels , some guy ’s name on my underwear .
Rogaine , Viagra , Olestra .
The people I know who used to sit in the bathroom with pornography , now they sit in the bathroom with their IKEA furniture catalogue .
You buy furniture .
You tell yourself , this is the last sofa I will ever need in my life .
Buy the sofa , then for a couple years you ’re satisfied that no matter what goes wrong , at least you ’ve got your sofa issue handled .
Then the right set of dishes .
Then the perfect bed .
The drapes .
The rug .
Then you ’re trapped in your lovely nest , and the things you used to own , now they own you .
You are not your job .
You are not how much money you have in the bank .
You are not the car you drive .
Rejectâ€¦ the importance of material possessions .
2. Do Something Meaningful
This is your life and it ’s ending one minute at a time .
Every word you read of this useless fine print is another second off your life .
Do n’t you have other things to do ?
Is your life so empty that you honestly can’t think of a better way to spend these moments ?
What would you wish you ’d done before you died ?
You have to know the answer to this question !
If you died right now , how would you feel about your life ?
3 . Think for Yourself
Or are you so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all that claim it ?
Do you read everything you ’re supposed to read ?
Do you think every thing you ’re supposed to think ?
Buy what you ’re told to want ?
4. Transcend Temporary , Unfulfilling RelationshipsÂ
Single - serving sugar , single - serving cream , single pat of butter .
The microwave Cordon Bleu hobby kit .
Shampoo - conditioner combos , sample - packaged mouthwash , tiny bars of soap .
The people I meet on each flight ?
They ’re single - serving friends .
5 . The Path to Enlightenment is Hard Work
I do n’t wanna die without any scars .
Hitting bottom is n’t a weekend retreat .
It ’s not aâ€¦ seminar .
Without pain , without sacrifice , we would have nothing .
And then , something happened .
I let go .
Lost in oblivion .
Dark and silent and complete .
I found freedom .
Losing all hope was freedom .
It ’s only after we ’ve lost everything that we ’re free to do anything .
Ironically , Tyler himself would hate having his knowledge pre-packaged as a self - help article , as he suggests Â in this slightly modified quotation :
Maybe self - improvement is n’t the answer … .
Maybe self - destruction is the answer .
But thankfully for me , Tylerâ€™s a fictional character ( in more ways than one ) , and is unlikely to show up on my front stoop bloody - knuckled and ready to brawl .
And to be honest , this isnâ€™t really Tyler Durdenâ€™s Tips for Living .
Itâ€™s a list of tips derived from Fight Club , heavily filtered by my own notions of self - improvement , and dredged for sanity and common sense .
I suppose I could have made this article about 2 pages longer by addingÂ exposition and analysis to Tylerâ€™s quotations , but why ?
The Internet is already overflowing with such analysis .
Given the tremendous cult - following that this movie enjoys , Iâ€™m quite sure someone will pop in here to tell me how Iâ€™ve misunderstood the movie or misinterpreted Tylerâ€™s intentions .
Fair enough .
Just know this : fan of the movie or not , Iâ€™m not planning to throw any real - life punches anytime soon , so weâ€™ll have to restrict our debate to the comments section of this Website , if itâ€™s all the same to you .
And for those of you who have n’t seen the movie and who might consider doing so upon my recommendation , know this : the movie is vulgar , violent , sexual , bloody , and brimmingÂ with ideas that some people struggle to understand .
Â Â According to the director , the movieÂ was intended to be like a sharp stick in the eye . Â
And it is .
But for so many members of the lost generation , what a wonderful and welcome stick in the eye it turned out to be .

Scientists say the snakes smash into walls in an effort to escape
Experts at the earthquake bureau in Nanning , in southern Guangxi province , monitor local snake farms via 24 - hour internet video links .
Scientists said the serpents can sense a quake from 120 km ( 75 miles ) away , up to five days before it happens .
They respond erratically , even smashing into walls to escape , scientists said .
" Of all the creatures on the Earth , snakes are perhaps the most sensitive to earthquakes , " Jiang Weisong , director of the earthquake bureau in Nanning , told The China Daily .
The reptiles respond by behaving extremely erratically , he said .
" When an earthquake is about to occur , snakes will move out of their nests , even in the cold of winter .
If the earthquake is a big one , the snakes will even smash into walls while trying to escape , " he told the newspaper .
Nanning - an area prone to earthquakes - is one of 12 Chinese cities monitored by hi-tech equipment .
It also has 143 animal monitoring units .
" By installing cameras over the snake nests , we have improved our ability to forecast earthquakes .
The system could be extended to other parts of the country to make our earthquake forecasts more precise , " Mr Jiang said .
China is frequently struck by earthquakes .
In 1976 , some 250,000 people died when the city of Tangshan was devastated by an earthquake .
Alien hand syndrome is a rare disorder where one hand functions involuntarily .
Lee Balterman / Getty Images
Picture this scenario :
You 're napping on a breezy Sunday afternoon in the hammock of your backyard , enjoying the peace and quiet of your suburban utopia .
Slowly , your left hand eases up , wraps around your neck and you awake to find your own hand locked in a kung - fu grip on your throat .
You pry it loose with your other hand , finger by finger , until it relents and you 're left there staring at a hand that suddenly does n't feel like your own .
While it sounds like something from a B - grade horror movie , it 's actually a very odd and very real medical condition known as " alien hand syndrome " ( AHS ) .
In this article , we 'll explain exactly what alien hand syndrome is , check out the brain function behind it and examine how pop culture seems to be hooked on this unusual condition .

Exactly what is Alien Hand Syndrome ?
Alien hand syndrome is a rare neurological disorder in which one hand functions involuntarily , with the victim completely unaware of its action .
While the example above may be extreme , people who suffer from AHS have exhibited similar symptoms in certain cases .
Less horrifying symptoms include involuntary reaching and grasping , touching the face or tearing at clothing .
More extreme cases have involved involuntarily stuffing food in the mouth , preventing the normal hand from completing simple tasks and self inflicted punching or choking .
While it 's viewed as more of a nuisance than a medical threat , its sufferers often experience psychological problems and embarrassment and are occasionally put in harm 's way as result of the renegade limb 's actions [ source : Turkington ] .
AHS differs from other conditions of involuntary limb movement in that the actions of the affected limb have purpose and are goal - oriented .
The affected hand will pick up an object and attempt to use it , or will perform a simple task , such as buttoning and unbuttoning a shirt .
Patients retain all sense of feeling in the alien hand , but they often describe feelings of disassociation .
Patients may also exhibit strange behaviors , such as speaking to the hand , claiming demonic possession or referring to it in the third person [ source : Goldberg ] .
Also known as anarchic hand , AHS was first identified in 1909 and there have only been 40 to 50 recorded cases since .
It 's believed that other instances may have been misdiagnosed as part of an existing mental health disorder .
The rarity and non-threatening nature of AHS has led to infrequent research and a lack of hard data , resulting in a condition that 's largely mysterious .
Very recently , however , new clues have been uncovered that help pinpoint the part of the brain that is active during AHS episodes [ source : Kumral ] .
In the next section , we 'll look at the brain function behind AHS .
The first time I saw Daily Show correspondent John Oliver was at the UCB during their Best Comedy in the Universe Festival .
During his half hour set , there was no thirty - second period where the audience was n't laughing uproariously .
From that alone I can say that Oliver is a tremendous talent and I can't wait to see him take the mic once again .
Which of your Daily Show assignments has been your favorite thus far ?
I particularly liked the Bush / Lincoln comparison that we did a couple of weeks ago .
That was good fun to do .
And breaking my nose whilst charging at the Confederate army takes some beating .
Are there any issues that you 'd like to tackle on The Daily Show that you 've yet to tackle ?
I will tackle any issue .
I see myself very much as the Reggie White of satire .
If any issue tries to run through me , I will smack that shit down before dancing arrogantly over the now unconscious issue shouting ‘ not in my house , baby ’ .
I have made myself the promise that my work at the Daily Show will not be done until I have tackled every issue known to man and three others .
Prior to moving to America , what was your perception of the US ?
My political perception of the US was similar to that of the rest of the planet which was ‘ what on earth are you doing ? ’
To paraphrase Oscar Wilde ;
‘ To elect him once was unfortunate – to elect him twice was un-fucking - believable ’ .
How has it changed since the move ?
It ’s been interesting being on the inside looking out .
I do n’t think the rest of the world appreciates just how divided this country is .
America is presented to us foreigners very much as a united front , which clearly could n’t be further from the truth .
And this is where the current worrying trend of anti-Americanism is fostered – it is too easy to forget that not only do many people here have to live with a president whom they did n’t elect , but they also have to live with the people who did .
That this country has not once more erupted into civil war shows admirable restraint .
It does seem a shame that some of the most wonderful things this nation was built on – free speech , a questioning of authority , and non conformity have somehow been twisted into being labeled ‘ Un - American ’ .
What are some aspects of American Culture that you enjoy that are n't found in the UK ?
You have something here called ‘ decent food ’ which could really catch on back in the UK if people just gave it a chance .
Are there , perhaps , some things you 'd like to see American 's adapt from the British or Vice Versa ?
Well you adapted our desire to rule the world extremely well .
In return , I think we should take ‘ 2 and a half Men ’ .
Many British television start off as radio shows .
Do you think that this is a good production method ?
Why or why not ?
I do think it ’s a great idea .
Radio offers you far more control , which means that you do n’t have to deal with as much interference from wherever it is exactly that interference always seems to come from .
Also , not having to worry about the logistics of shooting a joke opens up a world of infinite possibility and means that the most important thing to concentrate on is the script .
I co-wrote a radio series in Britain called ‘ The Department ’ where we could have 1000 seals performing an interpretative dance about what mankind was doing to their habitat , before having another sketch where we were shot out of a water canon at a crowd of protestors .
Television is necessarily more disciplined , and it ’s good to be able to do literally anything first , before having to worry about whether or not it is possible .
America has a reputation of adapting British shows , such as The Office or Men Behaving Badly .
What are some shows that you 'd like to see adapted ?
There ’s a program called ‘ Look Around You ’ which you should have a crack at .
Their first series had superb 10 - minute episodes about different areas of science .
If you ’re not going to remake it , then the least you could do is show it .
Do you remember the US Men Behaving Badly ?
I get the feeling that everyone forgot that that was a show .
Rob Schneider was in it .
What do you think of his films ?
I do n’t remember that .
Although I am aware of Mr Schneider and his canon of work .
I do n’t want to speak out of line , but subtlety does not seem to be a regular bedfellow of his .
Could you come up with a premise for a Rob Schneider film right now ?
I could do that , but I feel that ’s something best left to Robert himself .
What is the British equivalent of a Rob Schneider film ?
I ’m not sure where this Rob Schneider fascination is coming from .
Do n’t get me wrong , I ’ve been in interviews dominated by Rob Schneider questions before , but never quite to this extent .
I guess our nearest equivalent to a Rob Schneider film was probably the Battle of the Somme .
Do you have aspirations of writing or acting in films someday ?
I have aspirations not only of doing that , but of taking over the very concept of film itself .
What I will do with it from that point on is between me , my Military Advisers , and my Line Producer .
What sort of acting training do you have ?
None .
If you have n’t noticed by now , I have absolutely no range whatsoever .
I merely operate in degrees of loudness .
What did you study in Cambridge ?
English .
Do you plan on getting a website or blog in the future ?
Maybe a website .
Although johnoliver.com is currently owned by two interior designers from Reno , Nevada .
Their names are John and Jennifer Oliver and do visit their site , especially if you live in the Reno area , and are interested in their philosophy of ‘ creating a total environment through living color , interior space planning , texture , carpet , furniture , drapery and fabric ’ .
Instead I have bought the address mrjohnoliver.com .
I ’m going to try to lead a new wave of formality on the internet , which up to this point has been overly familiar .
I have n’t done anything with the address yet – but when I do be prepared for increased politeness across the superhighway .
Do you plan on working with Daniel Kitson again ?
What was it like working with Daniel ?
I ’ve never worked with Daniel in any formal sense .
He ’s my best friend , so he regularly takes things that I ’ve said to him and repeats them on stage , passing these ideas off as his own .
But he assures me this is entirely normal .
He came over here to watch the Superbowl on TV with me .
He bought an entire cheesecake with much big talk of how he was going to eat the whole thing .
Rest assured , over ¾ of it remain in my fridge at the moment .
What do you like to do after a performance ?
Go home and repent .
Yes “ digital brand experience ” – not user experience .
Because branding is also responsible for the way you experience a product or a service .
Let ’s say that user experience concerns …

WASHINGTON , May 10 — President Bush offered his first public concession to try to resolve the impasse over Iraq war spending today , as he confronted new pressure from his own party over the conflict and House approval of a plan that would provide money for combat operations only through midsummer .
After a briefing at the Pentagon around midday , Mr. Bush said he had instructed Joshua Bolten , the White House chief of staff , to reach “ common ground ” with lawmakers of both parties over setting firm goals , or benchmarks , to measure progress in Iraq .
Mr. Bush had previously insisted he wanted about $ 95 billion for the military with no strings attached .
“ It makes sense to have benchmarks as a part of our discussion on how to go forward , ” Mr. Bush said , even as he threatened to veto the House plan , which was approved on a vote of 221 to 205 , to require him to seek approval in two months for the balance of the war money .
Before that vote tonight , House Democrats demonstrated their opposition to continuing the war when 169 of them voted for a separate plan that would have required the withdrawal of American troops to begin in 90 days , with most forces out within another six months .
MacWorld 2007 Predictions : Apple No Longer Just a Computer Maker
“ I need the simplest phone you can produce , I need it to run WebKit , and oh yeah , I ’m going to need a big “ Apple ” button in the middle of it . ”
That ’s how I believe the conversation started between Steve Jobs and the president of the handset manufacturer who will be proudly appearing with Jobs on stage at next week ’s MacWorld Expo .
The 2007 MacWorld Expo is the most anticipated Steve Jobs appearance in years and for good reason .
I have it on good word from trusted friends close to the situation that this one is going to be special .
Really , really special .
So do n’t gear yourself up for a letdown , because it ai n’t gonna happen .
You might not get all 100 of the products you ’ve been speculating about , but what you * will * get will be really , really good .
The world clearly does n’t need another post speculating what will be announced but I ’m going to do one anyway .
I claim no detailed inside information , no clairvoyance , and no 100 % certainty .
These are speculative statements , just like all MacWorld predictions .
i Theater
While most people are occupied with thoughts of an Apple phone , the one thing I ’m most confident about is that this year ’s MacWorld will be largely dominated by the big screen .
I expect a full Netflix / Blockbuster killer here and I expect at least one , but probably all of the major studios to already be on board or close to it .
i Theater will likely be available as an add - on box for your current TV and also possibly integrated into an Apple - branded , Samsung ( or Sony ) manufactured LCD TV … probably in two sizes : 37 - inch and 50 - inch ( or thereabouts ) .
Most of the world ’s plasmas and LCDs are already made in only a handful of factories so slapping an Apple casing and some extras on should n’t be overly difficult .
i Theater will be dead - simple to use , and initially it will only do two things : download movies for $ 5 and play them .
The DRM scheme will be simple : three plays or three months … whichever comes sooner .
i Theater will eventually pull down video from all sorts of places , most notably Google Video , and by extension , YouTube … but for now , the proposition must remain simple : forget Netflix and Blockbuster …
iTheater is where you should rent your movies .
I also expect live and recorded concerts to be a part of this offering shortly .
Remember , Steve Jobs does n’t hate the TV as a medium … he just hates the TV ecosystem .
MobileMe
This is the phone we ’ve all been waiting for .
It may not be as mature as we ’d like it to be , but it will be a fascinating start .
In listening to Dan Benjamin ’s podcast with John Gruber , I noticed that the majority of their skepticism around an Apple phone revolved around the problem of keeping it quiet .
While Dan and John both think an Apple phone may be announced , they had a hard time believing there have n’t really been any solid leaks yet given the extraordinary amount of non-Apple people that must be involved in such a thing ( e.g. your carriers , your hardware manufacturers , etc. ) .
While I think this is a valid concern , look again at the first sentence of this blog post .
If Apple were to make a phone , there is a sliding scale of how many non-Apple people they could involve .
The end - all , be - all phone with every feature under the sun might involve the help of many external resources .
But imagine the other end of the scale for a moment : what if you could pack all data capability into one lightweight framework ?
A framework that supports http data transfer , html , javascript , cookies , and the rest of the toolbox we seem to rely on for all of our data needs these days ?
Oh wait , you already can .
It ’s called WebKit and it ’s been embedded in many Nokia phones for several months now .
It ’s the same engine that powers one of the best browsers in the world : Safari .
Has anyone ever used the WebKit browser on Nokia phones ?
It ’s the best mobile browser I ’ve ever used .
So if Apple confined 90 % of their data features to a simple instance of WebKit , what sorts of things could they provide in an easily accessible way via the default start page ( something like mobile.apple.com ) that would come up every time you hit the Apple button ?
Google Maps with Live Traffic .
Access to your contacts stored on .
Mac .
Access to your email ( anyone notice the nice new web interface to .
Mac mail ? ) .
Select video clips .
Google searches .
Wikipedia searches .
What else do you really need ?
It ’s all available in HTML these days and with a little server - side simplification , it can be made to look really pretty via Mobile WebKit .
It ’s possible the integration goes deeper , but under the scenario I just described , Apple needs very little help from anyone .
Just a simple handset with an Apple button that launches WebKit .
This will be the Expo where WebKit goes primetime and busts out of the browser .
In the phone , in the iTheater , and in whatever other devices Apple may come out with .
Leopard
Expect plenty of Vista bashing here .
When Leopard was first unveiled , we were told “ many ” of its features would be revealed at a later date , so expect a few biggies to be shown off .
I ’d love to see built - in virtualization , but for some reason Apple is still pushing the whole Boot Camp approach .
I tend to think Boot Camp is more proof - of - concept than anything else , and virtualization is really what 95 % of users will care about and use ( if they must ) .
I ’d love to see some implementation of Jef Raskin ’s “ interfaceless interface ” principles in Leopard as well .
For instance , if you sit down at the computer and start typing “ 59 x 20 ” , the calculator should just automatically pop up and compute it for you .
Same thing if you type something like “ Dear John ” ; your word processor should pop up and begin a well - formed letter .
Who knows what else Leopard will hold , but I expect several more showstoppers .
Laptops
I think the only thing we ’ll see on this front are new MacBookPros .
The MacBookPros , to me , are a poor value proposition compared to MacBooks right now and that situation is bound to change soon .
If not here , then a few months down the road .
I expect subtly new cases and I hope a new subnotebook species .
i Pods
The only new iPods I can see coming out are video iPods with a different form factor and bigger screen .
I do n’t know how well the current video iPods are selling , but they are the only model that I never really hear anybody talking about .
Revision one seems far from perfect to me and an update here would be nice .
A touch - screen could also be included on these units .
Blu - Ray
If Apple has n’t already internally jumped off of the Blu - Ray bandwagon , they have to be thinking about it .
Blu - Ray and HD - DVD are in a battle for hearts and minds right now and a lot of people I ’ve talked to , including Danny over at Mavromatic , think Sony is losing the battle so far .
Apple did Sony a huge favor by supporting Blu - Ray early on , but things may have shifted since then .
I wonder , in fact , how the latest discussions between Steve Jobs and Sony have gone :
Sony : “ Hey Steve , how ’s the weather in Cupertino !
We ’re still on for co-branding those 50 inch Sony LCDs , right ? ”
Jobs : “ Can you guarantee me they wo n’t catch fire like those laptop batteries you sold us ? ”
Sony : “ Hee hee !
Sorry about that !
Yeah , these are n’t battery powered .
We ’re still on for Blu - Ray , right ? ”
Jobs : “ We do n’t comment on future product announcements . ”
Caveat : I ’m not a good person to ask about the Blu - Ray / HD - DVD debate .
I think by the time it ’s all decided , we ’ll be doing most of our stuff over IP anyway .
Mystery Google Integration
I expect Apple ’s increasingly cozy relationship to Google to get even cozier at this year ’s Expo .
Maps on the Apple phone would be one possible integration point , as well as maybe something on the video front .
Vague , I know … but it ’s hard for me to believe the two companies have n’t been working behind the scenes on * something * lately .
iMac
Do n’t care … they are already cool enough .
PowerMacs
Do n’t care … they are already overkill for everything except video editing .
Wrap Up
When you give detailed predictions about things , you ’re bound to be wrong on at least some counts , but one thing I ’m fairly sure of is that 2007 will be the year that Apple starts to shed its image as a high - end computer company .
To some extent , they ’ve already accomplished this with the iPod , but the next wave of product releases — encompassing things like phones , living room technology , and possibly another gadget we are n’t even expecting — will begin to move Apple out of the high - end computer zone and into the digital lifestyle zone .
They ’ve already mentioned this shift before , but my feeling is that next week is when it really comes together .
Supervolcanoes can sleep for centuries or millennia before producing incredibly massive eruptions that can drop ash across an entire continent .
One of the largest supervolcanoes in the world lies beneath Yellowstone National Park , which spans parts of Wyoming , Montana and Idaho .
Though the Yellowstone system is active and expected to eventually blow its top , scientists do n’t think it will erupt any time soon .
Yet significant activity continues beneath the surface .
And the activity has been increasing lately , scientists have discovered .
In addition , the nearby Teton Range , in a total surprise , is getting shorter .
The findings , reported this month in the Journal of Geophysical Research — Solid Earth , suggest that a slow and gradual movement caused by a giant hotspot of molten rock beneath a volcano can shape a landscape more than sudden ground movements caused by the volcano ’s frequent earthquakes .

For the past 17 years , researchers used Global Positioning System ( GPS ) satellites to monitor the horizontal and vertical motion of the Yellowstone caldera — a huge volcanic crater formed by a super - eruption more than 600,000 years ago .
The movement of the caldera indicates what ’s going on underground where magma , or molten rock , is stored for the next eruption .
When magma builds up , some of it starts to rise toward the surface , where it presses against the floor of the caldera .
The pressure makes the caldera bulge , while a decrease in pressure makes it sink .
The 45 - by - 30 - mile caldera bulged and deflated significantly during the study period .
“ We think it ’s a combination of magma being intruded under the caldera and hot water released from the magma being pressurized because it ’s trapped , ” said lead study author Robert Smith from the University of Utah .
“ I do n’t believe this is evidence for an impending volcanic eruption , but it would be prudent to keep monitoring the volcano . ”
More energy
The researchers also found that 10 times more energy goes into producing the slow and gradual ground deformations at Yellowstone than goes into ground movements released suddenly by the area ’s frequent quakes .
Data shows that the caldera floor sank 4.4 inches from 1987 until 1995 .
From 1995 until 2000 , the northwest rim of the caldera rose about 3 inches , followed by another 1.4 - inch rise until 2003 .
Then between 2000 and 2003 , the caldera floor sank a little more than an inch .
And then from 2004 to 2006 the central caldera floor rose faster than ever , springing up nearly 7 inches during the three - year span .
“ The rate is unprecedented , at least in terms of what scientists have been able to observe in Yellowstone , ” Smith said .
Abnormal fault
These results could explain another surprise finding :
The ground along Teton fault — an active fault running 40 miles north - south along the eastern base of Teton Range in the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming just south of Yellowstone — moves in the opposite direction compared to what ’s been previously thought .
Typically , when a big earthquake takes place on a normal fault such as Teton , the ground is pulled apart .
This kind of extension or stretching causes valleys to drop downward and mountains to rise upwards .
Thousands of earthquakes over millions of years built the mountains that comprise the Teton Range today .
But recent measurements showed a different trend .
Researchers found that just the opposite is happening with Jackson Hole — the valley below the Teton .
The valley is rising up slowly and the mountains are dropping down .
What the researchers think is happening , on a short - term basis at least , is that the bulging Yellowstone hotspot north of the Tetons is pushing against the north edge of Jackson Hole and jamming it against the mountains .
( This is also causing the southwest part of the Yellowstone plateau , under the hotspot , to slide downhill at a rate of one - sixth of an inch each year . ) .
“ The textbook model for a normal fault is not what ’s happening at the Teton fault , ” Smith said .
“ The mountains are going down relative to the valley going up .
That ’s a total surprise . ”
This motion , according to researchers , is also expected to produce bigger quakes , confusing the picture of how earthquakes occur in that area .
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - More than 800 Hong Kong residents have called on authorities to reclassify the Bible as “ indecent ” due to its sexual and violent content , following an uproar over a sex column in a university student journal .
A spokesperson for Hong Kong ’s Television and Entertainment Licensing authority ( TELA ) said it had received 838 complaints about the Bible by noon on Wednesday .
The complaints follow the launch of an anonymous Web site -- www.truthbible.net -- which said the holy book “ made one tremble ” given its sexual and violent content , including rape and incest .
The Web site said the Bible ’s sexual content “ far exceeds ” that of a recent sex column published in the Chinese University ’s “ Student Press ” magazine , which had asked readers whether they ’d ever fantasised about incest or bestiality .
That column was later deemed “ indecent ” by the Obscene Articles Tribunal , sparking a storm of debate about social morality and freedom of speech .
Student editors of the journal defended it , saying open sexual debate was a basic right .
If the Bible is similarly classified as “ indecent ” by authorities , only those over 18 could buy the holy book and it would need to be sealed in a wrapper with a statutory warning notice .
TELA said it was still undecided on whether the Bible had violated Hong Kong ’s obscene and indecent articles laws .
But a local protestant minister shrugged off this possibility .
“ If there is rape mentioned in the Bible , it does n’t mean it encourages those activities , ” said Reverend Wu Chi-wai .
“ It ’s just common sense ... I do n’t think that criticism will have strong support from the public , ” he added .
Games have always prepared young people for war but , asks Pat Kane , should we be concerned about the increasingly explicit links between digital gaming and the military ?
As the situation in Iraq gets bloodier and more uncontrollable , who would take on the task of promoting the idea of enlistment to America 's youth ?
Step forward Colonel Casey Wardynski , who is deploying perhaps the most cost - effective recruitment method presently available to the US army - a war game .
Whereas television advertising costs between $ 5 and $ 10 per hour to get the US army brand in front of each viewer , the program Colonel Wardnyski is supporting costs an average of 10 cents per hour - based on the $ 2.5 m annual running costs for the website where the game America 's Army is available for free download .
And people are playing : 29 million have grabbed a copy , and there are 6.1 million active users .
But that 's only the start .
The whole purpose of America 's Army , a first - person - shooter simulation of army training and combat whose development began in 1999 and which was launched in 2002 ( on July 4 , Independence Day , of course ) , is to recruit more soldiers .
" Players can download it free from the internet , and use it to try the role of soldier , virtually , and see if it 's something they want to do in real life , " said Wardynski , who has a doctorate from Rand and is a professor at West Point Academy , the US 's pre-eminent military tuition college , at the first Serious Games Summit in October last year .
In fact , between 20 and 40 % of new US army recruits have already played the game .
The strapline on the console version , just launched in the US and due to be in the UK by Christmas , gets to the point : " Our game developers do n't rely on imagination , " it says .
So is the marriage of war and games inevitable ?
After all , humans play games for wonderful , enriching reasons - and sometimes for no reason at all .
But they have always played games to prepare for war .
Some of our earliest and most enduring board games , such as chess and Go , began as teaching tools for the children of kings and emperors .
Through such games they understood strategy , imagined the battlefield and saw the consequences of attack and defence .
Art of war
It should be no surprise that a walk down the aisles of any computer games retailer can seem like a visit to your local military academy .
From Rome : Total War Barbarian Invasion to Battlefield 2 : Modern Combat , whether the scenarios are fantastic or grittily realistic , the arts of war are represented and celebrated .
But we should be aware that this link between digital gaming and the military is more than just the latest expression of an enduring human tradition , or the populist instinct of a highly commercial sector .
These links are explicit , current and increasingly overt .
As Heather Chaplin , co-author of Smart Bomb , a new book on the games industry , says : " I spent four years walking into the offices of upper - echelon games developers , and can't think of one who had n't accepted an invitation to work for the CIA , the FBI or the Department of Defence .
It is amazing how willing the people in the industry are to give their talents and time to military purposes . "
Figures detailing the success of America 's Army were presented at the summit - sponsored by the US army - in Washington last month , and as one journalist put it , " the army 's experiment in serious gaming is starting to look like a franchise " .
As industry veterans will readily tell you , games do n't get to be a franchise if the gameplay is n't very good .
America 's
Army is the result of an intense embrace between the best talents of the game business and the recruitment and training imperatives of a military superpower .
In addition , the Department of Defence has spent $ 100 m creating an entire campus , the Institute for Creative Technologies at the University of California , which turns games intended for soldier training into marketable products : Full Spectrum Warrior is the most notable example .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( Darpa ) - the US government 's powerful military laboratory - has a range of projects that blur the line between online gaming , virtual worlds and military performance , employing counter - culture game gurus such as JC Herz , the New York Times ' first videogames critic .
Military roots
But this should not be so surprising .
Computer games , like any hi-tech industry , have roots in military technology : there is a direct line from the first air force radar screen to today 's pixellated hyper -real images .
The first videogames were made in the 50s and 60s , by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) funded by the Department of Defence .
Until the mid-90s , the department was funding its own , clunky , game tools such as Simnet ( for training tank drivers ) .
But people such as Mike Zyda , a computing pioneer who was a co-creator of America 's Army and is now director of the University of Southern California 's Viterbi School of Engineering 's GamePipe Laboratory , noted some time ago how compelling games were becoming - in terms of realistic graphics , inventive brio and sheer cost - effectiveness .
His 1997 paper , Linking Entertainment and Defense , gave the initial rationale .
A meeting in 1999 between four - star general Paul Kern and the head of Disney 's Imagineering division Bran Ferren lit the policy spark .
The spark has started a fire that has burned through the industry , and few seem untouched by some degree of military service provision .
As Chaplin says , younger gamemakers ' sanguinity in the face of this is worth some comment .
She profiles the designer Will Wright , responsible for seemingly thoughtful and relationship - based games such as SimCity and The Sims , and who is about to launch the new god game Spore .
Yet Wright turns up for meetings sporting his CIA - embroidered flight jacket , a thank - you for work he did for the agency .
The chapter closes with Wright accepting the " fun " challenge from Darpa to create a robot car that could drive to Las Vegas by itself .
Why did he think it was sponsoring the event ?
" Well , I think that should be pretty obvious , " says Wright .
" They want to be able to build land - based cruise missiles . "
So why is the US computer games industry , as compared to , say , music , movies or television , so explicitly gung - ho ?
Partly it is the lure of " problem - solving " projects for a class of digital expert .
They are so compelled by the challenges that they bracket out any distracting context , often involving wider ethical or political questions .
Steven Johnson 's recent book Everything Bad Is Good For
You made a case for the cognitive benefits of computer games .
Though the content may be violent , the mental gymnastics involved in negotiating these complex worlds had to be recognised , and not demonised , he argued .
What 's intriguing is that this is exactly what senior military games people such as Jeff Wilkinson , a program manager at the US army 's Simulation & Training Technology Center , want .
In return for their investment , they want a higher level of cognitive performance .
" We are frequently looking for ' first - person thinker ' environments and not ' first - person shooter ' environments , " says Wilkinson .
" This provides a significant opportunity for gamemakers to focus their resources in new ways . "
He says the benefits of investment will accrue mostly to education , not entertainment .
Science - fiction vision
Chaplin quotes Michael Macedonia , a major mover in army simulation circles , recommending the visions of science - fiction writers such as Orson Scott Card 's Ender 's Game , a novel in which six - year - olds unknowingly fight remote wars through their gaming consoles .
Greg Costikian , a designer who recently left Nokia to start his own company , Manifesto Games , is agnostic about the relationship between games and the military .
But unlike many , he has a strong opinion on America 's Army .
" Given that we have a volunteer military , the military needs to recruit .
And if it 's legitimate for them to use TV and print advertising , what 's wrong with doing so through a game ? "
This position is shared by Sheldon Pacotti , the scriptwriter for the forthcoming America 's Army console game , Rise of a Soldier .
His experience on AA , working closely with special forces soldiers , was that their " nuanced ideas about the role of an outside military force " in foreign interventions was much more subtle than the understanding of either American politicians or citizens .
" The truth about terrorism , " Pacotti told me , " is that it is much more complex than any plot you could dream up for a game or any other type of entertainment .
The virtue of Rise of a Soldier is that it does n't set out to demonise the enemies , their culture , or their worldview . "
The gamemakers have a point : we should n't automatically damn each product that bears a military title , given that the actual gameplay may be subtler than the blood 'n ' guts marketing .
And it 's not as if there is n't a small counter - movement in the game sector .
The same Washington conference sponsored by the US army featured serious games that were about non-violent conflict resolution in the Middle East , and distribution of food by the United Nations .
And the rise of modding and machinima allows a wider and more subtle range of world - view and aesthetics , hopefully similar to independent movies and music .
But Heather Chaplin was inspired to write Smart Bomb from the anthropologists ' old saw : show me the games of your children , and I will show you the next hundred years .
" Maybe there are people who are not frightened by the idea of an increasingly militarised culture .
But I am . "

After 44 years in journalism , I do n’t get angry very often about the dirty tricks that so often besmirch the American political process .
But I am angry about the Valerie Plame affair , a sordid tale that flared anew this week when President George Bush commuted the prison sentence of Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby .
I am not angry at the commutation or the pettifogging partisan exchanges it spawned .
I am angry at the underlying event – the fact that an American patriot whose only crime was to serve her country in a dangerous and honorable profession had her mission undercut for partisan political purposes .
I am even angrier that the vicious “ outing ” of Valerie Plame put her sources at risk – the men and women in foreign countries who had risked their own lives to help America in our war on terror .
In the intelligence trade , such foreign sources are called “ assets . ” I call them heroes .
And they are the ones who were put most at risk after columnist Robert Novak revealed Plame ’s CIA connection as part of a clumsy Bush administration effort to discredit her husband , former Ambassador Joseph Wilson , who had become a critic of the Iraq war .
To explain why this case angers me so deeply , let me give you a number : RA68031300 .
It identifies me as a Vietnam - era veteran of the United States Army .
After enlisting , I took basic training at Fort Leonard Wood , Mo. , where I received orders sending me to Fort Sill , Okla . , for training in artillery , after which I expected to be sent to Vietnam .
Because someone in the Pentagon noticed I had worked for United Press International , I was called out on my last day of basic and redirected to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point .
I ultimately became editor of the post newspaper , the Pointer View .
So in the end , my personal risk in my military career was limited to some really awful haircuts .
But the names of 58,000 of my comrades engraved on a wall in Washington , D.C. , prove that my story could have ended differently .
Those names also explain why I will never forgive anyone who willfully puts the lives of America ’s military or intelligence personnel or our friends abroad in danger .
And that ’s exactly what former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage did when he leaked Plame ’s identity to Novak – and what Novak did when he published the name of a covert CIA agent .
Between Armitage ’s dishonorable act and Novak ’s dishonorable act were a string of other dishonorable acts , including an executive order by President Bush empowering Vice President Cheney to declassify classified information , which Cheney did , thus allowing Libby to shop Plame ’s identity around in hopes of finding a journalist willing to smear Wilson through his wife .
With Libby ’s information confirming Armitage ’s original tip , Novak willingly blew Plame ’s cover .
In so doing , he did n’t put Plame at personal risk , because she was not overseas at the time .
But he did irrevocably damage her mission – and put those human “ assets ” at risk .
You see , al - Qaeda and its ilk rarely try to kill CIA agents – or anyone else who can fight back .
What these cowards do is kill people who have worked with U.S. agents .
You can imagine the conversation : “ Hmm , that Valerie Plame who visited here turns out to be a CIA agent .
Did n’t she hang out at Hamid ’s coffee shop a lot ? ”
Next day , Hamid ’s body turns up , along with the bodies of his wife and family , all of whom were tortured to death before his eyes .
That ’s the way our enemies play the game .
That ’s why we train brave men and women like Valerie Plame so America can fight back .
The outing of Plame may have been technically legal , as the commutation of Libby ’s sentence undoubtedly was .
But our supreme law , the U.S. Constitution , still defines treason as giving aid and comfort to our enemies in time of war .
And in this aging veteran ’s eyes , that ’s exactly what Armitage , Cheney , Libby and Novak did .

Mr Obama said Pakistan must do more to tackle al - Qaeda
Mr Obama made the comments in a speech outlining his foreign policy positions .
Pakistan 's foreign ministry said any threat to act against al - Qaeda from within its territory should not be used for political point - scoring .
Earlier this month , Mr Obama 's chief rival , Hillary Clinton , described him as " naive " on foreign policy .
The attack from Mrs Clinton came after a televised debate between Democrat presidential hopefuls .
If we have actionable intelligence about high - value terrorist targets and President Musharraf wo n't act , we will
Barack Obama
During the debate Mr Obama said he would be willing to meet leaders of states such as Cuba , North Korea and Iran without conditions .
In his speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars , in Washington , Mr Obama criticised the Bush administration 's focus on al - Qaeda in Iraq , saying US President George W Bush was " confusing " the mission .
He said Americans were more vulnerable to terrorist attacks than before the 9/11 attacks because of a war in Iraq " that should never have been authorised and should never have been waged " .
" The first step must be getting off the wrong battlefield in Iraq , and taking the fight to the terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan , " he said .
Aid conditions
Mr Obama said General Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan 's president , must do more to end terrorist operations in his country .
He said he would make the hundreds of millions of dollars in US military aid to Pakistan conditional on the following actions by the Pakistani government :
substantial progress in closing down terrorist training camps
evict foreign fighters
prevent the Taleban from using Pakistan as staging area for attacks in Afghanistan
" If we have actionable intelligence about high - value terrorist targets and President Musharraf wo n't act , we will , " Mr Obama said .
The BBC's Jonathan Beale , in Washington , says such comments are clearly designed to bolster his credentials among a domestic audience .
But a spokeswoman for Pakistan 's foreign ministry , Tasnim Aslam , told the AFP news agency that talk of military action was a serious matter and political candidates and commentators should " show responsibility " .
White House spokesman Tony Snow defended Pakistan 's leadership , saying it was working hard to fight al - Qaeda and Taleban fighters within its borders .
Gen Musharraf has been a key US ally in its so - called " war on terror " since the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks .
But US officials have publicly said recently that they believe Pakistan has let al - Qaeda and Taleban militants reorganise themselves in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan .
The more I think about Microsoft , the more I realise that they are , possibly for the first time , seriously cornered ( or surrounded , depending on how you want to see it ) .
A little history will clarify why I think so - and why I think that this might really be the beginning of the end for Microsoft .
Herb Sutter refers to a comment by Bill Dunlap , a product manager for Visual C++ , on the future of MFC :
MFC – we are working on a huge update to MFC that should knock your socks off .
I ca n’t tell you too much right now , but this is closer than you might thing < g > .
Intriguing , since with ATL and then the whole .NET thing , including managed C++ and C++/CLI , I ’d assumed that MFC was all - but deprecated .
I can see the value of this for maintaining existing projects , but for new ones ?
I like this comment by Dan Shappir :
The only reason I can see for doing significant UI development in C++ is for cross - platform support , and in that case I would probably choose Qt .
Actually I can think of a few other reasons , such as performance and compatibility with older versions of Windows , but then again why not use Delphi ?
Talking of Delphi , it ’s interesting that according to Shappir ’s post referenced above , Microsoft ’s Visual C++ team had similar feedback to Borland / Codegear :
Damien Watkins , a Program Manager on the Visual C++ team , stated quite frankly that the feedback they have received from C++ developers is that they prefer to use C# for developing managed code for .
NET .
So what is the new positioning for C ++?
Apparently it ’s : A strong emphasis on developing unmanaged , native applications
Tool for achieving interop between existing native code and new managed code
I guess this ties in with renewed investment in MFC .
The Buncombe County Sheriff ’s Office arrested activists Mark and Deborah Kuhn in West Asheville Wednesday morning after a complaint that the couple was desecrating an American flag .
They say a deputy invaded their home and used excessive force .
[ The photo at right , taken by a neighbor , shows Mark on the ground , with Deborah standing by , during the arrest . ]
The flag was hung upside down as an act of protest and had several statements pinned to it , including a picture of President Bush with the words “ Out Now ” upon it and one explaining the meaning of the upside down flag , a sign of distress .
The Kuhns , along with several neighbors and witnesses , assert that a sheriff ’s deputy violently invaded their home at 68 Brevard Road .
The sheriff ’s office claims that the couple assaulted deputy Brian Scarborough and resisted arrest .
According to the report from the sheriff ’s office , Scarborough arrived at the home at 8:45 a.m. in response to a complaint about the desecration of a flag .
Lt. Randy Sorrell says that while the address was in the city of Asheville , “ when we receive a complaint that the law is being broken , we have to respond . ”
Under a rarely enforced state statute , it is a misdemeanor to desecrate or trample a U.S. or North Carolina flag .
The Kuhns said the flag was taken as evidence , though the sheriff ’s department has no record of it .
After knocking on the door , the couple answered it and , after being shown the statute , said they complied and took the flag down .
Scarborough then asked for their identification .
“ The flag covered our whole front porch ; he comes up with this printout about the law and tells us that we ca n’t attach things to the flag , that we ’re desecrating it , ” Deborah Kuhn said .
“ We tell him we ’re not meaning to desecrate it — all we had was a picture of [ President ]
Bush with ‘ out now ’ on it and a note saying this was not a sign of distress or disrespect .
We did this because the country is in distress and we do n’t know what to do . ”
Then , she said , Scarborough “ started talking arrest , so we took the flag down .
He kept wanting to see our ID .
We refused .
We said , ‘ Why should we show you our ID — are you arresting us ? ’ ; so we walked back into the house and closed the door . ”
There , the accounts diverge .
According to Deborah Kuhn , Scarborough “ tried to force the door , but we got it closed and locked it with the deadbolt .
He then kicked it , punched the glass out , unlocked our door and came after us . ”
The sheriff ’s office report states that “ the man [ Mark Kuhn ] refused to identify himself and slammed the door on the officer ’s hand , breaking the glass pane out of the door and cutting the officer ’s hand . ”
However , the Kuhns ’ account is backed up by Jimmy Stevenson , who was working with Ace Hardwood Floors nearby and asserts that he saw Scarborough break down the door .
“ I saw that one cop [ Scarborough ] pull up and I saw those people come out on the porch and start talking to him , ” Stevenson said .
“ They took their flag down , asked the officer to leave and closed the door .
Then he started kicking the door , he kicked it about five or six good times , then he laid right into it .
After he got done kicking it , he broke the window out – I saw him hit the window . ”
Deborah Kuhn says that Scarborough then “ pursued my husband into the kitchen , they were scuffling , [ and ]
Mark was trying to get away from him .
He pulls out his billy club and I call 911 and say that an officer has broken into our house and is assaulting us . ”
Scarborough sustained a cut to his arm when the window broke and Mark Kuhn had several cuts on his face from the scuffle with Scarborough .
“ I was just trying to defend myself and back away from him , ” Kuhn said .
“ They never , ever told us why we were being arrested until we were in jail . ”
Deborah Kuhn asserted that no warrant was displayed or permission asked to enter the house .
After calling 911 , she says , she ran outside and began screaming for help .
Sam York , who lives nearby the couple , was awakened by the struggle , as the Kuhns and Scarborough both came out into the yard .
“ I woke up to Debbie screaming , ” he said .
“ Mark and Debbie were saying ‘ you assaulted us ’ and the officer [ Scarborough ] , was demanding their identification .
Then another officer threatened them with a taser .
He told Debbie to back away or he ’d taser her and demanded that Mark get on the ground . ”
Sorrell confirms this part of the account : “ When they were outside , one of the other officers produced a taser and he [ Mark Kuhn ] surrendered and submitted . ”
Deborah Kuhn ’s screams also drew the attention of Shawn Brady and several of his roommates , who live next door to the couple .
“ I run outside and ask them what ’s going on and there ’s cops chasing Mark around his car , ” Brady said .
“ They threaten to taser him and demand that he get on the ground .
He gets on the ground and we ask them what they ’re being charged with .
They tell us it ’s none of our concern .
I tell them they ’re our neighbors and it is our concern . ”
Neal Wilson , who lives with Brady , also saw the deputy produce the taser , he says .
After repeated questions , Brady and roommate Tony Plichta said that the deputies replied that “ they did n’t know yet ” what the couple would be charged with .
“ This is an outrage , ” Brady said .
“ The 1st , 4th and 5th Amendments were clearly broken today . ”
Plichta expressed similar anger .
“ They actually wanted to know why we cared — these are our neighbors , ” he said .
Following the arrest , the Kuhns were taken to the Buncombe County Detention Facility , where they were charged with two counts of assaulting a government official , and one count each of resisting arrest and desecrating an American flag .
Their son posted their bail shortly afterwards .
This was not the first time that the flag had attracted attention .
On July 18 , with just the upside - down flag hanging , an Asheville police officer stopped by to inquire about the situation .
“ He was very polite and just said that because it was a sign of distress , he wanted to make sure everything was OK , ” Deborah Kuhn said .
“ We said we had it out as a show of desperation — our country is in distress and we just do n’t know what to do .
We asked if we had violated any ordinance .
He said , ‘ No , you have every right . ’ ”
After that , Deborah Kuhn said that she posted up the picture of Bush and the explanation of their reasons for displaying the flag in protest .
A couple of days later , Mark Kuhn said that a man in military fatigues came to their door , and was driving a car with a federal license plate .
“ He stood here telling me that I needed to take the flag down or fly it right , ” he said .
Kuhn adds that he assumed the man was with the National Guard , due to the nearby armory .
Wilson , Plichta and Brady said that after the man stopped by , they also saw him drive by several times during the following days , and one night , witnessed several other men in fatigues taking pictures of the flag .
Furthermore , Wilson said that as the Kuhns were being arrested and taken off , he saw a man in fatigues drive by and shout “ Go to jail , baby ! ”
After his experience , Mark Kuhn said he is convinced this is not an isolated occurrence .
“ If Americans do n’t wake up to the martial state we ’re in , the cops , the police , the sheriffs , the state police will all come to our door and take us away if we allow this to happen – it ’s time for America to wake up . ”

This is one of the most gorgeous implementations of matchbooks i’ve seen in some time .
Interactions from shaking the match out ( reminiscent of some of those toothpick dispensers ) , the satisfaction of pulling it out and having it light , being able to see all the matches inside yet untouchable …
Column
The use of “ lambda ” originates from functional programming and lambda calculus , where a lambda abstraction defines an unnamed function .
Lambda functions or Lambdas in C++ are one of the more interesting things to look forward to in the next C++ standard ; giving us the ability to treat functions as first class objects at last ; composing them inline and treating them as class objects .
Up until now we 've scraped by with pointers to functions , and various libraries like Boost Lambda , both of which approaches suck .
The syntax for declaring function pointers can get so cryptic that at a large percentage of C++ interviews , it 's used to filter out the weak applicants .
Boost et al .
do a good job given the limits of the language ; but again if you try anything more ambitious than a simple predicate then debugging can get very painful .
They offer , as Valentin Samko says with heavy irony in his proposal here , the opportunity to learn " numerous highly non-trivial programming techniques " .
All by themselves they beat the amateur efforts in the International Obfuscated C contest .
However , it would be nice to be able to write something like this ( where the code is passed just as if were any other type of variable ) :
void KillByVal( const int x , std::vector<int> & Vec ) { std::remove_if(v.begin( ) , v.end( ) , bool ( int& n ) { n == x ; } } ;
The first thing to notice is that the predicate we supply can see the parameter x directly .
Lambdas will naturally have the scope of the enclosing function , and since they are n't full classes will include the local this pointer without clashing .
This style of coding is giving a big hint to the compiler for inline optimisations .
Before I get letters of complaint , yes I know you can do some of this with # define , but if you know how to do this , you also know why it 's such a tragically bad idea .
Loopless code
Explicit loops are not just sources of the " out by one " family of bugs , but also are often less efficient than the STL algorithms , a fact that is , surprisingly , still unknown to a good percentage of programmers .
I adhere to the notion that the closer the mapping between intent and implementation , the better the code .
You may not agree ; if so , that 's presumably why you 're still using MFC .
However , to many people it is more intuitive to " apply " code to a set of data , saying in effect " do this action to it " , rather than to explicitly iterate though each value .
This is not only because it feels more elegant , but also because if you do n't specify a deterministic sequence , a smart compiler with access to multiple CPU cores or hardware assist ( as in GPUs , PPU or SIMD architectures ) can generate much better code .
Even my laptop now has twin cores ( if yours does n't , I win ) – and by the time this stuff hits your compiler , multiple CPUs will be very common .
STL already makes use of function objects for a variety of For_Each replacements for the classic C style loop .
Another way in which functors and function pointers are weak is in not meshing with the scope of the code you 're writing .
Since they are in a separate context , they simply cannot know about variables local to their invocation unless you 're dumb enough to use globals to communicate with them .
Lambdas will enjoy access just as if they were a block within the scope of a function body ; and that includes access to this when it's a class member ; but since a lambda is n't quite a class it has no this pointer to clash with it .
Nevertheless , being an object , a Lambda 's lifetime is n't bounded to the function in which it is created , and so , even before compilers support this feature , we have a new variant on an old type of bug .
Just like pointers to local objects , Lambdas may reference variables and continue to do so after it is no longer safe ; and , before you ask , even the smartest compiler can't catch all cases .
There is now a serious debate on how variables get into the Lambda : should they be copied or referenced ?
References are more dangerous , but , in many cases , vastly more efficient than copies for larger objects ; but the copies are vastly easier to multi thread .
Lambdas will be declared with much the same syntax as you 'd expect for a function , taking forms like :
Return_Type Name ( Type1 P1 , . TypeN PN ) ; <> ( Type1 P1 , Type2 P2 , ... )
For example :
<> ( auto x , auto& y ) { y += x ; } is equivalent to template < class T1 , class T2 > void ( T1 x , T2& y ) { y += x ; }
And a return type is only necessary if it cannot be deduced ( normally , it 's prefixed by -> ) .
This means that the compiler can immediately recognise that it ’s not an older style function , which should make error messages more comprehensible .
We currently use function names to reference the address of piece of code when creating thread procs or callbacks , again making encapsulation more clunky .
Most O/S level thread and callback APIs do n't really handle the passing of parameters to their functions well , mostly because of irritating stack issues ; and also because , in their heart of hearts , both Windows and UNIX are really still C APIs .
As a side effect of this , Lambda objects also refer to a specific context of execution ; so two Lambda objects created by the same or identical code may refer to two different contexts of execution , and therefore different sets of local variables :
APICreateThread ( tr1::function < void( int ) >)
CFeed : : FireThread ( int ct ) { APICreateThread ( void ( int i ) : ( Repeat ( ct ) ) { for ( int i=0 ; i!=ct ; ++) DoStuff ( ) ; } ) ; }
Old function pointers may point anywhere , with zero often being used to mean “ uninitialised ” — and of course that means every so often you end up jumping to zero and dying horribly .
Lambdas , on the other hand , are more like references than pointers in that they must point to some block of code ; and not being pointers stops people coding atrocities like address arithmetic before calls .
You cannot do address arithmetic on function pointers unless you reinterpret_cast them , but then you get what you deserve .
Lambdas look likely to be in C ++
Ox , but work is still under way , and the committee is planning to review refined versions relatively soon .
And , just to refer back to my provious C++ divided by CLI article , the committee has rejected Microsoft ’s proposal .
I really ca n’t decide whether that ’s good or bad , so I 'll just end here , I think .
CURIOUS PROPERTIES OF 153
References about number 153 can be found in the New Testament , where in the net Simon Peter drew from the Sea of Tiberias held 153 fishes .
Some of the interesting properties of number 153 published in [ 1 ] are :
Curious properties of number 153 :
It is the smallest number which can be expressed as the sum of cubes of its digits :
153 = 13 + 53 + 33
It is equal to the sum of factorials of number from 1 to 5 :
153 = 1 ! + 2 ! + 3 ! + 4 ! + 5 !
The sum of digits of 153 is a perfect square :
1 + 5 + 3 = 9 = 32
The sum of aliquot divisors of 153 is also a perfect square :
1 + 3 + 9 + 17 + 51 = 81 = 92
Aliquot divisors of a number are all the divisors of that number excluding the number itself but including 1 .
It is seen that the sum of aliquot divisors of 153 is the square of the sum of the digits of 153 .
On adding the number 153 to its reverse , 504 is obtained , whose square is the smallest square which can be expressed as the product of two different non-square numbers which are reverse of one another :
1 5 3 + 3 5 1 = 504
504 2 = 2 88 x 88 2
It can be expressed as the sum of all integers from 1 to 17 .
In other words , 153 is the 17th triangular number .
Since reverse of 153 , i.e. 351 is also a triangular number , 153 can be termed as a reversible triangular number .
Number 153 is also a Harshad number ( also called Niven number ) , i.e. it is divisible by the sum of its own digits :
1 5 3 / ( 1 + 5 + 3 ) = 17
Since reverse of 153 , i.e. 351 is also a Harshad number ( or Niven Number ) , 153 can be termed as a reversible Harshad number ( or reversible Niven Number ) .
It can be expressed as the product of two numbers formed from its own digits :
1 5 3 = 3 * 5 1
Note that the digits used in multipliers are same as in product .
The number 135 , which is formed by rearranging the digits of 153 , can be expressed as :
1 3 5 = 1 1 + 3 2 + 5 3
The sum of all divisors of 153 is 234 .
1 + 3 + 9 + 17 + 51 + 153 = 234
The product of aliquot divisors of 153 is 23409 :
1 * 3 * 9 * 17 * 51 = 234 09
Note that the product of aliquot divisors of 153 contain the sum of all divisors of 153 juxtaposed :
234 09 = 234 : 09
234 = Sum of all divisors of 153
09 = Square root of the sum of aliquot divisors of 153 .
When the cubes of the digits of any number , that is , a multiple of 3 are added , and then this process is repeated , the final result is 153 , where the process ends because 153 = 13 + 53 + 33
For example : Take the number 108
13 + 03 + 83 = 513 and 53 + 13 + 33 = 153
So , the number 108 reaches 153 in two cycles and it can be represented as
108 → 513 → 153
A detailed study of all numbers up to 105 reveals that all numbers which are multiple of 3 and are less than 105 reach 153 ( after the repeated process of summing the cubes of digits is done ) in maximum 14 cycles .
However , maximum 13 cycles is required for all numbers , which are multiple of 3 and are less than 10,000 .
The smallest number , which requires 13 cycles to reach 153 , is 177 , i.e. ,
177 → 687 → 1071 → 345 → 216 → 225 → 141 → 66 → 432 → 99 → 1458 → 702 → 351 → 153
Table 1 indicates the smallest numbers , which reach 153 in cycles from 1 to 14 .

It may be noted that the smallest number to reach 153 in 15 cycles will be more than 10 19 .

Solid - state hard drives , or SSDs , have finally emerged this year as viable , though expensive , products .
The great benefit of SSDs is the fact that they are rather akin to giant blocks of ram — sturdy thanks to the fact they have no moving parts , power efficient because there 's no motor needed to spin drive platters , and very fast since there 's no issue of the drive spinning up to top speed and seeking for various bits of data .
Alienware is apparently the first of the gaming PC makers to begin adding the drives to gaming laptops as it today announced the availability of both single and RAID 0 options for owners building mobile powerhouses .
The Area -51 m9750 , Aurora m9700 , and Area - 51 m5550 notebooks will each be available with SSD options .
Only the m9750 and m9700 will have the option of a 64 - GB dual drive RAID 0 array .
These models will also be available with a 32 - GB SSD and a 200 - GB traditional HDD .
Lucky owners of these new SSD based gaming notebooks will likely get some big performance gains in load times and battery life .
The upgrade wo n't come cheap however , as a single 32 - GB SSD drive adds $ 500 to the cost of an Alienware notebook , and the 64 - GB RAID 0 arrangement $ 920 .
Straight From The Shoulder of Michael Shelby
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
And he ’s welcome to it .
When Rep. Dennis Kucinich answered the question asked on this mornings ABC Democratic candidate debate from Iowa , moderated by George Stephanopoulos , for an example from each candidate of one time they did not tell the whole truth on an issue – Rep.
Kucinich said he would give the truth to the American people “ straight from the shoulder . ”
“ Straight From The Shoulder ” is the tag line my grandfather , Ward Shelby , used in the 1930 ’s for his comment column as owner and publisher of Progressive Arizona and the Great Southwest , a travel magazine that is considered the forerunner to today ’s Arizona Highways magazine .
I ’ve taken this tag line for my self to honor my grandfathers commitment to the truth .
It ’s fun for me to think that one of Dennis ’ staffers passed up one of my articles on him and he “ stole ” the line .
This morning ’s ABC / Iowa Democratic Candidate debate once again weighted its questions and attentions on the front runners disproportionately and unfairly .
Rep. Kucinich was last to be addressed and was shut out for fully 30 minutes into the debate .
As usual , however , of Rep. Kucinich maximized his six speaking opportunities , adding to just over four minutes in the 90 minute “ debate ” , to deliver the most presidential , cogent , content driven , affirmative answers of all the candidates .
Rep. Kucinich displayed his “ firstest with the mostest ” leadership on the issues of defunding the Iraq war and a strategy for withdrawal , single payer universal healthcare , education , the economy , and eschewing money from PAC ’s and lobbyists .
Of all the candidates , Rep. Kucinich is the only candidate who has introduced legislation – H.R. 676 – that removes the insurance companies from adding over 30 % to healthcare costs from bureaucracy and unconscionable profit taking while denying coverage for almost 50 million Americans .
Every other democratic candidate maintains a role for insurance companies and their non-value added profit taking in the delivery and managing of our healthcare system .
Medicare and the Veterans Administration provides healthcare at overhead costs of less than 3 % .
Why are we allowing the current healthcare delivery system that gouges the American people for an unnecessary 27 % add - on cost to continue !?!
Why not use that excess profit feeding the insurance CEO ’s , some making over $ 1 Billion in compensation , to provide training and reemployment for the insurance company employees that will need refocusing when insurance companies are removed from the healthcare system .
The continued savings can then be reinvested to continuously improve the healthcare system .
Rep .
Kucinich once again delivered the best line of the debates when he was called on to answer the question of whether or not the candidates believe that prayer could stop wars and hurricanes ( I wo n’t even comment as to how inane and ridiculous such a question is .
To their credit , however , the candidates got it ! ) .
When called , Dennis said , “ George I ’ve been standing here for 45 minutes praying to God you were going to call on me . . . ” and looked to the heavens as he enjoyed the sheepish “ ya ’ got me ” smiles for his answer from Stephanopoulos and the almost full minute of laughter from the audience .
Kucinich ’s substantive answer clearly transcended the fluffy answers of the other candidates as he differentiated between biblical dogma and spirituality .
Deftly using appropriate biblical quotes , chapter and verse , Rep. Kucinich argued the founding fathers made clear that there must be a separation of church and state but they never excluded spiritual values , “ the values of peace , social and economic justice , and that remember where I came from ” , as a necessary part of good governance .
Finally , amid the few substantive answers to the final question of the debate , “ What ’s the decisive moment in your life ? ” it was Dennis Kucinich who answered – amid the pandering to certain interest groups or when I went from high school to college or I met my wife or when I joined the Peace Corps or my mom – with the most enlightening opening into the motivation of Dennis Kucinich as a candidate and human being .
U. S. Congressman Kucinich said , “ The most decisive moment in my life came when I was living in a car in the inner city and I thought about all the dreams I could have as a child and I decided at an early age that I was gonna be someone .
And , I ’ve had a lot of help along the way to get to this stage .
But I can tell you , as President , the American people would have someone who remembers where he came from and has the compassion in his heart to lift up everyone to make sure everyone has a chance , thank you . ”
If you had no other reason to vote for Dennis Kucinich for President of the United States , just meditate on that singular , human , compassionate , hope - filled , and uplifting answer for a while .
None of the republican crop of pygmy candidates could have the slightest appreciation or understanding of Kucinich ’s answer .
Most of the democratic candidates grew up privileged beyond working class America and none ever experienced homelessness in their lives .
Dennis Kucinich lived through degrading and soul - destroying mean financial circumstances to emerge not as a Social Darwinist with a “ pull yourself up by your own bootstraps ” self - centered mentality personified by republicans – instead he transcended his circumstance , appreciated those who helped him along the way , and evolved to a higher level of compassion expressed through public service .
Let ’s look to see if any of the candidates rise to Dennis Kucinich ’s level of intelligence , intuition , insight , compassion , and humanity .
Look to see if anyone rises to the level of honesty and transparency that Dennis Kucinich personifies when he answers the American people , “ Straight from the Shoulder . ”

Paul Krugman looks at who has sacrificed for the Iraq war :
Sacrifice Is for Suckers , by Paul Krugman , Commentary , NY Times : On this Fourth of July , President Bush ... called for “ more patience , more courage and more sacrifice . ”
Unfortunately , ... nobody asked the obvious question : “ What sacrifices have you and your friends made , Mr. President ? ” ...
You see , the Iraq war , although Mr. Bush insists that it ’s part of a Global War on Terror™ , a fight to the death between good and evil , is n’t like America ’s other great wars — wars in which the wealthy shared the financial burden through higher taxes and many members of the elite fought for their country .
This time around , Mr. Bush celebrated Mission Accomplished by cutting tax rates on dividends and capital gains , while handing out huge no -bid contracts to politically connected corporations .
And in the four years since , as the insurgency Mr. Bush initially taunted with the cry of “ Bring them on ” has claimed the lives of thousands of Americans and left thousands more grievously wounded , the children of the elite — especially the Republican elite — have been conspicuously absent from the battlefield .
The Bushies , it seems , like starting fights , but they do n’t believe in paying any of the cost ...
Above all , they do n’t believe that they or their friends should face any ... penalties for trivial sins like distorting intelligence to get America into an unnecessary war , or totally botching that war ’s execution ...
Think Progress has a summary of what happened to the men behind the war ...
To read that summary is to be awed by the ... generosity of the neocon welfare system .
Even Paul Wolfowitz , who ... mess[ed ] up ... two high - level jobs , has found refuge at the American Enterprise Institute .
Which brings us to ... I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby Jr. ...
In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal titled “ Fallen Soldier , ” Fouad Ajami of Johns Hopkins University cited the soldier ’s creed : “ I will never leave a fallen comrade . ”
He went on to declare that “ Scooter Libby was a soldier in your — our — war in Iraq . ”
Ah , yes .
Shuffling papers in an air - conditioned Washington office is exactly like putting your life on the line in Anbar or Baghdad .
Spending 30 months in a minimum - security prison , with a comfortable think - tank job waiting at the other end , is exactly like having half your face or both your legs blown off by an I.E.D .
What lay behind the hysteria , of course , was the prospect that ... one of the people who tricked America into war , then endangered national security yet again in the effort to cover their tracks , might pay some price ...
Back when the investigation into the leak of Valerie Plame Wilson ’s identity began , Mr. Bush insisted that if anyone in his administration had violated the law , “ that person will be taken care of . ”
Now we know what he meant .
...
Mr. Bush says that Mr. Libby ’s punishment remains “ harsh ” because his reputation is “ forever damaged . ”
Meanwhile , Mr. Bush employs , as a deputy national security adviser , none other than Elliott Abrams , who pleaded guilty to unlawfully withholding information from Congress in the Iran - contra affair .
Mr. Abrams was one of six Iran - contra defendants pardoned by Mr. Bush ’s father , who was himself a subject of the special prosecutor ’s investigation of the scandal .
In other words , obstruction of justice when it gets too close to home is a family tradition .
And being a loyal Bushie means never having to say you ’re sorry .
The Culture of Fear
Noam Chomsky
In Javier Giraldo , Colombia : The Genocidal Democracy , Common Courage Press , July , 1996
North American readers of Father Giraldo ’s documentation of the reign of terror that engulfed Colombia during the “ Dirty War ” waged by the state security forces and their paramilitary associates from the early 1980s .
The first is that Colombia ’s “ democra - tatorship , ” as Eduardo Galeano termed this amalgam of democratic forms and totalitarian terror , has managed to compile the worst human rights record in the hemisphere in recent years , no small achievement when one considers the competition .
The second is that Colombia has had accessories in crime , primary among them the government of the United States , though Britain , Israel , Germany , and others have also helped to train and arm the assassins and torturers of the narco - military - landowner network that maintains “ stability ” in a country that is rich in promise , and a nightmare for many of its people .
In July 1989 , the U.S. State Department announced plans for subsidized sales of military equipment to Colombia , allegedly “ for antinarcotics purposes . ”
The sales were “ justified ” by the fact that “ Colombia has a democratic form of government and does not exhibit a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights . ”
A few months before , the Commission of Justice and Peace that Father Giraldo heads had published a report documenting atrocities in the first part of 1988 , including over 3,000 politically - motivated killings , 273 in “ social cleansing ” campaigns .
Political killings averaged eight a day , with seven people murdered in their homes or in the street and one “ disappeared . ”
Citing this report , the Washington Office on Latin America ( WOLA ) added that “ the vast majority of those who have disappeared in recent years are grass - roots organizers , peasant or union leaders , leftist politicians , human rights workers and other activists , ” over 1500 by the time of the State Department ’s praise for Colombia ’s democracy and its respect for human rights .
During the 1988 electoral campaigns , 19 of 87 mayoral candidates of the sole independent political party , the UP , were assassinated , along with over 100 of its other candidates .
The Central Organization of Workers , a coalition of trade unions formed in 1986 , had by then lost over 230 members , most of them found dead after brutal torture .
But the “ democratic form of government ” emerged without stain , and with no “ consistent pattern of gross violations ” of human rights .
By the time of the State Department ’s report , the practices it found praiseworthy were being more efficiently implemented .
Political killings in 1988 and 1989 rose to 11 a day , the Colombian branch of the Andean Commission of Jurists reported .
From 1988 through early 1992 , 9,500 people were assassinated for political reasons along with 830 disappearances and 313 massacres ( between 1988 and 1990 ) of peasants and poor people .
Throughout these years , as usual , the primary victims of state terror were peasants .
In 1988 , grassroots organizations in one southern department reported a “ campaign of total annihilation and scorched earth , Vietnam - style , ” conducted by the military forces “ in a most criminal manner , with assassinations of men , women , elderly and children .
Homes and crops are burned , obligating the peasants to leave their lands . ”
Also in 1988 the government of Colombia established a new judicial regime that called for “ total war against the internal enemy . ”
It authorized “ maximal criminalization of the political and social opposition , ” a European - Latin American Inquiry reported in Brussels , reviewing “ the consolidation of state terror in Colombia . ”
As the State Department report appeared a year after these events , the Colombian Minister of Defense again articulated the doctrine of “ total war ” by state power “ in the political , economic , and social arenas . ”
Guerrillas were the official targets , but as a high military official had observed in 1987 , their organizations were of minor importance : “ the real danger , ” he explained , is “ what the insurgents have called the political and psychological war , ” the efforts “ to control the popular elements ” and “ to manipulate the masses . ”
The “ subversives ” hope to influence unions , universities , media , and so on , and the government must counter this “ war ” with its own “ total war in the political , economic , and social arenas . ”
Reviewing doctrine and practice , the Brussels study concludes realistically that the “ internal enemy ” of the state terrorist apparatus extends to “ labor organizations , popular movements , indigenous organizations , oppositional political parties , peasant movements , intellectual sectors , religious currents , youth and student groups , neighborhood organizations , ” indeed any group that must be secured against undesirable influences .
“ Every individual who in one or another manner supports the goals of the enemy must be considered a traitor and treated in that manner , ” a Colombian military manual prescribes .
The manual dates from 1963 .
At that time , violence in Colombia was coming to be “ exacerbated by external factors , ” the president of the Colombian Permanent Committee for Human Rights , former Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfredo Vasquez Carrizosa , wrote some years later , reviewing the outcome .
“ During the Kennedy administration , ” he continues , Washington “ took great pains to transform our regular armies into counterinsurgency brigades , accepting the new strategy of the death squads . ”
These initiatives “ ushered in what is known in Latin America as the National Security Doctrine , . . . not defense against an external enemy , but a way to make the military establishment the masters of the game . . . [ with ] the right to combat the internal enemy , as set forth in the Brazilian doctrine , and the Colombian doctrine : it is the right to fight and to exterminate social workers , trade unionists , men and women who are not supportive of the establishment , and who are assumed to be communist extremists . ”
The “ Dirty War ” escalated in the early 1980s — not only in Colombia — as the Reagan administration extended these programs throughout the region , leaving it devastated , strewn with hundreds of thousands of corpses tortured and mutilated people who might otherwise have been insufficiently supportive of the establishment , perhaps even influenced by “ subversives . ”
North Americans should never allow themselves to forget the origins of “ the Brazilian doctrine , the Argentine doctrine , the Uruguayan doctrine , the Colombian doctrine , ” and others like them .
They were crafted right , then adapted by students trained and equipped right here .
The basic guidelines are spelled out in U.S. manuals of counterinsurgency and “ low intensity conflict . ”
These are euphemisms , technical terms for state terror , a fact well known in Latin America .
When Archbishop Oscar Romero wrote to President Carter in 1980 shortly before his assassination , vainly pleading with him to end U.S. support for the state terrorist , he informed the rector of the Jesuit University , Father Ellacuria , that he was prompted “ by the new concept of special warfare , which consists in murderously eliminating every endeavor of the popular organizations under the allegation of Communism or terrorism . . . ”
So Father Ellacuria reported shortly before he was assassinated by the same hands a decade later ; the events framed the murderous decade with the symbolism as gruesome as it was appropriate .
The agents of state terror are the beneficiaries of U.S. training designed to ensure that they have an “ understanding of , and orientation toward , U.S. objectives , ” Defense Secretary Robert McNamera informed National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy in 1965 .
This is a matter of particular importance “ in the Latin American cultural environment , ” where it is recognized that the military must be prepared to “ remove government leaders from office , whenever , in the judgment of the military , the conduct of these leaders is injurious to the welfare of the nation . ”
It is the right of the military and those who provide them with the proper orientation who are entitled to determine the welfare of the nation , not the beasts of burden toiling and suffering and expiring in their own lands .
When the State Department announced new arms shipments as a reward for Colombia ’s achievements in human rights and democracy , it surely had access to the record of atrocities that had been compiled by the leading international and Colombian human rights organizations .
It was fully aware of the U.S. role in establishing and maintaining the regime of terror and oppression .
The example is , unfortunately , typical of a pattern that hardly varies , as can be readily verified .
As the “ Dirty War ” of the 1980s took its ever more grisly toll , U.S. participation increased .
From 1984 through 1992 , 6,844 Colombian soldiers were trained under the U.S. international Military Education and Training Program .
Over 2,000 Colombian officers were trained from 1990 to 1992 , as “ violence reached unprecedented levels ” during the presidency of Cesar Gaviria , WOLA reported , confirming conclusions of international human rights monitors .
President Gaviria was a particular favorite of Washington , so admired that the Clinton administration imposed him as Secretary - General of the Organization of American States in a power play that aroused much resentment .
“ He has been very forward looking in building democratic institutions in a country where it was sometimes dangerous to do so , ” the U.S. representative to the OAS explained — not inquiring into the reasons for the “ dangers , ” however .
The training program for Colombian officers is the largest in the hemisphere , and U.S. military aid to Colombia now amounts to about half the total for the entire hemisphere .
It has increased under Clinton , Human Rights Watch reports , adding that he planned to turn emergency overdrawing facilities when the Pentagon did not suffice for still further increases .
The official cover story for the participation in crime is the war “ against the guerrillas and narcotrafficking operations . ”
In its 1989 announcement of new arms sales , the State Department could rely on its human right reports , which attributed virtually all violence to the guerrillas and narcotraffickers .
Hence the U.S. is “ justified ” in providing military equipment and training for the mass murderers and torturers .
A month later , George Bush announced the largest shipment of arms ever authorized under the emergency provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act .
The arms were not sent to the National Police , which is responsible for almost all counter - narcotic operations , but to the army .
The helicopters and jet planes are useless for the drug war , as was pointed out at once , but not for other purposes .
Human rights groups soon reported the bombing of villages and other atrocities .
It is also impossible to imagine that Washington is not aware that the security forces it is maintaining are closely linked to the narcotrafficking operations , and that exactly as their leaders frankly say , the target is the “ internal enemy ” that might support or be influenced by “ subversives ” in some way .
A January 1994 conference on state terror organized by Jesuits in San Salvador observed that “ it is important to explore . . . what weight the culture of terror has had in domesticating the expectations of the majority vis-a - vis alternatives different to those of the powerful . ”
That is the crucial point , wherever such methods are used to subdue the “ internal enemy . ”
Israeli physician Ruchama Marton , who has been at the forefront of investigation of the use of torture by the security forces of her own country , points out that while confessions obtained by torture are of course meaningless , the real purpose is not confession .
Rather , it is silence , “ silence induced by fear . ”
“ Fear is contagious , ” she continues , “ and spreads to the other members of the oppressed group , to silence and paralyze them .
To impose silence through violence is torture ’s real purpose , in the most profound an fundamental sense . ”
The same is true of all other aspects of the doctrines that have been devised and implemented with our guidance and support under a series of fraudulent guides .
To impose silence on the internal enemy is necessary in the “ democra- tatorships ” that U.S. policy has sought to impose on its domains ever since it “ assumed , out of self - interest , responsibility for the welfare of the world capitalist system , ” in the words of diplomatic Gerald Haines , senior historian of the CIA , discussing the U.S. takeover of Brazil in 1945 — and indeed before , with important echoes at home as well .
It is particularly important to impose silence in the region with the highest inequality in the world , thanks in no small measure to policies of the superpower that largely controls it .
It is necessary to impose silence and spread fear in countries like Colombia , where the top three percent of the landed elite own over 70 % of arable land while 57 % of the poorest farmers subsist on under 3 % — a country where 40 % of the population live in “ absolute poverty , ” unable to satisfy basic subsistence needs according to an official government report in 1986 , and 18 % live in “ absolute misery , ” unable to meet nutritional needs .
The Colombian Institute of Family Welfare estimates that four and a half million children under 14 are hungry , half the country ’s children .
Recall that we are speaking of a country of enormous resources and potential .
It has “ one of the healthiest and most flourishing economies in Latin America , ” Latin Americanist John Martz writes in Current History , lauding this triumph of capitalism in a society with “ democratic structures ” which , “ notwithstanding inevitable flaws , are among the most solid on the continent , ” a model of “ well - established political stability ” — conclusions that are not inaccurate , if not quite in the sense he seeks to convey
The effects of U.S. arms and military training are not confined to Colombia .
The record of horrors is all too full .
In the Jesuit journal America , Rev. Daniel Santiago , a priest working in El Salvador , reported in 1990 the story of a peasant woman who returned home one day to find her mother , sister , and three children sitting around a table , the decapitated head of each person placed on the table in front of the body , the hands arranged on top “ as if each body was stroking its own head . ”
The assassins , from the Salvadoran National Guard , had found it hard to keep the head of an 18 - month - old baby in place , so they nailed the hands to it .
A large plastic bowl filled with blood stood in the center of the table .
Two years earlier , the Salvadoran human rights group that continued to function despite the assassination of its founders and directors reported that 13 bodies had been found in the preceding two weeks , most showing signs of torture , including two women who had been hanged from a tree by their hair , their breasts cut off and their faces painted red .
The discoveries were familiar , but the timing is significant , just as Washington was successfully completing the cynical exercise of exempting its murderous clients from the terms of the Central America peace accords that called for “ justice , freedom and democracy , ” “ respect for human rights , ” and guarantees for “ the endless inviolability of all forms of life and liberty . ”
The record is endless , and endlessly shocking .
Such macabre scenes , which rarely reached the mainstream in the United States , are designed for intimidation .
Father Santiago writes that “ People are not just killed by death squads in El Salvador — they are decapitated and then their heads are placed on pikes and used to dot the landscape .
Men are not just disemboweled by Salvadoran Treasury Police ; their severed genitalia are stuffed in their mouths .
Salvadoran women are not just raped by the national guard ; their wombs are cut from their bodies and used to cover their faces .
It is not enough to kill children ; they are dragged over barbed wire until the flesh falls from their bones while parents are forced to watch . ”
“ The aesthetics of terror in El Salvador is religious . ”
The intention is to ensure that the individual is totally subordinated to the interests of the Fatherland , which is why death squads are sometimes called the “ Army of National Salvation ” by the governing ARENA party .
The same is true in neighboring Guatemala .
In the traditional “ culture of fear , ” Latin American scholar Piero Gleijeses writes , peace and order were guaranteed by ferocious repression , and its contemporary counterpart follows the same course : “ Just as the Indian was branded a savage beast to justify his exploitation , so those who have sought social guerrillas , or terrorists , or drug dealers , or whatever the current term of art may be . ”
The fundamental reason , however , is always the same : the savage beast may fall under the influence of “ subversives ” who challenge the regime of injustice , oppression and terror that must continue to serve the interests of foreign investors and domestic privilege .
Throughout these grim years , nothing has been more inspiring than the courage and dedication of those who have sought to expose and overcome the culture of fear in their suffering countries .
They have left martyrs , whose voices have been silenced by the powerful — yet another crime .
But they continue to struggle on .
Father Giraldo ’s remarkable work and eloquent words should not only inspire us , but also impel us to act to bring these terrors to an end , as we can .
His testimony here contains an “ urgent appeal . ”
It should be answered , but it does not go far enough .
Our responsibilities extend well beyond .
The fate of Colombians and many others hinges on our willingness and ability to recognize and meet them .
Massacre of the Unicorns
The real problem of a critique of our own cultural models is to ask , when we see a unicorn , if by any chance it is not a rhinoceros . [ i ]
It ’s a convenient fiction that the difficulties with psychiatric diagnosis and treatment are due to incomplete knowledge - if we just knew more about dopamine !— but the real source of the failings is inherent in its structure .
Psychiatry fails because it is designed to fail .
Semiotics and Psychiatry
The problem is with the signs of psychiatry .
Signs are vehicles for conveying information .
For example , the term “ antidepressant ” is a sign conveying the idea of a “ drug which treats depression . ”
While tricyclics and SSRIs are both called “ antidepressants ” because they treat depression , the term otherwise carries no necessary value except that .
Signs can be misused if they are expanded to take on new meaning in an inconsistent fashion .
Consider the controversy over “ antidepressant induced mania . ”
Tricyclics have been shown to be associated with higher manic rates , but SSRIs have n’t .
So does that mean that most textbooks and articles are wrong — that antidepessants do n’t cause mania ?
Actually , the problem is worse than that .
It ’s not that antidepressants do n’t cause mania — it is that there cannot be any such notion as antidepressant induced mania .
Hydrochlorothiazide ( a diuretic ) and propanolol ( a beta blocker ) are both “ antihypertensives , ” but otherwise are very different drugs with very different side effects ; only one makes you pee .
There ’s no such thing as “ antihypertensive induced peeing . ”
But this error is itself based on an earlier semiotic error , with the sign of “ bipolar disorder , ” and its implicit idea of two opposing poles .
Depakote will cure and prevent mania ; and Zoloft will cure and prevent depression .
The treatment of one pole should surely move the patient closer to the next pole ; hence , psychiatrists talk about “ antidepressant induced mania ” but “ Depakote breakthrough mania . ”
See the difference ?
No ?
That ’s because , in reality , there is no difference in the two manias , and absolutely no reason one should believe one is “ induced ” and the other “ breakthrough , ” except that the problem has arbitrarily been defined in this manner , i.e. a ) mood stabilizers are a priori preventative , and b ) Depakote is a mood stabilizer .
But a ) is a postulate and b ) is an optimistic assumption .
A similar example is the often cited myth that diagnosis of bipolar disorder is frequently missed .
A survey [ ii ] found that 69 % of patients were actually misdiagnosed , most often as having regular depression .
An average of 4 physicians were consulted “ prior to receiving the correct diagnosis . ”
But who is to say what is the correct diagnosis , when the diagnosis is based on vague and overlapping descriptions ( and not on objective pathology ? )
You can look at this the other way , and say only 1 out of 5 psychiatrists felt it was bipolar disorder , while the other 80 % thought it was depression .
So it pays to have the last word .
Bipolar disorder is “ frequently missed ” not because it exists and doctors miss it , but because it is defined in a way which allows it , by 80 % of doctors , to be legitimately called something else .
The only way to say the diagnosis was correct or incorrect , in the absence of objective pathology , is to say that the treatment they received for “ bipolar disorder ” from the fifth doctor was better ( read : safer or more efficacious ) than the treatment they received from the first four .
This is not evident .
Marco Polo's Dilemma
The problem in psychiatry is the problem in the epigraph at the beginning of the paper .
When Marco Polo saw the exotic one horned quadruped , his frame of reference required that it could be none other than a unicorn , even though it did not conform exactly to his prior conception of it .
Marco Polo made his observation fit his existing paradigm of zoology .
While superficially ( and in retrospect ) this may seem silly and arbitrary , it is in fact the opposite , Marco Polo believed the only thing he could believe — because the alternative was to believe he had discovered an entirely new , unheard of , creature .
This is the semiotic problem in psychiatry , wherein we are forced to interpret clinical signs with our available “ encyclopedia , ” because we lack both the newer encyclopedia , and its accompanying language , to interpret the signs differently .
But here ’s the extra credit question : is it really a rhinoceros or a unicorn ?
Psychiatry is trying to move away from a symptom based field to a disease ( or at least disorder ) based science .
We are deciding ( note word choice ) that a psychiatric disease exists a priori , and can present with different symptoms , the way cancer could present as the flu , but really is cancer .
The diagnosis ( or sign ) becomes more important than the individual symptoms , because it demands a specific treatment .
But if the paradigm is faulty , what of the treatment ?
An example is the association of bipolar disorder with mood stabilizer .
Through a series of laughable twists , psychiatrists came to believe that antiepileptics had special properties in bipolar because they could quell the chaos in the brain in the same way that they calmed seizure activity there .
It is now common practice , as defined in numerous “ Expert ” guidelines and consensuses , that patients with bipolar disorder need to be on a mood stabilizer , specifically lithium or the antiepileptic Depakote .
The problem with this is that there has never been a study that found that Depakote is a mood stabilizer .
In fact , there is no evidence that any antiepileptics are mood stabilizers .
What few studies have been done show no benefit over placebo for this purpose .
Remarkably , very few psychiatrists know this .
But worse , even when you show them data , they refuse to accept it .
I know , it seems — well , crazy — that psychiatrists would blatantly ignore the absence of data — the opposite of data .
Ask your psychiatrist the following question : A patient with a history of bipolar disorder presents depressed .
There are only two medications available : Prozac or a new antiepileptic for which no efficacy or safety data yet exist .
Which do you use ?
That the mystery antiepileptic is even considered shows the power of the association , because I have n’t actually told you anything about the antiepileptic .
Nothing about efficacy , safety , anything .
And a doctor would consider it ?
It ’s considered because it is assumed that it will share the same properties as other antiepileptics , i.e. that it is a mood stabilizer .
But no other antiepileptics are mood stabilizers , so why the assumption ?
And even if one seizure drug was , in fact , a mood stabilizer , why would another one be ?
If antiepileptics have totally different efficacies with respect to seizure treatment , why should it be any different for bipolar treatment ?
The power of the paradigm compels us .
Can an antipsychotic be an antidepressant ?
Sure .
Can an antidepressant be an antipsychotic ?
See ?
You ’re hesitating .
It is harder to imagine that an antidepressant can be an antipsychotic — as if there is anything in either term that allows us to predict other actions — because the paradigm has given value to terms that they do n’t have .
There ’s an analogy in the social sciences : racism .
The Knowledge Trap
But psychiatry is an applied discipline .
What ’s the harm if assumptions lead to efficacious treatments ?
This is a trap .
Psychiatry has convinced itself that it needs to focus on expanding its knowledge ( i.e. data ) rather than re-evaluating its postulates and paradigms .
New discoveries or information are used to build on a paradigm , not to test it .
But now psychiatry is looking to see what it expects to find .
And if a discovery flatly contradicts the tradition , then it is ignored or rationalized .
How else to explain the comparative absence of articles critically discussing the placebo response ?
And the even fewer whose proposed solution is not the abandonment of the placebo arm , in favour of “ active controls . ”
Active as defined by whom ?
Is Depakote an active control ?
What Is Modern Psychiatry Seeking ?
The fiction is that psychiatry is looking for more efficacious treatments .
It is not .
It is looking for different treatments ; the paradigm does not allow for the creation of better treatments .
For example , psychiatry can applaud itself from moving from a “ noradrenergic hypothesis ” to a “ serotonin hypothesis ” of depression , but it ’s still the same paradigm .
While first line medications have changed , they have not changed because of improved efficacy .
Nothing has ever found anything to be more efficacious than the previous standard ( SSRIs .
vs. tricyclics , atypical antipsychotics vs. chlorpromazine , etc. ) nor has any “ model ” been more or less correct than any other .
That some medications have less side effects and greater versatility is useful , but a ) this is almost never the result of intentional scientific discovery but rather the fortunate by - product of the invention of ( yet another ) efficacious treatment ; b ) this greater tolerability in no way reflects the accuracy or inaccuracy of an existing model .
That Zoloft is more tolerable than imipramine has nothing to do with the viability of the “ serotonin hypothesis . ”
And yet how many times have I heard that antipsychotics treat depression with no more rigorous explanation than because of their “ activity ” ( note the vague term ) on serotonin ?
Psychiatry , which seeks to be like physics , becomes instead a caricature of it .
It , too , tries to focus on expanding knowledge and not re-evaluating its principles .
But unlike physics , psychiatry has no formal principles .
They are made up .
It is , strictly speaking , not a science but a paradigm , no different than psychoanalysis .
It may seem as though Freud concocted the notion of the unconscious out of thin air and developed an entire field around it , but modern psychiatry has done nothing different in concocting the notions of kindling or “ upregulation of receptors ” as first principles and then constructing an equally arbitrary field around them .
That medications help patients has everything to do with the medications and nothing to do with the incense and liturgy that surround them .
Paradigm shifts do not occur in physics because the principles do not change .
Newtonian mechanics will always be useful for prediction because it is correct for the cases in which it is applicable ( i.e. for measurable bodies . )
It is furthermore not susceptible to political influence .
Psychiatry is the opposite .
The decision to accept or reject the paradigms in psychiatry are very clearly political , not evidentiary .
We as individuals accept the idea that antiepileptics are mood stabilizers because psychiatry has decided to adopt this position , not because the evidence requires us to accept it ( in fact , the evidence should require us not to accept it , or at least seriously question it . )
No physicist could hope to “ practice ” physics without having read and understood what came before , without having worked the “ block on an incline ” problem .
But there is no theoretical nor practical requirement to practice psychiatry of reading the papers on , for example , mood stabilization , let alone what came before .
All that is required is to know what the current practice is ( “ Guidelines recommend prescribe antiepileptics . ” )
This may seem like science , i.e. “ scientists have determined that antiepileptics are mood stabilizers , so we will trust their word and prescribe them , ” but it is very clearly politics .
The current problem of psychiatry is that it seeks to be something that it is not : science .
It may be , at some future date , readily described by scientific principles , but this is assuredly not the case now .
It is most certainly a sociological construct , a paradigm , with a shared educational system , shared assumptions , and a mechanism to communicate discoveries ( i.e. journals , meetings . )
It also has a common language .
But it lacks the predictive ability common to other disciplines .
An argument against the notion that psychiatry is an arbitrary paradigm is that it is a reflection of what actually occurs in the brain .
This is sophistry .
For example , saying the “ serotonin system is relevant in mood disorders ” is empty because it lacks context .
Does it mean that no other system is relevant ?
Or that it is the most relevant ?
Or even necessary ?
Sufficient ?
What about Wellbutrin ?
Are you saying psychotherapy alters serotonin ?
( And not dopamine ? Etc )
Why There Can Be No Progress in Biological Psychiatry Using The Current Paradigm
While there is a science of the brain , there is no science of thought .
Another way to think of the problem is to question the nominalism of the field .
Psychiatry talks about things like mood , emotion , depression .
But are those actually real and distinct things ?
Is there some signal pattern in the brain that is mood that is wholly unrelated to the signal pattern for a thought ?
Just because something has a name , that does not mean that the thing exists in fact .
These may be simply convenient fictions .
To say that because it is known that chemicals can alter what is called mood therefore proves the existence of mood is not satisfactory .
The death of a loved one will alter mood as well , often dramatically and to an extreme .
How is this possible , if no chemicals are introduced into the system ?
In fact , nothing new is introduced into the brain except , depending on the paradigm , a ) information or b ) energy ( i.e. converted sound waves . )
How does the introduction of a new piece of information trigger an alteration of mood ?
Why would one thought " My family is dead " trigger the release of some chemicals , but another thought " My family is alive " not trigger that same release ?
And how does a non-physical entity like a thought trigger a physical reaction ?
Are thoughts even discrete ?
Or does the brain operate on a flow of thoughts ?
Digital or analog ?
Linear regression and statistics cannot address all of the problems of chemistry and mood ; for one reason because it does not account for thoughts that a patient cannot have while on the drug -- but it is reasonable to think there are some .
In other words , if there is some set of thoughts A , a subset B of which are negative and a subset C of which are positive , then is the introduction of a chemical in the brain able to block only subset C , or does it simply block set A ?
The reverse is potentially applicable : that there are certain thoughts that can be had only when on a drug .
( This is obviously evident in the case of perceptions that can be had only on a drug . )
The simple analogy to computer hardware and software illustrates the difficulty in psychiatry .
One can understand all of the hardware of a computer system , but this will not explain if or how the computer can run word processing software , video games , instant message or be susceptible to a virus , or make any predictions about the behavior of this software in the real world ( for example , no computer technician could predict the writing of this paper , nor , by changing the hardware , alter the content of this paper . )
Hardware is finite , but software is infinite , or as infinite as is thought .
Without understanding the mechanism of thought , or at least how thoughts or states can affect mood , then a pharmacology of the brain will simply tread water with no progress towards either treatment or diagnosis .
One cannot permanently alter mood without at least simultaneously altering thought .
In a sense , there is more logic to the psychological approach , or at least in conjunction with medications , because if software ( thought ) is the problem , more software is the cure .
While the applicability of “ therapy ” in schizophrenia may be debatable , there is no reason as yet to decide that any other approach is applicable to mood disorders such as depression or anxiety , and absolutely no evidentiary reason to assume that pharmacology is the superior approach .
It is not necessarily faster nor more consistently reliable .
Myths of psychiatry such as those described above are not isolated examples of poor practice or lack of knowledge , but are the unavoidable manifestations of an artificial paradigm which is arbitrarily derived from unproven assumptions , justified by inappropriate logic .
They often lead to ineffective , dangerous , and very expensive treatment .
Psychiatry must be more vigilant about its own data .
It is necessary to avoid laziness in our education and understand from where comes our knowledge .
There are daily diatribes against the influence of pharmaceutical companies ; but the effect of pens and detailing is surely much smaller than the effect of misunderstood data , poorly researched axioms , and signs run amok .
Psychiatry will not survive as a medical subspecialty if it continues along this path .
It will lose its dignity , and worse , it will become irrelevant .
“ It would be good to conclude by recommending a short book , What Is Science ? , that does things the right way .
It takes a robustly objective view of the relation of evidence to conclusion , explains what laws of nature are , briefly shows how measurement , data , statistics , and mathematical models work in science , states which parts of science are well - established and which not , illustrates with engaging episodes in the history of science , and ends with some colorful rudenesses on postmodernist solecisms concerning science .
Unfortunately , it does not exist . ” [ iii ]

Take a look at this little piece of code .
It looks pretty innocuous , like it was taken straight from " Teach Yourself ASP.NET in 21 Days " .
Pull a list of Trips out of the database for a given user , and bind it to a select list .
Nothing fancy .
Teaches you a little bit about ADO.NET and databinding all in one place .
Imagine my surprise , however , when I walked in to a small software shop recently and found a whole project written with code like the above .
What were these guys thinking ?
Are they seriously relying on this fragile , unmaintainable mess in a real software product ?
And then it dawned on me .
Maybe nobody had ever told them that the little examples in the book are just that : Little Examples .
For teaching purposes .
Never intended for use in the real world .
Come to think of it , it does n't even tell you that in the book .
It aught to be in block capitals across the cover of the book :
WARNING : DO NOT PASTE THE SAMPLES FROM THIS BOOK DIRECTLY INTO PRODUCTION SOFTWARE !!!
Somehow , it seems that this message never got through to a substantial portion of the software industry .
Every time I see a " Senior Developer " writing ad - hoc SQL or referencing a hashtable with a string I just want to cry .
So what do we do about it ?
I guess we try to get the message out .
Here is some code I copied out of the Blogabond source that is functionally equivalent to the above :
Figure 2. , Production Sample
public class ProductionCode : System .
Web.UI .
Page { protected HtmlSelect selTripID ; private int _userID ; private void Page_Load ( object sender , System .
EventArgs e ) { if (! IsPostBack ) { _userID = StringConvert.ToInt32 ( Request [ User.Columns.UserID ] , 0 ) ; if ( _userID != 0 ) { PopulateTripList ( ) ; } else { // bail gracefully ... } } } private void PopulateTripList ( ) { selTripID.DataSource = Trip.GetByUserID(_userID ) ; selTripID.DataTextField = Trip.Columns .
TripName ; selTripID.DataValueField = Trip.Columns.TripID ; selTripID.DataBind( ) ; } }
We 're using a Data Layer of some sort .
Somewhere in the back end lives a class that is wrapping a stored procedure for me .
There 's a Connection Factory back there someplace that knows to hand me a connection to the Production database because of a server setting .
The code that 's handing me the DataSet I 'm binding to can be reused by any page in the project , so I know that little select statement is only living in a single place .
In fact , everything that touches that table is sitting in a single class back there .
So if something changes in the schema I wo n't have to go hunting through the client code to fix it .
Best of all , because we 've separated the database code out into its own place , we can drop all the boilerplate CRUD into CodeSmith templates and let it auto - generate itself from the database schema .
In the case of Blogabond , I can flip a switch and watch as 50 k lines of boilerplate C# and SQL in our backend gets blown away and recreated in about 30 seconds .
And since it's also generating all the boilerplate Unit Tests for all that code , we can be sure that the datalayer and the database line up correctly .
So if junior dev Jimmy comes by and unchecks a not - null constraint in Enterprise manager , we 'll see the continuous build fail on an integrity check a few minutes later .
We 're using Enums instead of inline strings to reference our column names .
This may not sound like a big deal , but it buys us a couple things .
First , we 've abstracted out the concept of the Typo .
There is simply no way we can misspell " TripID " , because the compiler will catch it for us .
It will sit there underlined in red if we even try .
We do n't even have to remember what columns we have available , since Intellisense will tell us when we hit ctrl+space .
Second , and bigger , is that we buy the freedom to monkey with our tables and never worry that we 're causing runtime errors someplace .
I can rename the column " TripName " to " BlogName " if I want , re-generate the database wrappers , and watch as the project fails to compile until I fix the references .
That is some powerful stuff .
And what happens if I forget to re-generate the wrappers for that table ?
The continuous build will fail in about 5 minutes , since the unit tests that check to make sure the wrappers match the schema will fail .
Where do we go from here ?
Short and to the point .
And obviously only the tip of the iceberg .
This bit of code goes deep , but we can learn a few things just by looking at it : Copy and paste code reuse is bad .
Everybody knows that .
Ad - hoc SQL is bad .
Everybody knows that .
Inline strings are bad .
Everybody knows that .
At least that 's what I thought .
But you know what ?
They do n’t .
And they should .
And it 's our job to tell them .
In the past few days I 've found that while I 'm writing the code , the type checker is the one deciding what the code should be .
To take an example , I was recently writing some SYB code using gfoldl : > gfoldl :: ( forall a b .
Data a => c ( a -> b ) -> a -> c b ) -> ( forall g . g -> c g ) -> a -> c
aI decided what c had to be :> newtype C x a = C ( [ x ] , [ x ] -> ( a , [ x ] ) ) ( where " C x " was the instantiated type of c ) From there I did n't have much of a clue what I was doing , but by the time you 've got that far , there is really virtually only one type correct program that can possibly work !
Finding what that program was took a while , but once you have got this far you can start getting the type checker to write the code for you .
The first step is to write the basic definition , in such a way that Haskell will give you error messages if you do n't get it right : > myexpr :: a -> C x a > myexpr = gfoldl cont base > cont = undefined > base = undefinedAt this point the Haskell type checker can already check that you have n't made a mistake anywhere else .
Once all is good you can start trying to " fill in the blanks " .
The first step is to tackle base : > base :: a -> C x a > base = undefinedNote that no code has been written , but you 've checked that the type is valid .
A :ttype on base would have given you the same information , assuming base was at the top level of the program , but this step is useful to check .
Next you can start filling in the undefined bits :> base :: a -> C x a > base a = C ( [ ] , \y -> ( a , y ) )
By working this way it is relatively easy to build up a correct program , at each stage using small steps and regular type feedback to check you are going in the right direction .
The second time I was using this technique was when I was replacing one data structure with another , with some similar operations and some completely different ones .
It was n't as simple as changing the imports , but thanks to regular feedback from the type checker this went from being an exercise in thought to just going around mopping up the errors .
Programming like this is very powerful , giving lots of hints about what the user needs to do next , but would really benefit from some intelligent development tools .
Epigram has some similar ideas built into the development environment , but Haskell does n't .
Rich : ' Macaca moment ' symbolizes Rovian collapse Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday August 20 , 2007
Print This Email This Immigration reform ?
Katrina ?
Iraq ?
Writing in his Sunday column for The New York Times , Frank Rich says that none of these issues symbolize Karl Rove 's ill - fated vision for the Republican party so well as one , formerly - obscure word captured on video just over a year ago : Macaca .
" Forced to pick a single symbolic episode to encapsulate the collapse of Rovian Republicanism , " said Rich , " I would not choose any of those national watersheds , or even the implosion of the Iraq war , but the George Allen ' macaca ' moment ...
Its first anniversary fell , fittingly enough , on the same day last weekend that Mitt Romney bought his victory at the desultory , poorly attended GOP straw poll in Iowa . "
A political " century " has passed , Rich says , since incumbent Virginia Republican Sen.
George Allen " was anointed by Washington insiders as the inevitable heir to the Bush - Rove mantle : a former governor whose jus ' - folks personality , the Bushian camouflage for hard - edged conservatism , would propel him to the White House . "
" Allen 's senatorial campaign and presidential future , " Rich continued , " melted down overnight after he insulted a Jim Webb campaign worker , the 20 - year - old son of Indian immigrants , not just by calling him a monkey but by sarcastically welcoming him ' to America ' and ' the real world of Virginia . "
Why the story sprouted such legs -- video of the event created a national buzz when it popped up on YouTube -- was due to a number of factors , according to Rich .
" This incident had resonance well beyond Virginia and Allen for several reasons .
First , it crystallized the monochromatic whiteness at the dark heart of Rovian Republicanism ... There is not a single black Republican serving in either the House or Senate , and little representation of other minorities , either , " Rich said .
" Far from looking like America , the GOP caucus , like the party 's presidential field , could pass for a Rotary Club , circa 1954 . "
Rich added that Allen 's comment was a " compact distillation " of Bush and Rove 's perceived attitude -- standing in stark contrast to early promises of a Rove- coined " compassionate conservatism . " Rich goes on to say that while Bush and Rove are not xenophobes , history will show that the White House " spoke up too late and said too little when some of its political allies descended into Mexican - bashing during the immigration brawl .
Bush and Rove winked at anti-immigrant bigotry , much as they did at the homophobia they inflamed with their incessant election - year demagoguery about same - sex marriage . "
Finally , said Rich , " the ' macaca ' incident was a media touchstone . "
Referring to its
YouTube popularity , Rich said that " a year later , leading Republicans are still clueless and panicked about this new medium , which is why they , unlike their Democratic counterparts , pulled out of even a tightly controlled CNN - YouTube debate . "
" The rise of YouTube certifies the passing of Rove 's era , a cultural changing of the guard in the digital age .
Rove made his name in direct - mail fundraising and with fierce top - down message management ... it threatens the Rove ethos that led Bush to campaign at " town hall " meetings attended only by hand - picked supporters . "
The face of the Republican Party - -" at once contemptuous and greedy and self - righteous , " said Rich - - is the face of Rove himself .
" It is indelible enough to serve as the Republican brand for a generation . "

Update 6 : Some interesting changes from Twitter 's Evan Weaver : everything in RAM now , database is a backup ; peaks at 300 tweets / second ; every tweet followed by average 126 people ; vector cache of tweet IDs ; row cache ; fragment cache ; page cache ; keep separate caches ; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with Scala ; Thrift and HTTP are used internally ; 100s internal requests for every external request ; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same ; 3 queues are used to load balance requests ; extensive A/ B testing for backwards capability ; switched to C memcached client for speed ; optimize critical path ; faster to get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them locally .
Update 5 : Twitter on Scala .
A Conversation with Steve Jenson , Alex Payne , and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners .
A fascinating discussion of why Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure ( long lived processes ) and why they moved to Scala to program against it ( high level language , static typing , functional ) .
Ruby is used on the front - end but was n't performant or reliable enough for the back - end .
Update 4 : Improving Running Components at Twitter by Evan Weaver .
Tells how Twitter changed their infrastructure to go from handling 3 requests to 139 requests a second .
They moved to a messaging model , asynchronous process , 3 levels of cache , and moved their middleware to a mixture C and Scala / JVM .
Update 3 : Upgrading Twitter without service disruptions by Gojko Adzic .
Lots of good updates on the new Twitter architecture .
Update 2 : a commenter in Twitter Fails Macworld Keynote
Test said this entry needs to be updated .
LOL .
My uneducated guess is it's not a language or architecture problem , but more a problem of not being able to add hardware fast enough into their data center .
The predictability of this problem is debatable , but once you have it , it 's hard to fix .
Update : Twitter releases Starling - light - weight persistent queue server that speaks the MemCache protocol .
It was built to drive Twitter 's backend , and is in production across Twitter 's cluster .
Twitter started as a side project and blew up fast , going from 0 to millions of page views within a few terrifying months .
Early design decisions that worked well in the small melted under the crush of new users chirping tweets to all their friends .
Web darling Ruby on Rails was fingered early for the scaling problems , but Blaine Cook , Twitter 's lead architect , held Ruby blameless :
For us , it ’s really about scaling horizontally - to that end , Rails and Ruby have n’t been stumbling blocks , compared to any other language or framework .
The performance boosts associated with a “ faster ” language would give us a 10 - 20 % improvement , but thanks to architectural changes that Ruby and Rails happily accommodated , Twitter is 10000 % faster than it was in January .
If Ruby on Rails was n't to blame , how did Twitter learn to scale ever higher and higher ?

A Small Talk on Getting Big. Scaling a Rails App & all that Jazz - really cute dog picks
The Platform
Ruby on Rails
Erlang
MySQL
Mongrel - hybrid Ruby / C HTTP server designed to be small , fast , and secure
Munin
Nagios
Google Analytics
AWStats - real - time logfile analyzer to get advanced statistics
Memcached
The Stats
Over 350,000 users .
The actual numbers are as always , very super super top secret .
600 requests per second .
Average 200-300 connections per second .
Spiking to 800 connections per second .
MySQL handled 2,400 requests per second .
180 Rails instances .
Uses Mongrel as the " web " server .
1 MySQL Server ( one big 8 core box ) and 1 slave .
Slave is read only for statistics and reporting .
30 + processes for handling odd jobs .
8 Sun X4100s .
Process a request in 200 milliseconds in Rails .
Average time spent in the database is 50 - 100 milliseconds .
Over 16 GB of memcached .
The Architecture
Ran into very public scaling problems .
The little bird of failure popped up a lot for a while .
Originally they had no monitoring , no graphs , no statistics , which makes it hard to pinpoint and solve problems .
Added Munin and Nagios .
There were difficulties using tools on Solaris .
Had Google analytics but the pages were n't loading so it was n't that helpful :-)
Use caching with memcached a lot .
- For example , if getting a count is slow , you can memoize the count into memcache in a millisecond .
- Getting your friends status is complicated .
There are security and other issues .
So rather than doing a query , a friend 's status is updated in cache instead .
It never touches the database .
This gives a predictable response time frame ( upper bound 20 msecs ) .
- ActiveRecord objects are huge so that 's why they are n't cached .
So they want to store critical attributes in a hash and lazy load the other attributes on access .
- 90 % of requests are API requests .
So do n't do any page / fragment caching on the front - end .
The pages are so time sensitive it does n't do any good .
But they cache API requests .
Messaging
- Use message a lot .
Producers produce messages , which are queued , and then are distributed to consumers .
Twitter 's main functionality is to act as a messaging bridge between different formats ( SMS , web , IM , etc ) .
- Send message to invalidate friend 's cache in the background instead of doing all individually , synchronously .
- Started with DRb , which stands for distributed Ruby .
A library that allows you to send and receive messages from remote Ruby objects via TCP / IP .
But it was a little flaky and single point of failure .
- Moved to Rinda , which a shared queue that uses a tuplespace model , along the lines of Linda .
But the queues are persistent and the messages are lost on failure .
- Tried Erlang .
Problem :
How do you get a broken server running at Sunday Monday with 20,000 users waiting ?
The developer did n't know .
Not a lot of documentation .
So it violates the use what you know rule .
- Moved to Starling , a distributed queue written in Ruby .
- Distributed queues were made to survive system crashes by writing them to disk .
Other big websites take this simple approach as well .
SMS is handled using an API supplied by third party gateway's .
It 's very expensive .
Deployment
- They do a review and push out new mongrel servers .
No graceful way yet .
- An internal server error is given to the user if their mongrel server is replaced .
- All servers are killed at once .
A rolling blackout is n't used because the message queue state is in the mongrels and a rolling approach would cause all the queues in the remaining mongrels to fill up .
Abuse
- A lot of down time because people crawl the site and add everyone as friends .
9000 friends in 24 hours .
It would take down the site .
- Build tools to detect these problems so you can pinpoint when and where they are happening .
- Be ruthless .
Delete them as users .
Partitioning
- Plan to partition in the future .
Currently they do n't .
These changes have been enough so far .
- The partition scheme will be based on time , not users , because most requests are very temporally local .
- Partitioning will be difficult because of automatic memoization .
They can't guarantee read - only operations will really be read - only .
May write to a read - only slave , which is really bad .
Twitter 's API Traffic is 10 x Twitter ’s Site
- Their API is the most important thing Twitter has done .
- Keeping the service simple allowed developers to build on top of their infrastructure and come up with ideas that are way better than Twitter could come up with .
For example , Twitterrific , which is a beautiful way to use Twitter that a small team with different priorities could create .
Monit is used to kill process if they get too big .
Lessons Learned
Talk to the community .
Do n't hide and try to solve all problems yourself .
Many brilliant people are willing to help if you ask .
Treat your scaling plan like a business plan .
Assemble a board of advisers to help you .
Build it yourself .
Twitter spent a lot of time trying other people 's solutions that just almost seemed to work , but not quite .
It 's better to build some things yourself so you at least have some control and you can build in the features you need .
Build in user limits .
People will try to bust your system .
Put in reasonable limits and detection mechanisms to protect your system from being killed .
Do n't make the database the central bottleneck of doom .
Not everything needs to require a gigantic join .
Cache data .
Think of other creative ways to get the same result .
A good example is talked about in Twitter , Rails , Hammers , and 11,000 Nails per Second .
Make your application easily partitionable from the start .
Then you always have a way to scale your system .
Realize your site is slow .
Immediately add reporting to track problems .
Optimize the database .
- Index everything .
Rails wo n't do this for you .
- Use explain to how your queries are running .
Indexes may not be being as you expect .
- Denormalize a lot .
Single handedly saved them .
For example , they store all a user IDs friend IDs together , which prevented a lot of costly joins .
- Avoid complex joins .
- Avoid scanning large sets of data .
Cache the hell out of everything .
Individual active records are not cached , yet .
The queries are fast enough for now .
Test everything .
- You want to know when you deploy an application that it will render correctly .
- They have a full test suite now .
So when the caching broke they were able to find the problem before going live .
Long running processes should be abstracted to daemons .
Use exception notifier and exception logger to get immediate notification of problems so you can address the right away .
Do n't do stupid things .
- Scale changes what can be stupid .
- Trying to load 3000 friends at once into memory can bring a server down , but when there were only 4 friends it works great .
Most performance comes not from the language , but from application design .
Turn your website into an open service by creating an API .
Their API is a huge reason for Twitter 's success .
It allows user 's to create an ever expanding and ecosystem around Twitter that is difficult to compete with .
You can never do all the work your user 's can do and you probably wo n't be as creative .
So open you application up and make it easy for others to integrate your application with theirs .

Nick , who responded to Dougâ€™s recent post made some great points and some which I disagreed with .
I was going to respond to the original postâ€™s thread , but as my response became longer and longer , I thought it should be a stand alone post .
Hereâ€™s what Nick had to say :
Ron Paul is dead wrong on the islamofascism matter , but I simply donâ€™t care .
Right now I see us at a crossroadsâ€ ¦do we go further down the Euro - style nanny state road ?
Or do we turn back and recognize liberty for what it is ?
Ron Paul manages to piss me off everytime he starts saying thereâ€™s no threat in the middle east .
A lot .
Islam was founded by a violent intolerant man , and anytime an islamic government ( instead of a secular government of islamic people ) is allowed to flourish , these same traits will rise again .
Until the middle east takes a page from Ataturk , it will always be a hotbed of intolerant violence .
Always .
It can be argued that weâ€™ve given them * excuses * to act the way they want to , but thatâ€™s something entirely different .
Anyone with any understanding of history knows that â€ ˜Palestineâ€™ was created purely as an anti-Israel propaganda tool .
But Ron Paul is still the only candidate Iâ€™d vote for .
What I want to know is why they didnâ€™t ask the DOCTOR about healthcare reform ( Giuliani gave a great answer by the way ) .
Why didnâ€™t they ask him about anything else ?
I figure a lot of us find his Iraq War answers distasteful , but he can win a LOT of friends with his talk of domestic problems .
And the domestic thing is the ONLY thing iâ€™m looking at right now .
I agree with Nick : if Ron Paul is going to be in the race , I wish he would focus on domestic issues .
Iâ€™m not saying that he should go against his principled anti-war beliefs ( which is more than what I can say about the unprincipled and opportunistic anti-war candidates on the left ) but he really isnâ€™t saying anything all that much different than anyone else who opposes the war .
I think his assessment of Islam is spot on as well .
Thereâ€™s a danger with all religions becoming extreme and militant ; right now Islam is the religion which has the most extreme elements and a significant threat to our liberty .
I wish I could focus on Ron Paulâ€™s domestic agenda and ignore his naivet Ã© about external threats to our way of life .
I think itâ€™s this issue which is keeping him from having more wide spread support because I think many rank and file Republicans are libertarian at heart on the domestic side .
If there was such a candidate who would advocate Paulâ€™s domestic policies and a more effective foreign policy than the current administration , I would support that candidate in a heartbeat .
Iâ€™m beginning to contemplate more of a â€œsurvivalistâ€  attitude as it relates to Islamic terrorism .
Maybe its time to adopt an â€œevery man for himselfâ€ policy ?
We know the government cannot or will not defend us from every threat , whether foreign or domestic .
Hell , far too often the threat comes from the government itself !
Truthfully , the first and last responsibility of self defense belongs to the individual .
This is why the right to bear arms is so critically important and why every effort to limit the individualâ€™s access to firearms should be resisted at every turn .
What are the chances of my family , friends , or me being a victim of terrorism anyway ?
Perhaps
I should adopt the â€œit doesnâ€™t affect meâ€ attitude of one of my readers ( Josh ) who couldnâ€™t care less about what would happen to the Iraqis if coalition forces suddenly left Iraq in its current state .
Some believe that al Qaeda and other Islamic terror groups will bring their fight back to American soil if such a withdrawal from Iraq were to take place .
I happen to think there is some validity to that theory .
But so what ?
If the next attack happens in New York , Washington , Los Angeles , or anywhere but my back yardâ€ ¦itâ €™s not my problem right ?
Iâ€™m not quite to that point yet .
I still care too much about my fellow man .
But if I ever do decide to embrace this â€œevery man for himselfâ€ approach , Ron Paul will have my full support .
User -news sites offer diverse stories , some questionable sources
Choosing the News .
Chronicle Graphic Choosing the News .
Chronicle Graphic Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close User - news sites offer diverse stories , some questionable sources 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
During a week this summer when the mainstream press focused on the immigration debate in Congress and a failed terrorism plot in the United Kingdom , the most popular stories on news sites where the users rank their favorites , like San Francisco 's Digg , was - aside from chatter about Apple 's new iPhone - not dominated by any one news story .
And that 's part of their allure .
The 24 - hour news cycle does n't exist on rapidly growing user - news sites like Digg , Del.icio.us or San Francisco - based Reddit .
Neither do the small cabal of editors who decide what news readers and viewers should see on traditional print and broadcast outlets .
Instead , the readers of these user - news sites collectively and continuously contribute to the creation of a digital " front page " of their favorite stories - pushing to prominence news that may get scant airing on traditional print , broadcast or cable outlets , where space and airtime is finite and , they say , risk - taking is more rare .
This changing approach to news consumption is highlighted in a study released today by the Project for Excellence in Journalism , a Washington , D.C. , think tank .
It compared the stories on the above three leading user - news sites , along with Yahoo News ' Most Recommended , Most Viewed and Most E- mailed stories , with the project 's daily content audit of 48 print , cable , online , network TV and radio news outlets .
The study , a snapshot of a week 's worth of news consumption , shows the growing interdependence between traditional news outlets and online user - news sites .
It also illustrates how the news looks a lot different when audience members pick what story they want to read or recommend , as opposed to a professional journalist .
" The traditional news outlet wants to put a lot of gravitas on their front page .
They want the readers to eat their spinach , " said Kourosh Karimkhany , general manager of Wired Digital , which owns Reddit .
Technology allows users to create their own news " agenda " from multiple online sources , rendering a traditional front page increasingly " irrelevant , " he said .
Instead , on these growing sites - Digg welcomed 19.5 million unique visitors last month - consumers rely on the " wisdom of crowds " ( other readers ) to figure out what are the top stories of the day .
The study found that the news items on these sites are " more diverse , more transitory and often draw on a very different and perhaps controversial list of sources . "
It found that 40 percent of the stories on user - news sites originated on blogs and 24 percent came from mainstream sites like BBC News .
Only 5 percent came from wire services .
So the immigration debate never was a top - 10 story on Digg or Del.icio.us during the week of June 24 , the study 's focus period .
It appeared just once that week among the top stories on Reddit .
" The best way to get a sense of trend among these sites is not to look at specific news events , but at broad topic areas such as politics , crime and foreign affairs , " the study found .
And the focus on user - news sites is a lot different than editor - chosen news sites .
The study found roughly 40 percent of the stories on Digg and Del.icio.us were devoted to technology and science .
Lifestyle stories were the second most popular on user - news sites .
While the war in Iraq accounted for 10 percent of the stories from the nation 's top mainstream news outlets , it was only 1 percent of the stories on the three user - news sites .
At traditional outlets , the top - 10 list of stories that week - topics like Iraq , the Supreme Court decisions and a major fire near Lake Tahoe - accounted for 51 percent of all the stories .
" What it hints at is that the range of topics are broader and more varied ( on user - news sites ) , " said Tom Rosenstiel , director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism .
However , Rosenstiel said , it also shows that " more sources may or may not be completely dependable . "
On these user - news sites , items may be posted from a blog or other online source that does n't come with the " assurance of a professional journalist saying , ' I made seven calls on this , and it 's legitimate . '
Or , ' It 's a scam . ' "
And while traditional journalists often concentrate on ongoing coverage of the same issue , the variety of stories turning up on user - news sites may show that " maybe a lot of readers are n't as interested in those turn - of - the - screw type of stories , " Rosenstiel said .
But the study does n't portend the end to traditional journalism , said Jay Adelson , CEO of Digg .
On his site , its 2 million registered users submit and vote on content , " digging " the stories they prefer and " burying " those they do n't .
Stories with the most " diggs " go to the top of the page , creating a constantly evolving news source .
" In the current form , it is a very symbiotic relationship " between user - news sites and traditional media , he said .
" What this study shows is that the online news consumer consumes news differently . "
Instead of cuddling up to one newspaper or checking out the evening news , today 's consumer is checking out 15 to 20 sources - from the New York Times and The Chronicle to ABC to a blog , said Reddit 's Karimkhany .
Indeed , many traditional news outlets mark their stories with one or more user - news icons , inviting their readers to " Digg " that story .
" It 's not so much that people are shunning news .
I think people are reading more , " said Karimkhany , a graduate of the Columbia School of Journalism and a former reporter for mainstream outlets like Reuters and Bloomberg News .
" What Reddit does is much what a traditional newsroom does .
Except that instead of having four or five men in their 40s and 50s decide what goes on the front page , thousands of people do . "
But while this changing environment has brought many more news outlets into the picture , it has also cut into revenues for traditional outlets - which traditionally have been the home of most investigative reporting , because they had the resources to do so .
Said Adelson : " What I wonder about is what is going to happen to investigative journalism . "

THE VOLATILITY SEEN THIS QUARTER IN the stock and credit markets may be new to younger investors .
But there is something lurking out there that can make things really dicey .
A little - known fountain of free money called the " gold carry trade " is in danger of drying up .
And if it does , then markets from gold to bonds and even stocks can be in for a wild ride .
Before even explaining what the gold carry trade entails , let me first say that its demise has been forecast for nearly a decade .
In researching this topic , I found articles as far back as 1998 looking for an explosion in gold prices and commensurate damage to other markets , if not the economy .
In other words , this is a story that is as old as Methuselah .
But with a sinking dollar , soaring commodities , and several diverse technical conditions on the charts , the dynamics are coming together to make the end of the gold carry trade a lot closer to reality than ever before .
The gold carry trade is similar to the yen carry trade , which has been a hot topic in the markets this year .
Basically , money is borrowed from one source at a low interest rate and invested elsewhere at a higher rate .
As long as relevant exchange rates and asset prices remain stable , a profit is made with little effort .
Central banks are sitting on huge supplies of gold that earn them no interest and cost them money just to store securely .
To earn a little revenue on these static assets , they loan their gold to banks , called buillon banks , at a ridiculously low interest rate on the order of 1 % .
The banks turn around and sell the gold in the market , typically in the London bullion market , and invest the proceeds in a higher - paying asset , such as long - term Treasury bonds .
If bonds pay 4.6 % then the banks earn an easy 3.6 % .
The problem is that if the gold price starts to rise , profits can be wiped out or turned to losses .
And in today 's market , a falling dollar not only boosts gold prices but it also makes Treasury bonds less attractive to foreign investors .
That reduces demand and weakens prices to create a potential double - edged sword for carry traders .
The banks , of course , realize this and hedge their gold sales by buying gold futures .
According to Kevin Schweitzer , senior vice president with Hudson Securities , a firm that makes markets in gold stocks , the hedge is not perfect .
If central banks call in their gold loans , the banks cannot wait for contract expiration to take delivery on the gold they purchased via their futures contracts .
They have to pay back their loans right away and if gold prices are stable , there is no problem for the banks going into the physical market to buy back their gold .
However , if gold starts to rise quickly , the added demand from the banks to buy gold can exacerbate the rally causing what amounts to a mad dash for the metal .
The market will respond with steeply higher prices , and Schweitzer sees this pushing gold to $ 850 by the end of the year .
All of this is fundamental in nature so let 's examine the technicals a bit more .
As the chart shows , gold peaked in May 2006 in what some labeled a speculative bubble .
However , rather than falling quickly as burst bubbles portend , the market moved sideways for the next 15 months ( see Chart 1 ) .
Chart 1
Last month , gold broke out from that range to resume its bull market , moving quickly from 670 to 721 in just eight trading days .
A 7.6 % move in such a short period is a wake - up call for the carry traders .
Schweitzer also points out that open interest in gold futures , which measures the current size of bets made by futures traders , is 34 % lower than it was last year at the presumed speculative price peak .
In other words , the speculation present today is lower than it was the last time prices went up like they are now , and Schweitzer thinks that this gives the market a lot of room to the upside .
Traders who buy momentum markets -- think Nasdaq in 1999 -- have not yet piled on .
Seasonally , gold is also entering one of the stronger parts of the year .
Commercial players in the gold industry , the so - called smart money , are still buying and otherwise acting as if they expect prices to continue to rise ( see Getting Technical , " Gold Stocks Are Precious Again , " Sept. 10 ) .
Put it all together and the technicals support higher prices , short - term corrections excepted , and that will continue to pressure the gold carry trade .
What is the price that breaks the bank , so to speak ?
It is hard to say .
But with so many factors conspiring to keep the rally going , it does look as if the carry trade is finally about to unwind .
Banks that hold big short positions in gold are going to be very vulnerable .
Investors sitting on a stash of Krugerrands or Maple Leafs will be a lot happier .

Theory and Practice of Constraint Handling Rules , Thom Fruewirth , Journal of Logic Programming , 1994 .
Constraint Handling Rules ( CHR ) are our proposal to allow more flexibility and application - oriented customization of constraint systems .
CHR are a declarative language extension especially designed for writing user - defined constraints .
CHR are essentially a committed - choice language consisting of multi-headed guarded rules that rewrite constraints into simpler ones until they are solved .
In this broad survey we cover all aspects of CHR as they currently present themselves .
Going from theory to practice , we will define the syntax and semantics of CHR , introduce an important decidable property , confluence , of CHR programs and define a tight integration of CHR with constraint logic programming languages .
This survey then describes implementations of the language before we review several constraint solvers -- both traditional and non-standard ones -- written in the CHR language .
Finally we introduce two innovative applications that benefited from being written in CHR .
IT ’S A RIVETING SCENE that could have come from a more civil - liberties - friendly version of the television show “ 24 . ”
As the U.S. attorney general recovers from surgery , a White House lawyer heads to his hospital room to get the AG ’s signature on a form authorizing continued electronic surveillance of Americans suspected of terrorist ties .
But the president ’s lawyer is foiled by the acting attorney general , who makes it to his boss ’ bedside first .
In this scenario , it ’s not a ticking time bomb but an illegal invasion of privacy that ’s defused .
That stranger - than - fiction story was related this week to the Senate Judiciary Committee by former Deputy Atty .
Gen. James B. Comey .
On March 10 , 2004 , Comey was running the Justice Department during Atty .
Gen. John Ashcroft ’s convalescence from gallbladder surgery .
After refusing on legal grounds to sign a directive extending the Terrorist Surveillance Program , Comey learned that President Bush ’s counsel and chief of staff were on their way to Ashcroft ’s hospital room to try an end run .
Comey told senators that he “ raced to the hospital room ” and was waiting with a “ pretty bad - off ” Ashcroft when the White House team arrived .

Ashcroft declined to sign anything , despite a plea from then - presidential counsel Alberto R. Gonzales .
Later , after Ashcroft and Comey suggested that they might resign over the issue , Bush agreed to unspecified changes in the program .
Gonzales ’ role in this drama brings together the Bush administration ’s biggest personnel problem -- on Thursday , two senators proposed a vote of “ no confidence ” in the attorney general -- and one of its most controversial policies .
It also serves as a reminder that , long before he moved from the White House to the Justice Department , Gonzales was a serial enabler of legal shortcuts in the war on terror .
The timing of Comey ’s revelations could n’t be worse for Bush .
The administration is seeking changes -- some of them reasonable -- in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , the 1978 law that requires a court order for electronic eavesdropping on U.S. citizens .
But skeptical members of Congress recall that , for five years , the administration flouted that very law by eavesdropping on the international phone calls and e-mails of Americans without court approval .

The administration says that the FISA court is now overseeing the Terrorist Surveillance Program , though it has n’t provided details .
But earlier this month , even as he was asking for changes in FISA , Bush ’s director of national intelligence suggested to a Senate committee that the president had the constitutional power to engage in surveillance on his own “ in a crisis . ”
Bush is likelier to obtain the FISA changes he is seeking if the attorney general standing at his side is n’t the man who tried to coax a hospital - bed signature from an ailing John Ashcroft .
Robin Hayes has the solution to the Iraq war : have our soldiers convert all Muslims to Christianity .
Having won the election by only a hair ’s width and almost getting himself kicked out of Congress seems to have had some profound psychological effects on poor Mr. Hayes .
A speech that flip - floppin ’ Robin gave last week at the Concord Rotary Club seems to prove he has finally gone off the deep end .
Our local weekly newspaper the “ Concord Standard and Mount Pleasant Times ” reported on Mr. Hayes speech in his hometown :
First there ’s the usual talk of how we ’re “ winning ” over there : “ The war in Iraq has got to be won ; it ’s being won ” ( A couple of months ago Hayes said that the rise in violence in Iraq was an indication that we ’re winning . )
Then comes the real kicker : “ Stability in Iraq ultimately depends on spreading the message of Jesus Christ , the message of peace on earth , good will towards men .
Everything depends on everyone learning about the birth of the Savior . ”
So if we just turn our soldiers into missionaries everything will be okay , Mr. Hayes ?
First we sent our men over there to take out the WMD ’s , then it was to “ spread democracy ” , now you want them there to “ spread the message of Jesus Christ ” ?
It so happens that people in Iraq already have a savior but unfortunately for Mr. Hayes it ’s Muhammed , not Jesus .
If we ca n’t keep Muslims from killing each other over there , I do n’t think that trying to make them all Christian is going to be any easier .
With this kind of talk Hayes just plays into the hands of Al - Qaeda by confirming what their leaders have always been saying : those American soldiers are just modern Crusaders .
He is thereby strengthening the beliefs of terrorists that want to kill every American soldier they come across .

Updated with link to the actual story . . . click to view :
Walking along a path taken by thousands of others at the Crater of Diamonds State Park , Nicole Ruhter noticed something everyone else had missed - a tea-colored , 2.93 - carat diamond .
Ruhter , 13 , of Butler , Mo. , said she would name her find the " Pathfinder Diamond " after pulling what she described as a broken pyramid from the ground .
Her parents , grandparents , brother and two sisters had already spent the day digging in two other fields before heading down the path just after 7 p.m. Tuesday .
" We were walking through the path and I just walked and saw this little shine , " said Ruhter , who has just finished the seventh - grade .
" We wrapped it up in a little dollar bill and took it back and showed them . "
Ruhter said both park rangers and her vacationing family got excited about the diamond , found along a service road .
So far this year , visitors to the park have found 332 diamonds , three of them Tuesday alone , said Bill Henderson , assistant park superintendent .
While the park does not do appraisals , Henderson said experts appraised a 4 - carat diamond found previously in the park between $ 15,000 to $ 60,000 .
Henderson said Ruhter 's diamond did have chips and several imperfections .
" It 's a nice diamond , " he said .
" It looked like it had been broken off at one side . "
For now , Ruhter and her family said they'd keep the diamond for a time and find out how much it is worth before attempting to sell it .
" I was kind of praying to God .
I was saying , ' I do n't care if it 's worth whatever it 's worth , I do n't care if it 's a tiny little sliver of something , I just want something , ' " Ruhter said .
" Ten minutes later , I just found it . "
Crater of Diamonds State Park is the world 's only diamond - producing site open to the public and visitors are allowed to keep the gems they find .
On average , two diamonds are found each day at the park .
The largest of the 25,000 diamonds found since the state park was established in 1972 was the 16.37 - carat Amarillo Starlight , a white diamond found by a visitor from Texas in 1975 .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The United Auto Workers union launched a nationwide strike against General Motors on Monday as 73,000 UAW members walked off the job and hit the picket lines at the nation 's largest automaker .
UAW President Ron Gettelfinger blasted GM management , saying that the company had not been willing to meet the union part way in negotiations .
" This is nothing we wanted , " he said about the strike .
" No one benefits in a strike .
But there comes a point where someone can push you off a cliff .
That 's what happened here . "
Company officials did not respond to Gettelfinger 's comments , other than to say they were disappointed that the first national strike against the company in more than 37 years had been called , and that they hoped that an agreement to end the walkout could be reached soon .
Talks between the two sides resumed Monday afternoon after the union 's press conference and continued more than five hours through the afternoon and into the evening before recessing for the night just before 8 p.m. Monday .
The same negotiators had been at the table in a marathon session that started early Sunday and went right up to the 11 a.m. ET start of the strike on Monday .
GM spokesman Tom Wickham said talks are expected to resume Tuesday morning , although he did not have any detail on when , and would not comment on progress made in the latest negotiations .
Gettelfinger said at the midday press conference that the union is ready to discuss the company 's key bargaining goal of shifting an estimated $ 51 billion in healthcare expenses for retirees and their family members to union - controlled trust funds .
But he said that other issues had derailed hopes of an agreement .
The union president said he was looking for assurances from the company about the job security of UAW members .
He said he wanted guarantees about how much GM would invest in U.S. plants and about how many new vehicles would be built in the United States .
The UAW has seen its membership at GM plummet by 70 percent since 1994 , as the automaker dumped its parts unit and closed plants to try to align its production more in line with its shrinking U.S. market share .
The strike halted operations at 80 facilities , ranging from assembly lines to parts distribution centers , in 30 states coast - to - coast .
It also is likely to soon stop operations at GM plants in Canada and Mexico that depend on production from U.S. facilities , as well as the plants of many GM suppliers .
Still , most GM dealers wo n't start to see shortages of vehicles for two - to - three weeks , even though the strike will immediately halt production of 12,200 vehicles per day or 760 vehicles per hour , said Michael Robinet , vice president of global vehicle forecasts for CSM Worldwide .
GM 's inventory is above those of Japanese rivals and U.S. sales have been soft in recent months following the subprime mortgage meltdown , although GM bucked the trend to post a much better than expected sales month in August .
" Even if they have too much inventory , this is not a positive for the company , " said Robinet .
" I think they would rather take inventory out on their terms , not someone else 's terms . "
Picket signs went up at plants around the country just after 11 a.m. ET , followed by a stream of union members driving out of the plants ' gates .
The workers had stayed on the job for nine days past the original expiration of the contract on Sept. 14 , while union and management negotiators kept talking .
But late Sunday night , the union set the strike deadline for 11 a.m .
The company said it was still hopeful it could reach a quick deal with the union , despite the start of the strike .
" We are disappointed in the UAW 's decision to call a national strike , " said a statement from GM .
" The bargaining involved complex , difficult issues that affect the job security of our U.S. work force , and the long - term viability of the company .
We are fully committed to working with the UAW to develop solutions together to address the competitive challenges facing General Motors .
We will continue focusing our efforts on reaching an agreement as soon as possible . "
Since the start of 2005 , GM has taken a hit in its core North American auto unit , which posted nearly $ 13 billion in net losses in 2005 and 2006 combined .
Losses continued in the first quarter of 2007 before the unit posted a narrow profit in the second quarter , but it was likely to report continued losses this year even without the costs associated with a strike .
The company has also seen its U.S sales fall along with its financial fortunes .
It sold close to 1 in 3 cars purchased in the United States as recently as 1995 .
In the first eight months of 2007 , its market share had fallen to less than 1 in 4 vehicles , or the loss of close to 10 percent of the market .
For his part , union boss Gettelfinger did not dismiss the notion that GM was in trouble .
But he said there is only so much the union can do to stem losses at GM facilities .
" Obviously we 're very concerned about this company , " he said .
" I remind everyone we 've done a lot of things to help that company .
But there comes a point in time we have to draw a line in the sand . "
While the strike hit GM plants and facilities , it does not affect the two other automakers whose workers are represented by the UAW , Ford Motor ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) or Chrysler LLC , which between them have more than 100,000 UAW still on the job .
Members at those companies have been working under their own contract extensions as the union concentrated on reaching a deal with GM .
UAW strikers : Worried , but firm
A key to the contract talks is GM 's goal of shifting an estimated $ 51 billion in future healthcare costs for retirees and their family members to union - controlled trust funds .
GM has more than 340,000 retirees and surviving spouses receiving such benefits today .
Shifting those costs is seen as a key to GM efforts to close its cost gap with nonunion automakers , such as Toyota Motor ( Charts ) and Honda Motor ( Charts ) .
Ford and Chrysler combined are facing nearly $ 50 billion of retiree healthcare costs as well .
Gettelfinger disclosed that two years ago the union proposed setting up the kinds of trust funds , known by the accounting short - hand of VEBAs , that are now being sought by the company .
Instead the company and union negotiated a less dramatic manner to limit the cost of retiree healthcare for the company .
He said that if the company had taken the union 's proposal at that time , it could have saved $ 1,000 per vehicle .
" They did raise the VEBA [ in current talks ] and we were more than eager to discuss it , " Gettelfinger said .
" Let me be very clear on this point - this strike is not about the VEBA in any way , shape or form . "
Shares of Dow component GM ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) closed down just 20 cents Monday , although that 's well off of the 2.6 percent gain they were showing before the strike started .
Most analysts have said that although a long strike at General Motors would be a crippling blow for the automaker 's efforts to return its North American operations to profitability , the automaker is probably in a relatively good position to weather a short strike .
David Healy , analyst with Burnham Securities , said he believes GM could take a strike of up to a month without a significant problem .
" It 's sort of an odd thing , the first thing that happens with an automaker in case of a strike is their cash increases , as their payroll stops , and they still keep collecting cash for the cars that have been shipped , " said Healy .
He believes the two sides are close enough that the strike will be a short one .
" Days , not weeks or months , that would be my guess , " he said .
John Casesa , managing partner for New York auto consulting firm the Casesa Shapiro Group , also expects a short strike .
" I do n't think the strike is simply for appearances .
The UAW does n't take a strike lightly , " he said .
" I do think there were stumbling blocks at the last minute .
But given [ Gettelfinger 's comments about a trust fund ] , that 's why I think they will eventually reach an agreement .
This has been a topic of discussion around the union and GM for a couple of years . "
Casesa said that it 's possible that the strike could even make it easier for the union leadership to eventually win rank - and - file approval of any deal that is reached , which is necessary for a contract to be ratified .
" I think a short strike has the effect of sending a message to the more aggressive parts of the union that leadership is fighting for every dollar , " said Casesa .
" If it takes a couple of days strike to get the landmark agreement the two sides are talking about , that 's a pretty small cost to pay . "
Standard & Poor's , which has given junk bond status to GM 's credit rating for more than two years , said it does not intend to further downgrade the company 's debt unless the strike stretches on longer than what it expects to be " a brief and largely symbolic period . "
But if the strike is longer than expected and causes more serious problems for GM 's finances , it wo n't be alone in feeling the pain .
In that case , the credit agency said that the ratings of certain GM suppliers would also be at risk of a downgrade .
The strike is the nation 's largest since 87,000 workers at Verizon Communications ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) walked off the job in August 2000 , but that action did not shut down the company .
GM was last hit by a strike at its Flint , Mich. , locals in 1998 , a work stoppage by only 9,200 workers that was felt across most of GM's North American operations for 54 days since they could n't get the parts they needed to keep making cars and trucks .
The last true national strike against GM came in 1970 , which lasted 69 days .
The last strike by more than 70,000 workers that shut down a company 's operations was the 1997 strike by 185,000 Teamsters at United Parcel Service .

A vital molecule for resistance to food allergy has been identified and offers a potential target for therapy .
There is currently no way to treat food allergy and the only way for sufferers to manage the problem is to avoid certain foods and make sure they have injectable adrenaline at hand .
Scientists led by Dr Claudio Nicoletti at the Institute of Food Research in Norwich have found that a molecule called Interleukin - 12 ( IL - 12 ) is absent during allergic responses .
Dr Nicoletti suggests that by delivering an allergen in the presence of IL - 12 , allergic reactions could be brought back under control .
" A food protein can be perfectly harmless to one person and lethal to another , said Dr Nicoletti .
" We have identified the missing molecule that normally keeps immune responses under control and appropriate . "
Having a food allergy means that the immune system responds to a food protein as if it was harmful .
The immune system produces immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) antibodies , which normally help the body fight parasites .
In the most severe cases individuals can suffer life - threatening reactions , including anaphylactic shock .
In previous research , Dr Nicoletti found that special types of white blood cells called dendritic cells are important in helping the immune system decide on how to respond to foreign molecules .
In the latest research , Dr Nicoletti compared the activity of dendritic cells in the gut and in the spleen of allergic and allergy resistant mice .
He found that in the gut of susceptible mice , dendritic cells have stopped producing IL - 12 .
This research was carried out in collaboration with the University of Siena .
" We have identified a molecule that is very important for the regulation of immune response and for the first time clearly represents a potential target for the therapy of allergy .
This is currently under investigation " , said Dr Nicoletti .
David Reading , director of the Anaphylaxis Campaign , said : " Food allergy can place an extremely heavy burden on the families affected .
We welcome this research and look forward to further developments . "
" Production of IL - 12 by Peyer 's patch - dendritic cells is critical for the resistance to food allergy " will be published online by the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology on Monday 2nd July 2007

MOSCOW , May 18 —
The police detained more than a dozen opposition leaders and journalists here on Friday , preventing them from flying to a provincial city to take part in anti-Kremlin protests .
The action followed a wave of harassment of the protest ’s organizers .
The detentions added a new element of frostiness to President Vladimir V. Putin ’s meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and other leaders of the European Union near the provincial city , Samara .
“ Speaking frankly , I would like that those who today want to hold a demonstration in Samara would be able to express their opinion and have the chance to do so , ” Ms. Merkel said , displaying a willingness to criticize the Russian leader far more openly than her predecessor , Gerhard Schröder .
Among those detained at a Moscow airport was Garry Kasparov , the former chess champion , who was on his way to the latest in a series of protests organized by Other Russia , a protest group he leads .
Chinese toothpaste has been at the centre of contamination scares
The worst problems were found in canned fruit , dried fish and fruit drinks , a food inspectors ' report said .
China has pledged to take action to improve its food and drug industry after a series of safety scares aroused domestic and global concern .
The US has already banned or issued warnings over several goods from China , including seafood and toothpaste .
' Quality improving '
A wide - range of products , from food and consumer goods to fertilisers and farm machinery , were tested in the first half of this year , China 's General Administration of Quality Supervision , Inspection and Quarantine said in its report .
Of the goods tested , 19.1 % were found to be below standard .
Many of the food products had been contaminated by toxins or bacteria , or failed to carry the required labelling information , the report said .
The inspectors attempted to throw a positive light on the findings - saying that 80.9 % of products had successfully passed the tests , and that quality was improving .
The inspections did not cover exported products that have caused a number of scandals this year , particularly in the US .
The problems first came to light after the deaths of dogs and cats in the US earlier in 2007 .
Melamine found in wheat gluten exports from China for use in pet food was blamed , and at least 100 pet food brands were recalled .
Since then , the US Food and Agriculture department has also raised concerns about seafood products , toothpaste and the paint used in toy trains from China .
Letting my inner geek out
The nation 's top spook Michael McConnell told El Paso Times reporter Chris Roberts last week that debating the nation 's spy laws in public means " some Americans are going to die " and that companies being sued for helping the government spy on Americans did help the government , an admission that Bush Administration lawyers have repeatedly told courts was a secret that could put Americans at risk .
The astounding interview was published on Wednesday .
The companies being sued for helping with the government 's warrantless wiretapping program , which include AT&T , Bellsouth , and Verizon , did indeed assist the program since the NSA obviously needed help to wiretap , McConnell said .
The companies need retroactive immunity or they will face bankruptcy from the lawsuits , he added .
That 's an astonishing admission , given that the administration and the telecoms have long argued that confirming or denying the telcos ' participation would damage national security and put Americans ' lives at risk .
Now the second part of the issue was under the president 's program , the terrorist surveillance program , the private sector had assisted us .
Because if you 're going to get access you 've got to have a partner and they were being sued .
Now if you play out the suits at the value they 're claimed , it would bankrupt these companies .
So my position was we have to provide liability protection to these private sector entities .
Just last week , Justice Department lawyers told the 9th Circuit Appeals Court that such information was a state secret and AT&T attorney Michael Kellogg told the court : " The government has said that whatever AT&T is doing with the government is a state secret .
As a consequence , no evidence can come in whether the individuals ' communications were ever accepted or whether we played any role in it . "
McConnell further revealed that the first judge at government 's secret spying court who looked at the previously warrantless Terrorist Surveillance Program in early 2007 approved the whole program .
But the second judge who looked at the program struck down the NSA 's interception of communications inside the United States .
The government got a stay until May 31 , then pressed Congress to pass the Protect America Act of 2007 , which greatly expanded the NSA 's authority to install wiretapping outposts and backdoors in the U.S. 's communication architecture .
Furthermore , while the NSA keeps tabs on thousands of foreigners , it targets fewer than 100 hundred Americans at a time , McConnell said .
McConnell struck a less reassuring note when he told the reporter that terrorists are crossing the Southwest border between the U.S. and Mexico , including a " significant number " of Iraqis smuggled in .

A study of my own , and a growing body of research in psychology and political science , show that the political brain is an emotional brain .
It is not a dispassionate calculating machine , objectively searching for the right facts , figures , and policies to make a reasoned decision .
The reality is that our brains are vast networks of neurons ( nerve cells ) that work together to generate our experience of the world .
Of particular importance are networks of associations , bundles of thoughts , feelings , images and ideas that have become connected over time .
Just how important networks are in understanding why candidates win and lose can be seen by contrasting two political advertisements : the first from Bill Clinton 's campaign for the presidency in 1992 , and the second from John Kerry 's in 2004 .
Both men were running against an increasingly unpopular incumbent named Bush .
Both ads were , for each man , his chance to introduce himself to the general electorate following the Democratic primary campaign and to tell the story he wanted to tell about himself to the American people .
And both were a microcosm of the entire campaign .
The two ads seem very similar in their " surface structure " .
But looks can be deceiving .
A clinical dissection of these ads makes clear that they could n't have been more different in the networks they activated and the emotions they elicited .
Clinton 's ad was deceptively simple , narrated exclusively ( and with exquisitely moving emotion ) by the young Arkansas governor .
In the background was music evocative of small - town America , along with images and video clips that underscored the message .
Bill Clinton : " I was born in a little town called Hope , Arkansas [ image of a small - town train station , with the name " Hope " on a small white sign against a brick background ] , three months after my father died .
I remember that old two - storey house where I lived with my grandparents .
They had very limited incomes .
It was in 1963 [ video clip of John F Kennedy , looking presidential , coming up to a podium ] that I went to Washington and met President Kennedy at the Boy 's Nation programme [ video of the young Clinton and the youthful President Kennedy shaking hands ] .
And I remember [ living - room video of a now adult Clinton , starry eyed and nostalgic thinking about the encounter with a man who was obviously his hero ] just , uh , thinking what an incredible country this was , that somebody like me , you know , who had no money or anything , would be given the opportunity to meet the president [ photo of their hands clasped , slowly and gradually expanding to show the connection between the two men ] .
" That 's when I decided I could really do public service , because I cared so much about people .
I worked my way through law school with part - time jobs - anything I could find .
After I graduated , I really did n't care about making a lot of money [ photos of poor and working - class houses in Arkansas ] .
I just wanted to go home and see if I could make a difference [ photo of the young governor - elect raising his right hand to take the oath of office as governor of Arkansas ] .
" We 've worked hard in education and healthcare [ video clips of Clinton with children in a classroom , being hugged by a woman in her 70s or 80s , and talking with workers ] to create jobs , and we 've made real progress [ photo of the governor hard at work late at night in his office ] .
Now it 's exhilarating to me to think that as president I could help to change all our people 's lives for the better [ video of Clinton obviously at ease with a smiling young girl in his arms ] and bring hope back to the American dream . "
If you dissect this ad , you can readily see why it was one of the most effective television commercials in the history of American politics .
Bill Clinton never shied away from policy debates , but this ad was not about policy .
Its sole purpose was to begin creating a set of positive associations with him and a narrative about the Man from Hope - framed , from start to finish , in terms of hope and the American dream .
In his first sentence , Clinton vividly conveyed where he was coming from , literally and metaphorically - from a place of Hope .
But he was not content to do this just with words .
The ad created in viewers a vivid , multisensory network of associations - associations not just with the word hope but to the image of Hope in small - town America in an era gone by , captured by the image of the train station , and the sound of hope , captured in his voice .
Clinton told his own life story , but he told it as a parable of what anyone can accomplish if just given the chance .
He tied the theme of hope to the well - established theme of the American dream , presenting himself not as a man of privilege descending ( or condescending ) to help those less fortunate , but as someone no different from anyone else , who grew up on Main Street in any town - indeed , as someone who had suffered more adversity than most , having been born after his own father 's death .
The theme of hope was reinforced by the final image of a young child , representing our collective hope for the future , and the hope of every parent .
Although you can't get much more " hopeful " than that , the final line of the ad actually included a subtle allusion to the Bush economy ( " bring hope back to the American dream " , implying that it had been lost ) , with an implicit negative message most voters would likely register only unconsciously .
The association with President Kennedy was instrumental to the emotional appeal of the ad .
Kennedy was an American icon , whose brief tenure in the White House is widely remembered as a time in which America 's hopes soared along with its space programme .
Careful dissection of the sequence of visual images shows how brilliantly the ad was crafted .
The sequence began with Kennedy by himself , looking young , vibrant , serious and presidential - precisely the features the Clinton campaign wanted to associate with Clinton .
Then came the video of a young Bill Clinton shaking hands with Kennedy , dramatically bringing the theme of the American dream to viewers ' eyes - a poor boy from Arkansas without a father finding himself in the presence of his hero - while creating a sense of something uncanny , of " fate " , of the chance meeting of once and future presidents that seemed too accidental not to be preordained .
Then came a still photo of their hands tightly clasped , emphasising the connection between the two men .
This image lasted far longer than any other in the ad and gradually expanded until the two hands panned out into an image of the two recognisable figures .
Clearly , a central goal of the ad was to establish Clinton as presidential , particularly in light of the rumours about his sexual escapades during the bruising primary season ( which may actually have been turned to his advantage through the associations with Kennedy , who himself was linked with tales of infidelities but was none the less revered ) .
In a race against an incumbent president , who needed only to stand in front of a podium with the seal of the presidency to appear presidential , the Clinton ad seized every opportunity to show what Bill Clinton would look like as president , with the image of him raising his right hand to accept the oath of office ( as governor of Arkansas , but from a visual point of view , literally showing what Clinton would look like in his swearing - in ceremony as president ) followed by a photo of him working tirelessly at his desk , signing bills ( itself reminiscent of photos of Kennedy ) .
I do not know how much of this was consciously intended by Clinton and his consultants .
I suspect that much of it was , although some of the emotional overtones and sequencing of images might well have simply reflected Clinton 's extraordinary emotional intelligence and gut - level , implicit political horse sense .
Like Clinton 's " Hope " ad , the first television advertisement run by the John Kerry campaign in the general election , in early May 2004 , attempted to begin painting a picture - to tell a story - about John Kerry , the man and the potential president :
John Kerry [ patriotic music , with prominent brass ] : " I was born in Fitzsimmons Army Hospital in Colorado [ initial video of candidate speaking , which returns throughout the ad ] .
My dad was serving in the Army Air Corps .
Both of my parents taught me about public service [ photos of the candidate 's parents ] .
I enlisted because I believed in service to country [ photo of the young soldier with his comrades in arms ] .
I thought it was important , if you had a lot of privileges as I had had , to go to a great university like Yale , to give something back to your country [ video footage of a soldier , presumably Kerry , walking in the jungles of Vietnam ] . "
Del Sandusky : " The decisions that he made saved our lives . "
Jim Rassman : " When he pulled me out of the river , he risked his life to save mine . "
Announcer : " For more than 30 years , John Kerry has served America [ photo of Kerry talking on the phone , with glasses hanging off his face ] . "
Vanessa Kerry : " If you look at my father 's time in service to this country , whether it's as a veteran [ photo of war service ] , prosecutor [ photo of Kerry pointing toward a window in a setting that looks like a courtroom , which zooms quickly in to Kerry ] , or senator , he has shown an ability to fight for things that matter . "
Teresa Heinz - Kerry [ Kerry 's wife ] : " John is the face of someone who 's hopeful [ photo of the two , possibly as newlyweds , with Kerry smiling broadly ] , who 's generous of spirit and of heart . "
John Kerry : " We 're a country of optimists .
We 're the can - do people .
And we just need to believe in ourselves again [ video of Kerry speaking again , followed by video of profile of Kerry waving in some political event ] . "
Announcer : " A lifetime of service and strength .
John Kerry for president . "
On the surface , the differences between this ad and Clinton 's may be difficult to detect .
Both begin with the candidate using his birthplace to drive home a central theme .
For Kerry , the central theme was that he was born and bred in uniform , a theme central to a campaign trying to unseat an incumbent , George W Bush , widely seen as a strong leader in a perpetual " war on terror " .
The ad began with moving , patriotic music that continued throughout , with an emphasis on muted brass tones , congruent with the military theme , and conveying both strength and majesty - precisely the tone Kerry needed to convey .
The most moving moments of the ad came as Kerry 's fellow soldiers told , with genuine emotion in their voices , how he had saved their lives .
But that is where the similarity with the Clinton ad ends .
After Kerry 's opening paragraph , in which he told the American people in his own words who he was and what he wanted them to know about him , the rest of the ad did n't matter .
Kerry had already spent the first millions of his campaign dollars telling the story George W Bush wanted to tell about him , beginning to weave precisely the web of emotional associations in which the Bush campaign hoped to ensnare him : that he was not only privileged ( a word Kerry , who was married to an heiress , introduced himself ) , but a north - eastern liberal intellectual .
The fact that he was from Massachusetts was well known - the Republicans were already emphasising that he was " Ted Kennedy 's junior senator " - and the phrase " Massachusetts liberal " had become so successfully branded by the Republicans in the 1988 Bush - Dukakis campaign that either word readily evoked the other .
When Kerry added the reference to Yale , he fully activated the primary network that the conservative movement has worked for so many years to stamp into the American psyche to galvanise disdain and resentment toward Democrats : the liberal elite .
Put together Massachusetts , liberal senator and Yale , and you have virtually the whole network activated .
The only thing missing was a windsurfing outfit .
That came later .
Whatever its intended goal , that first paragraph of the Kerry ad served to convey one primary message that would stick in the neural networks of voters for the remainder of the election : this guy is n't like me .
The references to Yale and privilege were the most glaring mistakes in that ad , but they were not the only ones .
Perhaps most importantly , the ad did not , like Clinton 's , tell a coherent story .
Try to summarise it using the narrative structure of a good storyteller , and you 'll see the problem .
In fact , it told two stories .
The second had nothing to do with the first , and seemed as if it had come straight from the head of a consultant rather from the heart of the candidate .
The first story , " John Kerry was born on a military base , served his country heroically because he believed it was his duty , fought bad guys as a prosecutor , and would be a strong commander - in - chief " , was clear and effective .
Then the ad introduced two related themes , using words associatively linked to military strength ( service and fighting ) , which created two distracting subplots : one about a lifetime of service ( not the same thing as being heroic in the face of attack ) , the other about fighting for things that matter ( intended , I suspect , to smuggle in a populist theme under the banner of strength ) .
Whereas the Clinton ad wove together and created an emotionally powerful network , the subthemes in the Kerry ad drew on existing associative links ( the words military , service and fighting ) but actually took them in diverging directions , essentially dismantling a network whose activation was the central goal of the ad .
Two - thirds of the way through the commercial , the plot shifted , with Teresa Heinz - Kerry introducing the theme of optimism .
The insertion of this non sequitur no doubt reflected his consultants ' belief that optimism is a " winner " for presidential candidates .
The optimism theme seemed grafted on to both the message and the candidate .
Finally , the use of imagery in the Kerry ad stands in stark contrast to its effective use in the Clinton ad .
The scenes of Vietnam , and particularly the faces and intonation of the men who served with Kerry , painted a clear and moving portrait of Kerry as a man and a potential leader .
But after that , it seemed as if someone had just hastily rummaged through the Kerry family scrapbook .
The photo of Kerry " serving " conveyed nothing about him , other than perhaps that he needed bifocals .
And the image used to illustrate his service as a prosecutor and then as a senator was difficult even to decipher .
The difference between the Clinton ad and the Kerry ad - like the difference between the Clinton campaign and virtually every other Democratic presidential campaign of the last three decades - reflects the difference between understanding and misunderstanding mind , brain and emotion in American politics .
If you think the failure to tell a coherent story , or to illustrate your words with evocative images , is just the " window dressing " of a campaign and makes little difference in the success or failure of a candidacy , you 're missing something very important about the political brain .
Political persuasion is about networks and narratives .
We can hear the whirring of the dispassionate mind in the following exchange on Medicare , which occurred during the first presidential debate between Gore and Bush in 2000 :
Gore : " Under the governor 's plan , if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare , your premiums would go up by between 18 % and 47 % , and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he 's modelled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries .
Let me give you one quick example .
There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee .
He 's 70 years old , has high blood pressure , his wife has heart trouble .
They have an income of $ 25,000 a year .
They can't pay for their prescription drugs .
They 're some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs .
Under my plan , half of their costs would be paid right away .
Under Governor
Bush 's plan , they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage , but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions . "
Bush : " I can not let this go by , the old - style Washington politics , if we 're going to scare you in the voting booth .
Under my plan , the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs .
It 's called Immediate Helping Hand .
Instead of squabbling and finger - pointing , he gets immediate help .
Let me say something . "
Moderator ( Jim Lehrer , PBS ) : " You 're -"
Gore : " They get $ 25,000 a year income : that makes them ineligible . "
Bush : " Look , this is a man who has great numbers .
He talks about numbers .
I 'm beginning to think not only did he invent the internet , but he invented the calculator .
It 's fuzzy math . "
Now let 's take a " clinical " look at this interchange .
Note the expected utility model underlying Gore 's approach .
He saw his job as to convince the average senior citizen or ageing worker that Bush 's plan would have a lower utility value than his own .
Now there 's nothing wrong with comparing and contrasting plans , although Gore 's appeal would have been far more effective if he had simply reversed the order , reeling voters in with a personal story and then hooking them with a contrast between his plan and Bush's .
And from the standpoint of the dispassionate mind , Bush clearly had few answers to Gore 's charges , other than to play the Washington outsider and mumble some platitudes about helping hands .
After eight years as vice - president and months campaigning against George Bush , Gore clearly knew everything he needed to know about every " issue " in the campaign .
The last thing he needed was a debate coach to quiz him on facts and figures .
Yet precisely this kind of debate preparation set him up for the most memorable ( and , for Gore , the most destructive ) moment of the debate : Bush 's line about Gore claiming to invent the calculator .
Bush delivered this barbed one - liner with an affable style that stood in stark juxtaposition to Gore 's nonverbal dismissiveness of Bush 's arguments ( and , by extension , of his intellect ) .
The line was unfair , but the Gore team handed it to him , by attending to the facts and figures rather than to the stories Bush had been telling the public about Gore .
Instead of getting voters to feel the difference between his concern for the welfare of seniors struggling to pay their medical bills and Bush 's , Gore went to a level of numerical precision - premised on a model of expected utility , giving them every number they needed to make the appropriate calculations - that played right into Bush 's strategy of portraying Gore as an emotionless policy wonk , " not a regular guy , like us " .
Gore 's statement , " Your premiums would go up by between 18 % and 47 % , and that is the study of the congressional plan that he 's modelled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries , " may well have been accurate , and in rational terms , Gore had given Bush a beating .
But in emotional terms , both the presentation of exact numbers ( as opposed to " your premiums would go up by about a third " ) and the mention of actuaries undercut the story Gore most needed to tell the American people : that he cared about that 70 - year - old man , and he would do something about it .
Instead , his exacting reference to numbers and actuaries reinforced the story Bush wanted to tell about him : " Look , I 'm like you , I do n't care about all this fancy math .
I care about people .
They 're just statistics to him . "
In that single line about inventing the calculator , Bush killed three birds with one stone .
He established himself as a guy with a sense of humour who would likely be fun to have around for the next four years .
He reiterated themes about Gore 's hubris and lack of trustworthiness that struck at the heart of his character .
And most importantly , he disarmed Gore for the remaining debates - and the rest of the election - of the value of data .
From that point forward , all references to numbers were just " fuzzy math " .
It did n't help , of course , that the media did their postmodernism routine , turning Gore 's claims about Bush 's Medicare plan and tax cuts - which both turned out to be true - into a he said / she said contest of competing claims to a truth that somehow could n't be adjudicated .
But it is the job of a campaign to get the media to convey its message , rather than the opponent 's message , and in the past 30 years , with the exception of the Clinton years , Republicans have consistently outflanked Democrats in these manoeuvres , using the same emotional skill they have demonstrated with the electorate .

Want Your Kid to Disappear ?

Want Your Kid to Disappear ?
For $ 1,800 , former Atlanta police officer Rick Strawn will make that problem child someone else 's problem .
He even makes house calls .
By Nadya Labi
Louis Boussard has hired a professional to abduct his son .
On a late evening in early March , Rick Strawn of Strawn Support Services flew from Atlanta to Tampa , Fla .
He rented a Ford Taurus with child - safety locks from Avis and set off for the coastal town of St. Petersburg with his assistant , Joshua Dalton , and me .
An hour later , we were driving down a street filled with one - story homes .
We slowed down outside a house with an American flag hanging from the eaves and a Jaguar and a Grand Cherokee in the semicircular driveway .
It was 1:55 a.m. , which meant we were early .
Strawn parked in a nearby lot to kill time .
He went over the plan , emphasizing , " We 've got to leave by 3:15 . "
Flicking on the lights to look for Boussard 's number , Strawn dialed his cellphone .
" Um , Louis .
Hi .
Does your house have a circle driveway with a Jag in it ? " he said .
" If you 're ready , we 'll come on in .
Is he asleep ? "
The connection broke up .
Moments later , Strawn 's phone rang .
" Much better , yes .
No , do n't wake him up .
We 're going to talk to you for about an hour , " he said .
" I 'm going to help you through all that .
Okay .
Bye - bye . "
We drove back to the house at a crawl and got out of the car , easing the doors shut .
Both men wore khaki pants and dark blue shirts embossed with a globe logo and the website address of Strawn 's company .
Strawn walked up the stone pathway , peered in the window of the front door , and lightly rapped .
No one answered .
" Maybe he said go around the back , " Strawn said .
" Wait here for a second . "
He began to walk toward the back of the house when a light came on inside .
A Haitian - American man in his late 40s opened the front door and beckoned us inside .
Boussard ( his name and the names of his wife and son have been changed ) guided us to a dining - room table covered by a white tablecloth .
It held a white vase filled with artificial pink flowers and two fat red candles in wrought iron stands .
The matching white cushions of the dining - room chairs were covered in plastic .
Boussard sat at the head of the table , flanked by his wife , Sandra .
In spite of the late hour , they were impeccably dressed he wore a beige linen suit and she wore a scoop - necked sweater set off by a gold necklace and bracelets .
The couple 's formality , however , soon gave way to the urgency of the task at hand .
Two rooms away on the other side of the kitchen , their 16 - year - old son , Louis , Jr. , lay asleep in his bedroom .
The Boussards had hired Strawn Support Services to transport Louis , Jr. to Casa by the Sea , a school near Ensenada , Mexico that seeks to " modify " the behavior of troublemaking teens .
Casa takes kids who parents have decided are out of control , usually because the teens are talking back , getting poor grades , staying out late , drinking , having sex too soon , or taking drugs .
Louis , Jr.'s parents had not told him that he was going to Mexiconor how he would be taken there .
They thought he would run if he knew what was about to happen .
Now they kept glancing in the direction of the kitchen .
" Louis is very suspicious , " Sandra whispered about her son as her husband began a hurried account of the teen 's misbehavior .
The troubles had begun a year earlier when Louis , Jr. was in 10th grade .
His grades fell from A's and B's to C's and below .
He stopped playing basketball with his father .
He started talking back when his mother would n't let him go out to clubs with his friends .
He broke his curfew , which was 7:30 p.m. during the week and 9 p.m. on the weekends .
Often he left the house by his bedroom window .
The Boussards thought Louis , Jr. might be smoking pot .
Then all of a sudden , his report cards improved dramatically .
" I thought , something is not right , " said Boussard , squinting at the memory .
He discovered a bad report card in his son's backpack , and Louis admitted that he had faked the good ones .
The Boussards enrolled their son in counseling ; the counselor said he was doing fine .
They sent him to boot camp for a day , where he got anger - management and drug counseling .
He behaved better for about a week .
At around the same time , Louis was told that he had to repeat 10th grade .
His parents transferred him to a vocational program in carpentry at his high school with the hope that he would find the schoolwork easier .
Louis hated it .
Strawn listened to this litany of frustrations , nodding sympathetically .
Then , he took a breath and started the spiel that he has honed over the course of six years and some 300 transports .
" Behavior is as addictive as any drug or alcohol , " he told the Boussards .
Like all troubled kids , Louis , Jr. needed to recover from his bad behavior .
" The way I look at it , " Strawn continued , " any good recovery has three components : breaking down old habits , building a strong foundation , and building new habits . "
But Boussard pére was not paying attention .
He was still steamed about the fake report cards .
" I said ' Something is not right , ' " he repeated .
There was a slight noise , and he and his wife jumped .
" Do we need to have Josh go outside ? "
Strawn asked , referring to his assistant .
" He 's very suspicious , " Sandra whispered , glancing over her shoulder toward her son 's room .
Strawn went outside to make sure that Louis had not climbed out of his bedroom window .
The teen seemed to be asleep , but Strawn left Dalton outside to stand guard .
On the air conditioner outside the window was a bottle of cologne , which Strawn guessed Louis used to freshen up before his nights out .
Strawn squeaked back into his chair and rushed through his usual script .
Now was not the moment to dwell on his own recovery from alcoholism , or to lead the prayer circle that he often suggests before a trip .
He ran through what his clients should expect when he entered Louis 's room .
Strawn advised them to introduce him to Louis , to give their son a hug if Louis let them , and then to walk away .
" The hardest thing I ask a parent to do is to turn around and walk out , " he said .
" Do n't come back , no matter what you see or hear . "
The mother and father nodded , shifting in their seats .
Boussard got a black overnight bag from a closet and handed it to Strawn , along with a check for $ 1,800 .
In return , Strawn asked him to sign a notarized power - of - attorney that authorized his company to take " any act or action " on the parents ' behalf during the transport to Casa .
The document also promised that the couple would not sue for any injuries caused by " reasonable restraint . "
Strawn warned them that he would take Louis away in handcuffs .
The father signed the release , then seemed to have a moment of buyer 's remorse .
He said he'd been obsessively reading the catalogue for Casa .
" All of a sudden , the intensity just takes off , " Boussard said about sending his son away .
" We feel like we failed . "
" Let me help you out there , " Strawn reassured him .
" I go to families all the time with four or five siblings .
Only one of them decided to take this path .
If it had anything to do with your parenting skills . . . "
His voice trailed off .
" It is n't because of that . "
" We do n't want to see him go to prison or jail , " said Boussard , rubbing his hands over his face again and again .
" Will he understand what we 're trying to do for him ? "
Boussard got up from the table with a sigh .
The rest of us followed close behind .
He walked into the kitchen and took a dinner knife out of a drawer , explaining that he would use it to pry open his son's locked door .
Sliding the knife into the crack between the door and the wall , he prepared to enter .
RICK STRAWN IS AN EX - COP WHO STARTED HIS COMPANY in 1988 to help police officers find off - duty work guarding construction sites .
Ten years later , he was asked by a member of his United Methodist church to transport the churchgoer 's son to Tranquility Bay in Jamaica .
The school is run by the World Wide Association of Specialty Programs , a company headquartered in Utah that owns eight schools in the United States and abroad , including Louis , Jr. 's destination .
Strawn said no to that first inquiry because he knew the boy involved .
But he had stumbled upon what he now believes is his calling .
In his first year of business , he escorted eight teens to behavior modification schools .
Since then , his company has transported more than 700 kids between the ages of 8 and 17 .
Strawn has gone on about half of the trips himself ; on the others he has sent agents .
Either way , the company generally uses two escorts for the part of a trip that 's on the road .
Girls are escorted by coed teams ; in the early years , Strawn relied on his wife , mother , or older daughter to help him on these trips .
Now his wife , Susan , runs the company 's office from the family home in the Atlanta suburb of Suwanee .
After every trip , she sends the client a card with the message : " Just a note to say thank you for allowing us to assist your family . "
Balding and slightly soft in the gut , Strawn is a reassuring 52 - year - old .
He speaks with a light drawlhe was born in Lubbock , Tex . and he seems to mean it when he drops endearments like " hon . "
Strawn 's easy manner has won over many parents and school administrators .
" He 's one of the few escorts who takes the time and effort to talk to the kids , " said Karina Zurita , the admissions coordinator at Casa .
" He lets kids know that they 'll be in good hands . "
But if Strawn is decent and likable , he will also go to almost any length to get his charges to do what their parents want .
He has chased kids down .
He has dragged teens to the car in their underwear .
He has used a choke hold , learned as a cop , to render a few others unconscious .
He has taken suicidal kids from hospital treatment to reform school .
Most of Strawn 's clients are genuinely concerned about their children 's welfare .
They believe their children are at risk and want to save them .
But these parents also revel in forcing their kids to sit up , pay attention , and do what they 're told .
Glenda Spaulding , who took out four loans to send her 14 - year - old daughter to a WWASP school in South Carolina last November , had three words for Strawn before he took the girl away : " Go get her . "
Strawn 's willingness to use force differentiates him from other escorts .
While no one tracks the teen transport industry , those in the business estimate that more than 20 companies nationwide take kids to behavior modification schools , residential treatment centers , and boot camps .
Some of the bigger companies are more selective than Strawn about what they 'll do .
The Center for Safe Youth in Atlanta , for example , does n't use restraints to force a child to go anywhere .
And the center wo n't transport kids to WWASP schools because educational consultants with whom the company works do n't recommend them .
Its owner , John Villines , would like to create a professional association to oversee the transport industry .
The standards he proposes are rudimentary : no agents with felony convictions or histories of irresponsible driving or drug and alcohol abuse .
But they set the bar higher than almost any state does .
Instead of operating by rules , the escort industry runs on trust the trust that parents wo n't put their kids in harm 's way .
But there is no trust between parents and kids in the households that Strawn enters .
It has broken down so completely that parents think it 's okay , and even courageous , to send a stranger into their child 's bedroom .
Strawn makes his living from that judgment and he is willing to mislead a child for what he sees as the greater goal of reform .
Once parents put their kids at Strawn 's mercy , for a short time he is in loco parentis in the place of the parent in the fullest sense of the term .
He has the authority to tell a kid what to do and to punish him for failing to obey .
At the same time , he is the only person left to cling to when a kid is on the threshold of a scary , unknown world .
Three years ago , Strawn escorted Valerie Ann Heron , a 17 - year - old from Montgomery , Ala. , to Tranquility Bay .
The school is the most hardcore in the WWASP system , the one to which students are sent when they repeatedly cause trouble at other schools .
The trip went smoothly , according to Heron 's mother , Nell Orange , and Strawn played his role well .
" He made her feel comfortable with him .
She trusted him .
He talked to her about what to expect , where she was going , " Orange said .
" She gave him a hug when she left him . "
The day after that hug , Valerie rushed out of a second - floor classroom and jumped to her death off a 35 - foot - high balcony .
The suicide did n't faze Strawn .
He did n't ask himself whether he should have taken Valerie to Tranquility Bay and left her there , or whether she needed more help and tenderness than the tough - love school provides .
He does n't even acknowledge that she might have been upset or unhinged enough to kill herself .
" We had a really good trip .
We were laughing and cutting it up , " Strawn recalled .
" Was she suicidal ?
Till the day I die , I wo n't believe that . "
Without any evidence , Strawn says that Valerie must have jumped in an effort to run away or in hopes of hurting herself so that she would be sent home .
She landed on her head instead of her feet , he thinks , because one foot got caught in the balcony .
" My feeling is that the majority of kids who talk about suicide , they 're not suicidal , " Strawn said .
" What they are is manipulative . "
LOUIS , JR .
SAT STRAIGHT UP IN HIS BED .
He was surrounded by three strangers and his parents .
His chest was bare , and white acne medicine stood out against the dark skin of his forehead .
He grabbed his wire - rimmed glasses from the bedside table and blinked a few times .
The basketball posters of Tracy McGrady and Kobe Bryant were still there .
His childhood teddy bear sat in a low - slung armchair by the door .
" Do you have some underwear on ? " Louis 's father said .
" They 're here to help us .
They 're here to take you to a school . "
Louis shook his head to clear it .
" The only thing we want you to know is that we love you very much , " Boussard continued .
He and his wife stepped forward to hug Louis , but the gesture was forced and none of them seemed to want the contact .
" Where am I going ?
When am I coming home ? "
Louis 's parents walked out the door .
Strawn broke the silence that followed their exit .
He launched into what he calls " the scenario , " a three - minute script that he instructs his employees to memorize and deliver , right down to a required chuckle .
" Personally , I feel like I do it better than anyone else because I designed it , " Strawn had explained earlier .
The scenario is the key to a smooth escort , he believes .
It gives teens time to cool off , weigh their options , and realize that their best course of action is to follow orders .
" I want you to know that we are not here to be bad guys and bullies .
We are not here to lecture you , or right - or - wrong you to death , " Strawn told Louis .
" We are here to get you safely to the school and we are going to do that .
But we 'll absolutely give you as much respect as you allow us to give you . "
Louis stared at him and drummed his leg against the bed .
" Quite frankly , cuffs do not embarrass us , " Strawn continued .
" But if it goes there , it will be 100 percent your choice . "
He concluded with the question that the scenario is designed to set up .
" I have an important question for you .
If you walk out of here cuffed , do you understand that it 's 100 percent your choice ? "
" Uh - huh , " Louis said .
He looked around the room .
His mind was working but coming up empty .
He asked if he could grab his clothes .
The answer was no .
Instead he was allowed to direct Dalton to hand him a gray t- shirt , a black - and - gray Fubu jersey , and black mesh gym shorts .
" Am I coming home today ? " Louis was trying not to cry .
He blinked rapidly behind the smudged lenses of his glasses .
" I will not lie to you , " Strawn hedged .
" I might not answer your questions . . . "
" So when am I coming home ? "
" I mean no disrespect , but I learned a long time ago that I do n't want to chase you , " Strawn plowed on , ignoring Louis 's question .
He explained that he would handcuff Louis to Dalton .
" And son , if you can drag this ugly sucker far and fast enough to get away , well , God bless you , you were n't meant to go . "
Strawn gave the scripted chuckle .
Louis was still trying to buy time and find a way out .
" Can I brush my teeth ? " he asked .
Strawn shook his head , and cuffed Louis to Dalton .
Strawn wrote his script to give his charges the illusion of control , but he often cuffs the kids , especially boys , no matter what they say .
He hustled Louis to the car , guiding him into the back seat along with Dalton , to whom he was still cuffed .
Taking the wheel , Strawn explained to his passenger that he would stop talking 
" I consider it disrespectful to talk to you in the rearview mirror , " he said until he reached the airport .
At the mention of an airport , Louis said , " Oh , God . "
When we arrived at the Tampa airport half an hour later , Strawn took off Louis 's handcuffs .
As we walked to catch our connecting flight to Atlanta , Dalton grabbed the waistband of the boy 's shorts , which rode low on his hips and might have fallen off if Dalton had n't held fast .
The teen rolled his eyes and cracked a piece of gum that Dalton had given him .
He was auditioning for the part of bad boy , but the role did n't fit .
He was too quick to say " Thank you " and too eager to talk .
He had spent the past year bottling those impulses around his parents and chafing at the limits they had set for him .
His abduction struck him as the latest outrage .
" I do n't listen to them , I do n't like what they say , " he said .
" I do n't listen to the curfew .
I 'm not doing that .
It 's too early . "
When his parents bore down , Louis pushed back .
He hung out with a crowd they did n't like and he drank and smoked pot .
" I came home high once .
My father said , ' I know you 're high , ' " Louis remembered .
" Then I went to a one - day boot camp last August .
You exercise and they talk to you .
I came home high again and he sent me to this juvenile rehab thing that lasted two and a half days .
It was pointless . "
THERE COMES A POINT IN JUST ABOUT EVERY ONE OF STRAWN'S TRANSPORTS , whether he 's soothing a nervous parent or bonding with an upset teen , when he will mention his six - month stint in 1997 at a halfway house for alcoholics .
" Seven years ago , I entered recovery .
My drug of choice was alcohol .
You know far more about where you 're going than I knew about myself , " he told the 14 - year - old girl he escorted last November to a WWASP school in South Carolina .
" In my mind , I was kicking and screaming .
But the loveliest day of my life was when my wife and mom dropped me off at that halfway house .
I can tell you now that it 's the best thing that ever happened to me . "
That 's Strawn 's version of the story , which starts a generation earlier .
Strawn joined the Atlanta police force in 1973 .
He 'd previously been in sales , but he knew that being a cop would suit him better .
" In sales , the customer is always right , " he explained .
" But as a cop , I 'm always right . "
Strawn relished that authority .
" It seems at times he has to have the last word , " one of his supervisors noted in an evaluation early in his police career .
That 's a good thing in a cop , and the reviews Strawn received during this period were uniformly favorable .
Strawn worked many different beats , including patrol , drug enforcement , and homicide .
He earned the respect of his colleagues for calming down troublemakers .
" They have to think that you might be the toughest guy , " he said of the suspects he arrested .
" I was able to talk people into doing what we wanted them to do . "
Strawn was losing control of his own life , however .
He was drinking heavily and in 1992 he was briefly suspended for disappearing from work without explanation .
Strawn said that he stayed sober on the job , but the smell of alcohol seeped from his pores .
His colleagues complained .
Internal Affairs investigated .
Strawn tested clean .
Four years earlier , Strawn had married Susan Kyzer , a single mother with a young daughter .
Strawn did n't get along with the girl .
She had attention - deficit disorder and the Ritalin she took wore off by the time she got home from school .
" Her behavior was like a needle point with Rick , " Susan said .
" He was of the view that kids should be seen but not heard , and this kid was always heard . "
In 1996 , the stepdaughter told a counselor that Strawn had molested her two years earlier , when she was 12 .
She 'd just gotten home from a school football game , and she was still wearing her green - and - white cheerleader 's outfit .
She fell asleep on the living - room floor while watching TV with her stepfather .
She said that she woke to the feel of something hard against her vagina and ran out of the room .
Strawn was arrested for molestation .
During the police investigation , he claimed that he'd fallen asleep after drinking , and in his dreams had confused his stepdaughter with his wife .
But Susan told the investigators that just after the incident , Strawn had told her that " 'it was just a weak moment . ' . . .
He got turned on by her laying there with a short skirt on and all , and lay down beside her and unzipped his pants against her . "
Strawn grew depressed and began taking medication .
He also admitted to detectives that a year earlier he had fondled the breasts of his niece on two separate occasions , when she was 12 or 13 .
The Atlanta police department suspended him for several months .
But Strawn 's stepdaughter recanted her accusation , leaving prosecutors little choice but to drop the molestation charge .
Strawn was taken out of the field , however , and assigned to do desk work .
He was no longer the go - to officer .
" I was being tolerated , " he said .
" And for someone with my personality , being tolerated is enough to make you want to get drunk . "
One night in January 1997 , Strawn went home drunk .
After arguing with Susan , he said he was going to shoot himself and he got his .38 revolver out of the garage .
" I 've had all I can take , " he told Susan , his stepdaughter , and the couple 's 8 - year - old son , Jared .
But his threat was , to use his word , manipulation .
He fired into the air and left .
When he returned home later that evening , he passed out .
The next day , Susan confronted Strawn about his alcoholism , as she had many times in the past .
His stepdaughter chimed in that she had snapped a picture of Strawn in his stupor the previous night so that he could see what he'd looked like drunk .
Strawn wanted to destroy the roll of film but Susan and her daughter would n't let him , because it included a photo of the family cat , which had since died .
A struggle ensued , and Strawn kicked the girl in the groin .
He then grabbed his wife by the throat , choking her while his stepdaughter called 911 .
Strawn left the house and drove to a nearby park , where he continued drinking .
Susan and her daughter found him there .
Susan tried to calm her husband down .
Her daughter called the police .
Strawn was arrested and charged with family violence , reckless conduct , and four counts of simple battery misdemeanor charges that in Georgia together carry a maximum sentence of six years .
Less than a month later , he was arrested again when he was found drunk and nearly passed out in his car .
He avoided jail by pleading guilty to reckless conduct and a DUI charge .
Strawn likes to say that his wife made him go to the Hickey House Recovery Community .
But a judge sent him there , as a condition of his probation .
He spent six months at the halfway house while his family stayed away .
Strawn had n't prayed for some time , but he started going to a small church nearby .
The defensive stance that he 'd adopted slipped away .
" Things started loosening up , " Strawn said .
He felt closer to God .
When he got home , Strawn set to work on mending his family .
While he was drinking , Susan had considered leaving him .
Jared had withdrawn into video games .
Now Strawn reached out to them , and they responded .
Jared gave his father a cloth bracelet stenciled with the letters WWJD , for " What Would Jesus Do ? "
Strawn never takes it off .
The Atlanta police department was not as forgiving .
In May 1998 , it determined that Strawn had " brought discredit " on himself as a police officer , on 11 different counts .
His superiors decided to fire him .
Strawn opted to retire instead .
He left the day before he was due to lose his job after 25 years on the force .
Strawn does n't try to reconcile his past and his present , perhaps because he is afraid to find that traces of his old self remain .
It is safer for him to credit God as the way he " got from there to here . "
The story of redemption that Strawn spins persuades parents who do n't know where to turn that they can rely on him .
Strawn was lost , just like the kids he escorts , and it is both his reward and his punishment to tell how he was found .
" Working with these kids is like working a 12 - step , " he said before a recent transport .
" Behavior is as addictive as any drugs or alcohol .
I plant the seed of recovery . "
But Strawn knows that if he is to be trusted to plant that seed , there is no room in his history for criminal lapses of judgment .
I spent hours talking to Strawn , and he never mentioned the accusations involving his stepdaughter and niece .
Instead he told me about a 15 - year - old girl who was apparently discredited when she insinuated that he'd molested her during a 26 - hour drive from Indianapolis to a WWASP school in Montana .
Strawn said that an assistant was with him and the girl for the entire transport , and that the assistant backed Strawn up when he said he 'd done nothing wrong .
The school believed them .
" That was God watching over me , " Strawn said .
Otherwise , he continued , " I would not be working in this profession .
The cloud of suspicion would have been there . "
As for his stepdaughter , when I asked Strawn about her accusation , he said that she 'd made up the charge to get him help for his alcoholism .
She is now 21 and , along with Strawn 's niece , works as an escort for Strawn Support Services .
But she will not team up with her stepfather .
" WE'VE GOT SOMETHING DIFFERENT HERE , " Strawn told the ticketing agent at the checkout counter of Delta Airlines .
" We 've got someone here we 're escorting not a prisoner , but he does n't want to go with us . "
Louis sat with Dalton off to the side , rummaging through the overnight bag that his parents had packed for him .
The agent did n't pause .
" That 's fine , " he said with a smile .
Strawn wo n't board a plane with a kid who puts up too much of a fight hat 's why he ended up on that 26 - hour drive .
But when escorts do fly with protesting kids , airport officials rarely ask questions .
Amanda Krassin was taken by plane from Washington to Oregon when she was 16 .
The escorts , who were from the California company Guiding Hands , asked that she be detained in an airport security area and handcuffed her on the plane .
" Everyone ignored me at the airport , " Krassin recalled .
" I think they just thought I was a prisoner . "
On the way to the gate for our flight to Atlanta , Strawn skipped a long line by flashing an auxiliary Coast Guard badge .
( He 's a member of the group 's volunteer squad . )
Dalton took Louis to the bathroom .
The assistant , who is 25 , is fairly new to the job .
But Strawn likes to show off Dalton to clients because he attended a WWASP school in Western Samoa called Paradise Cove .
The school shut down in 1998 after a State Department investigation into what it determined to be " credible allegations " of abuse , but Strawn does n't mention that .
" I 'm going to make two suggestions , " he told Louis when the teen emerged from the bathroom .
" First , try to have an open mind .
I know it 's hard to have an open mind when two ugly guys come and take you from your bedroom at night to a school that you do n't want to be at .
Second , you 've got to be gut - level honest with yourself .
The bad part of that is it's a 100 percent inside job . "
The world according to Strawn is based on choices and consequences .
The world according to WWASP is designed to reinforce the same principle .
Students enter Casa by the Sea at the first of six levels .
To advance , they have to earn points through good behavior and schoolwork .
Until they reach level three , which takes an average of three months , they can communicate with the outside world only through letters to their parents , which the school monitors .
After that , they can talk on the phone to their parents but no one else .
Casa costs nearly $ 30,000 for a year as much as a year 's tuition at Harvard but offers no traditional academic instruction .
Instead the schoolwork is self - paced ; the students sit at tables with a workbook and take a test on a section when they decide they 're ready .
They can retake the same test as many times as necessary to achieve an 80 percent passing grade .
According to the Casa parent handbook , the school does not ensure that " the student will even receive any credits " or that the teachers who monitor the study sessions will have U.S. credentials .
The school does not track how many of its students go on to high school or college .
" You 're not going to have a teacher riding your back , " Dalton told Louis .
" It 's all independent study .
I just read the module , and did the test .
I finished class in a week .
That 's how easy it is . "
Students spend more time studying themselves than any other subject .
They write daily reflections in response to self - help tapes and videos such as Tony Robbins 's Personal Power , You Can Choose , and
Students also attend , and eventually staff , self - help seminars .
The entry - level seminar , called Discovery , encourages participants to " learn to interrupt unconscious mental and emotional cycles which tend to sabotage results . "
Kelly Lauritsen participated in Discovery at Casa in 2000 and said she was encouraged to hit the walls with rolled towels to release her anger .
The price of tuition includes versions of these seminars for parents .
Like Oprah on speed , sessions run nonstop from morning until midnight .
Many parents and kids say they benefit from the self - analysis .
" I did n't realize that I had so much anger inside , " the 14 - year - old girl whom Strawn transported in November wrote to her mother .
WWASP also pays for Strawn and his employees to attend the seminars , and Strawn has done Discovery .
He enrolled in the seminar so that he could better sell parents on hiring him , but its talk - until - you 're - cured approach forced him to confront buried wounds , such as his father 's death a decade earlier .
" God had a reason to put me there and it had nothing to do with the business , " he said of the experience .
Strawn told Louis that the hardest thing about Casa would be abiding by the school 's intricate system of discipline .
" It 's not the big rules that get you .
It 's all the little rules , " Strawn said .
Casa docks students , according to its handbook , for telling " war stories " about inappropriate experiences , for being unkind to each other , and for making " negative statements about the School , the staff , the country , or other students . "
" There 's a whole page of rules , " said Shannon Eierman , who attended Casa last year .
" That page is divided into sections of categories , into different codes , and a million subcategories .
You could be there forever and the next day and learn a new rule . "
Students at Casa who commit " Category 5 infractions " can be punished with an " intervention , " for example , which is defined as being left alone in a room .
Students say that the punishment can last for weeks , though Casa insists that the maximum penalty is three days .
" I had to sit with crossed legs in a closet for three days , " said Kaori Gutierrez , who left Casa in 2001 .
Interventions may be used to punish out - of - control behavior , drug use , and escape attempts .
But they 're also the way the school handles " self - inflicted injuries , " which can range from cracked knuckles to self - mutilation with pens or paper clips to an attempted suicide .
At the root of this long list of punishable violations is " manipulation , " which includes lying or exaggerating .
Strawn repeatedly uses the word to dismiss a kid's behavior it 's the way he said Valerie Heron acted the day before her suicide .
In the WWASP universe that he inhabits , manipulation is a term of art that refers to just about anything a teen does or says that the staff does n't like .
Still , the schools ' intensive monitoring has helped some students turn their lives around .
Richard King of Atlanta believes that going to Tranquility Bay in 1997 , when he was 17 , taught him to be accountable for his actions .
The experience saved him from ending up " either dead or in jail , " he said .
Before he went to the school , King drank , smoked pot , and battled with his parents .
When he returned , he could sit down and talk to them .
CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE WITH A SEMBLANCE OF OVERSIGHT FOR ESCORTS .
In response to news accounts in 1997 of a teenage boy from Oakland , Calif. , who was transported against his will to Tranquility Bay , the state 's legislature developed a bill to protect kids like him .
The legislation would have barred escorts from using restraints that interfere with a child 's " ability to see , hear , or move freely . "
By the time it passed , however , the bill had been amended into a toothless licensing scheme .
Nor are there federal controls .
In 1923 , the Supreme Court announced that parents have a " right of control " that allows them to direct their children 's upbringing and education .
The court has not budged from this stance since , and , for obvious reasons , it is not listening to the voices of kids who rebel against their parents ' dictates .
Few people want childrenor , for that matter , anyone else to have veto power over the decisions that parents make .
Even the states that permit teenagers to be emancipated from their parents , allowing them to be treated legally as adults , ordinarily mandate that the parents must agree .
As many a frustrated teen knows , the legal framework means that parents get to call the shots .
While teenagers can't be jailed by the state without a judge 's approval , parents can confine minors against their will for reasons including their mental health .
( It 's harder to take away the freedom of mentally ill adults . )
The Constitution has been interpreted to allow teens effectively to be imprisoned by private companies like Strawn 's and private schools like Casa by the Seaas long as their parents sign off .
" If these were state schools or state police , the children would have constitutional protections , " said Barbara Bennett Woodhouse , the director of the Center on Children & the Law at the University of Florida .
" But because it is parents who are delegating their own authority , it has been very difficult to open the door to protection of the child . "
It 's even more difficult to open that door once kids have been taken to foreign schools like Casa by the Sea that lie beyond the reach of U.S. courts .
" The problem is that when Americans are in another country , they are subject to the laws of that country , " said Stewart Patt , a spokesman for the Bureau of Consular Affairs at the State Department .
" Whether it 's a violation of American law is not going to matter to local authorities . "
There is one limit on parents :
They cannot harm their children .
Every state allows the government to intervene if a child or teenager is at risk .
The agencies charged with protecting kids get involved if someone reports that a child is being abused .
Yet by the time friends and relatives learn of a teen 's disappearance and think to make a report , the escort is gone .
What matters is getting the kid back from the school that 's holding him .
It 's a nearly impossible task .
A few determined do - gooders have managed it , however .
In 1998 , 17 - year - old Justin Goen was able to call his girlfriend before being taken by escorts to Tranquility Bay .
The girlfriend 's parents then called the child welfare agency in Justin 's hometown of Worthington , Ohio .
That set a local judge named Yvette Brown in motion .
She heard evidence in juvenile court about spartan conditions , sleep deprivation , and emotional abuse at the school and ordered Justin home .
The Goens ignored Brown 's order , though , and the community cheered them on .
" I hope parents are horrified that a public agency can be so intrusive into family life , " one reader wrote in a letter to The Columbus Dispatch .
After weeks of negotiations , the parents agreed to transfer their son to a WWASP school in Utah .
Justin did not thank the state for its troubles .
He insisted that his most severe punishment at Tranquility Bay was being told to write two 1,000 - word essays .
Jonathan Tyler Mitchell was also sprung from Tranquility Bay .
Tyler ( he goes by his middle name ) had lost his mother when he was young and had never gotten along with his father , Bill Mitchell .
In February 2002 , Mitchell married his girlfriend of eight months and Tyler moved in with his brother .
Mitchell soon asked Tyler to come over for dinner .
When the 12 - year - old arrived , there were two strangers at the table .
They worked for Strawn .
Later , they roused Tyler from bed and took him to Jamaica .
What had Tyler done to deserve this wake - up call ?
According to his father , he had been disrespectful in class , kicked a school locker , talked about suicide , and refused to go to counseling .
Tyler 's account was different .
" I suffer a lot of beatings from my dad , " he told a psychologist who evaluated him .
" The future is not looking good for me . "
Tyler had several relatives , however , who were not willing to leave the boy 's future in his father 's hands .
Gini Farmer Remines , an adult cousin on his mother 's side , petitioned a local juvenile court to order his return .
When the judge refused , Remines appealed her decision to a circuit court .
At a hearing that followed , three former Tranquility Bay students testified on Tyler 's behalf , and what they described was a Caribbean purgatory .
The food , they claimed , sometimes contained pubic hair and bugs .
Raw sewage spilled over into the boys ' shower area and " visible layers of dirt , grime , filth , mildew on the sides of the shower stalls " led to outbreaks of scabies .
Students who broke a rule against looking out the window were placed in " observation placement " forced to lie on the floor , sometimes for weeks at a time , and allowed to sit up only for food or a punitive round of 5,000 jumping jacks .
One of the witnesses , Aaron Kravig , reported that he was at Tranquility Bay in August 2001 , the month Valerie Heron died , and that he'd been forced to use a towel that had been used to clean up her remains .
The unwashed towel " had a spot of blood about , somewhere about the size of a dinner plate , " Kravig testified .
" There was some of her hair on it .
They used it to pick her head up ; I 'm pretty sure .
I told the staff about it and nothing was done . . . .
I had to dry off with that towel for about three weeks . "
Mitchell visited the school with his wife after he sent
Tyler there and testified that he 'd seen kids playing tennis and shooting hoops .
But the judge ordered Tyler home .
Shortly after his return , the boys ' relatives heard that Mitchell had threatened to send Tyler back .
Seven of them filed for custody .
Gini Remines said that Mitchell gave up and turned Tyler over to her .
" Tyler does n't talk about what happened at Tranquility Bay , " Remines said recently .
" All he 'll say was that it was a hellhole and he might have died in it . "
" THE SCHOOL IS IN MEXICO ? "
Louis said when he noticed the highway signs on our drive south from San Diego .
" I thought it was in California . "
" I said we were coming to California , not that the school was there , " Strawn said .
" I was spoon - feeding you until we got here . "
Louis fell silent .
Ten minutes later , Strawn drove past a sign that looked like a middle - school art project , with " Mexico " written in green , red , and white .
It was now nearly noon .
A Mexican flag flapped over a ramshackle collection of buildings , and a film of dust and grit seemed to cloud the bright blue day .
Like a tour guide on autopilot , Strawn kept up a running commentary about the sights while his passenger stewed in the back seat .
" That 's a serious fence , " Strawn said , pointing to a 14 - foot - high barrier of sheet metal topped with electrical wires which marked the border .
" The school is just north of a town called Ensenada .
That 's your primary cruise destination . "
On the dashboard of the Buick LeSabre he had rented for this leg of the journey , Strawn had installed a portable GPS system that Susan had given him for Christmas .
But it was n't working .
About a mile past the Mexican border , Strawn missed the Scenic Road exit to Ensenada and drove through Tijuana instead .
We passed palm trees and squat bushes with fire - red flowers .
Strawn braked at a stop sign that read " Alto , " muttering to himself as he tried to find his way back to the highway .
We were back on course and heading through a purple and yellow tollbooth by the time Louis spoke .
" What 's the name of the school I 'm going to ? " he asked as the ocean crashed against the shore near the passenger side of the car .
" Casa .
Casa by the Sea , " Strawn answered , and hummed the lyrics " down by the sea , " from the song " Under the Boardwalk . "
" Mi casa es su casa , " Dalton ad - libbed .
Strawn told Louis that the Casa grounds used to house a resort .
" The nice thing about resorts , " he mused , " they usually have walls around them .
They keep you from getting involved with the nuts around here , and keep them from you . "
A huge half - finished bust of Jesus loomed on a mountain outside the car .
Dalton began reminiscing about his time at Paradise Cove .
He mentioned that he used to hunt for octopus in the ocean .
Strawn pointed to the beach and said that students at Casa hung out there .
Louis asked why it was empty .
Strawn answered by changing the subject .
" You ought to get there about lunchtime , " he said with determined cheer .
" And I can tell you , those chubby Mexican women can do a number on some Mexican food . "
When a trip is winding down and a kid has been scared into compliance , there is a moment when Strawn likes to wax philosophical .
He cribs liberally from Stephen Covey , the author of the bestselling business guide
The talk works best when Strawn has something tangible to move to like the letters that parents often give him for their children .
The kids used to tear up the letters .
But they have n't since Strawn started telling them to spend more time in Covey 's " space " before doing anything rash .
The Boussards had n't written their son a letter , so Strawn did his best on his own to bring Louis around to their way of seeing things .
He told the boy not to be angry with his folks .
" It 's absolutely a sign of love for them to take the chance on what they believe will be the best for you , " said Strawn .
" When you grow up and have your own family you have to excuse me I hope you have the balls to do what your parents are doing for you . "
The off - white stucco walls and red shutters of Casa came into view , and a Mexican guard opened a red iron gate .
A line of teenagers wearing khaki pants and navy blue jackets walked across the courtyard in single file .
A few girls carried baskets full of laundry .
The smell of fried chicken wafted through the air .
A man in a white turtleneck pointed to Louis and said to Strawn , " This is the kid ? "
The man directed Louis to grab his bag .
Strawn handed a woman Louis 's paperwork his birth certificate , passport , and the contract with Casa that his parents had signed .
When Louis turned and walked away with the man in the white turtleneck , Strawn did n't say goodbye .
Then I asked if it was time for us to go and he rushed to catch up with the boy and gave him a hug .
Louis looked taken aback by the embrace and there was a moment of awkwardness .
Then he hugged back , hard .
Strawn collects those hugs .
They help him believe that he is saving , not savaging , the kids he steals away with in the night .
When we were back in the car , Strawn put on his sunglasses and lit a cigar , as he likes to do at the end of a trip .
He leaned forward in anticipation of the next stops along his journey a Cuban cigar shop in Tijuana and then a Mexican restaurant in San Diego .
He blew out a ring of smoke , and it was as if Louis had never been with us .
Nadya Labi is a senior editor at Legal Affairs .
Louis Boussard has hired a professional to abduct his son .
On a late evening in early March , Rick Strawn of Strawn Support Services flew from Atlanta to Tampa , Fla .
He rented a Ford Taurus with child - safety locks from Avis and set off for the coastal town of St. Petersburg with his assistant , Joshua Dalton , and me .
An hour later , we were driving down a street filled with one - story homes .
We slowed down outside a house with an American flag hanging from the eaves and a Jaguar and a Grand Cherokee in the semicircular driveway .
It was 1:55 a.m. , which meant we were early .
Strawn parked in a nearby lot to kill time .
He went over the plan , emphasizing , " We 've got to leave by 3:15 .
" Flicking on the lights to look for Boussard 's number , Strawn dialed his cellphone .
" Um , Louis .
Hi .
Does your house have a circle driveway with a Jag in it ? " he said .
" If you 're ready , we 'll come on in .
Is he asleep ? "
The connection broke up .
Moments later , Strawn 's phone rang .
" Much better , yes .
No , do n't wake him up .
We 're going to talk to you for about an hour , " he said .
" I 'm going to help you through all that .
Okay .
Bye - bye .
" We drove back to the house at a crawl and got out of the car , easing the doors shut .
Both men wore khaki pants and dark blue shirts embossed with a globe logo and the website address of Strawn 's company .
Strawn walked up the stone pathway , peered in the window of the front door , and lightly rapped .
No one answered .
" Maybe he said go around the back , " Strawn said .
" Wait here for a second . "
He began to walk toward the back of the house when a light came on inside .
A Haitian - American man in his late 40s opened the front door and beckoned us inside .
Boussard ( his name and the names of his wife and son have been changed ) guided us to a dining - room table covered by a white tablecloth .
It held a white vase filled with artificial pink flowers and two fat red candles in wrought iron stands .
The matching white cushions of the dining - room chairs were covered in plastic .
Boussard sat at the head of the table , flanked by his wife , Sandra .
In spite of the late hour , they were impeccably dressed he wore a beige linen suit and she wore a scoop - necked sweater set off by a gold necklace and bracelets .
The couple 's formality , however , soon gave way to the urgency of the task at hand .
Two rooms away on the other side of the kitchen , their 16 - year - old son , Louis , Jr. , lay asleep in his bedroom .
The Boussards had hired Strawn Support Services to transport Louis , Jr. to Casa by the Sea , a school near Ensenada , Mexico that seeks to " modify " the behavior of troublemaking teens .
Casa takes kids who parents have decided are out of control , usually because the teens are talking back , getting poor grades , staying out late , drinking , having sex too soon , or taking drugs .
Louis , Jr.'s parents had not told him that he was going to Mexiconor how he would be taken there .
They thought he would run if he knew what was about to happen .
Now they kept glancing in the direction of the kitchen .
" Louis is very suspicious , " Sandra whispered about her son as her husband began a hurried account of the teen 's misbehavior .
The troubles had begun a year earlier when Louis , Jr. was in 10th grade .
His grades fell from A's and B's to C's and below .
He stopped playing basketball with his father .
He started talking back when his mother would n't let him go out to clubs with his friends .
He broke his curfew , which was 7:30 p.m. during the week and 9 p.m. on the weekends .
Often he left the house by his bedroom window .
The Boussards thought Louis , Jr. might be smoking pot .
Then all of a sudden , his report cards improved dramatically .
" I thought , something is not right , " said Boussard , squinting at the memory .
He discovered a bad report card in his son's backpack , and Louis admitted that he had faked the good ones .
The Boussards enrolled their son in counseling ; the counselor said he was doing fine .
They sent him to boot camp for a day , where he got anger - management and drug counseling .
He behaved better for about a week .
At around the same time , Louis was told that he had to repeat 10th grade .
His parents transferred him to a vocational program in carpentry at his high school with the hope that he would find the schoolwork easier .
Louis hated it .
Strawn listened to this litany of frustrations , nodding sympathetically .
Then , he took a breath and started the spiel that he has honed over the course of six years and some 300 transports .
" Behavior is as addictive as any drug or alcohol , " he told the Boussards .
Like all troubled kids , Louis , Jr. needed to recover from his bad behavior .
" The way I look at it , " Strawn continued , " any good recovery has three components : breaking down old habits , building a strong foundation , and building new habits . "
But Boussardwas not paying attention .
He was still steamed about the fake report cards .
" I said ' Something is not right , ' " he repeated .
There was a slight noise , and he and his wife jumped .
" Do we need to have Josh go outside ? "
Strawn asked , referring to his assistant .
" He 's very suspicious , " Sandra whispered , glancing over her shoulder toward her son 's room .
Strawn went outside to make sure that Louis had not climbed out of his bedroom window .
The teen seemed to be asleep , but Strawn left Dalton outside to stand guard .
On the air conditioner outside the window was a bottle of cologne , which Strawn guessed Louis used to freshen up before his nights out .
Strawn squeaked back into his chair and rushed through his usual script .
Now was not the moment to dwell on his own recovery from alcoholism , or to lead the prayer circle that he often suggests before a trip .
He ran through what his clients should expect when he entered Louis 's room .
Strawn advised them to introduce him to Louis , to give their son a hug if Louis let them , and then to walk away .
" The hardest thing I ask a parent to do is to turn around and walk out , " he said .
" Do n't come back , no matter what you see or hear .
"
The mother and father nodded , shifting in their seats .
Boussard got a black overnight bag from a closet and handed it to Strawn , along with a check for $ 1,800 .
In return , Strawn asked him to sign a notarized power - of - attorney that authorized his company to take " any act or action " on the parents ' behalf during the transport to Casa .
The document also promised that the couple would not sue for any injuries caused by " reasonable restraint . "
Strawn warned them that he would take Louis away in handcuffs .
The father signed the release , then seemed to have a moment of buyer 's remorse .
He said he'd been obsessively reading the catalogue for Casa .
" All of a sudden , the intensity just takes off , " Boussard said about sending his son away .
" We feel like we failed . " " Let me help you out there , " Strawn reassured him .
" I go to families all the time with four or five siblings .
Only one of them decided to take this path .
If it had anything to do with your parenting skills . . . "
His voice trailed off .
" It is n't because of that .
" " We do n't want to see him go to prison or jail , " said Boussard , rubbing his hands over his face again and again .
" Will he understand what we 're trying to do for him ?
" Boussard got up from the table with a sigh .
The rest of us followed close behind .
He walked into the kitchen and took a dinner knife out of a drawer , explaining that he would use it to pry open his son's locked door .
Sliding the knife into the crack between the door and the wall , he prepared to enter .
RICK STRAWN IS AN EX - COP WHO STARTED HIS COMPANY in 1988 to help police officers find off - duty work guarding construction sites .
Ten years later , he was asked by a member of his United Methodist church to transport the churchgoer 's son to Tranquility Bay in Jamaica .
The school is run by the World Wide Association of Specialty Programs , a company headquartered in Utah that owns eight schools in the United States and abroad , including Louis , Jr. 's destination .
Strawn said no to that first inquiry because he knew the boy involved .
But he had stumbled upon what he now believes is his calling .
In his first year of business , he escorted eight teens to behavior modification schools .
Since then , his company has transported more than 700 kids between the ages of 8 and 17 .
Strawn has gone on about half of the trips himself ; on the others he has sent agents .
Either way , the company generally uses two escorts for the part of a trip that 's on the road .
Girls are escorted by coed teams ; in the early years , Strawn relied on his wife , mother , or older daughter to help him on these trips .
Now his wife , Susan , runs the company 's office from the family home in the Atlanta suburb of Suwanee .
After every trip , she sends the client a card with the message : " Just a note to say thank you for allowing us to assist your family .
" Balding and slightly soft in the gut , Strawn is a reassuring 52 - year - old .
He speaks with a light drawlhe was born in Lubbock , Tex . and he seems to mean it when he drops endearments like " hon . "
Strawn 's easy manner has won over many parents and school administrators .
" He 's one of the few escorts who takes the time and effort to talk to the kids , " said Karina Zurita , the admissions coordinator at Casa .
" He lets kids know that they 'll be in good hands .
" But if Strawn is decent and likable , he will also go to almost any length to get his charges to do what their parents want .
He has chased kids down .
He has dragged teens to the car in their underwear .
He has used a choke hold , learned as a cop , to render a few others unconscious .
He has taken suicidal kids from hospital treatment to reform school .
Most of Strawn 's clients are genuinely concerned about their children 's welfare .
They believe their children are at risk and want to save them .
But these parents also revel in forcing their kids to sit up , pay attention , and do what they 're told .
Glenda Spaulding , who took out four loans to send her 14 - year - old daughter to a WWASP school in South Carolina last November , had three words for Strawn before he took the girl away : " Go get her .
" Strawn 's willingness to use force differentiates him from other escorts .
While no one tracks the teen transport industry , those in the business estimate that more than 20 companies nationwide take kids to behavior modification schools , residential treatment centers , and boot camps .
Some of the bigger companies are more selective than Strawn about what they 'll do .
The Center for Safe Youth in Atlanta , for example , does n't use restraints to force a child to go anywhere .
And the center wo n't transport kids to WWASP schools because educational consultants with whom the company works do n't recommend them .
Its owner , John Villines , would like to create a professional association to oversee the transport industry .
The standards he proposes are rudimentary : no agents with felony convictions or histories of irresponsible driving or drug and alcohol abuse .
But they set the bar higher than almost any state does .
Instead of operating by rules , the escort industry runs on trust the trust that parents wo n't put their kids in harm 's way .
But there is no trust between parents and kids in the households that Strawn enters .
It has broken down so completely that parents think it 's okay , and even courageous , to send a stranger into their child 's bedroom .
Strawn makes his living from that judgment and he is willing to mislead a child for what he sees as the greater goal of reform .
Once parents put their kids at Strawn 's mercy , for a short time he is in loco parentis in the place of the parent in the fullest sense of the term .
He has the authority to tell a kid what to do and to punish him for failing to obey .
At the same time , he is the only person left to cling to when a kid is on the threshold of a scary , unknown world .
Three years ago , Strawn escorted Valerie Ann Heron , a 17 - year - old from Montgomery , Ala. , to Tranquility Bay .
The school is the most hardcore in the WWASP system , the one to which students are sent when they repeatedly cause trouble at other schools .
The trip went smoothly , according to Heron 's mother , Nell Orange , and Strawn played his role well .
" He made her feel comfortable with him .
She trusted him .
He talked to her about what to expect , where she was going , " Orange said .
" She gave him a hug when she left him .
" The day after that hug , Valerie rushed out of a second - floor classroom and jumped to her death off a 35 - foot - high balcony .
The suicide did n't faze Strawn .
He did n't ask himself whether he should have taken Valerie to Tranquility Bay and left her there , or whether she needed more help and tenderness than the tough - love school provides .
He does n't even acknowledge that she might have been upset or unhinged enough to kill herself .
" We had a really good trip .
We were laughing and cutting it up , " Strawn recalled .
" Was she suicidal ?
Till the day I die , I wo n't believe that . "
Without any evidence , Strawn says that Valerie must have jumped in an effort to run away or in hopes of hurting herself so that she would be sent home .
She landed on her head instead of her feet , he thinks , because one foot got caught in the balcony .
" My feeling is that the majority of kids who talk about suicide , they 're not suicidal , " Strawn said .
" What they are is manipulative .
" LOUIS , JR .
SAT STRAIGHT UP IN HIS BED .
He was surrounded by three strangers and his parents .
His chest was bare , and white acne medicine stood out against the dark skin of his forehead .
He grabbed his wire - rimmed glasses from the bedside table and blinked a few times .
The basketball posters of Tracy McGrady and Kobe Bryant were still there .
His childhood teddy bear sat in a low - slung armchair by the door .
" Do you have some underwear on ? " Louis 's father said .
" They 're here to help us .
They 're here to take you to a school .
" Louis shook his head to clear it .
" The only thing we want you to know is that we love you very much , " Boussard continued .
He and his wife stepped forward to hug Louis , but the gesture was forced and none of them seemed to want the contact .
" Where am I going ?
When am I coming home ?
" Louis 's parents walked out the door .
Strawn broke the silence that followed their exit .
He launched into what he calls " the scenario , " a three - minute script that he instructs his employees to memorize and deliver , right down to a required chuckle .
" Personally , I feel like I do it better than anyone else because I designed it , " Strawn had explained earlier .
The scenario is the key to a smooth escort , he believes .
It gives teens time to cool off , weigh their options , and realize that their best course of action is to follow orders .
" I want you to know that we are not here to be bad guys and bullies .
We are not here to lecture you , or right - or - wrong you to death , " Strawn told Louis .
" We are here to get you safely to the school and we are going to do that .
But we 'll absolutely give you as much respect as you allow us to give you .
" Louis stared at him and drummed his leg against the bed .
" Quite frankly , cuffs do not embarrass us , " Strawn continued .
" But if it goes there , it will be 100 percent your choice . "
He concluded with the question that the scenario is designed to set up .
" I have an important question for you .
If you walk out of here cuffed , do you understand that it 's 100 percent your choice ? " " Uh - huh , " Louis said .
He looked around the room .
His mind was working but coming up empty .
He asked if he could grab his clothes .
The answer was no .
Instead he was allowed to direct Dalton to hand him a gray t- shirt , a black - and - gray Fubu jersey , and black mesh gym shorts .
" Am I coming home today ? "
Louis was trying not to cry .
He blinked rapidly behind the smudged lenses of his glasses .
" I will not lie to you , " Strawn hedged .
" I might not answer your questions . . .
" " So when am I coming home ? " " I mean no disrespect , but I learned a long time ago that I do n't want to chase you , " Strawn plowed on , ignoring Louis 's question .
He explained that he would handcuff Louis to Dalton .
" And son , if you can drag this ugly sucker far and fast enough to get away , well , God bless you , you were n't meant to go . "
Strawn gave the scripted chuckle .
Louis was still trying to buy time and find a way out .
" Can I brush my teeth ? " he asked .
Strawn shook his head , and cuffed Louis to Dalton .
Strawn wrote his script to give his charges the illusion of control , but he often cuffs the kids , especially boys , no matter what they say .
He hustled Louis to the car , guiding him into the back seat along with Dalton , to whom he was still cuffed .
Taking the wheel , Strawn explained to his passenger that he would stop talking 
" I consider it disrespectful to talk to you in the rearview mirror , " he said until he reached the airport .
At the mention of an airport , Louis said , " Oh , God .
" When we arrived at the Tampa airport half an hour later , Strawn took off Louis 's handcuffs .
As we walked to catch our connecting flight to Atlanta , Dalton grabbed the waistband of the boy 's shorts , which rode low on his hips and might have fallen off if Dalton had n't held fast .
The teen rolled his eyes and cracked a piece of gum that Dalton had given him .
He was auditioning for the part of bad boy , but the role did n't fit .
He was too quick to say " Thank you " and too eager to talk .
He had spent the past year bottling those impulses around his parents and chafing at the limits they had set for him .
His abduction struck him as the latest outrage .
" I do n't listen to them , I do n't like what they say , " he said .
" I do n't listen to the curfew .
I 'm not doing that .
It 's too early .
" When his parents bore down , Louis pushed back .
He hung out with a crowd they did n't like and he drank and smoked pot .
" I came home high once .
My father said , ' I know you 're high , ' " Louis remembered .
" Then I went to a one - day boot camp last August .
You exercise and they talk to you .
I came home high again and he sent me to this juvenile rehab thing that lasted two and a half days .
It was pointless .
" THERE COMES A POINT IN JUST ABOUT EVERY ONE OF STRAWN'S TRANSPORTS , whether he 's soothing a nervous parent or bonding with an upset teen , when he will mention his six - month stint in 1997 at a halfway house for alcoholics .
" Seven years ago , I entered recovery .
My drug of choice was alcohol .
You know far more about where you 're going than I knew about myself , " he told the 14 - year - old girl he escorted last November to a WWASP school in South Carolina .
" In my mind , I was kicking and screaming .
But the loveliest day of my life was when my wife and mom dropped me off at that halfway house .
I can tell you now that it 's the best thing that ever happened to me .
" That 's Strawn 's version of the story , which starts a generation earlier .
Strawn joined the Atlanta police force in 1973 .
He 'd previously been in sales , but he knew that being a cop would suit him better .
" In sales , the customer is always right , " he explained .
" But as a cop , I 'm always right . "
Strawn relished that authority .
" It seems at times he has to have the last word , " one of his supervisors noted in an evaluation early in his police career .
That 's a good thing in a cop , and the reviews Strawn received during this period were uniformly favorable .
Strawn worked many different beats , including patrol , drug enforcement , and homicide .
He earned the respect of his colleagues for calming down troublemakers .
" They have to think that you might be the toughest guy , " he said of the suspects he arrested .
" I was able to talk people into doing what we wanted them to do .
" Strawn was losing control of his own life , however .
He was drinking heavily and in 1992 he was briefly suspended for disappearing from work without explanation .
Strawn said that he stayed sober on the job , but the smell of alcohol seeped from his pores .
His colleagues complained .
Internal Affairs investigated .
Strawn tested clean .
Four years earlier , Strawn had married Susan Kyzer , a single mother with a young daughter .
Strawn did n't get along with the girl .
She had attention - deficit disorder and the Ritalin she took wore off by the time she got home from school .
" Her behavior was like a needle point with Rick , " Susan said .
" He was of the view that kids should be seen but not heard , and this kid was always heard .
"
In 1996 , the stepdaughter told a counselor that Strawn had molested her two years earlier , when she was 12 .
She 'd just gotten home from a school football game , and she was still wearing her green - and - white cheerleader 's outfit .
She fell asleep on the living - room floor while watching TV with her stepfather .
She said that she woke to the feel of something hard against her vagina and ran out of the room .
Strawn was arrested for molestation .
During the police investigation , he claimed that he'd fallen asleep after drinking , and in his dreams had confused his stepdaughter with his wife .
But Susan told the investigators that just after the incident , Strawn had told her that " 'it was just a weak moment . ' . . .
He got turned on by her laying there with a short skirt on and all , and lay down beside her and unzipped his pants against her . "
Strawn grew depressed and began taking medication .
He also admitted to detectives that a year earlier he had fondled the breasts of his niece on two separate occasions , when she was 12 or 13 .
The Atlanta police department suspended him for several months .
But Strawn 's stepdaughter recanted her accusation , leaving prosecutors little choice but to drop the molestation charge .
Strawn was taken out of the field , however , and assigned to do desk work .
He was no longer the go - to officer .
" I was being tolerated , " he said .
" And for someone with my personality , being tolerated is enough to make you want to get drunk .
" One night in January 1997 , Strawn went home drunk .
After arguing with Susan , he said he was going to shoot himself and he got his .38 revolver out of the garage .
" I 've had all I can take , " he told Susan , his stepdaughter , and the couple 's 8 - year - old son , Jared .
But his threat was , to use his word , manipulation .
He fired into the air and left .
When he returned home later that evening , he passed out .
The next day , Susan confronted Strawn about his alcoholism , as she had many times in the past .
His stepdaughter chimed in that she had snapped a picture of Strawn in his stupor the previous night so that he could see what he'd looked like drunk .
Strawn wanted to destroy the roll of film but Susan and her daughter would n't let him , because it included a photo of the family cat , which had since died .
A struggle ensued , and Strawn kicked the girl in the groin .
He then grabbed his wife by the throat , choking her while his stepdaughter called 911 .
Strawn left the house and drove to a nearby park , where he continued drinking .
Susan and her daughter found him there .
Susan tried to calm her husband down .
Her daughter called the police .
Strawn was arrested and charged with family violence , reckless conduct , and four counts of simple battery misdemeanor charges that in Georgia together carry a maximum sentence of six years .
Less than a month later , he was arrested again when he was found drunk and nearly passed out in his car .
He avoided jail by pleading guilty to reckless conduct and a DUI charge .
Strawn likes to say that his wife made him go to the Hickey House Recovery Community .
But a judge sent him there , as a condition of his probation .
He spent six months at the halfway house while his family stayed away .
Strawn had n't prayed for some time , but he started going to a small church nearby .
The defensive stance that he 'd adopted slipped away .
" Things started loosening up , " Strawn said .
He felt closer to God .
When he got home , Strawn set to work on mending his family .
While he was drinking , Susan had considered leaving him .
Jared had withdrawn into video games .
Now Strawn reached out to them , and they responded .
Jared gave his father a cloth bracelet stenciled with the letters WWJD , for " What Would Jesus Do ? "
Strawn never takes it off .
The Atlanta police department was not as forgiving .
In May 1998 , it determined that Strawn had " brought discredit " on himself as a police officer , on 11 different counts .
His superiors decided to fire him .
Strawn opted to retire instead .
He left the day before he was due to lose his job after 25 years on the force .
Strawn does n't try to reconcile his past and his present , perhaps because he is afraid to find that traces of his old self remain .
It is safer for him to credit God as the way he " got from there to here . "
The story of redemption that Strawn spins persuades parents who do n't know where to turn that they can rely on him .
Strawn was lost , just like the kids he escorts , and it is both his reward and his punishment to tell how he was found .
" Working with these kids is like working a 12 - step , " he said before a recent transport .
" Behavior is as addictive as any drugs or alcohol .
I plant the seed of recovery .
" But Strawn knows that if he is to be trusted to plant that seed , there is no room in his history for criminal lapses of judgment .
I spent hours talking to Strawn , and he never mentioned the accusations involving his stepdaughter and niece .
Instead he told me about a 15 - year - old girl who was apparently discredited when she insinuated that he'd molested her during a 26 - hour drive from Indianapolis to a WWASP school in Montana .
Strawn said that an assistant was with him and the girl for the entire transport , and that the assistant backed Strawn up when he said he 'd done nothing wrong .
The school believed them .
" That was God watching over me , " Strawn said .
Otherwise , he continued , " I would not be working in this profession .
The cloud of suspicion would have been there . "
As for his stepdaughter , when I asked Strawn about her accusation , he said that she 'd made up the charge to get him help for his alcoholism .
She is now 21 and , along with Strawn 's niece , works as an escort for Strawn Support Services .
But she will not team up with her stepfather .
" WE'VE GOT SOMETHING DIFFERENT HERE , " Strawn told the ticketing agent at the checkout counter of Delta Airlines .
" We 've got someone here we 're escorting not a prisoner , but he does n't want to go with us . "
Louis sat with Dalton off to the side , rummaging through the overnight bag that his parents had packed for him .
The agent did n't pause .
" That 's fine , " he said with a smile .
Strawn wo n't board a plane with a kid who puts up too much of a fight hat 's why he ended up on that 26 - hour drive .
But when escorts do fly with protesting kids , airport officials rarely ask questions .
Amanda Krassin was taken by plane from Washington to Oregon when she was 16 .
The escorts , who were from the California company Guiding Hands , asked that she be detained in an airport security area and handcuffed her on the plane .
" Everyone ignored me at the airport , " Krassin recalled .
" I think they just thought I was a prisoner .
" On the way to the gate for our flight to Atlanta , Strawn skipped a long line by flashing an auxiliary Coast Guard badge .
( He 's a member of the group 's volunteer squad . )
Dalton took Louis to the bathroom .
The assistant , who is 25 , is fairly new to the job .
But Strawn likes to show off Dalton to clients because he attended a WWASP school in Western Samoa called Paradise Cove .
The school shut down in 1998 after a State Department investigation into what it determined to be " credible allegations " of abuse , but Strawn does n't mention that .
" I'm going to make two suggestions , " he told Louis when the teen emerged from the bathroom .
" First , try to have an open mind .
I know it 's hard to have an open mind when two ugly guys come and take you from your bedroom at night to a school that you do n't want to be at .
Second , you 've got to be gut - level honest with yourself .
The bad part of that is it 's a 100 percent inside job .
" The world according to Strawn is based on choices and consequences .
The world according to WWASP is designed to reinforce the same principle .
Students enter Casa by the Sea at the first of six levels .
To advance , they have to earn points through good behavior and schoolwork .
Until they reach level three , which takes an average of three months , they can communicate with the outside world only through letters to their parents , which the school monitors .
After that , they can talk on the phone to their parents but no one else .
Casa costs nearly $ 30,000 for a year as much as a year 's tuition at Harvard but offers no traditional academic instruction .
Instead the schoolwork is self - paced ; the students sit at tables with a workbook and take a test on a section when they decide they 're ready .
They can retake the same test as many times as necessary to achieve an 80 percent passing grade .
According to the Casa parent handbook , the school does not ensure that " the student will even receive any credits " or that the teachers who monitor the study sessions will have U.S. credentials .
The school does not track how many of its students go on to high school or college .
" You 're not going to have a teacher riding your back , " Dalton told Louis .
" It 's all independent study .
I just read the module , and did the test .
I finished class in a week .
That 's how easy it is .
" Students spend more time studying themselves than any other subject .
They write daily reflections in response to self - help tapes and videos such as , and Price Tag of Sex .
They answer questions like " What feelings / emotions did I experience today and how did I choose to respond ?
" Students also attend , and eventually staff , self - help seminars .
The entry - level seminar , called Discovery , encourages participants to " learn to interrupt unconscious mental and emotional cycles which tend to sabotage results . "
Kelly Lauritsen participated in Discovery at Casa in 2000 and said she was encouraged to hit the walls with rolled towels to release her anger .
The price of tuition includes versions of these seminars for parents .
Likeon speed , sessions run nonstop from morning until midnight .
Many parents and kids say they benefit from the self - analysis .
" I did n't realize that I had so much anger inside , " the 14 - year - old girl whom Strawn transported in November wrote to her mother .
WWASP also pays for Strawn and his employees to attend the seminars , and Strawn has done Discovery .
He enrolled in the seminar so that he could better sell parents on hiring him , but its talk - until - you 're - cured approach forced him to confront buried wounds , such as his father 's death a decade earlier .
" God had a reason to put me there and it had nothing to do with the business , " he said of the experience .
Strawn told Louis that the hardest thing about Casa would be abiding by the school 's intricate system of discipline .
" It 's not the big rules that get you .
It 's all the little rules , " Strawn said .
Casa docks students , according to its handbook , for telling " war stories " about inappropriate experiences , for being unkind to each other , and for making " negative statements about the School , the staff , the country , or other students . " " There 's a whole page of rules , " said Shannon Eierman , who attended Casa last year .
" That page is divided into sections of categories , into different codes , and a million subcategories .
You could be there forever and the next day and learn a new rule .
" Students at Casa who commit " Category 5 infractions " can be punished with an " intervention , " for example , which is defined as being left alone in a room .
Students say that the punishment can last for weeks , though Casa insists that the maximum penalty is three days .
" I had to sit with crossed legs in a closet for three days , " said Kaori Gutierrez , who left Casa in 2001 .
Interventions may be used to punish out - of - control behavior , drug use , and escape attempts .
But they 're also the way the school handles " self - inflicted injuries , " which can range from cracked knuckles to self - mutilation with pens or paper clips to an attempted suicide .
At the root of this long list of punishable violations is " manipulation , " which includes lying or exaggerating .
Strawn repeatedly uses the word to dismiss a kid's behavior it 's the way he said Valerie Heron acted the day before her suicide .
In the WWASP universe that he inhabits , manipulation is a term of art that refers to just about anything a teen does or says that the staff does n't like .
Still , the schools ' intensive monitoring has helped some students turn their lives around .
Richard King of Atlanta believes that going to Tranquility Bay in 1997 , when he was 17 , taught him to be accountable for his actions .
The experience saved him from ending up " either dead or in jail , " he said .
Before he went to the school , King drank , smoked pot , and battled with his parents .
When he returned , he could sit down and talk to them .
CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE WITH A SEMBLANCE OF OVERSIGHT FOR ESCORTS .
In response to news accounts in 1997 of a teenage boy from Oakland , Calif. , who was transported against his will to Tranquility Bay , the state 's legislature developed a bill to protect kids like him .
The legislation would have barred escorts from using restraints that interfere with a child 's " ability to see , hear , or move freely . "
By the time it passed , however , the bill had been amended into a toothless licensing scheme .
Nor are there federal controls .
In 1923 , the Supreme Court announced that parents have a " right of control " that allows them to direct their children 's upbringing and education .
The court has not budged from this stance since , and , for obvious reasons , it is not listening to the voices of kids who rebel against their parents ' dictates .
Few people want childrenor , for that matter , anyone else to have veto power over the decisions that parents make .
Even the states that permit teenagers to be emancipated from their parents , allowing them to be treated legally as adults , ordinarily mandate that the parents must agree .
As many a frustrated teen knows , the legal framework means that parents get to call the shots .
While teenagers can't be jailed by the state without a judge 's approval , parents can confine minors against their will for reasons including their mental health .
( It 's harder to take away the freedom of mentally ill adults . )
The Constitution has been interpreted to allow teens effectively to be imprisoned by private companies like Strawn 's and private schools like Casa by the Seaas long as their parents sign off .
" If these were state schools or state police , the children would have constitutional protections , " said Barbara Bennett Woodhouse , the director of the Center on Children & the Law at the University of Florida .
" But because it is parents who are delegating their own authority , it has been very difficult to open the door to protection of the child .
"
It 's even more difficult to open that door once kids have been taken to foreign schools like Casa by the Sea that lie beyond the reach of U.S. courts .
" The problem is that when Americans are in another country , they are subject to the laws of that country , " said Stewart Patt , a spokesman for the Bureau of Consular Affairs at the State Department .
" Whether it 's a violation of American law is not going to matter to local authorities .
" There is one limit on parents :
They cannot harm their children .
Every state allows the government to intervene if a child or teenager is at risk .
The agencies charged with protecting kids get involved if someone reports that a child is being abused .
Yet by the time friends and relatives learn of a teen 's disappearance and think to make a report , the escort is gone .
What matters is getting the kid back from the school that 's holding him .
It 's a nearly impossible task .
A few determined do - gooders have managed it , however .
In 1998 , 17 - year - old Justin Goen was able to call his girlfriend before being taken by escorts to Tranquility Bay .
The girlfriend 's parents then called the child welfare agency in Justin 's hometown of Worthington , Ohio .
That set a local judge named Yvette Brown in motion .
She heard evidence in juvenile court about spartan conditions , sleep deprivation , and emotional abuse at the school and ordered Justin home .
The Goens ignored Brown 's order , though , and the community cheered them on .
" I hope parents are horrified that a public agency can be so intrusive into family life , " one reader wrote in a letter to .
After weeks of negotiations , the parents agreed to transfer their son to a WWASP school in Utah .
Justin did not thank the state for its troubles .
He insisted that his most severe punishment at Tranquility Bay was being told to write two 1,000 - word essays .
Jonathan Tyler Mitchell was also sprung from Tranquility Bay .
Tyler ( he goes by his middle name ) had lost his mother when he was young and had never gotten along with his father , Bill Mitchell .
In February 2002 , Mitchell married his girlfriend of eight months and Tyler moved in with his brother .
Mitchell soon asked Tyler to come over for dinner .
When the 12 - year - old arrived , there were two strangers at the table .
They worked for Strawn .
Later , they roused Tyler from bed and took him to Jamaica .
What had Tyler done to deserve this wake - up call ?
According to his father , he had been disrespectful in class , kicked a school locker , talked about suicide , and refused to go to counseling .
Tyler 's account was different .
" I suffer a lot of beatings from my dad , " he told a psychologist who evaluated him .
" The future is not looking good for me .
" Tyler had several relatives , however , who were not willing to leave the boy 's future in his father 's hands .
Gini Farmer Remines , an adult cousin on his mother 's side , petitioned a local juvenile court to order his return .
When the judge refused , Remines appealed her decision to a circuit court .
At a hearing that followed , three former Tranquility Bay students testified on Tyler 's behalf , and what they described was a Caribbean purgatory .
The food , they claimed , sometimes contained pubic hair and bugs .
Raw sewage spilled over into the boys ' shower area and " visible layers of dirt , grime , filth , mildew on the sides of the shower stalls " led to outbreaks of scabies .
Students who broke a rule against looking out the window were placed in " observation placement " forced to lie on the floor , sometimes for weeks at a time , and allowed to sit up only for food or a punitive round of 5,000 jumping jacks .
One of the witnesses , Aaron Kravig , reported that he was at Tranquility Bay in August 2001 , the month Valerie Heron died , and that he'd been forced to use a towel that had been used to clean up her remains .
The unwashed towel " had a spot of blood about , somewhere about the size of a dinner plate , " Kravig testified .
" There was some of her hair on it .
They used it to pick her head up ; I 'm pretty sure .
I told the staff about it and nothing was done . . . .
I had to dry off with that towel for about three weeks .
" Mitchell visited the school with his wife after he sent
Tyler there and testified that he 'd seen kids playing tennis and shooting hoops .
But the judge ordered Tyler home .
Shortly after his return , the boys ' relatives heard that Mitchell had threatened to send Tyler back .
Seven of them filed for custody .
Gini Remines said that Mitchell gave up and turned Tyler over to her .
" Tyler does n't talk about what happened at Tranquility Bay , " Remines said recently .
" All he 'll say was that it was a hellhole and he might have died in it . " " THE SCHOOL IS IN MEXICO ? "
Louis said when he noticed the highway signs on our drive south from San Diego .
" I thought it was in California . "
" I said we were coming to California , not that the school was there , " Strawn said .
" I was spoon - feeding you until we got here .
" Louis fell silent .
Ten minutes later , Strawn drove past a sign that looked like a middle - school art project , with " Mexico " written in green , red , and white .
It was now nearly noon .
A Mexican flag flapped over a ramshackle collection of buildings , and a film of dust and grit seemed to cloud the bright blue day .
Like a tour guide on autopilot , Strawn kept up a running commentary about the sights while his passenger stewed in the back seat .
" That 's a serious fence , " Strawn said , pointing to a 14 - foot - high barrier of sheet metal topped with electrical wires which marked the border .
" The school is just north of a town called Ensenada .
That 's your primary cruise destination .
"
On the dashboard of the Buick LeSabre he had rented for this leg of the journey , Strawn had installed a portable GPS system that Susan had given him for Christmas .
But it was n't working .
About a mile past the Mexican border , Strawn missed the Scenic Road exit to Ensenada and drove through Tijuana instead .
We passed palm trees and squat bushes with fire - red flowers .
Strawn braked at a stop sign that read " Alto , " muttering to himself as he tried to find his way back to the highway .
We were back on course and heading through a purple and yellow tollbooth by the time Louis spoke .
" What 's the name of the school I 'm going to ? " he asked as the ocean crashed against the shore near the passenger side of the car .
" Casa .
Casa by the Sea , " Strawn answered , and hummed the lyrics " down by the sea , " from the song " Under the Boardwalk . "
" Mi casa es su casa , " Dalton ad - libbed .
Strawn told Louis that the Casa grounds used to house a resort .
" The nice thing about resorts , " he mused , " they usually have walls around them .
They keep you from getting involved with the nuts around here , and keep them from you .
" A huge half - finished bust of Jesus loomed on a mountain outside the car .
Dalton began reminiscing about his time at Paradise Cove .
He mentioned that he used to hunt for octopus in the ocean .
Strawn pointed to the beach and said that students at Casa hung out there .
Louis asked why it was empty .
Strawn answered by changing the subject .
" You ought to get there about lunchtime , " he said with determined cheer .
" And I can tell you , those chubby Mexican women can do a number on some Mexican food .
" When a trip is winding down and a kid has been scared into compliance , there is a moment when Strawn likes to wax philosophical .
He cribs liberally from Stephen Covey , the author of the bestselling business guide Seven Habits of Highly Effective People .
He begins with a question : " Have you heard of counting from one to ten if you 're mad ?
Did that ever make sense to you ? "
Whatever the teen 's answer , Strawn says that it did n't make sense to himuntil he came across Covey 's idea that there is a " space " between stimulus and reaction .
To Strawn , that space is the difference between lashing out and maintaining control .
" I 've learned to spend time in that space when I get mad , " Strawn told Louis .
" And in the last seven years , I have n't slapped one person upside the head .
"
The talk works best when Strawn has something tangible to move to like the letters that parents often give him for their children .
The kids used to tear up the letters .
But they have n't since Strawn started telling them to spend more time in Covey 's " space " before doing anything rash .
The Boussards had n't written their son a letter , so Strawn did his best on his own to bring Louis around to their way of seeing things .
He told the boy not to be angry with his folks .
" It 's absolutely a sign of love for them to take the chance on what they believe will be the best for you , " said Strawn .
" When you grow up and have your own family you have to excuse me I hope you have the balls to do what your parents are doing for you .
" The off - white stucco walls and red shutters of Casa came into view , and a Mexican guard opened a red iron gate .
A line of teenagers wearing khaki pants and navy blue jackets walked across the courtyard in single file .
A few girls carried baskets full of laundry .
The smell of fried chicken wafted through the air .
A man in a white turtleneck pointed to Louis and said to Strawn , " This is the kid ? "
The man directed Louis to grab his bag .
Strawn handed a woman Louis 's paperwork his birth certificate , passport , and the contract with Casa that his parents had signed .
When Louis turned and walked away with the man in the white turtleneck , Strawn did n't say goodbye .
Then I asked if it was time for us to go and he rushed to catch up with the boy and gave him a hug .
Louis looked taken aback by the embrace and there was a moment of awkwardness .
Then he hugged back , hard .
Strawn collects those hugs .
They help him believe that he is saving , not savaging , the kids he steals away with in the night .
When we were back in the car , Strawn put on his sunglasses and lit a cigar , as he likes to do at the end of a trip .
He leaned forward in anticipation of the next stops along his journey a Cuban cigar shop in Tijuana and then a Mexican restaurant in San Diego .
He blew out a ring of smoke , and it was as if Louis had never been with us .
Rediff lends credulity to GooglePhone scuttlebutt .

Locally , however , all eyes will doubtless be on the 700 MHz spectrum sale , by which Google could bypass the cellular networks entirely in everyone 's fantasy telecom world .
Forget iPhone , GPhone is here [ Rediff ]
I keep a file of notes for ideas for potential postings in this weblog .
Here are the notes for one idea :
tired of PDF ( impedance mismatch between screen and page metaphor ; printed pg numbers vs. Acrobat ones ; marketing " fact sheets " in PDF -- why not HTML ? )
In a recent Mokka mit Schlag posting titled PDF killed the Programming Language , Elliotte Rusty Harold has beaten me to it ( managing to work in a nice Buggles pun as well ) , but I 'll add a few points .
I 'm tired of people who create content on a computer screen and deliver it for viewers to see on a computer screen with that content optimized for the printout that only gets printed when it 's time for their boss or art director to review it .
After all , real brochure - ware should look like a nice brochure when the customer wants to print it , right ?
Those customers do n't want to nearly as often as the art director may insist .
Customers read product fact sheets because they want to see the facts about the product , not because they want a hi-res view of some designer 's design skills .
Gratuitous use of PDF these days is in some ways worse than gratuitous use of Flash , because at least Flash is about creating things on a computer screen for viewing on a computer screen .
PDFs are bad for viewing on a computer screen .
Good things about PDFs
Adobe 's Why PDF ?
page lists some obvious advantages of PDF files .
( And , bless them , this page is HTML , not a PDF . )
They call it an " Open format " , but " open " here is software corporate - speak for " documented " , which is certainly a Good Thing , but not open in the sense of " to any outside influence " , which is what " open standard " means to most people , even ( finally ) to Sun .
The same page also lists " Multiplatform " , " Accessible " , and " Searchable " as advantages .
I can't argue with the first .
While I can't argue with " Accessible " either , I 'd be curious about the opinion of someone who studies these issues more closely .
" Searchable " I 'll take with a grain of salt — I know I can't write an application that could search through PDF files .
( Advocates of so - called " binary XML " forget that a key advantage of XML as defined in its spec is that , as a text - based format , writing code to search and manipulate it is very , very easy . )
Adobe also says that Acrobat files can " maintain information integrity " — I would n't have worded it the same way , but it can be an advantage to know that page breaks will happen in the exact same place with any viewer on any platform , if you really care about page breaks .
Many of my company 's clients really care about page breaks , because they 're publishers who have products that they send off to printing houses .
PDF minimizes so many worries about page layout , fonts , and other printer - related issues that for this purpose it 's a wonderful thing .
Still , while page fidelity is important in contracts and certain other documents , it should n't matter to a tutorial or product fact sheet .
In general , you can't edit PDFs , although Adobe wo n't list this as an advantage .
This is probably because it falls under " information integrity " , but more importantly , they have software that lets you edit it .
Few people own this software ( compared with the number of people who own PDF readers ) , so when you send a PDF to multiple people , you know they wo n't screw around with it .
Unless you 're deliberately asking for revisions to a document , sending a PDF is almost always better than sending a Word file .
If John sends a Word ( or HTML ) file to Jane and Jane forwards it to Jim , how does Jim know that Jane did n't alter it en route ?
I suppose that outside of the publishing industry the key advantage to PDF files these days is that they 're not Microsoft Word files .
In addition to not being able to edit them , people can't add macros to them that will screw up your computer .
When someone at my daughter 's school 's parent association sends a Word file of a flyer for some event , I wish that it was a PDF , but they do n't know any better .
My wife was very happy when I showed her PDFCreator , an open - source Windows program that appears in the printer menu of any program that can print and sends your output to a PDF file instead of a printer .
For more advanced use , OpenOffice and free and commercial XSL - FO implementations offer more PDF creation choices .
I think we can assume that the programmers that Elliotte mentions in his weblog posting are more technically sophisticated than the people running a typical primary school parents council , so they have less excuse for using PDF .
Bad things about PDFs
I want to focus on disadvantages of the PDF format itself , and not the Acrobat Viewer program .
Acrobat Viewer is free , but it 's big and slow and bloated , and as Adobe 's foot in my door it spends too much time reminding me about " critical " upgrades and trying to sell me things I do n't need .
However , you do n't have to use Acrobat Viewer to view your PDFs ; last June I discovered a nice alternative .
When you present printed pages on a glowing screen , there 's a certain impedance mismatch , and the advantages of fidelity to printed pages ( for example , knowing that when you say " bottom of page 12 " , it will mean the same to all viewers ) are often outweighed by the disadvantages .
I 'm especially tired of looking at on - screen representations of the gap between the bottom of one page and the top of another ; what good does this do for us ?
How about when Acrobat tells you that you 're looking at page 13 of a document , but the bottom of that page say " 15 " ?
Perhaps I could hunt through the twenty categories under " Edit Preferences " for some check box that lets me change this , but why do I need to ?
Come to think of it , when you say " bottom of page 12 " , maybe it does n't mean the same thing to all viewers .
In a comment on Elliotte 's posting , John Cowan points out that an article about a programming language , when written for ( or aspiring to ) a peer - reviewed journal article , is taken more seriously when it 's in PDF format .
That 's fine , but as Elliotte wrote of the offending web site , " it seems all their tutorials , manuals , white papers , and almost everything else are in PDF " .
There 's just too much PDF out there .
The number of FAQs alone that are in PDF instead of HTML is just shameful .
I think that companies that are large - scale publishers as a by - product of their main business are getting ready to move past PDF .
You 've heard of the jet fighter planes whose total printed documentation weighs more than one of the planes ?
Step one for easing the access of repair engineers to the relevant documentation — the process of putting it " online " , as they still call it — has been to create PDF versions of those books .
A CD or DVD full of PDFs is more convenient than a wallful of books to someone crawling around the inside of a plane 's engine compartment , but pictures of pages with all the negative issues described above are not the best way to present the relevant information to these repair engineers .
Designing a better interface for this content delivery is work , but more of these companies are realizing that the work is worth it .
Reliance on the page metaphor may be a symptom of the historical moment as we spend a few decades completing the transition from hard copy books to more sensible online delivery for the appropriate content .
( Note my little qualifier at the end of that sentence — I 'm sure that for novels read on the beach , bound hardcopy books will remain the best delivery medium for years to come . )
You could compare it to the state of movies before D.W. Griffith , when each film was little more than a single static shot of a filmed silent play .
Many publishers are now picking up hints that it 's time to move on from the page metaphor .
I recently attended some meetings in which publishers were discussing ways to control costs , and the first step is discussing ways to measure costs .
Cost per page is a classic measure in the publishing world , but everyone in the meeting agreed that it 's increasingly meaningless as more content is delivered online .
My former employer LexisNexis recently renamed the division of the company that creates books to Offline Products .
Considering that everyone used to consider online delivery to be an alternative to print delivery , it 's interesting that someone would now define print delivery as essentially being " not online " delivery .
Outside of diagrams accompanying patents , I do n't know of any content that LexisNexis deliver as PDFs , so they have the right idea .
A brief check around lexisnexis.com ( which unlike lexis.com or nexis.com is more of a marketing web site than a product delivery one ) did n't turn up any PDFs either , and those marketing types are usually the quickest to think that PDF is better than HTML .
Although this is a company that was founded to deliver content online , they 're still capable of being behind the curve on various technical issues ; it 's nice to see that they have their PDF / HTML priorities straight .
To summarize : PDF does n't make your content look slicker or more professional .
It may make the printed output look better , but make damn sure that most of your content 's readers intend to print it before reading it .
And , make an honest effort to create an HTML version that prints nicely .
Smart people are making progress on this front all the time .
This is a collection of somehow strange Russian tanks .
All of them were in production for some time in Russia , USSR or Russian Empire .
The one above is 1940 “ Self - moving machine gun emplacement point ” .
This one is 1930 dual tank – it has both wheels and tracks .
This one was made in Latvia when it was part of Russia in 1915 .
Looks like they were already familiar with eco-design basics .
Wow .
A flying tank !!!
It was a Russian T - 60 combined with Antonov plane , tested in 1942 during WW2 .
A personal tank ?
Was produced in 1941 .
It was engineered and produced for usage in World War I , in 1915 .
It was caled Tsar - Tank .
No full - size photo can be found .
This was a swimming tank with for tracks , back from 1965 .
Not really a tank but one of the first very armored trucks , from 1914 .

New poll shows majority of Americans think Cheney should be impeached
Enjoy this story ?
Get headlines instantly with RSS .
A new video released Friday morning makes a three - part case for the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney .
Robert Greenwald and Brave New Films released the short film at their website ImpeachCheney.org .
The video comes the same day that a polling firm found a majority of Americans supporting impeachment of the Vice President .
American Research Group , in a poll of 1,100 respondents taken from July 3 - 5 , found that 54 % of Americans favored impeachment .
Only 17 % of Republicans in the poll favored the impeachment of Cheney , while 76 % of Democrats supported the move in the House of Representatives .
However , of independents polled , a slight majority of 51 % , also supported impeaching the Vice President .
The poll also reflected deep disapproval of President George W. Bush 's commutation of Vice President Cheney 's former chief of staff , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
The Brave New Films video , which is presented below , selects key Cheney media appearances and speeches that correspond with the three allegations of ' high crimes and misdemeanors ' that are identified in H. Res. 333 .
The bill was introduced by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , and accuses the Vice President of promoting false intelligence about the danger of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction programs as well as the relationship between the Saddam Hussein regime and al Qaida terrorists .
It also accuses the Vice President of saber - rattling against Iran .
The film ends with Greenwald 's usual message of " pssst ... Do Something ! "

Despite the attack on the twin towers , plenty of skyscrapers are rising .
They are taller and more daring than ever , but still mostly monuments to magnificence
SKYSCRAPERS are hard to build and even harder to make money from .
Perhaps that is why they hold such an enduring fascination .
“ The problem of the tall office building ” , wrote Louis Sullivan in 1896 , “ is one of the most stupendous , one of the most magnificent opportunities that the Lord of Nature in His beneficence has ever offered to the proud spirit of man . ”
Sullivan , an architect , was enthusiastically observing Chicago at a time when steel - framed buildings clad in stone had reached greater heights than anything that had been built before .
But he could have been talking about New York in the 1920s , Hong Kong in the 1980s , or one of the booming cities in Asia that , according to Emporis , a firm which tracks skyscrapers , now lead a boom in high - rise building undaunted by the attack on the World Trade Centre in 2001 .
Roughly 8 % of the world 's stock of tall buildings is currently under construction , according to Emporis .
About 40 % of the world 's 200 tallest buildings have been completed since 2000 .
Skyscrapers pose stupendous problems to designers and developers because they have two powerful forces working against them .
The first is economic — exemplified by the number of big American companies that now prefer to operate from low - rise campuses built outside cities .
There are of course exceptions .
These tend to be large financial institutions , on which a skyscraper confers the permanence once embodied by marble halls and oak - panelled dining - rooms .
The second is physical : towers are always fighting against their own weight .
As more parts of the building are devoted to holding it up , they encroach on the space for working or living in .
Developers and leasing agents refer to the ratio between these two elements as a building 's “ net - to - gross ” .
In a really efficient skyscraper , nearly 70 % of the building 's volume is useable , with the rest taken up by lift - shafts , stairwells and pillars .
In a well designed low - rise building , by contrast , more than 80 % of the space can be sold or let .
These obstacles explain why , in each skyscraper boom , many more designs are proposed than built .
London , for example , has five towers over 200 metres ( 656 feet ) tall that either have planning permission or are in the planning process , by which stage they must have completed designs and a willing developer .
Yet only a couple of them are likely to be built .
Francis Salway , chief executive of Land Securities , a developer , predicts that “ between one and three ” will go up over the next decade .
A lot has still to happen before a tower can metamorphose from a design with enthusiastic backers into a few hundred metres of vertical glass and steel .
Penthouse envy
From a developer 's point of view , skyscrapers come in three varieties : speculative ventures , commissions for a company headquarters and government - sponsored exercises in gigantism .
Tall buildings cost more , so all three types depend on finding someone who is prepared to pay extra to look down on the neighbours .
Of these three types , towers built speculatively are the most common .
A developer finds an anchor tenant ( which reduces the risk of a flop ) , borrows the construction costs and looks to fill the rest of the building when it is near completion .
A lot of skyscrapers known by a company 's name came about like this :
Woolworth only ever took up two of the 57 floors of the Woolworth building in New York , for example — the rest was let out in smaller parcels .
The new New York Times building , due to be completed this year , will house the newspaper of the same name , but half of its 52 storeys will be let .
These skyscrapers are the riskiest of all and need a rare combination of factors to come together if they are to make money .
They include a short supply of land in a desirable location ( as in Hong Kong ) , zoning laws that preserve this scarcity and easy access to finance .
Other factors , like bedrock near the surface to drive foundations into , help to keep costs down .
The areas around Wall Street and midtown Manhattan have such favourable geology , which partly explains how New York looks .
But nature can be mastered : Chicago , home to the first skyscrapers , sits on mud ; Dubai 's giant towers are being built on sand .
Company headquarters , such as the HSBC and Citibank towers at Canary Wharf in east London , bend these rules but do not break them .
Because a single company occupies them , they are less subject to changes in the rental market .
Instead , they are part advertising hoarding , part management tool .
And for some companies , this is worth paying extra — which removes some of the constraints that apply to speculative towers .
Carol Willis , the curator of the Skyscraper Museum in New York , describes company towers as “ the Cadillacs of skyscraper design ” .
One company polishing the fins on its machine is Goldman Sachs , an investment bank that is not known for frittering away its shareholders ' money .
Goldman is building a tower in lower Manhattan , close to the controversial redevelopment of the World Trade Centre site , where the Freedom Tower and other buildings are planned .
Goldman 's aim is to bring together people from ten office buildings it has in New York .
The bank already has a tower a short distance away in New Jersey , but gleeful Manhattan property developers say that Goldman 's bankers refused to move to the cheaper office space just across the water .
For a bank , then , paying a premium to be near lots of other bankers can be worthwhile .
Government - backed towers discard most of these rules .
Whether built as a statement of economic intent ( as in Dubai , where much of the building frenzy is financed by companies backed by the government ) , or as a concrete index finger held up to the outside world ( the 330 - metre high Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang , North Korea ) , any city that aspires to be taken seriously wants a skyscraper or two .
Building skyscrapers for governments can lead to some odd results .
In Dubai , for example , skyscrapers stand one deep on either side of the Sheikh Zayed Road in the south of the city , with desert behind them stretching away into the distance .
The international skyscraper style , which involves using acres of glass , does not always make sense .
It works well in the parts of north America where it first appeared , but when transported to the Gulf , the giant greenhouses require a huge amount of energy to cool them and engineers have to find ways to keep the light out .
Some architects have proposed designs with concrete walls and small apertures that recall the screens in early Islamic architecture , but they have been rejected .
Skyscrapers do n't look like that .
Taller , lighter , stranger
The engineers who have to make the towers stand up , can build taller and stranger shapes only when technology permits .
Three sorts of changes have shaped the current wave of skyscraper design : materials , lifts and computing .
New materials have the most visible effect on skyscrapers ' looks .
In 1922 Ludwig Mies van der Rohe , a German architect who later moved to America , sketched a tower with a glass skin stretched around the floors of a translucent building that appeared to have no central core .
Not only would the building have fallen down , but it would have been impossible to make glass panels that were light enough or that could have been bent into the shapes that the design demanded .
“ It has taken 80 years for glass technology to catch up with what Mies was sketching , ” says Neven Sidor , of Grimshaw Architects .
Translucent towers , which aside from looking pretty also alleviate one of the worst things about skyscrapers — the long shadows they cast on the streets below — are now proposed by architects everywhere .
Thin - film technology ( coating the glass in glazes that repel heat , but let in light ) and self - cleaning glass are becoming standard .
And glass can be formed into shapes that now make Mies 's conceptual design look rather conservative , as at 30 St Mary Axe in London ( better known as the “ gherkin ” ) or the Hearst building in New York .
Other changes to materials have helped towers weigh less , which allows them to go higher .
Floors and walls have become thinner , thanks to innovations like slim - line insulation made of fibreglass and aluminium foil , an idea borrowed from containers used to transport blood .
This brings its own problems , though .
When a floor is really large , thin ones become like trampolines and engineers have to find ways to prevent the journey to the photocopier from becoming too bouncy .
Architects are also grappling with Mies 's other idea : dispensing with the central core , or breaking it up .
Skyscrapers up to 200 metres tall can stand up with a central core of steel and concrete that houses a building 's lifts and the plumbing for support services .
Any taller and the building needs outriggers , which provide support like the flying buttresses on a gothic cathedral .
This structure can apparently be extended heavenwards indefinitely .
The Burj Dubai is made up of a central core with outriggers .
It is determined to claim the title of tallest building in the world — so determined , in fact , that its final height is a secret and subject to elongation to keep ahead of would - be usurpers .
But some towers ( architects refer to them as tubes ) use a web of steel struts to transfer the building 's weight down to its foundations via a few large piers .
These buildings tend to be easy to spot — as with the HSBC building in Hong Kong , their architects like to flaunt their structural elements .
This allows the lift shafts to be broken up or even moved to the outside of the building .
The skyscrapers that result can look much lighter .
As materials have improved , it has become possible to go higher than the 509 - metre Taipei 101 tower , which is currently the world 's tallest building .
But engineers also have to work out how to get people to the top floors .
Tall buildings have always relied on changes to lifting technology to go higher — the first hydraulic lifts around 1870 made it possible to go higher than the steam - powered lifts they replaced .
Now , however , the constraints come less from the ability of a lift to travel half a kilometre vertically than from how long people must wait in the lobby for a lift to take them to the 50th floor .
That makes it necessary to find ways to speed up their journeys around the building .
Most tall towers now have at least two banks of lifts : one for the lower floors and one for the upper ones .
In the tallest towers in Asia ( home to eight of the world 's ten highest giants ) this still means waiting too long .
So engineers run two or more lifts in each lift shaft , and build “ sky lobbies ” where passengers cross between lifts if they want to go the whole way down or up .
These arrangements , whereby cappuccino - carrying office workers or hotel porters are directed to a particular lift according to where they want to go , are collectively known as “ hall call ” .
KONE , a Finnish lift company , is working on a lift system that sends text messages to people 's mobile phones as they enter a building , informing them to take lift five , say , if they want to go to their desk or lift seven if they want the café on the 60th floor .
Contemplating buildings this complicated has been possible in recent years only because computers have became powerful enough to build three - dimensional models that developers , architects , structural engineers , mechanical engineers and builders can all work on .
Before such computer systems arrived , design changes had to be made on several sets of drawings , which increased the chances of mistakes .
Strange shapes constructed at lower levels were possible before computers sped up .
But ambitious forms like the new 230 - metre China Central Television building in Beijing ( which looks a little like a bent croquet hoop ) needed computer processors to design .
Computers have made other things possible , too .
Engineers can use them to test how a building might stand up to a fire or an aeroplane crash .
When the main tower at Canary Wharf was proposed in the 1980s , according to Peter Bressington of Arup , an engineering firm that is a prolific builder of skyscrapers , nobody was able to predict accurately how long it would take to evacuate if a fire broke out .
Now Arup can run a simulation in which a fire starts on the 35th floor , one lift is out of action and a few thousand people have to get out , and see how long it takes .
As well as allowing skyscrapers to go taller , these changes have made them more efficient machines for living or working in and brought their running costs down .
Since the construction of the Commerzbank building in Frankfurt ( which is reckoned to be the first green tower ) in 1997 , architects and some planning authorities have pushed environmental designs .
In New York , for example , planners now insist that developers build skyscrapers that conform to tough standards set by the Green Building Council .
Boosters argue that green designs improve the productivity of their inhabitants .
Workers with access to natural light and fresh air that has not circulated endlessly through a building 's air - conditioning system seem to get ill less often and avoid symptoms of “ sick - building syndrome ” associated with the sealed towers built in the 1970s , when energy costs were high .
Building green is more expensive .
But developers can demand a premium — partly because of the value to companies of being seen to be green and partly because such buildings use at least 35 % less energy .
The new Bank of America tower in New York is an example .
According to its developers , the building will act as a giant air filter , sucking in dirty air from the city , cleaning it up and eventually sending it out cleaner .
It will also have a heat - exchange system whereby heat produced by sunshine , people , computers and lights will be used to make ice , which in turn will be used to cool the offices the following day .
“ The pitch ” , says one Manhattan - based developer , “ is higher productivity , lower energy costs , nicer places to work . ”
Yet all this innovation has not altered the biggest obstacle to towers built speculatively : the vagaries of the property cycle .
Developers make money through good timing , releasing office space on to the market when it is picking up and prices are rising .
But because skyscrapers take much longer to go from a design to occupancy , it is hard to get the timing right .
The first big attempt to study historical patterns in commercial property markets was made by two economists in the 1930s .
Homer Hoyt and Roy Wenzlick looked at the market for office space in Chicago and found that big profits made by developers early in each cycle encouraged further building .
This led to oversupply in the market and falling rents .
Monoliths and markets
Skyscrapers have an unfortunate habit of being finished just as the market starts to drop .
The Chrysler building was being completed when the tumble of Wall Street became the crash of 1929 ; the Empire State in the nadir of the Depression ( in 1934 , a quarter was vacant , hence its nickname : the Empty State building ) .
Work by Jason Barr of Rutgers University suggests that over the 20th century the tallest skyscrapers in New York have been completed at around the time when America 's economy was about to turn downwards ( see chart ) .
It is hard to know if this will hold true for the Asian cities that are now leading the way in skyscraper enthusiasm , since strong demand in the office market has not been around for long enough .
Yet the timing of the 452 - metre Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur , which were completed a year after the East Asian financial crisis began in 1997 , suggests it might .
It seems to apply to some other cities , as the history of skyscrapers in London shows .
London 's office market headed down in 1974 , 1982 , 1990 and 2002 .
The two most recent tumbles were marked by the completion of well - known skyscrapers : the main Canary Wharf tower in 1991 and 30 St Mary Axe in 2003 .
Skyscrapers in London take between five and ten years to go from idea to income , and each cycle lasts for some ten years .
This makes it “ virtually impossible to get the timing right on tall buildings , ” according to Peter Damesick of CB Richard Ellis , a property agent .
Perhaps it is this defiance of gravity and the market that makes skyscrapers so alluring and explains why people continue to want to build them .
Publicity for the Empire State Building claimed the feeling of looking out from its viewing gallery was better than air travel .
Nobody explained that the platform was there only because the space could not be sold .
IN CONGRESS , JULY 4 , 1776 :
When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature 's God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation .
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . —
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .
—
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies ; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government .
The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations , all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States .
To prove this , let Facts be submitted to a candid world .
He has refused his Assent to Laws , the most wholesome and necessary for the public good .
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance , unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained ; and when so suspended , he has utterly neglected to attend to them .
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people , unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature , a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only .
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual , uncomfortable , and distant from the depository of their Public Records , for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures .
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly , for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people .
He has refused for a long time , after such dissolutions , to cause others to be elected , whereby the Legislative Powers , incapable of Annihilation , have returned to the People at large for their exercise ; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without , and convulsions within .
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States ; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners ; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither , and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands .
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers .
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices , and the amount and payment of their salaries .
He has erected a multitude of New Offices , and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance .
He has kept among us , in times of peace , Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures .
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power .
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution , and unacknowledged by our laws ; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation :
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us :
For protecting them , by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States : For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world :
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent : For depriving us in many cases , of the benefit of Trial by Jury : For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences :
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province , establishing therein an Arbitrary government , and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies For taking away our Charters , abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments :
For suspending our own Legislatures , and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever .
He has abdicated Government here , by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us .
He has plundered our seas , ravaged our coasts , burnt our towns , and destroyed the lives of our people .
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death , desolation , and tyranny , already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages , and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation .
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country , to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren , or to fall themselves by their Hands .
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us , and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers , the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare , is an undistinguished destruction of all ages , sexes and conditions .
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms :
Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury .
A Prince , whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant , is unfit to be the ruler of a free people .
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren .
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us .
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here .
We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity , and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations , which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Drinking three or more cups of coffee a day may cut the risk of colon cancer in women by half , according to a study by Japanese scientists .
Researchers from Tokyo’s National Cancer Center studied data from more than 96,000 men and women aged between 40 - 69 over a period of up to 12 years from 1990 , a member of the team said on Wednesday .
They found no significant benefit in men .
Even after adjusting for other factors including diet and exercise , they found that women who drank three or more cups of coffee a day had half the risk of developing colon cancer , compared with those who drank no coffee at all .
The researchers , whose findings have been published in the International Journal of Cancer , did not find any link between consumption of green tea and colon cancer .
“ In Japan , almost all the male population drinks alcohol and there are a large number of smokers , ” said Manami Inoue of the research team .
“ There may be some benefit from coffee for men , but it may be that we were unable to adjust for these factors . ”
The mechanism by which coffee may prevent cancer is unknown , Inoue said .
The caffeine it contains could stimulate the working of the colon , or the effect could be due to coffee ’s antioxidant properties , she said .
“ Some people cannot tolerate caffeine , so they should not force themselves to drink coffee .
But for people who like it , there is no reason to give it up , ” Inoue said .
The recent collapse of Ginko Financial , a " virtual investment bank " in Second Life , has spurred calls for more oversight , transparency and accountability , especially when it comes to business practices in the metaverse .
Last week , Ginko Financial – an unregulated bank that promised investors astronomical returns ( in excess of 40 percent ) and was run by a faceless owner whose identity is still a mystery – announced it would no longer exist as a financial entity .
The declared insolvency meant the bank would be unable to repay approximately 200,000,000 Lindens ( U.S. $ 750,000 ) to Second Life residents who had invested their money with the bank over the course of its three and a half years of existence .
" You have to remember , there 's not a lot of places to put your money in Second Life , " said Benjamin Duranske , a lawyer who publishes Virtually Blind , a blog that chronicles virtual laws and legal issues that impact worlds like Second Life .
" When you have disposable income and a bank that 's promising a 60 percent return on deposits , that alluring – especially if it works for a while . "
Quickly following this news , a tidal wave of backlash took shape from thousands of angry Second Lifers in SL forums .
Yet in many ways , the undoing of Ginko and the collective loss of more than 750,000 very real U.S. dollars is only the latest event hammering home the fact that the lawlessness of the virtual land has its drawbacks .
Indeed , after Linden Lab , the owner and operator of Second Life , invited the FBI to investigate casino activity , the company subsequently instituted a ban on all gambling earlier this month .
On Tuesday , Linden Lab itself issued a statement trying to clarify its stance on regulations and Second Life 's virtual economy .
" Linden Lab does not intend to recreate or subvert real - world laws in any way , " the statement says .
" We caution our residents to be wary of anyone offering extremely high interest rates at no risk , either in the real world or in Second Life – if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is . "
The response was timely , considering Second Life currently has 20 to 30 banks that operate essentially the same way Ginko did .
That fact , plus the large losses associated with Ginko , has led to a growing call for even more transparency and regulation among SL residents .
Duranske is at the forefront of the movement .
An intellectual property lawyer who 's taking time off from his practice to work on a book about virtual law , he was one of the first people to jump on the shady business dealings at Ginko Financial more than two months ago .
Indeed , his blog has one of the most comprehensive accounts of Ginko 's downfall .
Duranske claims he 's personally talked with a few SL residents who have lost as much as $ 10,000 in the Ginko scheme , but estimates that the majority lost a more moderate amount–somewhere in the range of $ 50 to $ 100 .
" A lot of people forget , Second Life is governed by U.S. law and the laws of California , " Duranske explained .
" It just so happens that these laws have n't been enforced . "
But that 's about to change .
Duranske says because Ginko has received so much press lately , the bank , as well as others , will inevitably become an issue that Linden Lab will have to tackle .
That either means self - regulation or more federal intervention .
He 's hoping it wo n't come to the latter .
Robert Bloomfield , an accounting professor at Cornell University , is of the same mind .
Bloomfield says the collapse of Ginko and the recent closing of casinos , among other incidents of alleged fraud , are shocks to participants in the Second Life financial sector .
That said , Bloomfield believes residents are already responding by creating a variety of oversight institutions of their own , including companies that insure against fraud and homegrown regulatory institutions like the Second Life Exchange Commission , which is modeling itself on the SEC .
" It will be very interesting to see which organizations survive ( if any ) , and how they reduce the risk of fraud , " he said in an e-mail .
Bloomfield admits he 's getting in on the act on a personal level and has forged an ongoing agreement with two Second Life - based stock exchanges , the International Stock Exchange and the SL Capital Exchange ( formerly AVIX ) that will provide him with comprehensive data on trading histories for all listed firms .
He expects to publish analyses of that data in the near future and says such information could very well be another important step toward transparency .
In the end , Bloomflield says SL 's financial and business sector can teach us a lot about the nature of regulation and oversight .
Even with the unfortunate case of Ginko , he still believes the intervention of real - world regulation is remote .
" I am really hoping that RL ( real life ) regulation does not come to SL because right now SL has the chance to sort out what type of oversight and regulation it wants , " Bloomfield said .
" If the RL authorities or Linden Lab do start meddling with business affairs , it could ruin a golden opportunity for real innovation and creativity , a chance to recreate a world in a new image . "
Update :
The practical incompatibilities between Python 2 and Python 3 in the end turned out much smaller than what was initially claimed would be the case .
For more information see my free online book Porting to Python 3 which contains information on how to support both Python 2 and Python 3 .
There is some discussion in Python community about the move to Python 3000 .
Basically it ’s between people who are worried about it and those who are n’t .
There is a definite risk involved in breaking the backwards compatibility , and that is if you end up making it very difficult to make code that runs on both versions , as this is going to effectively stop people from moving to the new version .
This is not unique to Python , it is a general problem , just look at Zope3 , where it ’s impossible to make code that runs on both systems .
Some people are tired of hearing this being raised as an issue , but other people are tired of hearing it being brushed away .
This IS an issue .
Do n’t brush it off by saying “ look we ’re trying our best ” or “ stay on Python 2.5 then if you like it so much ” .
Because the risk is just that people do stay on Python 2.5 .
And then you have TWO languages and TWO communities competing for resources .
And that is a huge issue .
The Py3 K project is of course completely aware of this , and is trying to address in two ways .
Firstly by introducing forward compatibility in 2.6 , and secondly by having a converter , so that you write Python 2 code , and run it through a converter to make it Python 3 code , and then release different releases .
The code converter is great for those who have good unit tests , and use binary eggs for releasing ( as they will have to make different releases for different versions anyway ) .
For everyone else , it adds quite a lot of extra work and complexity , and that complexity will most likely be too much for people to bother about it .
And that means that this issue hinges on how easy it is to write code that runs directly under both 2.6 and 3.x without conversion .
If that ’s easy , all is well .
If it turns out to be difficult , we have a problem .
And the major issue here is this statement from the PEP 3000 :
There is no requirement that Python 2.6 code will run unmodified on Python 3.0 .
Not even a subset .
( Of course there will be a tiny subset , but it will be missing major functionality . )
There may not be a requirement in the PEP , but it IS a requirement from Python developers .
If we really end up in the situation that it is practically impossible to write useful code that works under both Python 2 and Python 3 , the transition to Python 3 will quite likely never happen .
And that ’s bad .
But that ’s theory .
How is the reality ?
Well , it looks better than PEP 3000 does .
Most things in Python 3 can be introduced into Python 2 without any problems .
The new I/O library and new names for CamelCased libraries should be easy .
The 0o777 format for octals is also easy to support , a “ from __forwards__ import print ” should enable the new print ( ) function instead of the print statement and so on .
There are some obvious problems as well .
That 1/2 returns 0.5 in Python 3 , but will return 0 in Python 2.6 will be a compatibility issue , but it ’s solvable by writing 1//2 , which will return the same thing in both .
Many functions that today return lists will in Python 3 return iterables , but that can be fixed by doing list ( dictionary.keys ( ) ) to make sure it ’s really a list , if you use it like that .
Another issue like that is unicode strings .
In Python 2.6 , ‘…’ will be ascii / binary and u ’…’ will be unicode .
In Python 3 , ‘… ’ will be unicode , and b’… ’ used for binary , and there will be no ascii strings as such .
This is a good change , but unless the u’…’ syntax is supported in Python 3 , and the b’… ’ syntax in Python 2.6 , you will have to type Unicode ( [ 0x7f , 0x45 , 0x4c , 0x46 , 0x01 , 0x01 , 0x01 , 0x00 ] ) and bytes ( [ 0x7f , 0x45 , 0x4c , 0x46 , 0x01 , 0x01 , 0x01 , 0x00 ] ) , which is very ugly , and hard to convert to .
This will practically stop anybody using either strings for bytes , or unicode in Python 2.6 to move to Python 3 without also dropping support for Python 2 .
It ’s not clear that u’… ’ is going to be supported in Python 3 , and neither that b’… ’ is going to be supported in 2.6 , but both should be possible to support with little effort , so lets hope they are .
If this type of “ pseudo - backwards compatibility ” is n’t going to be supported , one alternative way forward is to use Python 2.7 and 2.8 to drop backwards compatibility in steps .
That is , just as Python 2.6 introduce some 3.0 features into 2.6 while being compatible with 2.5 , but not 2.4 , Python 2.7 could introduce more 3.0 features , while being compatible iwth 2.6 but not 25 .
And 2.8 could be incompatible with 2.6 , but compatible with 2.7 and 3.0 .
That introduces a gradual movement to 3.0 , so that it is always possible to support two python versions with one set of code .
This however requires a conversion process that is more than one step and is thus less desireable .
So the major issue here is how many little compatibility problems like that will pop up , and how easy it is to get around them .
If there are n’t too many , then all is well .
If they turn out to be many , then it ’s a problem .
Where the limit between “ many ” and “ few ” goes is largely a matter of taste , and therefore there is no answer to this , and there will not be an answer to this until sometime after Python 3 is released and we see how the community reacts .
Basically , if the community ends up saying “ I ca n’t write code that supports both 3.0 and 2.x ” , the community will either stay on 2.x forever .
And that ’s not just a problem for the community , and that does n’t just mean that the Python 3000 effort has been wasted .
It will also act as discouraging to new programmers , who may simply not get into Python at all , saying that “ Python 2 is old and unsupported and Python 3 has no software ” .
For me , it ’s looking good .
I ca n’t find that many obvious problems that is n’t easily fixable .
But I ’m not the community , I ’m just me .
So do n’t brush the issue aside , because if you do , there is a high risk that this potential problems turns real .
There HAS to be a way to go from Python 2 to Python 3 without dropping Python 2 support completely .
A complete disruption WILL be damaging to Python as a whole .

Pelosi : Democrats will hold Bush ' accountable , ' despite inability to end war , unwillingness to impeach Mike Aivaz and Nick Juliano

Nine months after taking control of the House , Nancy Pelosi is taking credit for " changing the debate " on the war while in Iraq there are 30,000 more troops than on the day the San Francisco Democrat first rapped the Speaker 's gavel .
As to cries from liberal activists to impeach President Bush and / or Vice President Dick Cheney , such suggestions remain strictly verboten .
" I 've always said that impeachment is off the table , " Pelosi said Tuesday at the tail end of an interview with CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .
" This is President Bush 's war ; it 's Vice President Cheney 's war , and now it 's become the war of the Republicans in Congress . "
Pelosi blamed the closely divided Senate for preventing passage of meaningful reforms in the Iraq war strategy and claimed she did not have the political clout or Constitutional authority to unilaterally cut war funding .
" I wish the Speaker had all the power you just described , " she scolded Blitzer , when he suggested the House simply cut off funding for the war .
" I certainly could do that .
That does n't bar the minority from bringing up a funding resolution .
They have their parliamentary prerogatives as well . "
The president vetoed a bill that called for troop redeployment earlier this year , and Pelosi blamed Republicans in the Senate for blocking any bills that attempted to change course in Iraq , such as a recent measure that would have guaranteed troops as much time out at home as they spent at war .
It failed to receive a necessary 60 votes to move out of the Senate .
CNN host asks : Are Democrats just ' complaining ' ?
Blitzer asked if Pelosi was simply " telling your angry base " that " there 's nothing you can do " given Republican obstructionism .
" How could you have ever gotten that impression ? "
Pelosi lectured Blitzer , adding condescendingly " for those who pay attention " that she said Democrats will " hold this administration accountable , time and time again for the conduct of this war . "
The CNN host persisted , " When you hold the president accountable , I want you to to explain , What does that mean besides just complaining and holding hearings ? "
Pelosi pivoted to the importance of oversight and reiterated the Democrats ' vision of " stability " in Iraq spurred by a troop withdrawal , while accusing Republicans of favoring a " 10 - year war " and aiming for a " Korea - like presence , in perpetuity . "

A man has been charged in Carlisle , Pennsylvania with filming police officers during a routine traffic stop and faces up to seven years in prison for " wiretapping " .
Brian D. Kelly is charged under a state law that bars the intentional interception or recording of anyone 's oral conversation without their consent , reports the Patriot News .
The criminal case relates to the sound , not the pictures , that his camera picked up .
His camera and film were seized by police during the May 24 stop , he said , and he spent 26 hours in Cumberland County Prison until his mother posted her house as security for his $ 2,500 bail .
Police also took film from his pockets that was n't related to the traffic stop , he said .
Kelly , just 18 years old , is obviously extremely scared and has apologized profusely for not knowing the law .
He has sought the help of the ACLU in the case .
The charge is invalid because it flouts privacy laws .
Under the fourth amendment the expectation of privacy is not reasonable at such public places as automobile thoroughfares .
In other words filming on a public highway cannot be classed as an invasion of privacy .
Furthermore , the expectation of privacy is not reasonable if there exists a vantage point from which anyone , not just a police officer , can see or hear what is going on .
Charging someone with wiretapping for filming on a public highway in this sense would be akin to charging someone with arson for cooking burgers on a grill .
The charge also becomes bogus because the " wiretapping " law is not adhered to by police officers themselves .
An exception to the wiretapping law allows police to film people during traffic stops .
In addition police routinely carry microphones that are wired up to their vehicles to record conversations without the knowledge of anyone whom they stop or question .
This is not the first time this has happened either .
Last year a North Middleton Twp. man was charged in a street racing case that involved a wiretapping charge .
Police claimed the man ordered associates to tape police breaking up an illegal race after officers told him to turn off their cameras .
Furthermore , just last month a 48 - year - old man from Dover , New Hampshire was arrested for " wiretapping " for allegedly recording police while they were investigating him for driving while intoxicated .
In addition we have previously covered stories where camera crews have been threatened with arrest for filming peaceful demonstrations , and where cops have been caught stealing protestor 's cameras .
Filming in public is a right every American citizen has under the first amendment , which is why the cops in the case above had to steal the camera and the footage , because there was no legal basis to seize it .
It seems that filming and photographing is now deemed to be a threat per se .
Pick from any number of stories archived at www.freedomtophotograph.com for example .
In Seattle , police banned a photography student from a public park .
He was taking photographs of a bridge for a homework assignment .
The officers who ban him from the park do so without the knowledge of park officials and have no authority to do so .
In Texas a man was first threatened by neighbors and then reportedly accosted and sprayed with pepper spray by police .
He was walking around his neighborhood , filming with his new video camera .
In New York , National Press Photographers Association members staged a protest in the New York subway system to bring attention to a proposed law to ban photography in the subway system .
In Philadelphia a magazine photographer was detained and questioned after a parade for taking architectural shots while waiting for a subway train .
In Harrisburg , PA a man was swarmed by 8 Police and accused of being a member of Al - Qaeda after shooting pictures of his new car under a bridge .
We have recently exposed how some police now do not understand that they are violating the rights of individuals .
In other cases we have witnessed police pull out pocket constitutions from cars and question their legality .
In addition we have a government which has been mired in scandal for wiretapping US citizens without warrant , yet when the tables are turned US citizens face the full wrath of the corrupt judicial system .
Though clearly Brian D. Kelly had no criminal intent and is likely to escape with just a fine , the case sets a dangerous precedent .
US citizens can be arrested and charged for filming on public streets .
It also sets the precedent that those who enforce the law are also above the law .

From the comment -
The Bush administration has opened this Pandora ’s Box about Iraq .
It has found its scapegoats : Hillary Clinton and us .
The lies and terror tactics with which it deluded this country into war — they had nothing to do with the abomination that Iraq has become .
It is n’t Mr. Bush ’s fault .
The selection of the wrong war , in the wrong time , in the wrong place — the most disastrous geopolitical tactic since Austria - Hungary attacked Serbia in 1914 and destroyed itself in the process — that had nothing to do with the overwhelming crisis Iraq has become .
It is n’t Mr. Bush ’s fault .
The criminal lack of planning for the war — the total " jump - off - a- bridge - and - hope - you - can - fly " tone to the failure to anticipate what would follow the deposing of Saddam Hussein — that had nothing to do with the chaos in which Iraq has been enveloped .
It is n’t Mr. Bush ’s fault .
The utter , blinkered idiocy of " staying the course , " of sending Americans to Iraq and sending them a second time , and a third and a fourth , until they get killed or maimed — the utter de-prioritization of human life , simply so a politician can avoid having to admit a mistake — that had nothing to do with the tens of thousand individual tragedies darkening the lives of American families , forever .
It is n’t Mr. Bush ’s fault .
The continuing , relentless , remorseless , corrupt and cynical insistence that this conflict somehow is defeating or containing or just engaging the people who attacked us on 9/11 , the total " Alice Through the Looking Glass " quality that ignores that in Iraq , we have made the world safer for al - Qaida — it is n’t Mr. Bush ’s fault !
The fault , brought down , as if a sermon from this mount of hypocrisy and slaughter by a nearly anonymous undersecretary of defense , has tonight been laid on the doorstep of ...
Sen. Hillary Clinton and , by extension , at the doorstep of every American — the now - vast majority of us — who have dared to criticize this war or protest it or merely ask questions about it or simply , plaintively , innocently , honestly , plead , " Do n’t take my son ; do n’t take my daughter . "
OSLO ( Reuters ) - Norway took steps on Friday to crack down on circumcision of girls by barring families from traveling abroad if officials suspect they plan to have the procedure done outside the country .
The intervention followed reports in Norwegian media that at least 185 girls from Norway -- daughters of immigrants -- had their genitals cut in just one village in Somalia .
The government said it would refuse passports to families suspected of sending girls abroad to have the procedure carried out .
Authorities can also forbid a family from traveling if they suspect the purpose is female circumcision , officials said .
“ Today ’s decision is about how to prevent children from being subject to genital mutilation , ” Astri Aas - Hansen , a senior official at the Ministry of Justice and Police , told Reuters .
“ This is violence , ” she said .
Justice Minister Knut Storgberget told Norwegian NTB newswire that officials would not block people from traveling based only on their skin color or destination .
“ The authorities must have concrete suspicions that circumcision is planned to be able to deny a passport , ” he said .
Genital cutting , sometimes referred to as female genital mutilation or circumcision , is banned in Norway and arouses widespread horror in the West but is a rite of passage for young women in many countries , predominantly in Africa .
It also occurs in some Middle Eastern countries , such as Saudi Arabia , in some immigrant communities in Europe and North America and in parts of Asia , including Indonesia .
The practice usually involves removing part or all of the clitoris and other parts of the female genitalia .
Many of the practitioners are untrained and use crude instruments , making the practice life - threatening .
The Norwegian government is also considering mandatory check - ups for girls to weed out the practice .
In the last three years , Oslo ’s university hospital has treated 260 children and women for health problems tied to genital mutilation , some as young as 10 or 11 years old .
Less than 20 paces away , stuck to a wall on the way to the beach , there is a death notice of the sort you encounter throughout southern Europe .
The text underneath a black cross notes that one Enzo Cotroneo is " missing from the affection of his loved ones " .
It omits to say that he died in a midnight ambush just a few days earlier .
Cotroneo , the striker of the local football team , was driving his VW Golf down a wooded lane just outside Bianco when another car forced him over .
Carabinieri say at least three people were involved in shooting him dead .
On the morning after he met his bloody end , Cotroneo was meant to have been at an appointment with detectives investigating the slaying of a prominent regional politician , Francesco Fortugno .
Fortugno , the deputy speaker of the regional parliament , was shot dead last October 16 as he walked into the town hall of nearby Locri .
The killer , dressed in black and with his face obscured by a cap , followed him into the building and put five bullets into him before fleeing to a waiting car .
The assassination was the 23rd murder in or around Locri in just 14 months ; Cotroneo may have known something about the men who carried it out ; his subsequent murder ensured he would never talk .
Visiting Calabria after the assassination of Fortugno , Italy 's then interior minister blamed it on the local mafia , the ' Ndrangheta , which he said was " the most deep - rooted , the most powerful and the most aggressive of [ Italy 's ] criminal organisations " .
Just pause to consider that remark .
We are talking about the homeland of the Mafia - Sicily 's Cosa Nostra .
Are the Italian authorities really saying that a criminal fraternity few people have heard of ( and the name of which even fewer could pronounce ) is now more of a threat than the world 's most fabled " mob " ?
Behind his desk at the National Antimafia Directorate on the cobbled Via Giulia , in the heart of Rome 's historic centre , Enzo Macri gives a sigh .
" We 've been saying it for years , " he says .
Macri , himself a Calabrian , is the prosecutor colleagues say understands the ' Ndrangheta better than anyone .
Cosa Nostra , perhaps because of its links to the United States , and in no small measure because of the Godfather books and films , continues to exercise an irresistible fascination .
It was demonstrated most recently by the publicity given to the arrest of its " boss of bosses " , Bernardo Provenzano .
But the evidence suggests that , while the Sicilian Mafia , like the US Mafia , has been fading to a shadow of its former self , the little - known ' Ndrangheta ( pronounced " en-drang - ay - ta " ) has been taking over as Italy 's true public enemy number one and has become a criminal empire with global clout .
For a start , it is bigger than the Mafia .
Most estimates put its strength at 6,000 - 7,000 men against 5,000 for Sicily 's Cosa Nostra .
But Nicola Gratteri , a prosecutor who has specialised in tracing the Calabrian syndicate 's international ramifications , reckons the figure for the ' Ndrangheta is an underestimate .
" Altogether in the world , I would say it has maybe 10,000 members , " he says at his office in the regional capital , Reggio Calabria .
As with the Mafia , the ' Ndrangheta 's tentacles have spread thanks to emigration from Italy .
In the period running up to 1925 , dirt - poor Calabria lost more of its population than Sicily and more indeed than all but two of Italy 's 20 regions .
There was another massive outflow of Calabrians after the second world war , with the result that there are large communities of Calabrian descent - and remote outposts of the ' Ndrangheta - in Latin America , Canada and Australia .
The links with Latin America have proved particularly important , for they have helped the ' Ndrangheta to become a leading player in the global cocaine trade .
Gratteri estimates that 80 % of the cocaine entering Europe today is brought in by Calabrian mobsters .
" The ' Ndrangheta , " says Macri , " represents the globalisation of Italian organised crime . "
Despite the ' Ndrangheta 's new - found international prominence , its origins , as with all Italy 's organised crime syndicates , remain obscure .
Its name , like many dialect terms in Calabria , seems to be of Greek origin .
It has been variously translated as referring to courage , loyalty and nobility .
According to the FBI , the ' Ndrangheta was formed in the 1860s by a band of Sicilians exiled from their native island - an explanation that could mean the organisation grew out of the original Mafia .
At all events , court documents in the latter part of the 19th century increasingly reflected the existence of organised gangs in and around the main centres of population , and in 1888 the prefect of Reggio Calabria received a letter from an anonymous informant alerting him to the presence of " a sect that fears nothing " .
For almost a century , the 'Ndrangheta remained a local phenomenon - an evil , but essentially containable brew of rural banditry , urban racketeering and extortion .
Then , in 1975 , the murder of a local godfather at Locri signalled the beginning of a gang war that would transform the organisation at the cost of some 300 lives .
A young , rebellious and ultimately successful faction aspired to more profitable activities , notably the kidnapping of northern Italian businessmen .
Their luckless victims were brought back to Aspromonte , the uplands that form the rocky , rugged heart of Calabria , and hidden in caves until their families or firms could get together the ransom .
The profits were immense .
Looking around for something in which to reinvest their new - found fortunes , the 'ndrine , or clans , of the eastern , Ionian coast hit upon narcotics .
" They had the means with which to buy heroin from the Turks , hashish from the Moroccans and a variety of drugs and arms in the Lebanon , " says Gratteri .
" Then , at the start of the 1990s , there was a fundamental shift in the drugs market .
Largely because of Aids , there was a sharp drop in the demand for heroin , which was accompanied by an equal sharp increase in rise in the demand for cocaine . "
At first , the ' Ndrangheta gangs bought most of their cocaine from the then more powerful and pervasive Cosa Nostra , which already had links with the Colombian cartels .
But it was not long before they were trading directly with the Latin Americans and by the end of the 1990s , the ' Ndrangheta had a network of local representatives established in Colombia .
" The Colombians prefer to deal with the Calabrians , " says Macri .
" They are much more reliable .
They do n't talk .
And they pay on time . "
In more than one respect , indeed , the ' Ndrangheta resembles the Sicilian Mafia as it once was .
It is murderously querulous .
The socalled second ' Ndrangheta war of 1985 - 91 cost more than 700 lives .
Disputes even within small ' clans ' can lead to public bloodbaths of a kind the Sicilian Mafia nowadays does its best to avoid .
Six years ago , at the height of a dispute over control of the local drugs trade , a hit squad armed with pistols and a Kalashnikov cut down three alleged members of a rival faction , including ' Ndrangheta boss Salvatore Valente , 39 , in the village of Strongoli near Crotone .
A 73 - yearold pensioner sitting on a bench was shot and killed in the crossfire of a three - way shootout in which a Carabiniere officer was also injured .
At the same time , the ' Ndrangheta is punctilious in its observance of old - fashioned underworld values .
Just how old - fashioned those values can be was underscored in March with the arrest of the nephew of Giuseppe Morabito , known as Peppe Tiradritto ( Joe Go-ahead ) , allegedly one of the syndicate 's most feared godfathers .
This nephew , Giovanni Morabito , gave himself up , admitting he had just shot and hideously wounded his sister , who was separated from her husband , after discovering that she was pregnant by another man .
Bruna Morabito , who was shot in the face , was last reported by her doctors to have emerged from a coma but was only able to respond to them with nods .
This brutal , old - fashioned code of conduct has made combating this new mafia extremely difficult .
The ' Ndrangheta , an exasperated Florida district attorney once said , is " invisible , like the dark side of the moon " .
Of all Italy 's organised criminal groups , it has proved the most difficult to understand , let alone penetrate .
Like the others , it is known to initiate its members with rituals that vary from clan to clan and are meant to bind them to silence for life .
As with the others , it has a system of ranks which in the case of some ' ndrine have a distinctly blasphemous ring : one of the most senior posts is that of Vangelo ( " Gospel " ) .
But whereas the Sicilian Mafia , the Neapolitan Camorra and the Sacra Corona Unita in Puglia are made up of " families " or " clans " that are really just gangs in which there is no need for the members to be related , the ' Ndrangheta is held together almost entirely by actual blood relationships .
Most of its 'ndrine consist of extended families , often linked by marriage to form bigger units known as locali .
" ' Ndrangheta families have often arranged weddings to solder the links between them , " says Gratteri .
" There are families that have intermarried as many as four times in the 20th century . "
Sons are not just expected , but in most cases required , to follow their fathers into the family business , receiving - sometimes at birth - the title of Giovane d'onore ( young man of honour ) .
The overlap between criminal and family loyalties has made the ' Ndrangheta peculiarly impervious to the sharpest weapon in the Italian state 's anti-mob armoury .
Legislation introduced by the Italian government in the early 1990s made it easier for Mafiosi to turn state 's evidence and become so - called pentiti ( literally , penitents ) .
The new arrangements have wrought havoc in the ranks of Cosa Nostra , but scarcely bruised the ' Ndrangheta .
" A Calabrian mobster considering turning state 's evidence has to come to terms with betraying maybe 200 of his relatives , " says Gratteri .
" There have been ' Ndrangheta pentiti , " says Macri .
" But we have never had a boss turn state 's evidence ; they have always been low - to medium - ranking mobsters . "
Another factor protecting the organisation is its structure , or lack of one .
" Cosa Nostra is a pyramid , " says Macri .
" Cut off the top of the pyramid by arresting its leader and it has big problems .
In Calabria , on the other hand , what you have is a federation .
There are moments when some of the elements in the federation will come together , but it is more than anything for purposes of coordination .
The ' Ndrangheta can not be beheaded . "
The Italian authorities reckon that the new mafia 's turnover - estimated at  35bn ( £ 24bn ) a year - surpasses that of the entire annual output of Calabria 's legal economy .
But while there are rather more expensive cars than you might expect on the Ionian coast towns ' potholed streets , there is scant evidence of the cash that is known to be flowing into Italy 's poorest region .
" In Calabria , there are billionaires who live like paupers , " says Macri .
" The young drug couriers make a show of their wealth .
They wear Rolexes and drive BMWs .
But the more senior members of the ' Ndrangheta , who are on the run , often live in caves in the mountains in conditions of genuine hardship . "
" When they go up to Milan or abroad , the ' Ndrangheta families live it up , " says Gratteri .
" But back in Calabria they go to great lengths to disguise their wealth .
I have been to houses that are not even painted on the outside , but which , inside , have onyx floors and antique furniture . "
The Italian authorities have been remarkably sluggish in their reaction to the ' Ndrangheta , but then Calabria is poor , lacking in influence and a long way from Rome .
" We have the richest and best - organised mafia in Italy and we 're trying to tackle it without proper resources , " says Nuccio Iovene , a senator for the formerly communist Left Democrats .
" It 's like Russia . "
In the mob -ridden town of Lamezia Terme , he says , police patrols have had to be reduced to save petrol .
" The police cars are in such bad condition that during a recent chase one of them caught fire . "
The way the judiciary is organised does not help either .
After they qualify , Italian judges and prosecutors are given their choice of postings .
Those who come top in their exams get the first choice and those who finish near the bottom get whatever is left .
" That 's usually Calabria , " says Senator Iovene .
" It 's considered a hardship post .
So the moment they arrive , they put in a request to be transferred elsewhere .
When Francesco Fortugno was killed , in Locri , a hotbed of ' Ndrangheta activity , the magistrate with the longest experience had been in the job for only six months . "
Fortugno's assassination - in the dying months of Silvio Berlusconi 's government - finally jolted the state into action , however .
The interior minister came down from Rome , as already mentioned , and announced a series of special measures .
But the murder also put a huge question mark over the future .
There are signs that the ' Ndrangheta shrewdly anticipated Berlusconi 's fall and began to shift the votes it controls to the left .
At a regional election in April 2005 , almost two - thirds of Calabria 's electors voted for Romano Prodi 's centre - left alliance , which took power nationally last month .
Fortugno , a doctor , was a Prodi man .
His assassination is thought to have something to do with the ' Ndrangheta 's efforts to penetrate the local health authority .
But there are some who fear it was also a way of sending a message to the people they expected to form Italy 's new government .
The ' Ndrangheta has an unusually keen interest in politics at the moment , because of the plan to build a bridge over the straits of Messina to link Sicily with the Calabrian mainland .
It stands to cream off millions of euros from the contracts that would be awarded .
Berlusconi's government wanted the bridge to be built .
Prodi's team is split on the issue , partly because of fears that it could prove a bonanza for southern Italy 's mobsters .
" By killing Fortugno , " says an investigator who has asked not to be identified , " they may have been sending a message to the centre - left : ' We have given you our votes .
Now , we expect results ' " .

There has n�'t been a wedding like it for quite some time .
About seven centuries , in fact .
The bride arrived riding side saddle on a white mare in a dress made from 270 feet of silk .
And waiting for her was her knight in shining armour - £ 10,000 of hand - forged steel trimmed with brass and velvet .
Scroll down for more ...
The scene was the wedding of Sian Jenkins and Rupert Hammerton - Fraser , who are so fascinated by the Middle Ages that they recreated a medieval ceremony down to the minutest detail - the bride even promised to be �bonny and buxom in bed� , a vow from a 14th century service .
The £ 30,000 event at Lulworth Castle in Dorset ended with a banquet where guests many in home - made costumes were served medieval delicacies .
The following day there was jousting , sword - fighting and even a full - scale battle re-enactment .
Mr Hammerton - Fraser , 40 , went out with his squire and ring bearer and fought challengers with swords , a practice common in the 14th century .
Scroll down for more ...
His 26 - year - old wife said : " �Our families were a bit surprised when we told them what we wanted but they got involved and even made their own costumes for the day . � "
Her husband , a lecturer in traditional print making , said the wedding took two years to plan and research and was around � 99 per cent historically accurate� .
" My male friends and I drank beer and polished our armour before we went to the castle , " � he said .
" �I arrived with a guard of three armoured men and my best
men , squire and chief usher .
" �My bride then rode up on a white horse and was escorted by her oldest male friend , maid of honour , three armoured knights and three bridesmaids . � "
Scroll down for more ...
The couple , from High Wycombe , Buckinghamshire , and their guests drank and danced the night away before waking up to another day of historical events .
Mr Hammerton - Fraser said : � " We had a great time with jugglers and
falconry and we finished the day with a joust . � "

The bride added : " �I have been doing historical improvisation
since I was 15 and have a passion for medieval history .
Rupert shares my passion so a mediaeval wedding was the obvious choice . �
The couple did make one concession to the 21st century - they were married officially at Bournemouth Register Office in contemporary clothing the day before .
Blackwater Security ( shown here on one of their typical helicopter patrols in Iraq ) , who was involved in a shootout Sunday that updated reports now say left over 20 Iraqi unarmed civilians dead , has yet to offer an apology for the attack .
They continue to state that they fired in defense against a perceived threat .
Of course , they do n’t have to say they ’re sorry .
They have The US Secretary of State to do that for them .
Condoleezza Rice has apologized both personally and on behalf of the United States government for the shootings .
She has done so , it is reported , to forestall Blackwater ’s expulsion from Iraq .
ter.jpgGiven the heinous nature of the reports of Blackwater ’s actions ( shooting unarmed Iraqis who were felling the scene in the back ) , the operative question becomes why ?
Why defend such lawless , vicious behavior ?
Here ’s a possible explanation :
Diplomats , engineers and other westerners in Iraq rely heavily on protection by Blackwater .
The Iraqi decision created confusion on the ground , with uncertainty over whether protection was still available and whether Blackwater staff should leave the country immediately .
Add to that new reports that the US has now restricted the movements of diplomats and others since the Blackwater shootout , and it becomes plain enough : the US ca n’t operate in Iraq without Blackwater ’s protection .
After all , the troops are being used for more important work – pursuing the oil interests of the US .
So duties normally assigned to troops – providing protection to senior officers , diplomats , and important corporate interests ( like oil business executives ) have to be contracted out .
Since Blackwater is a primary security provider for these people , the American presence in Iraq , and hence , Bush administration foreign policy , is captive to the likes of Blackwater .
So we get double - talk like this from a State Dept. deputy press secretary :
We ’re in conversations with the Iraqis on how we can find some mechanisms for looking at this issue in a joint way .
There have been a number of questions that have been raised and we want to make sure that both we and the Iraqis have a common set of facts that we ’re working from and also that we can hopefully come to some common conclusions on how to proceed .
– Tom Casey , State Dept. deputy press secretary
What will those conclusions be ?
Given that the Iraqi government has thrown down a gauntlet with this expulsion of such a powerful administration corporate partner , one would assume that one conclusion will be that Blackwater will only temporarily be expelled from the country .
Distasteful as that is for both the US and Iraq governments politically ( as well as horrifying for the Iraqi civilian population ) , it might be safer than the alternative .
At least it will continue to give Blackwater somewhere far away from our shores to use their troops , planes , and ships without an invented “ crisis ” here at home that might allow The Decider to use them here in the US .
Update : The NY Times has an article that explores the complexities of holding civilian security firms like Blackwater to a legal standard .

Angry bees that fly like mini-missiles could map the futures of unmanned aircraft and planetary explorer robots , thanks to new University of Queensland research backed by the Queensland Government .
Professor Mandyam Srinivasan , Professor of Visual Neuroscience at UQ's Queensland Brain Institute , will lead a $ 2.5 million project aiming to improve robot technology including unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , through better understanding of bee behaviour .
Professor Srinivasan is winner of the $ 1.25 million 2007 Smart State Premier 's Fellowship , which is matched by funding from UQ .
“ Professor Srinivasan 's unique marriage of biology and engineering will help to put Queensland on the map at a time where enhanced surveillance and security are key priorities for governments and leaders around the world , ” Queensland Premier Peter Beattie said when announcing the award today .
Professor Srinivasan and his team have spent more than two decades unlocking the mysteries of bee vision and navigation , and are now investigating how bee emotions , particularly aggression , can improve robotics .
Research of aggressive bees is unprecedented , he said .
Worker bees are generally docile – until a guard bee protecting the hive emits an alarm hormone to signal the hive is endangered .
“ Normal bees are fairly peaceful when they go out hunting for food , but the moment they get a whiff of alarm pheromone from a guard bee the entire colony mobilizes .
“ The flight dynamic changes and they become like little fighter aircraft or missiles , ” Professor Srinivasan said .
Bees ' small but smart brains and nervous systems have evolved a “ visuomotor ” system that enables them to track moving objects with pinpoint accuracy .
Professor Srinivasan 's research has previously been funded by NASA and now has funding from the US Airforce , and its practical potential is diverse .
It could be used for aerial coastal surveillance , weather monitoring and minerals exploration .
The technology also has potential to reduce the risk to soldiers involved in peace - keeping and combat situations , who might one day have portable UAVs to send on reconnaissance missions .
The research could also lead to planetary explorer robots that are able to behave autonomously , in the same way as insects .
This would be much more effective than robots controlled remotely from Earth , given a long signal delay between Mars and Earth , Professor Srinivasan said .
Professor Srinivasan is the second UQ researcher to be awarded the Smart State Premier 's Fellowship , which is now in its second year .
Professor Ian Frazer , Director of UQ's Diamantina Institute for Cancer , Immunology and Metabolic Medicine , who co-invented the world 's first vaccine for cervical cancer , became the first Fellow in 2006 .

Dick ’s mixture of satire and fantasy has inspired countless films .
QUICKHONEY
There ’s nothing more exciting to an adolescent reader than an unknown genre writer who speaks to your condition and has something great about him .
The Ace paperback cover promises mere thrills , and the writing provides real meaning .
The combination of evident value and apparent secrecy makes Elmore Leonard fans feel more for their hero than Borges lovers are allowed to feel for theirs .
When they tell you it ’s going to be good , what more can you hope for it to be ?
Eventually , enough of these secret fans grow up and get together , and the writer is designated a Genius , acquiring all the encumbrances of genius : fans , notes , annotated editions , and gently disparaging comprehensive reviews .
Since genre writing can support only one genius at a time — and no genre writer ever becomes just a good writer ; it ’s all prophet or all hack — the guy is usually resented by his peers and their partisans even as the establishment hails him .
No one hates the rise of Elmore Leonard so much as a lover of Ross Macdonald .
Of all American writers , none have got the genre - hack - to - hidden - genius treatment quite so fully as Philip K. Dick , the California - raised and based science - fiction writer who , beginning in the nineteen - fifties , wrote thirty - six speed - fuelled novels , went crazy in the early seventies , and died in 1982 , only fifty - three .
His reputation has risen through the two parallel operations that genre writers get when they get big .
First , he has become a prime inspiration for the movies , becoming for contemporary science - fiction and fantasy movies what Raymond Chandler was for film noir : at least eight feature films , including “ Total Recall , ” “ Minority Report , ” “ A Scanner Darkly , ” and , most memorably , Ridley Scott ’s “ Blade Runner , ” have been adapted from Dick ’s books , and even more — from Terry Gilliam ’s “ Brazil ” to the “ Matrix ” series — owe a defining debt to his mixture of mordant comedy and wild metaphysics .
But Dick has also become for our time what Edgar Allan Poe was for Gilded Age America : the doomed genius who supplies a style of horrors and frissons .
( In both cases , it took the French to see it ; the first good critical writing on Dick , as on Poe , came from Europe , and particularly from Paris . )
Like Poe ’s ,
Dick ’s last big book was a work of cosmic explanation in which lightning bolts of brilliance flash over salty oceans of insanity .
Poe ’s explanation of everything was called “ Eureka . ”
Dick ’s was “ VALIS . ”
The second , literary Dick is now in the Library of America ( $ 35 ) , under the excellent editorial care of Jonathan Lethem , a passionate devotee , who also provides an abbreviated chronology of Dick ’s tormented life .
Four of the sixties novels are neatly packed together in the handsome black covers : “ The Man in the High Castle , ” “ The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch , ” “ Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? ” ( the original of “ Blade Runner ” ) , and his masterpiece , “ Ubik . ”
Dick ’s fans are not modest in their claims .
Nor are they especially precise : Borges , Calvino , Kafka , Robertson Davies are cited , in the blurbs and introductions , as his peers .
A note of inconsistency inflects these claims — Calvino and Robertson Davies ? — but they are sincerely made and , despite all those movies and all that praise , have a slight , useful tang of hyperbolic defensiveness .
One of the first things that everyone is inclined to say about Dick is that his subject and his mostly straight - to - paperback publication kept him from literary respectability , leaving him a neglected cult writer who is only now beginning to get his due .
On the evidence of the biographers , though , this does n’t seem quite true .
While he served a fairly long apprenticeship — a series of almost unreadable realist working - class novels that he wrote in the fifties are now back in print — and struggled to make money , from the time “ The Man in the High Castle ” won a Hugo Award , in 1963 , he was famous , admired , and read .
He was n’t reviewed on the front page of the Times Book Review , but so what ?
Reading his life — either in the reflective French version , by Emmanuel Carrère , or in the thorough and intelligent American one , by Lawrence Sutin — one has a sense not of a man of thwarted ambition but , rather , of a man burning up with ideas and observations who found in a pop form the perfect vehicle for expressing them .
Dick ’s allegiance was not to literature but to writing and to the possibilities of writing as a form of protest and instant social satire .
Another twist of fate , or circumstance , and he could have ended up as Rod Serling ; another and he could have ended up as Marty Balin , writing lyrics for Jefferson Airplane .
But it ’s hard to imagine any circumstances in which he would have ended up as Doctorow , or wanted to .
There were a million places to write sci- fi in those years , publishers eager to have it , and readers eager to argue about it .
You can find unfairly neglected writers in America ; Dick , with a steady and attentive transatlantic audience , was never one of them .
Dick ’s early history is at once tormented , hustling , and oddly lit by the bright California sunshine of the late fifties .
Born in 1928 , he had a twin , a sister named Jane , who died when she was only a month old ; like Elvis Presley , who also had a twin sibling who died , Dick seems to have been haunted for the rest of his life by his missing Other .
He seems to have blamed his mother , unfairly , for her death , poisoning their relations .
He had one of those classic , bitter American childhoods , with warring parents , and was dragged back and forth across the country .
He had loved science fiction since boyhood — he later told of how at twelve he had a dream of searching in Astounding Stories for a story called “ The Empire Never Ended ” that would reveal the mysteries of existence — and he began writing quickie sci- fi novels for Ace in the fifties and sixties .
“ I love SF , ” he said once .
“ I love to read it ; I love to write it .
The SF writer sees not just possibilities but wild possibilities .
It ’s not just ‘ What if ’— it ’s ‘ My God ; what if ’— in frenzy and hysteria .
The Martians are always coming . ”
The hysteria suited him .
He seems to have been a man of intellectual passion and compulsive appetite ( he was married five times ) , the kind of guy who ca n’t drink one cup of coffee without drinking six , and then stays up all night to tell you what Schopenhauer really said and how it affects your understanding of Hitchcock and what that had to do with Christopher Marlowe .
“ The Man in the High Castle ” ( 1962 ) , the book that made Dick famous , is in many ways the least typical , and least interesting , of his sixties novels .
It tells what would have happened if the Germans had won the Second World War , and , though skillfully done , it leaves his imagination too tethered to reality and “ research ” to resonate ; not enough Martians come .
It ’s in “ The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch , ” two years later , that his style explodes .
Dick tends to get treated as a romantic : his books are supposed to be studies in the extremes of paranoia and technological nightmare , offering searing conundrums of reality and illusion .
This comes partly from the habit , hard to break , of extolling the transgressive , the visionary , the startling undercurrent of dread .
In fact , Dick in the sixties is a bone - dry intellectual humorist , a satirist — concerned with taking contemporary practices and beliefs to their reductio ad absurdum .
If we oppress the Irish , why not eat them ?
Swift asked , in the model of all black satire — and if we can make quotidian and trivial the technology that has already arrived , Dick wonders , then why would we not do the same to the future yet to come , psychic communication and time travel and the colonization of Mars ?
Although “ Blade Runner , ” with its rainy , ruined Los Angeles , got Dick ’s antic tone wrong , making it too noirish and romantic , it got the central idea right : the future will be like the past , in the sense that , no matter how amazing or technologically advanced a society becomes , the basic human rhythm of petty malevolence , sordid moneygrubbing , and official violence , illuminated by occasional bursts of loyalty or desire or tenderness , will go on .
Dick ’s future worlds are rarely evil and oppressive , exactly ; they are banal and a little sordid , run by a demoralized élite at the expense of a deluded population .
No matter how mad life gets , it will first of all be life .
The last natural blondes will die out within 200 years , scientists believe .
A study by experts in Germany suggests people with blonde hair are an endangered species and will become extinct by 2202 .
Researchers predict the last truly natural blonde will be born in Finland - the country with the highest proportion of blondes .
The frequency of blondes may drop but they wo n't disappear
Prof Jonathan Rees , University of Edinburgh
But they say too few people now carry the gene for blondes to last beyond the next two centuries .
The problem is that blonde hair is caused by a recessive gene .
In order for a child to have blonde hair , it must have the gene on both sides of the family in the grandparents ' generation .
Dyed rivals
The researchers also believe that so - called bottle blondes may be to blame for the demise of their natural rivals .
They suggest that dyed - blondes are more attractive to men who choose them as partners over true blondes .
But Jonathan Rees , professor of dermatology at the University of Edinburgh said it was unlikely blondes would die out completely .
" Genes do n't die out unless there is a disadvantage of having that gene or by chance .
They do n't disappear , " he told BBC News Online .
" The only reason blondes would disappear is if having the gene was a disadvantage and I do not think that is the case .
" The frequency of blondes may drop but they wo n't disappear . "
Congressional Record : WHY CHENEY SHOULD BE IMPEACHED

LACY CLAY of Missouri , Thursday , May 3 , 2007
Mr. CLAY .
Madam Speaker , I am a proud cosponsor of H. Res. 333 , the resolution to Impeach Vice President Dick Cheney .
Four years after the start of this war , it is obvious that Mr. Cheney deliberately manipulated the intelligence process to deceive Congress and the American people .
At the urging of my constituents in Missouri ’s 1st Congressional District , and from Americans across the country , I cosponsored Congressman Kucinich ’s resolution because there is ample evidence that Mr. Cheney systematically evaded the truth and used scare tactics to build support for this unjust war .
Mr. Cheney ’s betrayal has resulted in a tragic , unnecessary war that has already cost the lives of over 3,300 brave Americans and has cost the taxpayers over $ 400 billion .
The Vice President has taken the integrity out of his office and breeched the trust of the American people .
Madam Speaker , below is Richard Cohen ’s column from yesterday ’s Washington Post , headlined , “ A Case Against Cheney . ” I agree with Mr. Cohen ’s conclusion , “ the harping on weapons of mass destruction was an attempt to scare the American people into supporting a war that need not have been fought . ”
I encourage my colleagues to read this column and make a conscious decision to hold Vice President Cheney accountable by cosponsoring H. Res. 333 .
[ From the Washington Post , May 2 , 2007 ]
A Case Against Cheney
( By Richard Cohen )
The resolution offered by the gentleman from Ohio reads sensibly .
It alleges crimes high and low , misdemeanors galore–all of them representing an effort to mislead the American people and take them into war .
It is Dennis Kucinich ’s articles of impeachment directed at Dick Cheney .
The vice president will , of course , deny being a liar .
As long as Kucinich is at it , add that to the articles .
The congressman ’s case is persuasive , although his remedy may be too radical .
He calls for Cheney to be impeached by the House and tried by the Senate , just as Bill Clinton was for what turned out to be neither a high crime nor much of a misdemeanor .
What was it , anyway , compared with more than 3,300 American dead ?
In his articles of impeachment , Kucinich details the many statements Cheney made that turned out to be factually wrong .
For instance , he quotes Cheney as saying , “ We know they [ the Iraqis ] have biological and chemical weapons , ” which of course , they did n’t .
Still , that was excusable , since it was early in the game and little contradictory evidence was being presented .
As Condi Rice said Sunday , “ When George [ Tenet ] said `slam dunk , ’ everybody understood that he believed that the intelligence was strong .
We all believed the intelligence was strong . ”
But in Cheney ’s case , the slam - dunking went on and on –way past the point where it was possible anymore to believe him .
He continued to insist that Saddam Hussein had high - level contacts with al - Qaeda– “ the evidence is overwhelming , ” he once said –while others in the government not only knew that the evidence was not overwhelming but that it hardly existed .
It was the same with Cheney ’s insistence –not just wrong , but irrefutably so–that Hussein “ has weapons of mass destruction , ” and “ [t ] here is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends , against our allies and against us . ”
The percussive march of these statements is so forceful , one after another after another , that it suggests Cheney wanted war no matter what .
If he was lying to himself as well as to the rest of us , that is only a mitigating circumstance –sort of an insanity defense .
Kucinich also alleges that Cheney “ purposely manipulated the intelligence process to deceive the citizens and Congress . ”
That , as the expression goes , is the gravamen of the charge .
Kucinich does n’t stand a ghost of a chance of making it stick because Congress is not about to vote impeachment .
But no one who reads Kucinich ’s case against Cheney can fail to conclude that this is a rational , serious accusation .
It ’s possible that each individual charge can be rebutted , but the essence of it is shockingly apparent :
We were being manipulated .
It is something of a joke that Washington is now transfixed by l’affaire Wolfowitz .
This is the contretemps at the World Bank in which an architect of this misbegotten war stands accused of favoring his girlfriend .
Do not be concerned with the details –this is a parody of a Washington scandal–but concentrate instead on what else Wolfowitz has done in government and how , now , it is a salary increase awarded to a companion that might do him in .
This is tantamount to getting Al Capone for tax evasion .
In the same vein , we tend to focus on single events or statements regarding Iraq ( to slam dunk or not to slam dunk , that is the question ) and how poor George Tenet , a self - deceived careerist , is misunderstood–as if he had uttered a statement of principle dramatically resigning over the manipulation of intelligence and it is suspiciously missing from the record .
In all this back - and - forth , what gets lost is the immensity of the outrage , the enormousness of the breach of trust , the naive faith some of us had that when it came to the making of war , we ’d be told the truth .
This was not the case .
The harping on weapons of mass destruction was an attempt to scare the American people into supporting a war that need not have been fought .
Kucinich is an odd guy for whom the killer appellation “ perennial presidential candidate ” is lethally applied .
But he is on to something here .
It is easy enough to ad hominize him to the margins–ya know , the skinny guy among the “ real ” presidential candidates–but at a given moment , and this is one , he ’s the only one on that stage who articulates a genuine sense of betrayal .
He is not out merely to win the nomination but to hold the Bush administration –particularly Cheney–accountable .
In this he will fail .
What Cheney has done is not impeachable .
It is merely unforgivable .

They are the kind of supposedly iconic sights which inspire tourists to trek around the world clutching the guidebooks that list them as must - see destinations .
But when travellers finally set eyes on some of the most well - known attractions the pilgrimage ends too often with a distinct sense of anticlimax .
It seems the allure of mysterious ancient constructions or feats of elegant engineering are easily diminished by the inconvenience of traffic , crowds and hawkers for the Britons who have voted Stonehenge , the Eiffel Tower , Times Square and the Pyramids as among the most disappointing tourist spectacles they have seen .
Buckingham Palace and the White House left the respondents cold .
Even Anthony Gormley 's much - celebrated Angel of the North in Gateshead ( an " ugly monstrosity " according to one ) and the London Eye took a beating , as did postcard favourites Blackpool Tower and Brighton pier .
And she may have been the People 's Princess , but the panel of 1,267 were not impressed by the controversial Diana , Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain either ( " wet and pointless " ) .
Elsewhere in the world the experience of jostling for position to peer at the surprisingly tiny Mona Lisa was thought to have contributed to the Louvre 's damp squib status .
Stonehenge , which topped the table of the most disappointing attractions in Britain , has long suffered complaints about its position wedged at the junction of the busy A303 and A344 .
Planning permission has been granted for a £ 67 m visitor centre that has been in the pipeline for years , but English Heritage is still awaiting a decision from the government on whether the A303 can be rerouted into a tunnel .
The centre can not go ahead without it .
Stonehenge director Peter Carson said : " Stonehenge is a must - see attraction even though the current visitor facilities are inadequate for the number of people who visit each year . "
The prehistoric monument 's latest critics , who must pay £ 6.30 to walk around the stone circle , noted that the " road does seem to detract from the spectacle " .
One , with disregard for the mystery of the monument which dates to around 3,100 BC , complained it was " just a pile of rocks " and even sniped : " It 's dull . "
Those polled for Virgin Travel Insurance chose their most underwhelming sights from a list of 24 possibilities in the UK and 25 overseas .
But writer Bill Bryson , while agreeing Stonehenge needed a tunnel and serious improvements to visitor facilities , was quick to defend it .
" There 's no doubt that it is n't as spectacular as people often think it 's going to be , " he said .
" But I have completely warmed to Stonehenge over the years .
Once you adjust to the fact that it 's completely inert and not overwhelming in scale it 's quite magical . "
Approached on foot from a distance it was an entirely different experience , he explained .
" The whole problem is not Stonehenge .
It 's the way it 's presented .
You kind of drive up and it's not a very great reception - it 's more a big Portakabin type thing .
It all looks temporary ... what it desperately needs is a really good visitor centre . "
Bryson was equally keen on other attractions blacklisted in the poll .
" I love the Angel of the North , " he said .
" I do n't see why it could possibly be disappointing . "
Blackpool Tower was " sensational " , the Diana fountain " terrific " and the Pyramids , which he saw for the first time earlier this year , " one of the great moments in my life " .
Indeed the problem might be that people were coming to the most well - known sights with expectations already raised too high and an unrealistic desire to see them minus the crowds .
" Stonehenge is a classic example : you 've seen it so many times before you actually see it that you have a very powerful image of what it 's going to be like and because of that the likelihood is that you 're going to be disappointed , " Bryson said .
" The Eiffel Tower is really a great structure .
It 's very exciting .
I know it 's a bit of a pain in the ass to get up because of the queues .
But this is the world we live in .
There are a finite number of attractions and increasing numbers of people . "

David Hodgkinson said he was fed up being a single man
David Hodgkinson 's borrowed money from his elderly mother and re-mortgaged his home in Margate , Kent , but neither woman showed up at the airport .
The 48 - year - old electrical engineer has admitted he was naive , but said he was desperate to find a partner .
" Emotionally , it 's given me a lot of depression , " he said .
Mr Hodgkinson , who is a full - time carer for his 86 - year - old mother , turned to online dating after he became fed up with being single .
There 's many times that I literally cry my heart out
David Hodgkinson
He first struck up a relationship with Natalia , from Russia , who he met through a dating website .
He sent her more than £ 10,000 to pay for her travel and a visa so she could be with him .
He went to meet her at Heathrow Airport four times , but she never arrived .
" I feel no ill in my heart .
I did really love her , " Mr Hodgkinson told the BBC .
He then turned to a Christian dating website and met Amada , from Senegal .
He sent her £ 6,000 , but was again left waiting in the arrivals lounge of the airport .
" There 's many times that I literally cry my heart out and there are times when I felt I did n't want to live any more , " he said .
' Never listened '
His mother , Constance , has been forced to take out a loan to help repay his debts .
" I did tell him off about keeping going to Heathrow , " she said .
" In my heart I knew they would n't ever turn up ... but he never listened . "

At first I thought , like many fellow scientists , " Surely , Christopher Lloyd is just having fun with us !
That 's not how you pronounce gigawatt ! "
Shortly thereafter , I got a nice laminated sheet from IUPAC with units and prefixes on it .
They took special care to point out that giga- ( the correct spelling ! ) was pronounced with the first g as a hard g , and the second , as a soft one !
According to my Merriam Webster 's Collegiate Dictionary ( 1993 ) the first ( preferred ) pronunciation is " ' ji - ge " ( as in jiggle ) and the alternative pronunciation is " ' gi - ge " ( as in giggle ) .
OK , so you do n't believe me !
But what about this pronouncing dictionary ?
Just to add fuel to the fire , fish have gills ( as in giggle ) , but I drink beer by the gill ( as in jiggle or jill ) .

LONDON
ED HUSAIN remembers the man as a kindly soul , not the sort you would suspect of recruiting for a radical Islamic group .
As a teenager already in rebellion against his upstanding middle - class parents , who had raised him as a sort of Muslim choirboy , young Mohamed — his original first name — was an easy target .
They met in the early 1990s at the elaborate Muslim wedding of a distant relative .
“ He was a medic at Royal London Hospital , and he invited me to lunch , ” said Mr. Husain , whose recently published memoir , “ The Islamist : Why I Joined Radical Islam in Britain , What I Saw Inside and Why I Left , ” has caused a ruckus in the newspapers , on television , on talks shows and in blogs .
“ He was asking me questions and then saying , ‘ White Muslims are being killed in Bosnia , ’ ” he recalled in an interview .
“ What chances do we have as brown people in England ? ’
He was creating doubts . ”
He said his new friend had “ black and white ” answers to the world ’s problems , and gave him books by Taqiuddin an - Nabhani , a Palestinian judge who , dissatisfied with the Muslim Brotherhood in the early 1950s , set up his own Islamic party , called Hizb ut - Tahrir , or Party of Liberation .
Thus began Mr. Husain ’s journey into the world of British Islamic radicalism .
He joined a university campus branch of Hizb ut - Tahrir .
He said he had been hooked on an ideology that calls for a caliphate in Muslim countries and the end of Israel , though in nonviolent ways .
Membership made him feel important , even though he was only a cog in a larger movement .
“ You feel a few cuts above an ordinary Muslim , ” he said .

By Date By Thread 6 Month Vista Vuln Report , Debunked From : " Kristian Hermansen " < kristian.hermansen ( ) gmail com >
Date : Tue , 26 Jun 2007 09:09:31 - 0400
This report from Microsoft's Jeff R. Jones is ludicrous : http://www.csoonline.com/pdf/6_Month_Vista_Vuln_Report.pdf
The Microsoft " researcher " claims that Windows Vista is exponentially less vulnerable than many Linux distributions and Mac OS X .
It may be true that the default Vista installation has had less public vulnerability reports , and that Linux has had many more , but this is due to the nature of Open Source .
Jeff does not include any " silently fixed " vulnerabilities that have been patched since Vista was released and Microsoft has not disclosed such vulnerabilities publicly .
Here is a per section debunking of his paper broken down by topic , because I feel Jeff really needs to perform another less exaggerated analysis .
" Window Vista - The First 6 Months "
Let 's remember that Vista was released to business partners earlier than home users .
He does not account for this gap , and thus , this could soften the exposure of the official Vista code to many researchers for analysis .
" Teredo " Teredo is also a major hole , and they are leaving it wide open .
The community feels this is a flaw , but Microsoft does n't seem to care .
Also , the entire networking stack was rewritten for Vista , and that means lots of new bugs are present .
I have already spoken to other researchers who have not disclosed such flaws publicly .
However , a good start for learning about some is the Symantec paper that analyzed Vista during the BETA phases and revealed numerous issues .
" Windows XP " Windows XP , touted as the most secure OS to date on release .
Also , touted as secure in SP1 , and again most secure in SP2 .
We are now seeing it again with Vista .
Are we really supposed to believe that somehow this mantra is going to change just because Microsoft tells us so ?
In defense of Microsoft , however , they have focused their efforts to really clean things up , and that is commendable .
" Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Workstation " OK .
The claims here are just plain insulting .
The 100 + vulnerabilities include such software as PostgreSQL , MySQL , mailman , squid , and emacs .
None of this software is installed in a default installation of RHEL4 .
I think the guy clicked on " Install Everything " and went to town with vulnerability reports :-)
" RHEL4 Reduced Component List "
This analysis more closely assimilates with Vista , but is still bloated in that many of the vulnerabilities he reports are very small bugs in Firefox , which do n't result in a compromise of the host .
Again , the nature of bug reporting in open versus closed source software .
" Ubuntu " Again , the nature of open versus closed source bug reporting .
However , even the kernel flaws reported are only relevant when such modules are loaded in the system and that surface is exposed .
Again , the results are inflated , even in the " reduced " set .
" Novell " More of the same .
The vulnerabilities are shared between all the distros of course !
" Mac OS X " Even though OS X claims to be secure , researchers have obviously shown that Apple will have flaws too .
This is nature of software , and it affects all code .
However , the paper claims that things like the vulnerability below are relevant ... < snip >
A bug in AFP Server when using an ACL - enabled storage volume may in certain situations result in an ACL remaining attached when a file with POSIX - only permissions is copied .
</ snip > " Putting It All Together " * insert nice graphs here *
The conclusions that are drawn are built on a lack of understanding by the Microsoft researcher .
I highly encourage him to go back and take another look , and pare down the results to essential information that is absolutely critical to the conclusions , rather than just " Other OS 's have more bugs , see , look at my graphs " ... -- Kristian Hermansen _______________________________________________

A. D. Corlan Eficient compilation of the R ( S , Splus ) language by translation to CommonLisp
What it is Download Installation Rationale Translations
What it is .
R2cl is a minimal , proof of concept translator from the R or S language into Common Lisp .
An increase in speed of over 1000 times can then be achieved using the free CMU Common Lisp native code compiler on the resulting code , making it comparable to FORTRAN , Ada or C .
The sole purpose the current version ( 0.1 ) is to allow the automatic translation and compilation of a simple benchmark .
We did n't implement any feature not needed for this purpose .
Download R2cl - 0.1.tgz released Jan 7 , 2006 .
Installation and usage .
To install you need first to install cmucl ( the CMU Common Lisp ) and R. Both come with most Linux distributions by default but you must select them for installation .
I think most recent ( after 2000 ) versions will work .
I have R 1.5.1 and cmucl x86- linux 3.0.8 18 c+ running on Debian 3.0 ( woody ) .
You must be running the bash shell ( which is the default ) and have gnu make on your system ( which you normally have ) .
Just untar the distribution archive : tar xvzf R2cl - 0.1.tgz
It will create the directory R2cl .
Type : cd R2cl make
and watch translation , compilation and duration of execution of benchmarks .
That 's all , except if you want to have a look at the code .
Rationale .
R is a reimplementation of the S language for statistical processing .
It is a free project , see r-project.org .
R is a highly expressive ' matrix ' language ( it makes extensive use of matrix and vector operators ) with a huge library of statistical functions .
However , expressivity requires a dynamic execution engine based on an ' infinite memory ' model which is slow .
It also requires that expressions and function can be constructed by a program or introduced by an operator at runtime thus enforcing the an interpreted approach .
This makes strighforward implementations of it slow .
For programs that might have an equivalent in FORTRAN , that FORTRAN equivalent would be over 1000 times faster .
Lisp is a language with the same execution model , except the that it is even more general , and include extensive macro and object oriented feature .
There are may flavors , but the main currents are Scheme ( which is reductionist , favoring simplicity ) and Common Lisp ( the ISO standard which is extensive and highly concerned with efficient compilation ) .
None of these languages would be easy to fully translate , say , in C .
To have the complete language you need , at least in part , to have the intepreting engine and the ' infinite memory ' machine intimately combined with the generated code .
However , there is no reason for pieces of code which make no use of the generality ( such as source code generation and execution at runtime ) not to be compilable to code as fast as FORTRAN .
In practice , this is a huge task .
Nevertheless , it was achieved in a free implementation , for example in CMU CommonLisp , as I was delighted to learn when trying these benchmarks .
The semantics of R is a subset of the semantics of Scheme .
It also includes , of course , a wealth of data types suitable for statistics .
The semantics ( expressive mechanisms ) of CommonLisp are probably a superset of Scheme .
This means that R is easy to express in Scheme ( actually the engine of the free implementation is a Scheme engine ) and perhaps easy to translate in CommonLisp .
This later is interesting because of the availability of the efficient compiler .
So I arrived at this toy project , to check if such a route for the efficient compilation of R is possible .
Many R applications do n't need speed .
You can describe the job you need done so quickly that you rarely mind to wait a couple of seconds for the system to do it .
However , there are also whole classes of applications where speed is necessary and if a complete porting of R on CommonLisp ( really big project ) would be done they would all become feasible for R users like myself .

The bodies of the two women were found by villagers on the outskirts of the city of Bannu .
A note found on the bodies accused the women of " acts of obscenity " , a term that usually refers to prostitution .
The region is a known base for militants who want to impose their interpretation of Islamic law .
Police said the women were travelling in a three - wheeled vehicle when masked and armed men overpowered them and bundled them into a car .
Senior district police officer Dar Khattak told Reuters news agency it was the first time militants had directly targeted and killed women in the region .
The note read : " We have started doing this to end obscenity in the area . "
Music and movie shops in the region have also been targeted by militants .
Militant attacks in the north - west have increased since the army ousted radical Islamists from the Red Mosque in the capital , Islamabad , in July .
More than 100 people were killed in the operation .
Continuation - Passing Style
and why JavaScript developers might be interested in it
Topic : JavaScript , ' AJAX ' , continuations
Audience : JavaScript programmers
Author : Marijn Haverbeke
Date : July 24th 2007
Most programmers , at least those whose interests go beyond just Java or PHP , will at some point have come across the concept of continuations .
When I read the Scheme Revised Report for the first time , I was rather bewildered by that part of the language .
To recap : Scheme 's call - with - current - continuation function makes it possible to capture a computation , a state of the call stack as it were , and resume that same state at a later time .
On top of such a primitive , various form of exception handling and C - like longjmp tricks can be implemented .
In most real Scheme programs I have seen , stack - unwinding tricks that other languages would handle with try / catch or similar are the only applications of call - with - current - continuation .
The canonical example application of continuations , ' non- deterministic programming ' ― basically a way to abstract backtracking in a search algorithm ― is not something that is very hard to do without continuations .
Some people even advocate removing continuations from the Scheme standard entirely , on the basis that they are hard to implement efficiently .
They conflict with the ' call stack ' model of computation , and combine very poorly with dynamically - scoped cleanup code such as C++ destructors or other languages ' finally clauses .
Because of these things , I used to consider continuations mostly a toy .
But a very cute toy .
I was delighted to see , for example , that in a language that does not support call - with - current - continuation but does have closures , any code can be converted to continuation - passing style by a rather simple transformation .
If we have a JavaScript program ...
function traverseDocument ( node , func ) { func ( node ) ; var children = node .
childNodes ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < children .
length ; i ++) traverseDocument ( children [ i ] , func ) ; } function capitaliseText ( node ) { if ( node .
nodeType == 3 ) node .
nodeValue = node .
nodeValue . toUpperCase ( ) ; } traverseDocument ( document .
body , capitaliseText ) ;
This can be transformed as follows :
We add an extra argument to every function , which will be used to pass the function 's continuation .
This continuation is a function value representing the actions that must happen after the function ' returns ' .
The stack becomes obsolete in continuation - passing style ― when a function calls another function , that is the last thing it does .
Instead of waiting for the called function to return , it puts any work it wants to do afterwards into a continuation , which it passes to the function .
Of course , the transformation does not have to effect every function .
The toUpperCase method , for example , is a built - in JavaScript function , and we can not transform it .
Nor do we really have to ― it always returns normally .
A function in continuation - passing style can call regular functions with no ill effects .
The transformed version of the above code might make a few things clear .
For brevity , continuation arguments are called simply c .
function traverseDocument ( node , func , c ) { var children = node .
childNodes ; function handleChildren ( i , c ) { if ( i < children .
length ) traverseDocument ( children [ i ] , func , function ( ) { handleChildren ( i + 1 , c ) ;} ) ; else c ( ) ; } return func ( node , function ( ) { handleChildren ( 0 , c ) ;} ) ; } function capitaliseText ( node , c ) { if ( node .
nodeType == 3 ) node .
nodeValue = node .
nodeValue . toUpperCase ( ) ; c ( ) ; } traverseDocument ( document .
body , capitaliseText , function ( ) {} ) ;
So , we 've created code that does exactly the same as the earlier version , but is twice as confusing .
Not much gain so far .
But bear with me .
Imagine we have a huuuuge document to capitalise .
Just traversing it in one go takes five seconds , and freezing the browser for five seconds is rather bad style .
Consider this simple modification of capitaliseText ( do n't pay attention to the ugly global ) :
var nodeCounter = 0 ; function capitaliseText ( node , c ) { if ( node .
nodeType == 3 ) node .
nodeValue = node .
nodeValue . toUpperCase ( ) ; nodeCounter ++ ; if ( nodeCounter % 20 == 0 ) setTimeout ( c , 100 ) ; else c ( ) ; }
Now , every twenty nodes , the computation is interrupted for a hundred milliseconds to give the browser interface a moment to respond to user input .
A very primitive form of threading ― you can even run multiple computations at the same time like this .
A more commonly useful application of this is related to XMLHttpRequest s , or the various IFRAME and SCRIPT tag hacks used to simulate them .
These always require one to work with some kind of call - back mechanism to handle the data that the server sends back .
In simple cases , a trivial function will do , or a few globals can be used to store the state of the computation that must be resumed after the data comes back .
With complex cases , for example when the data is being used by a function that must return some value to its caller , continuations simplify things considerably .
You just register the continuation as the call - back , and your computation is resumed when the request finishes .
function doXHR ( url , succeed , fail ) { var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; xhr . open ( " GET " , url , true ) ; xhr . send ( null ) ; xhr .
onreadystatechange = function ( ) { if ( xhr . ready State == 4 ) { if ( xhr . status == 200 ) succeed ( xhr . responseText ) ; else fail ( xhr ) ; } } ; } function tryLogin ( name , password , c ) { doXHR ( " login?name= " + encodeURIComponent ( name ) + " &password= " + encodeURIComponent ( password ) , function ( response ) { c ( response == " ok " ) ; } , function ( xhr ) { warn ( " Could not get login information from server . ( " + xhr . statusText + " ) . " ) ; c ( null ) ; } ) ; }
Note how doXHR takes two continuations , one for failure and one for success .
Also note that values that would normally be returned by functions are now passed to their continuations instead .
You can also see that tryLogin passes null to its continuation when it fails .
JavaScript with continuation - passing style is not all beauty and sunshine .
For one thing , it breaks exception handling .
Since the stack is no longer a reliable indication of the current computation , the stack unwinding that an exception does will no longer work as expected .
The same goes for finally clauses .
When necessary , a function can abort a computation entirely by not calling its continuation .
And if you really want to you can implement a simple substitute for exception handling by storing a stack of ' catch ' continuations in a global array ― a function that would normally throw an exception now just calls the continuation on the top of that stack , and functions that would normally catch exceptions now push a function onto that stack , and pop it off when they are done .
Another issue that you should be aware of is that , since continuation - passing functions never really return , and JavaScript implementations do not typically provide ' tail - call ' optimisation , it is possible to blow the call stack when you have too many such functions calling each other without resetting the stack through setTimout or a callback .
In my experience this rarely becomes a problem , but when it does you can add a strategic setTimout of zero milliseconds to reset the stack manually .
Finally , JavaScript is notoriously sluggish about function calls , and all these extra calls will not exactly make your scripts run faster .
Most JavaScript programs do not take up a noticeable amount of CPU time , but for some heavy - handed scripts this extra overhead might be a problem .
So I do not recommend anyone to go ahead and convert his entire code - base to continuation - passing style .
There are scripts , however , especially those making lots of requests to a server , that will benefit from such a transformation .
It is never necessary to convert every function .
Only those that might get ' interrupted ' ( or call other functions that might get interrupted ) benefit from having a first - class continuation .
Other good approaches to the same problem include Narrative JavaScript , a system that compiles a JavaScript - like language down to regular JavaScript .
This language adds some event - based syntax , which allows you to write ' interruptable ' code without manually transforming your functions .
( It does n't use actual continuations , so you do n't have the stack issues . )
Jwacs is a similar approach , but this one does use real continuations , with a trampoline calling system to prevent stack overflows .
Deferred objects , as seen in MochiKit , Dojo , and the Python library Twisted are a less invasive , but still nicely structured way to write code that has to wait for something .
Instead of returning the actual result , a function will return a Deferred object that encapsulates this result .
Callers can register callbacks on this object to handle it further , but if they need to return something to their own callers , they also have the possibility of just adding a function to the deferred that somehow transforms the result , and then returning it , and so on .
This requires a bit of glue code , but does keep the handling of incoming results local to the functions that are concerned with them .

If you say something generally interesting , I 'll include your reaction here at the bottom of the page .
Abu Zubaydah was a mess .
It was early April 2002 , and the al - Qaeda lieutenant had been shot in the groin during a firefight in Pakistan , then captured by the Special Forces and flown to a safe house in Thailand .
Now he was experiencing life as America ’s first high - value detainee in the wake of 9/11 .
A medical team and a cluster of F.B.I. and C.I.A. agents stood vigil , all fearing that the next attack on America could happen at any moment .
It did n’t matter that Zubaydah was unable to eat , drink , sit up , or control his bowels .
They wanted him to talk .
A C.I.A. interrogation team was expected but had n’t yet arrived .
But the F.B.I. agents who had been nursing his wounds and cleaning him after he ’d soiled himself asked Zubaydah what he knew .
The detainee said something about a plot against an ally , then began slipping into sepsis .
He was probably going to die .
The team cabled the morsel of intelligence to C.I.A. headquarters , where it was received with delight by Director George Tenet .
" I want to congratulate our officers on the ground , " he told a gathering of agents at Langley .
When someone explained that the F.B.I. had obtained the information , Tenet blew up and demanded that the C.I.A. get there immediately , say those who were later told of the meeting .
Tenet ’s instructions were clear : Zubaydah was to be kept alive at all costs .
( Through his publisher , George Tenet declined to be interviewed . )
Zubaydah was stabilized at the nearest hospital , and the F.B.I. continued its questioning using its typical rapport - building techniques .
An agent showed him photographs of suspected al - Qaeda members until Zubaydah finally spoke up , blurting out that " Moktar , " or Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , had planned 9/11 .
He then proceeded to lay out the details of the plot .
America learned the truth of how 9/11 was organized because a detainee had come to trust his captors after they treated him humanely .
Al - Qaeda operative Khalid Shaikh Mohammed shortly after his capture , 2003 .
Corbis .
It was an extraordinary success story .
But it was one that would evaporate with the arrival of the C.I.A ’s interrogation team .
At the direction of an accompanying psychologist , the team planned to conduct a psychic demolition in which they ’d get Zubaydah to reveal everything by severing his sense of personality and scaring him almost to death .
This is the approach President Bush appeared to have in mind when , in a lengthy public address last year , he cited the “ tough ” but successful interrogation of Zubaydah to defend the C.I.A.’s secret prisons , America ’s use of coercive interrogation tactics , and the abolishment of habeas corpus for detainees .
He said that Zubaydah had been questioned using an “ alternative set ” of tactics formulated by the C.I.A .
This program , he said , was fully monitored by the C.I.A. ’s inspector general and required extensive training for interrogators before they were allowed to question captured terrorists .
Alstonefield , where there 's a new lord of the manor
Ruth Alexander
BBC Radio 4's Law in Action
" Lord of the Manor " titles are being bought at auction for thousands of pounds , provoking bitter disputes over the ownership of village greens and grass verges , and prompting campaigners to call for the abolition of feudal laws .
A village in the Peak District has become an unlikely battleground between the country 's old feudal laws and the modern British legal system .
The title of Lord of the Manor of Alstonefield was bought for £ 10,000 in 1999 by a business in Wales .
That business is owned by Mark Roberts , who also styles himself Lord Marcher of Trelleck , another title his company owns .
It owns 60 titles in all .
It 's been absolutely horrendous for ordinary families living within this situation
Sue Fowler
Parish councillor , Alstonefield
He claims ownership of grass verges and commons in Alstonefield , but the parish council has disputed this claim , saying it has an old legal document to prove a previous lord of the manor gave up rights to this land in the 1800s .
Mr Roberts initially had a caution put against first registration of the title across a 25,000 - acre area covering the ancient parish , to make sure no - one else registered a lord of the manor title for the same area .
LORD OF THE MANOR
Title arose in feudal system after Norman Conquest Estates of land called manors were still owned by the king
But they were handed to the ( mostly Norman ) lords in return for military service
They were all - powerful over the peasants who worked the land Today people can call themselves ' The Lord of the Manor of ... ' but the Passport Agency does not recognise them Chris Eubank is Lord of the Manor of Brighton
But it had the unintended effect of stopping house sales because lenders and buyers were made aware that someone had some sort of claim or interest in the area of land .
Some villagers also found they did n't have right of way into their properties , as Mr Roberts was claiming ownership of grass verges , and they ended up paying him for access .
In one case , a resident paid £ 15,000 for land next to his house .
" It 's been absolutely horrendous for ordinary families living within this situation , " says Sue Fowler , a parish councillor in Alstonefield , who believes Mr Roberts is imposing 11th Century laws on a 21st Century community .
" I think it 's about time we made it a criminal offence to make money in such a way . "
Arguments A similar situation arose in a village near Newport in Wales , Peterstone Wentloog , where Mr Roberts is also lord of the manor .
Then in 2005 , the law changed so that no - one can charge a person for accessing their property via common land any more , as long as they can show they have been doing so for 20 years or more .
Roberts denies causing a nuisance
This change put an end to the practice , but in Alstonefield the arguments continued , despite the fact the caution had been lifted .
Mr Roberts claimed ownership of common land too , which includes several greens .
He said he would lease the land to the parish council for a nominal sum .
But the council refused as that would effectively recognise him as landowner .
Instead , the council applied for village green status so it could protect the villagers ' free use of the land , no matter who owned it .
The lord objected and a public inquiry was called , at a cost to the parish council of £ 16,000 .
Earlier this month , Staffordshire County Council granted village green status to just four of Alstonefield 's many grassy areas .
That means the arguments could continue over more than 10 other pieces of land .
" We do not buy titles .
We buy manors , which are the oldest form of landed estate , " says Mr Roberts .
" We buy these old landed estates for the land including demesne agricultural land , pasture land , quarries , common land , waste land and foreshore that go with them , which we manage in a traditional way as any other major landowner does and has done over the last 1,000 years .
" We are in essence akin to a small version of the Crown Estate or Duchy of Cornwall Estate . "
Seven years of confusion have engulfed Alstonefield Scores of titles are bought and sold every year .
Often people buy them for fun , like ex-boxer Chris Eubank , but some people see a business opportunity .
This is entirely legal and there is no doubt the titles can be valuable .
As well as rights to land like wastes and commons , they can also give the holder rights over land .
For example , mineral rights , hunting and fishing rights , the right to hold a market - even the right to a beached whale , should one wash up in your manor .
However , it can be difficult to exercise feudal rights in today 's legal landscape .
For example , you cannot build a mine without planning permission and the mining of gold , silver and oil are subject to statutory restrictions .
Campaigners around the country , as well as some politicians and legal professionals , say manorial rights are anachronistic and ought to be abolished .
People are looking at these rights for personal gain
Judith Bray
Land law expert " This is a long way from the feudal system in the 13th Century , " says Judith Bray , a land law expert from Buckingham University .
" People are looking at these rights for personal gain and for business opportunities .
They no longer have the reciprocal duties that they owed in the 13th Century .
It is now an opportunity to exploit their position . "
She said the legal situation is very confusing because a piece of legislation in the 1920s separated manorial rights from the ownership of land .
It is not known how many manorial rights are even held , although the Land Registration Act 2002 set a 10 - year window in which all such rights have to be registered .
Trespass Mark Roberts strongly rebuts any suggestion that his pursuit of manorial rights causes a nuisance .
" I have a right to protect my land against modern encroachment and trespass , " he told the BBC Radio 4's Law in Action programme .
" The majority of listeners would not countenance a trespass in their back garden and neither will I , no matter how big the perpetrator . "
The Law Commission in England and Wales is considering a project to abolish feudal land law , acknowledging the remnants cause " uncertainty " to the public , legal professionals and the courts .
But any such project would not include a review of manorial rights .
Law in Action was broadcast on Tuesday 31 July on BBC Radio 4 at 1600 BST .

What we really need is an Act of Parliament which makes it illegal for these titles to be enforced - you can have the title but without the benefits currently acquired .
Christopher Trefor Davies , Caerdydd , Cardiff
Such titles should not be free for sale and purchase .
In this day and age of consumerism and greed , the concept belittles the idea of manorial lordships and the reciprocal rights carried therein .
Such titles should only be granted by the monarch ( not even by the PM on her behalf - as this would result in political appointments ) , and the duties of the title holder should be enforced .

I see a company that has found a cheeky loophole and a way to make an easy buck .
Good luck I say , I wish I had thought of that .
What I do n't get is the resident who paid £ 15,000 quid for a bit of land down the side of their property .
Why did n't they just buy the title and save a few quid or all the locals get together and buy it .
Doh !!!
Colin , Leeds Surely , as a feudal title , Lordship of any Manor is held from the Monarch - so all that needs to be done is for the queen to strip these petty lordlings of their titles ?
The land could then be held in common as a village green or , as has been suggested by the NT .
Dominic Newton , Bristol , UK Paying for right of access is pretty normal , the council will charge you for that right when the land belongs to them .
As long as any changes limiting the rights of land owners also apply to the councils .. then i would agree with it . :)
Timothy O'Brien , Thatcham
It could only happen in the great democracy we call England .
Give ALL these titled deeds to the National Trust .
It 's the only JUST way to deal with this .
We cannot continue Thacherite ideals , look at our roads and housing , a bloody mess caused by greed and government idleness .
Mike Preston , Blackpool , UK
The problem of these people buying titles would not come about had the owner of those titles not put them up for sale .
If the original landowners had n't been greedy and put them up for sale then perhaps the purchasers would n't have got their hands on them in the first place .
Out of all the people that are bleating on about their rights etc how many of them would n't do exactly the same thing should they be in the same position .
It really smacks of double standards
Karen Shield , Swaton , Lincolnshire To Karen in Swaton , I think these titles have not been sold by greedy land owners , from what I gather many of them are from families who died out and have not been in use for many , many years .
I think that people should be allowed to buy the titles but they should also have a commensurate responsibility which comes with the title .
When someone purchases a title it should be clear what comes along with the title , certainly this will add to the cost of them .
New title deeds will have to be drawn up in consultation with local councils and heritage agencies at the time of purchase and the cost of all this should be borne by the person who is buying the title .
This means councils get their say , vanity buyers get their titles , work is created and all is fair :o )

There is a fairly simple way to make this less of a viable option .
The locals should embrace the fact they have a lord , and make use of his services .
1 : For minor issues on the manor , enforce your right for the lord to hear your case in the " Manorial Court " a forum for dealing with the day to day running of the Manor , which he must provide at his expense .
The lord MUST also ensure all tenants are informed of the details of the manorial courts .
2 : Ensure the lord is keeping proper records of all tenures , eg numbers of chickens , goats cattle etc ( this is a required duty )
The added expense of running these tasks as well as the many others that a Lord is required to provide would make the fact of having this title more trouble than it is worth .
Mark Scott , Camberley Surrey .
The lady from Birmingham University is wrong to asy that 1920s legislation separated moanorial rights from the land - they had always been severable and the 19th century saw many instances of impecunious landed families selling the land and retaining the lordship rights , or if more modern in their approach selling the rights ( in the belief they were only of interest to moneyed snobs ) but retaining the land .
Some country solcitors and estate agents built up large portfolios of manorial titles as a result .
The 1920s land law reforms abolished manorial tenure ( called copyhold ) but was not able to abolish lordships of the manor because the interests in them were too many , too varied and too untraceable for the necessary compensation scheme to be a viable option .
It is hard to see how this could be got around now , especially as there is now a European dimension to the uncompensated loss of legal rights or privileges .

What are these ?
While the same three 9th Circuit Appeals Court judges heard arguments in two different spying cases today , they seemed to be two entirely different sets of judges .
When listening to the government attempt to bury , on the grounds of national security , a lawsuit against AT&T for allegedly helping the government engage in a dragnet surveillance program aimed at Americans , the judges expressed dismay that the government and AT&T could not simply show documents proving the surveillance did not exist .
That case relies heavily on company documents provided to the Electronic Frontier Foundation by former AT&T technician Mark Klein .
Large chunks of those documents were published by Wired News last year .
But in the second half of Wednesday 's hearing , the judges hardly asked any questions of the government attorney .
He argued that a case directly aimed at the government 's admitted warrantless wiretapping of Americans ' overseas phone calls had to be thrown out because the document the plaintiffs want to use to prove they were surveilled was " totally classified . "
That document was accidentally given to them as part of a proceeding to put an Oregon Islamic charity known as Al - Haramain on a terrorist watch list .
The attorney for Al - Haramain , Jon Eisenberg , impassionately pleaded that his case would n't put state secrets at risk , but the judges seemed immune to his pleas .
Judge Margaret McKeown said Eisenberg 's arguments that he should be able to rely on his memory of the document , even though a lower court said the document could n't be used made her " fell like I 'm Alice in Wonderland . "
Many thought that the Al - Haramain plaintiffs , who look to be the only people in America who can prove they were surveilled without warrants by the government 's so - called Terrorist Surveillance Program , would be able to clamber over the legal obstacles standing in the way of getting a court to rule on the legality of warrantless wiretapping .
Instead , the court looks likely to throw out the Al - Haramain challenge because the government says the alleged surveillance call log is too secret to be used in court .
But at the same time , all three judges seemed to believe that the government could confirm or deny a secret intelligence relationship with the nation 's largest telecom , without disclosing secrets to the world .
THREAT LEVEL 's David Kravets wonders , after hearing arguments all day , whether the Bush Administration is still spying .
So seemingly , in the eyes of today 's panel of judges , in the collision between secret documents and the state secrets privilege , " totally secret " documents are not allowed to play , but sort - of - secret documents – the AT&T documents – may be able to trump the power of kings to do as they will .
The first ever Vanity Fair Style issue features no one else but the style icon , Kate Moss .
Inside , the likes of Charlotte Casiraghi , Selma Blair , Renee Zellweger , Fran Lebowitz , and Gwen Stefani , along with four men – Prince Ernst August of Hanover , Count Menfredi della Gherardesca , Page Six ’s Richard Johnson , and Kanye West , have been anointed into the halls of Vanity Fair ’s 2006 International Best - Dressed List .
“ Kate had to be on the cover of the style issue because she is the most followed style icon of our time , ” said fashion and style director Michael Roberts .
“ She looks ravishing whether she ’s going to the grocery store or walking the red carpet . ”
When Roberts looked at the tally of votes for the International Best - Dressed List , “ she got the most among women , ” he noted .
His lobotomy , his recovery , in his words
Howard Dully a professional bus driver for a tour company in San Jose where he lives with his wife .
When Howard was 12 years old he was given a lobotomy .
He is the author of a new book " My Lobotomy " about his life .

His lobotomy , his recovery , in his words 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
Until he was 5 , Howard Dully was a happy child .
That was the year his mother , June , died of cancer .
June was " loving and indulgent , " Dully writes , so devoted that his father once said , " I could 've dropped dead and it would n't have made a bit of difference .
She had you . "
After his mother 's death , neighbors started sewing and cooking , doing laundry for the Dullys .
One of them , Lucille " Lou " Cox , became his stepmother two years later .
Rigid and punitive , Lou hated Howard .
When he was 12 , she arranged for the boy to have a transorbital lobotomy .
The surgeon , Dr. Walter Freeman , did the procedure at Doctors General Hospital in San Jose .
After sedating Howard with four jolts of electroshock , Freeman inserted two skewer - like steel knives into his skull , entering through the inside of the right and left eye sockets .
" ( He ) swirled them around , " Dully writes , " until he felt he had scrambled things up enough . "
The lobotomy took 10 minutes to perform .
The charge was $ 200 .
This is the story that Dully , a 58 - year - old San Jose bus driver , tells in his memoir , " My Lobotomy " ( $ 24.95 , Crown Publishers ) .
It 's a gruesome but compulsively readable tale , ultimately redemptive .
Unlike most lobotomy patients - some became vegetables , 15 percent died - Dully was relatively unscathed .
" The biggest impact it made on me was my self - esteem , " Dully says during a conversation in Jimmy's , a San Jose coffee shop with early - '60s decor .
" You know , they changed me .
They rearranged me .
' Am I me any more ?
Am I really crazy and do n't know it ? '
These things all go through your mind . "
Dully is hardly the picture of victimhood .
Six - foot - seven , 330 pounds , he 's a bear of a man with enormous hands , a voice like a cello and the visage of a grizzled biker .
Until last year , he wore his mustache super- long and droopy , like Yosemite Sam , and then decided " I was hiding behind it . "
No one would want to mess with this guy , but when you sit down with Dully you find a gentle , vulnerable man who speaks easily of emotional hurt .
Traces of sadness are embedded in his face .
His mood is subdued - or at least leveled - by the Prozac he 's taken for four years .
What 's surprising is Dully 's lack of bitterness .
Despite the lobotomy , despite the subsequent years when he was bounced from foster home to juvenile hall to mental institution - he says " there 's no point " in being angry .
" I 've worked through all that .
The only person it 's gonna hurt is me .
My biggest question is ' Why ? '
Why would an adult play the game to the extent it was played ?
...
I 'm not going to say I was walking on water and here came the evil stepmother who just had things poked into the back of my head .
But I do n't feel I did anything to deserve a lobotomy . "
At 12 , Dully was already 6 feet tall - a " hellious " kid , in his words .
He lied and shoplifted on occasion .
He smoked cigarettes .
Hated homework .
Because his dad worked three jobs and was never home , his stepmom meted out the discipline .
" Lou was a fairly small woman and it finally got to the point where she 'd spank me and I 'd laugh .
I think that scared her . "
In " My Lobotomy , " Dully and co-writer Charles Fleming describe how Lou consulted six psychiatrists in her search for a solution , and was told by four of them that she was the problem and not Howard .
Finally , she found Freeman and convinced him that her stepson was a candidate for lobotomy .
Freeman , subject of a recent book , " The Lobotomist " by Jack El - Hai , did n't need to be lobbied or prodded .
A psychiatrist and neurologist , he did n't invent the lobotomy but popularized and promoted it .
Full of hubris , he touted the procedure 's benefits at medical conventions , behaving , his partner James Watt said , " like a barker at a carnival . "
When patients suffered permanent brain damage , Freeman was unfazed .
" Maybe it will be shown , " he said , " that a mentally ill patient can think more clearly and constructively with less brain in actual operation . "
Given the brutality and imprecision of the lobotomy procedure , Dully is luckier than most survivors .
He believes his tear ducts were damaged by the lobotomy and attributes his sinus problems to the procedure .
His thinking processes , he says , " seem to go off in different directions to reach conclusions , instead of focusing down one path . "
More than anything , he feels a loss - a sense of having missed his youth .
" I still go to Los Altos , to the old house where I lived ( before the lobotomy ) .
Go to the schools that I went to .
I get out of the car and walk around .
I 'd do it daily if I had time .
For some reason it fascinates me .
" I think it gives me an attachment to when I had a family , " he says , clearing his throat .
" A normal family life .
Mom and dad and brothers .
Because from 12 years on my life was not normal . "
Throughout his 20s and 30s , Dully had problems with alcohol , drugs and homelessness .
He went sober in 1985 and quit smoking in 1994 after a heart attack .
In his 40s , he went back to school and got a degree in computer information systems but found he was too old to find work in that youth - centric market .
" I 'll never get to where my brothers are , because I started at 40 and they started at 20 .
I lost 20 years .
It happened too late in some respects .
That 's just the way it is . "
Dully credits his wife , Barbara , with putting him on a positive track .
They met 22 years ago and got married in 1995 .
Wedding pictures show them in gown and tux , astride matching motorcycles .
Dully has two sons , 30 and 27 , from an earlier relationship and has worked as a bus driver for 10 years .
He 's on a leave of absence from San Jose Charter Bus while he promotes his book .
" My Lobotomy " began as a radio documentary on NPR's " All Things Considered " in November 2005 .
Producers Dave Isay and Piya Kochhar intended a profile on Freeman but when they found Dully , who had recently started researching lobotomy on the Internet , they fell in love with his story .
They decided to focus on him instead , and urged him to narrate the piece in his gentle , resonant baritone .
Isay and Kochhar took Dully to Freeman 's medical archives at George Washington University in Washington , D.C. " My file has everything , " he says in the narration .
" A photo of me with the ice picks in my eyes , medical bills .
But all I care about are the notes .
I want to understand why this was done to me . "
The NPR piece captures a conversation with Dully and his father , Rodney , a former schoolteacher who was later divorced from Lou .
" I was manipulated , pure and simple , " his dad says in regard to the lobotomy .
But when Howard breaks down and professes his love to his dad , his father answers , " Whatever made you think I did n't know that ?
You shaped up pretty good ! "
He does n't say " I love you " back .
" Ever since my lobotomy I 've felt like a freak , " Dully says at the end of the broadcast .
( But ) I know my lobotomy did n't touch my soul .
For the first time , I feel no shame .
I am , at last , at peace . "
The response to the broadcast was huge .
So many e-mails flooded in that NPR's Internet server collapsed .
Today , Dully says , there 's interest from Hollywood producers to make a TV movie or feature film from his book .
" I 'd love it , provided it 's done with truth .
I do n't want any fictional account making someone out worse than they were or better than they were . "
There 's also a playwright in New York who , inspired by the NPR documentary , has written a play about Dully called " The Memory of Damage . "
Dully , who looks like a Buddha as he sits in his favorite coffee shop , seems to regard the celebrity as a cosmic joke .
For someone who spent his life plagued by self - doubts , who says he 's still intimidated by his father , it 's difficult to accept this attention .
" I tease my wife and other people , and say I have a swollen ego , " he chuckles .
" But I do n't have any news people camping outside my door .
I do n't live in any mansion .
" My idea for writing the book was first to get a little closure - which I find a little selfish , but that 's OK .
The other reason was to help people to think about how we treat each other daily .
Not just loved ones but everybody .
" Something you start here or say here may affect somebody 's whole day , maybe their whole life .
Ten minutes of what Freeman did to me has affected me for 47 years . "
What a brilliant sales pitch : " Feeling lonely and bored ? " asked the email newsletter .
Of course I am !
I 'm sitting at my computer , are n't I ?
I 'm reading a newsletter about import games , are n't I ?
Well then , the email went on , why not check out some newly available English - translated Japanese Adult Dating Games ?
Why not indeed ?
Up until now , if you wanted to feed your Hentai videogame fix you 'd have to brush up on your kanji and search out seedy game stores in the side streets of Akihabara .
Not any more .
In recent years , companies such as Peach Princess and JAST USA have been making English - language eroge ( as it 's also known ) available to American gamers .
Now , Play - Asia is making them easily available to us European lot .
But should we actually care ?
Is there any more to this heady blend of anime , videogames and porn than antique game mechanics and mildly titillating drawings ?
Eurogamer decided to find out .
The first part of our research took us to Play - Asia 's selection of Hentai Games .
A brief warning that the pages ahead contain ' Nudity ' , ' Strong sexual content ' and ' Explicit pictures ' confirm that we 're in the right place .
Further confirmation is provided by the selection of games on offer - a selection that also provides some pretty startling insights into the genre .
There are currently some 50 - odd titles available in translation at the moment .
And they are pretty odd .
Picking titles at random demonstrates pretty clearly that even this limited selection of hentai games caters to the broadest extremes of sexual proclivity : there 's transexuality ( Yin - Yang - X - Change Alternative ) ; gothic horror ( Animamundi - Dark Alchemist ) ; historical romance ( Enzai - Falsely Accused ) ; human sacrifice ( Bible Black : The Game ) ; submission ( Absolute Obedience - Zettai Fukuju Meirei ) ; mild incest ( Hitomi - My Stepsister ) and much , much more .
Certainly more than the odd cross-dresser in Guilty Gear , or Dead or Alive 's bikini babes .
According to Wikipedia , Hentai is a Japanese word that can mean ' change of shape ' , ' abnormality ' or ' metamorphosis ' .
As well as all this .
There 's also a wide range of play mechanics , from simple dating games , where you 've got to impress the girls enough to get them into compromising positions , to choose - your - own adventure style flowchart games , where you simply have to make choices at key moments to propel the sexual narrative along .
And if , for some reason you 're stuck without a Windows - compatible PC , you can pick from a choice of interactive DVDs , which all play in a regular DVD player .
And if for some reason you 're stuck without a pair of hands , you can chose those games that include a ' hands - free ' mode ( whatever that means ) .
And talking of hands , the next part of our research obviously demanded a more hands - on approach .
Three titles were duly selected and ordered .
And received , although only one of them in plain cover , presumably because only one of them - Casual Romance Club - was adorned with 12 pictures of naked girls on the box .
Saving that for last , the first game to be subjected to the sort of rigorous scrutiny that you 've come to expect from Eurogamer was Critical Point .
Originally released in 2002 , the game is essentially a choose - your - own adventure with 24 different paths scripted by Mobile Suit Gundam scriptwriter , Kenichi Matsuzaki .
It 's illustrated by partially - animated and still images , and accompanied by a sort of lounge bar jazz soundtrack .
Rather helpfully it can be played in an easily alt - tabbed window , and for anyone who is n't a fan of Matsuzaki - san 's work , the game 's creators have helpfully included a ' quick ' mode , which speeds through the story so fast you do n't have to read it .
Hentai games are known by a variety of terms , including H game and Eroge .
More patient gamers will appreciate the science - fiction take on a police procedural that plays out pretty normally until the lead character , an amputee undercover investigator , takes a tour of Moon Base D - 02 and this happens :
" The crew woman called Tsuei turned away from her panel and stood up .
She started walking towards me .
Before I knew it , she opened her uniform and revealed her breasts . "
The murder - mystery plot goes on to encompass sex with an older woman , female marines running round in fishnet tops ; a scatterbrained assistant who accidentally falls over and flashes her panties etc. etc .
There is one , frankly troubling scene , however , which incorporates sado - masochism and rape fantasies .
Which leads , of course , to the serious argument about whether games such as these are likely to dehumanise women , or encourage sinister patterns of real - life behaviour .
While you might imagine such an argument to be a lively and complex one , the game 's readme file boils it down pretty succinctly ( some might say too succinctly , given that the game 's amputee undercover investigator describes one of his amorous encounters thus : " I was consumed with anger and lust .
I did n't even really hear her screams of protest " ) .
Yep , the creators of Critical Point are pretty clear about the beneficial effects of playing these sorts of games .
The readme file makes clear that it 's all just a fantasy : " We would like to state clearly that we oppose abuse or violence against any individual or living creature regardless of gender or other distinguishing personal traits ...
Furthermore , we assert that sex is an important aspect of adult relationships , and that sexual fantasies shared consensually between adults can enhance the emotional bond of a such relationships . "
It continues , with what might be considered a bit of an understatement : " the completely fictional sexual relationships portrayed by this game 's artwork do not always exhibit ' safe sex ' practices , nor do they necessarily demonstrate the full range of sensitivity , communication and intimacy necessary to sustain a real life interpersonal relationship . "
Nevertheless , for anyone who would like to base their real life interpersonal relationships on a videogame depicting domination and rape fantasies , there are some real - life sex - tips : " Always protect yourself and others when engaged in sexual activity , and always follow the principles of ' safe sex ' .
Always treat your sexual partner (s ) with consideration .
Never use force to get what you want , whether your partner is a man or a woman . "
Hentai games are then further broken down into sub-genres , such as Yaoi for boy on boy ; Bishojo for pretty girls , and so on .
By comparison , the sexual activities on offer in the other two games chosen for research are more moderate , although the gameplay is probably more interesting .
Transfer Student was originally released in the same year as Critical Point , and depicts the story of a young man drifting aimlessly through college , fantasising about women .
It features a similarly branching narrative structure to Critical Point , but it 's enlivened by the occasional freeform section in which you can stare at women in a bid to become so aroused that you can retire to the men's room to fantasise about them .
It 's also enlivened by the occasional bout of sex with your step - mother , depicted , once again , with partially animated stills .
Casual Romance Club , however , is the premium pick of the pack .
Released at the end of last year , it is , according to the blurb , " the first dating - sim game released in Japan to feature a full English translation . "
It also features 12 pictures of naked girls on the box , and comes with a handsome hardback manual containing character biographies and plenty of advice , such as : " Relationships for only making love are wrong because some may want you to be responsible for it . "
Indeed , in spite of the naked girls on the box , this is a world away from the amputee rape in Critical Point .
It 's still , ultimately , about having sex with women but just like in real life you have to be willing to put in a bit more groundwork .
The narrative sees you participating in the Casual Romance Club , a school club formed " to offer a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere where love and romance can be discovered and explored without fear or failure or rejection . "
Which means you 've got four weeks to persuade your chosen girl ( or girls ) to get their kit off - and there 's a girl for every taste here , from the bookish bespectacled Sidney , to ko - gal Clare , or the worryingly youthful Amanda , or even the mature charms of Sophie .
Interestingly , we shied away from tentacles .
Perhaps it 's not our thing ?
It does n't save unlocked images to a permanent gallery , as Critical Point does , but it is , in every other way , a more sophisticated experience .
The game is a fairly typical dating game in which you have to woo your chosen honey by saying the right things .
It rather artfully resembles an internet chatroom , with various windows offering different types of information , and at the key moments , the more prurient parts of images are tastefully pixellated out .
Indeed , considering the plain - cover packaging , Casual Romance Club is remarkably coy , with most girls taking a lot of persuading to get to bed , and most of the pixellated - out sexual activities falling well within the normal bounds of taste and decency .
For porn , anyway .
There 's even a parallel translation function for people who'd like to hone their language skills to graduate to playing these games in their original language .
Despite the differences in narrative , sexual mores and gameplay between even these three games , there are undeniable similarities : the bizarre internal logic ; the conversational non-sequiturs that lead suddenly to sexual activity ; but mostly the sense of mild disappointment .
Judged by the standards of conventional porn , especially of the sort that 's now freely available to anyone with an internet connection , these games demand a monumental amount of patience .
Sure , those sickos who get their kicks by googling for amputee rape images might find their thing in games like Critical Point ( a google image search for research purposes only turns up a Final Fantasy XII pack shot and a picture of Jean - Luc Picard , for example ) .
But for the rest of us , it 's difficult not to feel underwhelmed when the only reward for patiently plodding through acres of mundane text and / or stultifying game mechanics is one or two semi-animated cartoon pictures .

" We fully support him in his decisions to try to end this crisis for the Palestinian people and to give them an opportunity to return to peace and a better future , " she said .
The crisis has now prompted the European Commission to suspend humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip .
The BBC's Matthew Price in Jerusalem says the West Bank and Gaza Strip will now effectively be split from one another - Gaza run by Hamas and the West Bank by Fatah .
But Mr Haniya said Mr Abbas had taken " premature decisions that betray all agreements reached " .
He rejected the notion of a separate Gaza state , saying : " The Gaza Strip is an indivisible part of the homeland and its residents are an integral part of the Palestinian people . "
Mr Haniya said he would maintain the national unity administration agreed with Fatah three months ago and would impose law and order decisively and legally .
' Outlaws '
Hamas fighters overran most of Gaza on Thursday , capturing the headquarters of Fatah's Preventative Security force and hailing Gaza 's " liberation " .
In practical terms these decisions are worthless

After nightfall militants entered Mr Abbas ' presidential compound , which had been left undefended when Fatah men slipped away earlier .
Palestinian Information Minister Mustafa Barghouti said Hamas was in total control of Gaza .
" What is happening now is not only the collapse of the Palestinian national unity government but actually the collapse of the whole Palestinian Authority , " he told the BBC .
Mr Abbas said he had issued his decree because of the " criminal war in the Gaza Strip " and the " armed rebellion by outlaws " .
Hamas won a surprise victory in Palestinian elections in early 2006 but has since been engaged in a violent power struggle with Fatah .
Hamas , an Islamic organisation , rose to prominence in Gaza during two Palestinian uprisings and refuses to recognise or negotiate with Israel .
Fatah , a secular political grouping headed by Mr Abbas , ran the Palestinian Authority until 2006 and officially recognises the Jewish state .
Patterns of human behavior and movement in crowded cities – the tipping point at which agitated crowds become anti-social mobs , the configuration of civic areas as defensible spaces that also promote free speech , the design of retail space that fosters active walking – are at the core of an immersive 3 - D computational model under development by an Arizona State University geographer .
" Crowds are vital to the lifeblood of our cities , yet , crowd behavior is veiled to traditional academic inquiry , " says Paul M. Torrens , an assistant professor in the School of Geographical Sciences .
It is impractical , Torrens says , " to establish live experiments with hundreds or thousands of people along busy streetscapes , to reproduce mob behavior during riots for the purposes of academic experimentation , or , to expect to replicate the life and death behavior under emergency situations in a fabricated fashion . "
" You could n’t stage a realistic rehearsal of an evacuation because people are not going to panic appropriately , or you could never bulldoze large sections of the city to see how it affects pedestrian flow , " he says .
Instead , Torrens is developing a realistic computer model that can be used to assist city planners , shopping center developers , public safety and health officials , and researchers in exploring the dynamics of individual pedestrian and crowd behavior in dense urban settings .
" The goal of this project is to develop a reusable and behaviorally - founded computer model of pedestrian movement and crowd behavior amid dense urban environments , to serve as a test - bed for experimentation .
The idea is to use the model to test hypotheses , real world plans and strategies that are not very easy or are impossible to test in practice , " Torrens says .
The current ways of measuring behavior that use statistical analysis or physics models have not proven to have the veracity that this model could potentially have , according to Torrens .
The new modeling approach will incorporate individual behavior and independent characteristics – age , sex , size , health , body language –– while also taking into account crowd - level features such as panic , as well as characteristics of the environment , such as safety levels .
The simulations will model both motion and emotion , Torrens says .
The model " will serve as an experimental , but wholly realistic , environment for exploring ‘ what - if ’ and unforeseen scenarios of relevance to cities and their citizens , " Torrens says .
For example , the project will develop simulations to explore questions of sustainability in downtown settings : how cities can promote walking as an alternative to driving ; how pedestrian flow can be better integrated with transit - oriented development .
Another set of scenarios will explore a range of health issues , for example , how might a pathogen be transmitted through mobile pedestrians over a short time period "
Urban and economic planners will be able to use scenarios to explore questions involving the positioning of anchor stores along main shopping streets , pedestrian flow past street entertainers and placement of tourist information sites .
In the areas of public safety and homeland security , the model can be used to examine questions asking how pedestrian interactions with cars can be minimized ; what the early signs of anti-social behavior in large crowds are and how polarizing influences can be neutralized ; and strategies that might be used to compel anti-social crowds into quiescence without the use of force .
A prototype of the model has already been developed and used to crowd dynamics following outbreak of a fire in a dense part of a city with only a single point of evacuation .
Torrens explains : " When trying to evacuate , people start to run and panic .
Jams will occur and the evacuation does n’t proceed as efficiently as it might otherwise . "
The prototype model records every state of every thing in the model every 60th of a second .
Once those data are in the system , the model exports this information into a Geographic Information System where the data can be analyzed mathematically .
From this information , " we are able to study collective human dynamics in incredible detail and explore how pedestrian crowds form under a range of conditions ; and then provide information on how crowds might be better managed , " Torrens says .
" I can quantitatively and empirically benchmark what is normal behavior or what is a deviation from normal behavior and what could have caused somebody to panic in that situation .
We ’re able to look at panic levels and why people react to things the way that they do , " Torrens says .
Torrens ’s research will be aided by a National Science Foundation CAREER
Award in the amount of $ 400,000 over five years .
The award is the most prestigious award that the NSF grants to junior faculty .
While highly sought after , the award is rarely given to geographers .
The inspiration for this NSF proposal came during Torrens ’ research in the areas of large - scale urbanization and urban growth system dynamics , though he found the research at the microcosm to be much more challenging .
" These are parts of geography that have very micro scale spatial and temporal dynamics that are on the edge of what we have theory for and very much on the cutting - edge of what we have the technology for , " Torrens says .
" This award for Paul will launch an already young and distinguished career to leadership levels in our discipline and related disciplines , which make use of computational modeling and spatial technologies , " says Anthony J. Brazel , acting director of ASU ’s School of Geographical Sciences .
" I would foresee his work impacting analyses in homeland security , urban and economic planning , sustainability , public safety , microscale analyses in geographic modeling and other areas , and will greatly advance our role for ASU in the GI Sciences arena on the national scale . "
With the NSF grant Torrens plans to have hundreds of thousands of pedestrian agents and larger downtown areas within the model .
" We can look quantitatively at the results of reconfiguring the urban environment , social environment , and ultimately , human behavior , which is something you can never do in the real world , " he says .

Brit Hume : Dems ' think War on Terror is political scam ' RAW STORY
Published : Sunday July 29 , 2007
Print This Email This Enjoy this video ?
Get the Raw Story feed to get vids as they break .
Brit Hume , Chris Wallace , Mara Liasson , Juan Williams and Fred Barnes faced off on Fox News Sunday and a question from Wallace to Hume about warrantless wiretapping by the Bush Administration spun into an indictment of Sen.
Feingold and Democrats for what Hume saw as their not taking the " War on Terror " seriously .
Williams comes to the Democrats ' defense but is quickly hollered down by an emphatic Mr. Barnes , who implies that Democrats are supporting suspected terrorists while wasting time on other issues , such as " holding all - night Senate sessions " on the Iraq war .
Barnes speaks highly of " interrogation techniques , " but not of habeas corpus .
Ms. Liasson , while seated at the table , gives up on trying to make a contribution .
The following video is from Fox 's Fox News Sunday , broadcast on July 29 .
# TRANSCRIPT : WALLACE : -- Director of National Intelligence said :
At this point , we have great difficulties intercepting conversations between a foreign terrorist in one foreign country and another foreign terrorist in another foreign country because of the fact that it might go in a fiber optic cable through this country .
Democrats , including Feingold , say this is a power grab , that in fact it 's like the PATRIOT Act ; they want to have a wholesale rewriting of our civil liberties .
Brit ?
HUME : Well , first of all , the question that Sen .
Feingold did n't answer was the one you put to him , and that is if they do n't like the " kitchen sink " as they call it , that the administration is offering , along with this proposal to fix this particular problem , then all they need to do is just pass the simple fix .
There 's been no good answer as to why that has n't happened .
My guess is that it will , but the answer from Anna Eschew in that hearing was instructive as well .
In other words , not " Oh my God , we really do need to fix this ; " no , she was lamenting the fact that she thought the administration was trying to scare the American people , which is -- make no mistake about it -- this is what a lot of Democrats and those who support them think .
They think the war on terror is some kind of a political scam which the administration is using to try to undermine civil liberties and expand the power of the executive branch of the government .
They do not treat it particularly seriously .
WALLACE : Juan ?
WILLIAMS : This is unbelievable to me .
Wait a minute .
When you say it 's likely to be passed , why does n't the administration therefore then suggest " Let 's just fix exactly this issue .
Let 's not put-- addition ? " ( Crosstalk )
And let me just say one other thing -- HUME : -- Excuse me , Juan , that 's exactly what McConnell was proposing .
WILLIAMS : No .
McConnell and the administration have a great deal more to say , Brit , and they 're interested in advancing the idea that you do n't have to go before the FISA court in order to get the warrant ; that you can do things and get retroactive approval .
But here 's the larger point about being scared :
Who is it , you know , Republicans or Democrats , that did n't properly arm this force to go out and fight this war ?
That did n't put enough boots on the ground to get the job done early ?
Who is it that confused the mission ?
Then you say , " Oh no , it 's somehow Democrats who are running scared . "
To the contrary , Democrats this week put in place money to protect the homeland and make it tougher for terrorists to crack our defenses here at home .
I do n't see how you can say it 's anything but scaremongering and puppeting propaganda to say " Oh no , it 's the Democrats , those bad guys . "
BARNES : Well , they are in charge , you know , now , they are in charge .
I mean , they can do whatever -- they can write whatever bill they want .
They do n't have to listen to Mike McConnell or President Bush on this question of this wireless surveillance .
They can do this FISA thing .
And when you look at the more recent record it may be true , although I did n't realize you were one , back when the war started , who was calling for more troops .
I thought you were against the war , now you say there were more troops , but look --( Crosstalk ) -- Here 's what Democrats want : 1 ) They 've sat on this request by the administration for six months while they were spending a lot of time holding all - night Senate sessions and and going after [ Attorney General ]
Gonzales and all this stuff .
They want to ban a lot of this wireless surveillance -- I mean , certainly Sen .
Feingold does , because he 's called it unconstitutional and using it " impeachable " and so on .
They want to shut down Guantanamo .
They want to give all those terrorists the rights that a guy arrested for drunken driving in the United States would have , including habeas corpus .
You know , thirty of them from Guantanamo have been released , gone back into terrorism , been arrested or killed again , and they want to soften all the interrogation techniques , particularly the ones that have worked so well ... #

My advise for you is not to open any PDF files ( locally or remotely ) .
Other PDF viewers might be vulnerable too .
The issues was verified on Windows XP SP2 with the latest Adobe Reader 8.1 , although previous versions are also affected .
A formal summary and conclusion of the recent GNUCITIZEN 's bug hunt to be expected soon .
WASHINGTON , Aug. 22 — The Bush administration is set to issue a regulation on Friday that would enshrine the coal mining practice of mountaintop removal .
The technique involves blasting off the tops of mountains and dumping the rubble into valleys and streams .
It has been used in Appalachian coal country for 20 years under a cloud of legal and regulatory confusion .
The new rule would allow the practice to continue and expand , providing only that mine operators minimize the debris and cause the least environmental harm , although those terms are not clearly defined and to some extent merely restate existing law .
The Office of Surface Mining in the Interior Department drafted the rule , which will be subject to a 60 - day comment period and could be revised , although officials indicated that it was not likely to be changed substantially .

Researchers at the University of Warwick have found that sexual orientation has a real effect on how we perform mental tasks such as navigating with a map in a car but that old age does not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation and withers all men ’s minds alike just ahead of women’s .
The University of Warwick researchers worked with the BBC to collect data from over 198,000 people aged 20 – 65 years ( 109,612 men and 88,509 women ) .
As expected they found men outperformed women on tests such as mentally rotating objects ( NB the researchers ’ tests used abstract objects but the skills used are also those one would use in real life to navigate with a map ) .
They found that women outperformed men in verbal dexterity tests , and remembering the locations of objects .
However for a number of tasks the University of Warwick researchers found key differences across the range of sexual orientations studied .
For instance in mental rotation ( a task where men usually perform better ) they found that the table of best performance to worst was :
Heterosexual men Bisexual men Homosexual men Homosexual women Bisexual women Heterosexual women
In general , over the range of tasks measured , where a gender performed better in a task heterosexuals of that gender tended to perform better than non-heterosexuals .
When a particular gender was poorer at a task homosexual and bisexual people tended to perform better than heterosexual members of that gender .
However age was found to discriminate on gender grounds but not sexual orientation .
The study found that men ’s mental abilities declined faster than women ’s and that sexual orientation made no difference to the rate of that decline either for men or women .

Scarborough is one of the many conservatives out there who are fed up with this Republican controlled government and fully realize a need for checks and balances within our government .
This month 's Washington Monthly has a whole series of articles on " Conservatives on why the GOP should lose in 2006 " ( including articles by Buckley , Fein and Bartlett ) .

In a lesson plan for Christian middle schoolers , Christian graduate students in Education have a specific purpose :
Purpose :
By the end of this lesson , students will have a better understanding of Genesis 1:1 – “ In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . ”
There are basically two religions competing for the minds , hearts , and loyalties of intelligent man .
One of the religions is Christianity ; the other religion is evolution .
Students will be equipped to defend their Christian belief in a Creator who created … out of nothing .
You know this is going to be good .
Not surprisingly , there are mistakes everywhere .
But the best error comes when the grad students attempt to show the problems that the evolutionists have not solved .
Like the problem of the creation of human life .
They write :
[ S] cientists have computed that to provide a single protein molecule by chance combination would take 10262 years .
Take thins pieces of paper and write “ 1 ” and then zeros after them – you would fill up the entire known universe with paper before you could write that number .
Tiny Frog jumps all over that :
Wow .
An amazing new fact I could only learn from a creationist !
10^262 cannot even be written !
But , thanks to the * real - ultimate power * of the internets , we can actually see what this number looks like !

Pretty much everyone with a brain agrees that the Administration ’s approach to Iraq was disastrous ( this excludes both Cheney and Lieberman ) .
So you would think the architects of Bush ’s war , neoconservatives , would be banished to the political wilderness .
Somehow , these guys are still around , and now they are giving the ’08 candidates advice :
Most Americans disapprove of the Iraq war and of exporting democracy by force , yet neoconservative proponents of those policies advise the leading Republican presidential hopefuls .
“ There is an overwhelming presence of neoconservatives and absence of traditional conservatives that I do n’t know what to make of , ” said Richard V. Allen , former Reagan White House national security adviser .

Gay street fair Last Supper parody prompts Catholic beer boycott David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday September 27 , 2007

Print This Email This William Donahue of the Catholic League told Fox news on Thursday that his organization plans to call for a boycott of Miller Beer over a poster advertising the " Folsom Street Fair , " an annual gay street fest in San Francisco known as " the world 's largest leather event . "
The poster , which depicts a scene of a gay leather bar parodying Da Vinci 's " Last Supper , " has previously been featured by Fox as an " attack on Christianity . "
Donahue said his organization will be contacting 208 religious groups to participate in the boycott ( including Muslims , for whom alcohol is forbidden . )
Miller Beer , which has sponsored the fair for several years , has asked to have its logo removed from the offending poster , but this is not enough to satisfy Donahue , who is particularly outraged that charities supported by the fair include " the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence , a notoriously anti-Catholic group . "
" Miller does n't know what they 're in for , " Donahue threatened .
" We 're putting up the pictures on our website . "
Fred Kuhr of In Newsweekly , a New England gay and lesbian newspaper , began trying to say , " Boycotts like this that have happened in the past have failed ... " but was immediately interrupted by Donahue .
" No , I had one with WalMart two years ago , buddy , " Donahue sneered .
" I won within 48 hours and I 'll win on this too .
" WalMart did not suffer ... " began Kuhr .
" Because they gave in !
They gave in to my demand ! " yelled Donahue .
" Where have you been living ? "
Donahue , who successfully intimidated the John Edwards campaign last winter into firing two liberal bloggers , seemed to have no doubts of his own ability to bully both Miller Beer and Fred Kuhr .
" Were you offended by the Sopranos version of the Last Supper ? " Kuhr tried asking .
" I mean , the Last Supper has been parodied and been an object of satire for decades . "
Donahue insisted that the Sopranos is different than " half - naked men in leather standing over a table with sex toys . "
His rhetoric became increasingly belligerent as he continued to taunt the unfortunate Kuhr , telling him , " You do n't even know what you 're talking about . "
" It does n't offend the City of San Francisco , " said Kuhr weakly .
" I have no doubt about that , " Donahue replied smugly .
" It offends me .
That 's all that matters . "
" It 's a Catholic - bashing festival in part , " Donahue went on , " and this is the sickest , most depraved segment of the gay community .
...
Most gay people would n't be associated with this crap .
But you want to defend it ?
I do n't know where you came from . "
" There 's no sex going on [ in the poster ] " Kuhr retorted weakly .
" There are a couple of objects that are shocking ... "
" Fred , you should n't go on tv again , " said Donahue dismissively .
" You 're a loser . "
" Is it a Catholic value to call someone a loser ? " asked Kuhr , finally roused to a mild degree of anger .
" It 's called the truth , yes , " said Donahue .
" Catholics believe in the truth . "

Saturn 's gauzy G-ring is being swept into its orbit , grain by grain , from a region of icy chunks on its inner edge .
So say researchers working on data from NASA 's Cassini spacecraft in the 2 August issue of the journal Science .
A single bright arc on the inside of Saturn 's G - Ring .

Most of Saturn 's dusty rings are associated with a moon : for example , it is thought that the moon Enceladus ' leaky bottom creates the E-ring ; and the F - ring can trace its origins to the moons Prometheus and Pandora .
But the G - ring does n't have a moon , and its origin has been a mystery .
But now researchers say they have uncovered a mechanism that explains how it is formed .
In the ring 's inner edge there is a region of relatively large particles that extends roughly one sixth of the way around the circumference of the ring .
It is about 250 kilometres wide , much narrower than the full 6,000 - kilometre width of the G-ring .
The large particles are broken up by constant impacts from micro-meteoroids , and as plasma in Saturn 's magnetic field moves through the region , the finer , dust - sized particles are swept up to form the G-ring .
" Distant pictures from the cameras tell us where the arc is and how it moves , while plasma and dust measurements taken near the G - ring tell us how much material is there , " said Matthew Hedman , a Cassini imaging team associate at Cornell University , and lead author on the Science paper .
The arc is thought to be a relatively long - lived feature , confined by the gravitational influence of the moon Mimas .
Part of Hedman 's research involved constructing a model that demonstrated the mechanics of this confinement .
Further , the research has revealed that there must be plenty of unseen material in the arc - chunks ranging from pea-sized to small boulders .
In total , the arc 's mass is equivalent to that of an ice - rich moon around 100 metres across .
The team plans to take a closer look for the missing material when Cassini passes through the region again in 18 months . ®

In case you need any more examples , Senator , here ya go .

UPDATE : Looks like Senator Schumer is n't alone .
Yevgeny Gontmakher , an economist who worked as a senior adviser to the Cabinet until 2003 , told me , “ Even Putin does n’t know what he ’s going to do yet .
He is just reacting to events , day by day .
You might see him make some democratic - seeming moves toward the end of the year .
He wants to legitimatize his power in the eyes of the West .
There wo n’t be a third term .
He wants to join the club of former Presidents : Bush , Chirac , and all the rest .
At the same time , there are a lot of problems that are coming due and there is always the chance that the price of oil will drop .
Winning the Olympics for Sochi marked the peak of his popularity .
So why hang on ? ”
Yet stories persist that Putin may yet do so .
According to a report in the newspaper Novaya Gazeta , a Kremlin working group is examining scenarios for constitutional change to allow Putin more terms .
The pro-Kremlin party , United Russia , has well in excess of the two - thirds majority needed to alter the law .
In the end , though , Putin will almost certainly prefer to maintain the patina of democratic procedure — “ I have no intention to reduce everything I ’ve done to zero ” — and preserve a strong influence over his successor .
When he was asked earlier this month about his desire to continue in public life , Putin , with characteristic vagueness , said , “ I hope to be fit enough and I have the desire to do so .
Any future President will have to reckon with that . ”
Living in Moscow in the late nineteen - eighties and the early nineties , I spent many weekend mornings at various halls around the city — the House of Film , the Architect ’s Union , the Writer ’s Union — listening to Moscow intellectuals make speeches demanding that Gorbachev push reforms forward , faster .
Kasparov ’s political education took place at these meetings .
He was at the zenith of his celebrity as a chess champion .
Within a few years of Gorbachev ’s rise to power , in March , 1985 , political groups called nyeformali , or “ informals , ” were created , first in Moscow and then throughout the Soviet Union .
The most important of these early groups was Moscow Tribune , a “ discussion group , ” dominated by former political dissidents like Andrei Sakharov , Larisa Bogoraz , and Sergei Kovalyov and a range of shestidesyatniki , intellectual members of the sixties generation , who came of age after the death of Stalin .
With Kasparov often sitting in the audience , they discussed history , economics , democratization , human rights , and ethnic problems in the Caucasus , the Baltic States , and Central Asia .
“ The environment was different in 1987 , 1988 , 1989 than it is now , ” Kasparov said .
“ There was consensus in Soviet society that the game was over .
There was a demand for change .
People were opposed to the old Soviet system , from the feudal republics in Central Asia to the Baltics , which were essentially part of Europe .
The system had outlived itself .
But there was no clear plan .
There was a demand .
Everyone recognized that oil prices were going down and the Soviet system would collapse .
. . .
Today , the majority of people do n’t like what they feel and see , but there is a defensive layer : what if something else is worse ?
They remember it could be worse like it was when the economy collapsed in 1998 , or when the Union collapsed , in 1991 . ”
One of the earliest ethnic conflicts under Gorbachev was the dispute in the Caucasus between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the region of Nagorno - Karabakh .
In those days , Kasparov split his time between his home town , Baku , the Azerbaijani capital , and frequent trips to Moscow and matches abroad .
On January 13 , 1990 , he and his team of chess trainers were at a resort north of Baku , preparing for a match .
The atmosphere throughout the region was tense .
There had already been violence against the minority populations , especially against Armenians in the town of Sumgait .
That evening in Baku , gangs stormed through Armenian neighborhoods , beating men , women , and children .
They torched apartments and houses ; there were rapes and stabbings .
Kasparov wanted to help his friends and relatives in Baku , but he was stuck ; there were rumors that the gangs were headed to the resort where he was training and to other towns in the republic .
A few days later , he was able to go to his apartment in Baku but had time only to grab some family pictures and childhood chess notebooks .
The Azerbaijanis , together with the K.G.B. , had shut down most flights , trains , and other transport out of Baku .
Kasparov , however , was somehow able to arrange a chartered plane from Moscow .
On the seventeenth , he filled all sixty - eight seats with other Armenians and left for the Soviet capital .
When the violence subsided , almost all of the Armenians who still lived in Baku had fled .
On January 20th , the Soviet Army , under Gorbachev ’s command , moved into Baku not to save Armenians — it was too late for that — but to protect the leadership of the Azerbaijani Communist Party against a growing opposition .
Kasparov , whose privilege allowed him to stay at the Regency Hotel in New York and the St. James Club in Paris , had become a refugee .
He has never returned to Baku .
“ I always believed that a city is not the stones , a city is the people , ” he told the magazine New in Chess .
“ Baku is no longer the Baku where I was born and where I used to live .
There are some gravestones at the cemetery .
My father , my two grandfathers , and one grandmother were buried there .
But it is just a matter of stones . ”
The Moscow intelligentsia was ambivalent about Gorbachev .
He had freed Sakharov from his forced exile in Gorky and gradually unfettered the press , the publishing houses , and the universities .
But by 1989 many had grown impatient with his need to maneuver between the demands of the old élites of the Communist Party and the K.G.B. and the demands of the urban intellectuals who wanted him to abandon the entire Soviet system .
Few were more unforgiving of Gorbachev than Kasparov .
After the pogroms in Baku , he had met with Gorbachev and found him unmoved and “ unimpressed ” by his accounts of the bloodshed there .
“ All he could talk about was some new chief of the Azerbaijani Communist Party , ” Kasparov said .
“ For him , it was all big picture .
To sacrifice a single life did not seem to greatly matter . ”
When Kasparov travelled abroad , and when he wrote for Western newspapers like the Wall Street Journal , he denounced Gorbachev as a liar , a clever and desperate apparatchik , “ the last leader of the communist state , trying to save everything he can . ”
Before the first Gulf War , Kasparov told anyone who would listen that the United States should drop an atomic bomb on Saddam Hussein .
During the resistance in Moscow to the 1991 coup attempt , Kasparov took the conspiratorial position that Gorbachev had been behind the plot — that , in an effort to establish a national state of emergency and yet “ keep his hands clean , ” he had pretended to be under house arrest at his dacha in the town of Foros , in Ukraine .
“ I guess I am fifteen years older now , more experienced , ” Kasparov told me .
“ I was young and my political education was Soviet .
I saw things in black - and - white , Communist and anti-Communist .
Now in the Other Russia I find myself having to compromise with people who were my sworn enemies . ”
His newfound diplomacy , however , does not prevent him from comparing Putin ’s Kremlin to “ the Mafia ” and “ the Stalin regime . ”
Kasparov says that he was “ dead wrong ” to support Yeltsin for reëlection to the Russian Presidency in 1996 , even though it was a fairly open secret that Yeltsin , who had started a cruel and senseless war in Chechnya , was too addled to rule effectively .
Rather than risk allowing Yeltsin ’s opponent , the Communist Gennady Zyuganov , to come to power , Kasparov was one of those who chose to ignore the fact that Yeltsin , supported by oligarchs hoping to maintain their status , returned to power in a crooked ballot .
“ We knew it was neither a fair nor a free election , ” Kasparov said .
“ But we so feared a Communist resurrection that I personally went to Communist strongholds — Ulyanovsk , Kursk , Kaluga — and campaigned .
Then Yeltsin was elected and the country was looted by these men who put him forward . ”
Kasparov is hardly a conventional politician .
His appeal is the stubborn purity , almost naïveté , of his politics , the prestige of his former position as chess champion , and the public sense that he is an idealist .
Even the leaders of the anti-Putin intelligentsia who argue with Kasparov recognize that he could easily have lived a comfortable life in Moscow or joined the flow of rich migrants to South Kensington , the Seventh Arrondissement , or the Upper East Side .
“ The understanding of what an opposition is has been compromised in recent years — it ’s a term used ironically or skeptically or dismissed entirely , ” said Arseny Roginsky , the chairman of Memorial , a group devoted to human rights and historical memory .
“ This is the era of exposés and scandals , and everyone is seen to be crawling back to the Kremlin , for funding or whatever .
This is the era of complete distrust .
And so everyone ’s opposition credentials are disdained or dismissed .
Except for Garry .
He is unique , really .
No one doubts that he is in opposition to the Kremlin .
He might be a good politician or a bad politician , but no one doubts his sincerity .
In Russia today , you need to believe that an opposition exists — the image of an opposition , even .
Kasparov is honest .
As a little boy , part Jewish , part Caucasian , he had huge responsibilities .
Now he plays a different game .
And this earns him respect .
It ’s also important that he is so famous .
He belongs to the world . ”
“ I do n’t completely understand Garry , but he has huge reserves of energy and talent , ” Ludmila Alexeeva , a sixties - era dissident and a leader of the Moscow Helsinki Group , a predominant human - rights organization , said .
“ Russia , historically , has had its share of idealists .
And I would say that Garry is in that tradition . ”
Kasparov ’s demeanor hardly resembles Sakharov ’s saintly carriage .
After losing a match , he could be dismissive of autograph - seekers , rude to waiters , self - centered in the extreme ; sometimes he would humiliate the grand masters who helped to train him , pouncing on a piece of dubious advice and showing them , move by move , just how feebleminded their suggestion was .
Like anyone who has been the focus of admiration since kindergarten , Kasparov is ego - driven ; people wait on him ; friends , family , and wives ( there have been three ) know that his needs come first .
And yet , for the most part , he is as generous as he is intelligent .
Despite the single - minded attention he has given to an abstruse game of sixty - four squares , he is interested in everything from sports ( soccer , especially ) to literature ( his favorite novel is Bulgakov ’s “ The Master and Margarita , ” a celebrated example of allegory in the Soviet era ) .
Kasparov was born in 1963 in Baku .
His father , Kim Weinstein , was Jewish , and his mother , Klara Kasparova , Armenian .
When Garry was around six , he picked up an endgame puzzle in the newspaper and solved it , even though he did n’t yet know the rules of chess .
“ Since Garry knows how the game ends , ” his father said , “ we ought to teach him how it begins . ”
The next year , Kim Weinstein died , of cancer .
Garry started to play chess obsessively .
In those days , chess was a Soviet obsession and the regime sponsored an elaborate network of chess academies ; Garry started to train at one run by the former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik .
At the age of twelve , Garry was attracting national attention in chess , and he took his mother ’s family name .
“ When I began to have public success at chess , it seemed natural , ” he said .
“ My teacher , Botvinnik , himself of Jewish ancestry , added that it would n’t hurt my chances of success in the U.S.S.R. not to be named Weinstein . ”
The next year , he played his first tournament abroad , and by eighteen he was the Soviet champion , surrounded by admirers and under endless pressure to perform .
I finally got around to watching the first of the SICP lectures .
This first third of it is a real treat for those with a mathematical bent .
I summarize Sussman ’s Abelson ’s argument here :
Computer Science is not a science .
Computer Science is not about computers .
Computer Science is not even “ real . ”
Geometry is not about Surveying or Surveying instruments .
Geometry is about an using axioms and logic to provide a framework for exploring declarative knowledge– identifying and articulating what is true .
Similarly , Computer Science is really about imperative knowledge– articulating how to do things .
Computer Science deals with idealized components .
There ’s not all that much difference between what you can build and what you can imagine .
The constraints imposed in building large software systems are not physical constraints , but rather the constraints are the limitations imposed by your own mind .
Computer Science is therefore an abstract form of engineering .
The second portion of the lecture dealt with an overview of the course .
SICP is going to focus on programming techniques for controlling complexity .
Sussman made something as simple as Black Box Abstraction sound really interesting : the key to that was in how he highlighted that we ’re not just going to build black boxes , but that we ’re also also going to build black boxes that return other black boxes … and by passing black boxes as parameters , we ’ll be able to obtain another order of magnitude of abstraction in our programming style that is far beyond what non-functional programmers tend to think in .
He spent less time selling us on the Conventional Interfaces section , though he did mention that this part would hit on OOP somewhat .
The final portion of the course on Making New Languages sounded the most exciting – but his brief description of Metalinguistic Abstraction sounded ( at this point , mind you ) pointlessly geeky and pedantic .
I must as of yet lack some sort of illumination , because I suspect that my mind should be blown away by the mere hint of the magic of Eval and Apply … .
In the last section of the lecture he went over a bare bones introduction to Lisp .
He was using Scheme– and even though I have gotten DrScheme up and running with almost no hassle , I still recoil at the thought of spending any time away from Common Lisp , Slime , and Emacs .
Nevertheless , the Scheme approach is very clean and slightly more intuitive than the traditional Common Lisp way of doing things .
Just for fun I wrote a macro that implements some of the functionality of Scheme ’s define operator :
CL - USER > ( macroexpand - 1 ‘( define ( sq- a x ) (* x x ) ) )
( DEFUN SQ - A ( X ) (* X X ) )
T
CL - USER > ( macroexpand - 1 ‘( define sq-b ( lambda ( x ) (* x x ) ) ) )
( DEFUN SQ - B ( X ) ( ( LAMBDA ( X ) (* X X ) ) X ) )
T
CL - USER > ( define ( sq- a x ) (* x x ) )
SQ - A
CL - USER > ( sq- a 11 )
121
CL - USER > ( define sq-b ( lambda ( x ) (* x x ) ) )
SQ - B
CL - USER > ( sq - b 12 )
144
Note that the second case there was somewhat more tricky to implement .
I tried several different ways of doing it with setf and defun before getting a version that would work identically to the first case .
The key ( or possibly the ‘ hack ’ ) was to define the function with the arguments from the lambda … and then splice those arguments in with , @ after the lambda expression .
I think I had this same difficulty when I was trying to understand Michael Harrison ’s example from the Little Schemer a few weeks ago– Scheme and Common Lisp seem to work in subtly different manners in this case .
But working through this example has helped me understand the differences a little better .
Anyways , the most shocking thing in the lecture for me was when Sussman blithely tossed out the phrase “ syntactic sugar . ”
( He defined it as “ somewhat more convenient surface forms for typing something . ” )
I usually associate this phrase with smarty pants blogger types that really want to sound cool .
Yeah , like all you need to do to sound cool is to criticize Java a little and throw this phrase around !!
Now that I ’ve seen it turn up here , I guess I ’ll have to get down off my high horse the next time my hackles are raised over this ….

Mr. Gallagher was unhurt and the mugger was later caught by the police , but one night soon after the mugging , with the image of his attacker 's dark silhouette still burned into his memory , Mr. Gallagher was mesmerized by a shadow on the sidewalk .
He reached into his pocket and felt the chalk he had used to write the outdoor menu at Bar Tabac , and he dropped to his knees to outline it .
Shadow art was born .
Now Mr. Gallagher heads out on foot or on his bike with a backpack full of chalk , looking for shadows to trace .
When he tells you that " everything is fair game , " he means it .
He has traced everything from hydrants to whole city blocks .
While most people in Carroll Gardens and Park Slope have never seen him , many know his work and they seem to like it .
( While the city 's administrative code says defacing streets is illegal , it is unclear whether that holds true for sidewalks . )
Patty Wu , owner of Handmade on Smith Street , knows Mr. Gallagher 's work because he often stops to trace the shadows of objects in her window display , like women 's shirts and lingerie sets .
" I love it ;
It 's great , it creates a lot of visual interest and people stop and then see the store , " Ms. Wu said of the chalk outlines .
It even stirs a little friendly neighborhood rivalry .
" People across the street say , ' How come he does it in front of your store so much ? ' and I say ' Because I have good lighting , ' " Ms. Wu says with a smile .
More than anything , Mr. Gallagher will tell you , his work is meant for pure enjoyment .
" All of my chalk drawings are like graffiti , " he said .
" It 's putting out public art for people who normally would n't go to a museum . "
Claude DeCastro , the owner of the Hoyt Street bar Kili , saw Mr. Gallagher 's chalk art and invited him to put up a show of paintings on canvas in the bar , where it is now displayed .
FOX - Vern has some words for you about the pansy - assing of the 4th DIE FLACCID movie .
Published at : June 10 , 2008 , 8:11 p.m. CST by Moriarty
A reader named Ed Wilson tipped me off to the following outrageous lunacy : " In June 's VANITY FAIR , it states that Bruce Willis was initially disappointed that his fourth DIE HARD film will likely be cut to get a PG - 13 rating rather than an R.
' I really wanted this one to live up to the promise of the first one , which I always thought was the only really good one . '
And he 's not happy about it .
' That 's a studio decision that is becoming more and more common , because they 're trying to reach a broader audience .
It seems almost a courageous move to give a picture an R rating these days .
But we still made a pretty hardcore , smashmouth film . ' "
Dearest 19th Century Fox : Howdy .
Name 's Vern , nice to meet you .
I am writing to ask you one question .
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME ARE YOU JOKERS TRYING TO PULL ?
Before you blow me off to go bathe in that champagne / money / panda blood mixture you have in your hot tub , please be aware that I am not speaking as a member of the internet community , or associate of the nerd community .
I think ALL communites agree with me on this , except maybe the Amish , who do n't watch movies and are therefore neutral .
I am speaking as an American , and as a citizen of the world .
You can't fucking do that to DIE HARD .
Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I thought the movie was called LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD .
But from what Vanity Fair is saying here , it sounds more like LIVE FREE OR DIE -- WELL , LET'S NOT DIE TOO HARD , THERE ARE CHILDREN PRESENT .
Which , in my opinion , is not as good of a title .
Now , I know what you 're thinking .
If we make a horrible movie for babies and make it PG - 13 , it will make lots of money .
The movies that make money these days are worthless garbage intentionally designed to be of a low quality , intelligence and entertainment value , in order to lower standards , make people stupider , destroy our culture and make short - term , tainted money for our evil corporation .
Okay , fair enough .
You know your business , I can't argue with your money piles .
But let me remind you of a couple movies you guys had something to do with .
Exhibit A : DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE , aka DIE HARD 3 Exhibit B : DIE HARD 2 , aka DIE HARDER Exhibit C : DIE HARD , aka GREATEST AMERICAN ACTION MOVIE OF ALL TIME
There are many things these three movies have in common .
Two of them : they made you all kinds of money ( untainted money that you could be proud of ) and they were Rated - R. DIE HARD is a name you 're gonna have a hard time living up to , even with an R-rating .
The world is already skeptical .
Does organic John McClane have to be updated to the CGI world to fight computer hackers ?
We do n't know .
We 're not sure about this role playing vampire sissy being the director , either .
Some people have trouble with the title LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD , even though it 's awesome .
The trailer is pretty good , but you 've got a bald , fearless John McClane we have to get used to , plus you teamed him with that smarmy prick from the Mac commercials , and I know I personally came VERY close to ritualistically burning myself in front of your offices when I found out you put Kevin Smith in the movie as a wacky computer genius .
I bet you ten bucks Argyle ( limo driver from part 1 ) could take him in a fight , hack into a database faster than him AND direct a better movie .
But that 's beside the point .
My point is that you have alot going against you .
I , as a die hard DIE HARD die hard , am willing to give you a chance .
I am praying for a real DIE HARD .
The world of action cinema NEEDS a real DIE HARD .
Let me tell you something .
I am not like Harry , I do n't get sent the scoops all the time .
But a while back , as filming was starting up on this thing , somebody sent me the script .
People were up in arms against this thing , the word that was leaking out was not inspiring confidence , and I think the idea was that I would read it , I would be outraged at how it was a bad DIE HARD sequel , and I would start some kind of online crusade against it and try to get them to stop and rewrite or something .
What I did instead , I did n't read the script , not even the first page .
I was suspecting that this probaly would be an unworthy sequel .
But on the off chance that it was n't I did n't want to ruin it for myself .
I wanted to go into that theater , sit down and see a brand new fuckin DIE HARD movie .
And if not be " blown through the back of the theater , " at least there would be a cool breeze of awesomeness blowing me lightly against the back of my seat , and cooling me off on a hot June day .
What could be better than that ?
I 'm keeping my hopes up .
I 've been rationalizing away all the parts that look bad and keeping my fingers crossed .
But if you cut the movie for babies , you finally lost me .
I do n't know if I would even pay to see that shit .
If I did I might not admit it to anybody .
You know what a PG - 13 action movie is ?
It 's THE MARINE starring John Cena .
Not a good movie , not a profitable movie .
It 's HALF PAST DEAD , Steven Seagal 's only PG - 13 movie , which also happens to be his last theatrical movie .
Hmmm , that 's odd , I wonder how that happened ?
When people name their favorite American studio action movies , they 're gonna talk about DIE HARD , LETHAL WEAPON , PREDATOR , maybe UNDER SIEGE , maybe SPEED .
If you want to go even more sci - fi than PREDATOR you could include TERMINATOR 1&2 , THE MATRIX , ALIENS , ROBOCOP , TOTAL RECALL , etc .
All rated - R movies , all good movies , all profitable movies .
That 's how you die hard .
PG - 13 is not dying hard .
As a measure of caution , I am asking all movie writers to pull a nerd - Hans - Grueber and hold the title hostage .
Do not use the word " HARD " on the title until we have been given proof of a hard rating .
As long as there is a chance of a dishonorable PG - 13 , please only refer to this one as DIE SOFT , DIE LIMP , DIE WEAK , DIE FEEBLE , DIE FRAGILE , DIE COMPROMISED , DIE IN A PUDDLE OF YOUR OWN URINE AFRAID OF FACING THE CONSEQUENCES OF BEING A MAN , etc .
I personally will follow this rule and I hope my colleagues will as well .
If you make this PG - 13 , you might get your opening weekend , it might be as big as if it was R .
On the other hand , people might say " What ?
A new DIE HARD ?
Where he 's bald ?
And the title is funny ?
And the Macintosh guy is in it ?
And fucking Silent Bob ?
And it 's PG - 13 ?
I do n't want to see that shit ! "
Or , " Bruce Willis said it was supposed to be R- rated , and he was really disappointed , I 'll just wait until the real , actual adult version of the movie is available for free , illegal , non-Fox - money - giving download after some pissed off studio employee leaks it . "
And the 13 - 16 year olds you 're banking the legacy of DIE HARD on will say " that old guy from 16 BLOCKS is supposed to be tough ?
Ha ha " and then they will pout sullenly as they text each other and listen to crappy music on iPods .
And this might make the Macintosh wacky sidekick guy happy , but it will not get you any money .
Which , in this ugly scenario , will be the fate you deserve .
Keep in mind , a 16 year old today was 4 years old when the last ( and not even best ) DIE HARD came out .
Do you think he or she gives a fuck about DIE HARD ?
And if so , is n't that odd , that somehow he or she has seen an R - rated movie ?
It 's almost as if it can be profitable to release R- rated movies .
Weird .
And before you pull some kind of cheap " yeah , but GRINDHOUSE was Rated - R and it lost money " bullshit , remember this : BRUCE WILLIS WAS IN GRINDHOUSE .
What are you gonna do , cut him out of LIVE FREE OR DIE FRAIL just to be safe ?
Come on , people .
Best case scenario , moneywise : you make a ton of money on it .
But everybody feels ripped off .
Your precious franchise is dead forever .
The shine on an American classic gets a little less bright .
Everybody starts associating the real DIE HARD with this horse shit and thinking it's not as good as they remembered it .
You sell less copies when the old , actual genuine made - for - adults good DIE HARD movies come out on HD - DVD , BLU - RAY and whatever other futuristic formats come into existence .
Nobody will even consider making a new sequel or video game or downloadable ringtone or Happy Meal toy .
When you die , you will realize that in the long run you could 've made more money on this DIE HARD thing , and without having to shame an entire country to do it .
You could 've held your head proud instead of saying , " yeah , but this is a business , we are not here to do good things for the world and humanity , we are here to steal their money and then rationalize it by saying that ultimately it is a business . "
And the real kicker will be when you realize that the stress caused by knowing the damage you had done to cinema and culture had made you ill , causing your last years to be miserable .
If only you had known now what you will know then .
That you could 've had it both ways .
You could 've lived free AND died hard .
Yipee kay yay , etc .
I 'm not gonna call out any studio head names , I do n't know who 's responsible .
But for God 's sake - listen to Bruce .
DIE HARD is for grown ups .
And for kids who are allowed to go to R- rated movies with grownups .
It is part of a long tradition of dads taking their kids to see R- rated movies , and making them think their dad is cool .
If you pull this punk PG - 13 move their dads will no longer be cool .
The American family could fall apart .
Do the right thing , pal .
There is a clear path to follow here .
What do you think John McClane would do ?
Would he sissy out ?
Fuck no .
You know who you are in DIE HARD - you 're Ellis .
Go back and watch it .
I think you 'll be interested to find out what happens to Ellis .
Do n't blow it , buddy .
Do n't be Ellis .
Be a man .
Do n't die soft .
You know how you want to die .

MOSCOW , Russia ( Reuters ) -- A Russian court found the former boss of music download Web site www.allofmp3.com not guilty of breaching copyright on Wednesday in a case considered a crucial test of Russia 's commitment to fighting piracy .
The allofmp3.com
Web site angered Western music companies by undercutting the price of downloads in deals they said breached copyright law .
Denis Kvasov , head of MediaServices which owned the site , was put on trial after entertainment companies EMI Group Plc , NBC Universal and Time Warner Inc. pressed for a prosecution .
" The prosecution did not succeed in presenting persuasive evidence of his involvement in infringing copyright law , " said judge Yekaterina Sharapova .
A local official with the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) , which is representing copyright holders in the case , said it would appeal the decision .
" We are disappointed with the verdict and will appeal , " IFPI regional director Igor Pozhitkov told reporters .
The site has been a thorny issue in negotiations between Russia and the United States over Russia 's accession to the World Trade Organisation , a key aim of President Vladimir Putin .
At the beginning of the year global credit card companies stopped allowing customers to pay allofmp3.com for music downloads and by July the Web site had quietly closed down .
Kvasov always said he was within the law because the site paid part of its income to ROMS , a Russian organisation which collects and distributes fees for copyright holders .
The judge agreed with his defence .
" Everybody who uses soundtracks has to pay a certain amount of their income to the rights holders and this company has done that , " she said .
" MediaServices has paid a certain amount of money to ROMS . "
At the height of its popularity allofm p3.com attracted millions of bargain - hunting music lovers across the world .
It would typically sell the world 's most popular tracks at a huge discount to U.S. competitors .
Russian marketplaces and underground passes are full of cheap copies of music and film on DVDs and Russia 's government has been accused of being too lax on protecting intellectual property rights , a basic principle of WTO membership .
But in July Russia 's top negotiator on WTO entry said he thought a deal would be ready by the end of the year .
Although allofmp3.com has disappeared , another Russia - based discount music Web site has since emerged -- www.mp3sparks.com, also owned by MediaServices .

But Wagner , far from being the Third Reich 's " house composer " , actually became much less popular during Hitler 's rule , according to new research .
The Germans were much more keen on Carmen , Bizet 's tale of a soldier 's scandalous obsession with a Gypsy ; and on Madama Butterfly , Puccini 's opera about an officer 's doomed liaison with a Japanese courtesan - neither particularly appropriate tales by the standards of Nazi ideology .
According to Jonathan Carr , author of the forthcoming book The Wagner Clan , Hitler himself was obsessed by " the Master " .
But the party faithful were not , and had to be dragged kicking and screaming to performances at Hitler 's insistence .
" We are all told that the Germans poured into opera houses to listen to Wagner as soon as Hitler came to power .
The opposite is true , " said Carr .
The party faithful 's devotion to Wagner has also been exaggerated , according to Carr .
We may think of Wagner as the soundtrack to Nazism , with newsreels of Hitler at Bayreuth and the famous Wagner performances at the Nuremburg rallies .
However , according to the memoirs of Albert Speer and Hitler 's secretary , Traudl Junge , most Nazis were bored silly at the prospect of watching five - hour - long epics in which , frequently , little happens .
At the 1933 gala performance of Die Meistersinger , for instance , so few turned up that a furious Hitler sent patrols to drag party members out of beer gardens and brothels , according to Speer .
And during one performance of Tristan and Isolde , Junge recalled a member of Hitler 's group dropping off and having to be rescued before collapsing over the railings of the box they were in .
His rescuer had himself been asleep for most of the performance .
The author has analysed the operas performed in Germany in the 1930s .
Wagner 's works did not come to dominate the output .
Instead they had already begun a slow decline during the Weimar period and their fortunes continued to wane .
In the 1932 - 33 season Carmen was the most performed opera in Germany , with Weber 's Der Freischütz in second place .
Four Wagner operas were placed next .
But by 1938 - 39 the highest ranked Wagner opera - Lohengrin - achieved only 12th place .
Leoncavallo 's Pagliacci was the most popular , Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana second , and Puccini's Madama Butterfly third .
And , by the war years , it was Verdi , not Wagner , who was Germany 's most performed opera composer .
The Master 's market share dropped to under 10 % .
" Wagner was already considered by the younger generation to be rather old - hat , " said Carr .
It is true , said Carr , that Wagner 's music was used at key moments in the Nazi regime .
On the so - called Day of Potsdam , the propaganda show staged on March 21 1933 by Goebbels , officially to inaugurate the new Reichstag , the day ended with a performance of Die Meistersinger ( at Hitler 's insistence ; originally a performance of Strauss 's Elektra had been planned ) .
The Ride of the Valkyries was broadcast to accompany reports on German air attacks .
Siegfrieds
Tod from Götterdammerung would be heard on German wirelesses to announce important deaths - including Hitler 's own .
And the overture from Rienzi was often heard on ceremonial occasions .
But the penetration of Wagner has been exaggerated .
Leni Riefenstahl 's
The Triumph of the Will , about the 1934 Nuremburg rally , is often thought of as having a Wagner soundtrack .
In fact , most of the music is Wagner pastiche .
Hitler 's personal obsession with the composer was , perhaps , partly to do with his identification with Wagner the man : he saw him as a lonely figure who had battled against the odds to achieve greatness .
And as a man who clearly understood the power of spectacle he was , according to Carr , fascinated by the " nuts and bolts of the staging " of the operas .
Programming Data visualization : programming an art piece
Computer programming is art .
Not just because it takes a creative mind to unambiguously express a software solution , but also because of so much potential for a creative expression of the result .
Enter data visualization , a process of conveying large amounts of complex information in a graphical form .
Modeled to display easily recognizable patterns and facilitate easier discovery of trends .
It is often a programmer ’s job to handle large data streams , and to perform complex organizational computations .
Though a well designed visualization does not only show off its data , but often itself as a whole .
As a piece of art .
A beautiful visualizations of the poetry texts .
Each word corresponded to a numerical code by adding the alphabetical values of its letters together .
This number was mapped onto the position on a circle , and marked by a red dot .
Gray lines connect the dots in the sequence the words appear in the poem .
PingMag , a Tokyo - based magazine about “ Design and Making Things ” , has recently published a post on the beauty of data visualization .
Digging through piles of boring charts , there are a few rare gems of absolute awe , and Andrew Vande Moere ( with whom the PingMag had an interview ) shared his experience to locate the better ones .
In a symbiosis of creative design and data visualization , piles of statistics are turned into pieces of art .
Andrew explains :
Information aesthetic visualizations should appeal both the mind and soul .
While they positively stimulate our senses , in terms of engagement , involvement , and imagination , they are also optimized for the specific task of conveying complex data - driven concepts in intuitive and easily comprehensible ways .
It is not a surprise then , that the most successful infographics use creative design insights .
In fact , the blend between art and function is so great , that there are data visualization galleries that showcase exceptional works .
Visual Complexity , for example , intends to be a unified resource space for anyone interested in the visualization of complex networks .
There are some stunning examples , especially in the realm of plotting social interactions .
The [ above ] model was a landmark illustration of how simple networks of interconnected elements ( artificial neurons , so to speak ) can be organized so as to form a memory system that exhibits several crucial properties of human memory .
A popular programming language for many data visualization models ( including the above neural network ) is Processing – a Java based language that is very simple to use , and lets one focus on the media and its interaction , rather than worry about the details of the rendering process .
It is fairly fun to play with , and the resulting Java applets are web enabled for easy sharing and demonstrations .
Remember the beauty of simple software .
Yes , computer programming is definitely art .
Would n’t you agree ?

I ’ve written that most people Have Already Encountered the Multicore Crisis But Just Did n’t Realize It .
Now I thought I would post a chart that shows graphically how the crisis has been here for longer than people might suppose :
The Multicore Crisis has to do with a shift in the behavior of Moore ’s Law .
The law basically says that we can expect to double the number of transistors on a chip every 18 - 24 months .
For a long time , it meant that clock speeds , and hence the ability of the chip to run the same program faster , would also double along the same timeline .
This was a fabulous thing for software makers and hardware makers alike .
Software makers could write relatively bloated software ( we ’ve all complained at Microsoft for that ! ) and be secure in the knowledge that by the time they finished it and had it on the market for a short while , computers would be twice as fast anyway .
Hardware makers loved it because with machines getting so much faster so quickly people always had a good reason to buy new hardware .
Alas this trend has ground to a halt !
It ’s easy to see from the chart above that relatively little progress has been made since the curve flattens out around 2002 .
Here we are 5 years later in 2007 .
The 3GHz chips of 2002 should be running at about 24 GHz , but in fact , Intel ’s latest Core 2 Extreme is running at about 3 GHz .
Doh !
I hate when this happens !
In fact , Intel made an announcement in 2003 that they were moving away from trying to increase the clock speed and over to adding more cores .
Four cores are available today , and soon there will be 8 , 16 , 32 , or more cores .
What does this mean ?
First , Moore ’s Law did n’t stop working .
We are still getting twice as many transistors .
The Core 2 now includes 2 complete CPU ’s for the price of one !
However , unless you have software that ’s capable of taking advantage of this , it will do you no good .
It turns out there is precious little software that benefits if we look at articles such Jeff Atwood ’s comparison of 4 core vs 2 core performance .
Blah !
Intel says that software has to start obeying Moore ’s Law .
What they mean is software will have to radically change how it is written to exploit all these new cores .
The software factories are going to have to retool , in other words .
With more and more computing moving into the cloud on the twin afterburners of SaaS and Web 2.0 , we ’re going to see more and more centralized computing built on utility infrastructure using commodity hardware .
That ’s means we have to learn to use thousands of these little cores .
Google did it , but only with some pretty radical new tooling .
You ’ll see more from me on the multicore topic ( you can always click it in the tag cloud on the left ) , but I did this chart on a lark and thought it showed the problem pretty clearly so I wanted to get a post out .

1 There is vastly more nothing than something .
Roughly 74 percent of the universe is “ nothing , ” or what physicists call dark energy ; 22 percent is dark matter , particles we can not see .
Only 4 percent is baryonic matter , the stuff we call something .
2 And even something is mostly nothing .
Atoms overwhelmingly consist of empty space .
Matter ’s solidity is an illusion caused by the electric fields created by subatomic particles .
3 There is more and more nothing every second .
In 1998 astronomers measuring the expansion of the universe determined that dark energy is pushing apart the universe at an ever - accelerating speed .
The discovery of nothing — and its ability to influence the fate of the cosmos — is considered the most important astronomical finding of the past decade .
4 But even nothing has a weight .
The energy in dark matter is equivalent to a tiny mass ; there is about one pound of dark energy in a cube of empty space 250,000 miles on each side .
5 In space , no one can hear you scream : Sound , a mechanical wave , cannot travel through a vacuum .
Without matter to vibrate through , there is only silence .
6 So what if Kramer falls in a forest ?
Luckily , electromagnetic waves , including light and radio waves , need no medium to travel through , letting TV stations broadcast endless reruns of Seinfeld , the show about nothing .
7 Light can travel through a vacuum , but there is nothing to refract it .
Alas for extraterrestrial romantics , stars do not twinkle in outer space .
8 Black holes are not holes or voids ; they are the exact opposite of nothing , being the densest concentration of mass known in the universe .
9 “ Zero ” was first seen in cuneiform tablets written around 300 B.C. by Babylonians who used it as a placeholder ( to distinguish 36 from 306 or 360 , for example ) .
The concept of zero in its mathematical sense was developed in India in the fifth century .
10 Any number divided by zero is . . . nothing , not even zero .
The equation is mathematically impossible .
11 It is said that Abdülhamid II , sultan of the Ottoman Empire in the early 1900s , had censors expunge references to H2O from chemistry books because he was sure it stood for “ Hamid the Second is nothing . ”
12 Medieval art was mostly flat and two - dimensional until the 15th century , when the Florentine architect Filippo Brunelleschi conceived of the vanishing point , the place where parallel lines converge into nothingness .
This allowed for the development of perspective in art .
13 Aristotle once wrote , “ Nature abhors a vacuum , ” and so did he .
His complete rejection of vacuums and voids and his subsequent influence on centuries of learning prevented the adoption of the concept of zero in the Western world until around the 13th century , when Italian bankers found it to be extraordinarily useful in financial transactions .
14 Vacuums do not suck things .
They create spaces into which the surrounding atmosphere pushes matter .
15 Creatio ex nihilo , the belief that the world was created out of nothing , is one of the most common themes in ancient myths and religions .
16 Current theories suggest that the universe was created out of a state of vacuum energy , that is , nothing .
17 But to a physicist there is no such thing as nothing .
Empty space is instead filled with pairs of particles and antiparticles , called virtual particles , that quickly form and then , in accordance with the law of energy conservation , annihilate each other in about 10 - 25 second .
18 So Aristotle was right all along .
19 These virtual particles popping in and out of existence create energy .
In fact , according to quantum mechanics , the energy contained in all the power plants and nuclear weapons in the world does n’t equal the theoretical energy contained in the empty spaces between these words .
20 In other words , nothing could be the key to the theory of everything .
A little over forty years ago , humankind successfully achieved the world 's first soft lunar landing .
Back then , getting to the moon was the focus of a competition between two of the greatest science and engineering efforts ever undertaken , with the might of the USA and USSR behind them .
Now Google wants to see private enterprise repeat that goal , and it 's coughing up $ 30 million to make it happen .
Back in 1966 , Luna 9 , a Russian probe , completed the first successful soft landing on the moon .
Before Luna 9 , previous probes had touched down after free falling to the moon 's surface , often with serious consequences for the probe 's health .
A mere three years after Luna 9 , Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first humans to set foot on our closest celestial neighbour and the farthest place man has physically ventured away from home .
Hot on the heels of the success of the Ansari X PRIZE , which was designed to spur on the development of a commercial spacecraft able to reach low earth orbit , the Google Lunar X PRIZE will be awarded to " the team that can soft land a craft on the Moon that roams for at least 500 meters and transmits a Mooncast back to Earth .
The Grand Prize is $ 20 M until December 31 , 2012 ; thereafter it will drop to $ 15 M until December 31 , 2014 , at which point the competition will be terminated unless extended by Google and the X PRIZE Foundation . "
In order to keep competitors interested , there will be a second prize of $ 5 million , awarded to the next team to land on the moon by the end of 2014 .
There will also be bonuses awarded for lunar landers that complete certain tasks , such as roving , finding water , or surviving the fortnight - long lunar night .
Google is getting involved , in the words of cofounder Sergey Brin , " because we believe in the entrepreneurial spirit and its ability to accomplish the most ambitious tasks . "
The complete rules are still being worked out , but since there 's only a little more than five years left to claim that $ 25 million , if you want to be in with a chance , you better get building !
I recently served as a " consultant 's consultant , " advising a world leader in his field on what to do about his website .
In particular , this expert asked me whether he should start a weblog .
I said no .
You probably already know my own Internet strategy , so it might not surprise you that I recommended that he should instead invest his time in writing thorough articles that he published on a regular schedule .
Given limited time , this means not spending the effort to post numerous short comments on ongoing blogosphere discussions .
Weblogs have their role in business , particularly as project blogs , as exemplified on several award - winning intranets .
Blogs are also fine for websites that sell cheap products .
On these sites , visitors can often be easily converted and the main challenge is to raise awareness .
For example , a site that sells pistachio nuts should post as much content about pistachios as possible in the hope of attracting quick hits by people searching for that information .
Some percentage of these visitors will buy the nuts while visiting the site .
Avoid Commodity Status
For many B2B sites with long sales cycles , quick hits to commodity - level content are insufficient .
Instead , these sites need to build up long - term customer relationships based on respect .
Take my own business , for example .
When I talk with people at my usability conferences , they often say that they 've wanted to attend for ages , and only recently secured their boss 's approval to come .
To address this issue , we added a " convince your boss " section to our conference sites , explaining the benefits of spending money on usability training .
Still , realistically , I expect to wait 3 - 5 years before meeting new readers of my site in person .
Blog postings will always be commodity content : there 's a limit to the value you can provide with a short comment on somebody else 's work .
Such postings are good for generating controversy and short - term traffic , and they 're definitely easy to write .
But they do n't build sustainable value .
Think of how disappointing it feels when you 're searching for something and get directed to short postings in the middle of a debate that occurred years before , and is thus irrelevant .
Obviously , I am referring to the user experience and to the style of the content in this analysis ; not to the technology used to serve up this content .
Thus , what I call " articles " might be implemented on a blogging hosting service .
What matters is that the user experience is that of immersion in comprehensive treatment of a topic , as opposed to a blog - style linear sequence of short , frequent postings commenting on the hot topic of the day .
It does n't matter what software is used to host the content , the distinctions are :
in - depth vs. superficial
original / primary vs. derivative / secondary
driven by the author 's expertise vs. being reflectively driven by other sites or outside events
Demonstrate Leadership
For the sake of argument , let 's say that you 're the world leader in your field .
We 'll quantify that as being the # 1 expert among the 1,000 people with websites in your field .
In other words , you are in the 99.9th percentile .
( Although you might think you have many more than 1,000 competitors , the Web thrives on specialized content , so it 's better to conceptualize yourself as leading a smaller subdiscipline , unless you 're so good that you 're # 1 out of millions of people . )
We can measure expertise as some combination of intelligence , education , experience , correct methodology , professionalism ( say , avoiding profanities and politics ) , and willingness to be frank .
The exact metric does n't matter here ; let 's just assume there 's a way to quantify how good people are within their field .
The metric probably follows a normal distribution , meaning that the 1,000 people have the following levels of expertise :
Histogram of expertise scores for 1,000 authors .
Each dot is one person .
Stupid people are on the left ; clever ones are on the right .
Assuming that you 're this good , you have to show it to gain customers .
And blogs are n't the way , as we 'll see once we plot the distribution of postings as opposed to writers .
Variability of Blog Posting Quality
Assume that the 1,000 people each write 10 blog postings .
The resulting 10,000 postings will follow a much broader distribution , because the quality of postings is extremely variable .
Let 's assume that a given writer 's posting quality is normally distributed , with a mean representing that person 's level of expertise and a standard deviation 3 times as large as the SD for expertise among people .
I do n't know what the actual number is , so this is just a rough estimate .
But it 's reasonable to assume that posting quality is more variable than expertise for several reasons :
Sometimes people toss off a posting in a minute .
Other times they spend hours .
Sometimes a writer happens to know a lot about the topic at hand , possibly because they 've just spent several months working on that exact problem .
Other times people know nothing — which does n't keep them from voicing their opinions :-)
Sometimes people are lucky and get a blinding insight .
Other times they post more out of duty than anything else .
The following chart shows the distribution of the quality of 10,000 postings in one Monte Carlo simulation I ran :
Histogram of 10,000 blog postings ' quality .
Each dot is one posting ; the highest - ranked expert 's postings are shown in red .
Bozo ramblings are on the left ; insightful stuff is on the right .
Of course , if I 'd run many more simulations , the histogram would be smooth , but the overall shape would be the same .
In the above histogram , each of the tiny dots represents a blog posting .
The larger red dots indicate the ten postings by our leading expert ( who was ranked # 1 out of the 1,000 bloggers we 're considering ) .
Although our expert tends to write good postings , a few of the many lower - ranked people will sometimes write even better postings .
Even if you 're the world 's top expert , your worst posting will be below average , which will negatively impact on your brand equity .
If you do start a blog despite my advice , at least screen your postings : wait an hour or two , then reread your comments and avoid uploading any that are average or poor .
( Even average content undermines your brand .
Do n't contribute to information pollution by posting material that is n't above the average of other people 's writings .
Plus , of course , follow guidelines for blog usability . )
In my simulation , our expert 's best posting happens to be # 25 from the top .
The expert 's second - best posting was ranked # 300 from the top .
It might seem fine to be the author of postings # 9,700 and # 9,975 out of a group of 10,000 blog postings .
But in fact , it 's nowhere near good enough .
The beauty of the blogosphere is that it's a self - organizing system .
Whenever something good appears , other blogs link to it and it gets promoted in the system and gains higher visibility .
Thus , the 24 postings that are better than our expert 's very best attempt will gain higher prominence , even though they 're written by people with lower overall expertise .
Prospective new customers do n't even have time to read 24 postings , so they 'll never make it down the list of rank - ordered blog postings to reach our expert 's best .
Beating the Internet
It 's almost impossible to fight the Internet : you 're up against millions of people who are willing to work for free .
But you have to do so , because if you work within the prevailing Web paradigm you 're letting the search engines take 98 % of your content 's value .
That 's okay if you 're not in the content business .
Our pistachio site does n't mind that it 's not making money off its recipe for delicious pistachio ice cream .
Just as long as it sells nuts .
If you 're an expert who wants to live from adding to the world 's knowledge , you must go beyond the mainstream Web model of single page visits driven by search traffic .
It 's easy enough to build a website that freeloaders will use , but that should n't be your approach .
You must change the game and create content that 's so valuable that business users are willing to pay for it .
You should also focus on material that lower - ranked content contributors can't easily create in their spare time .
Both of these needs are met when you produce in - depth content .
In - Depth Content Is Value - Add Content
It might take you only an hour to write a blog posting on some current controversy , but a thousand other people can do that as well ( in fact , they 'll sometimes do it better , as shown above ) .
And customers do n't want to pay for such a tiny increment of knowledge .
Sure , sometimes a single paragraph holds the idea that can increase a site 's conversion rate so much that a reader should have paid a million dollars to read it .
But they do n't know that in advance , so they wo n't pay .
In contrast , in - depth content that takes much longer to create is beyond the abilities of the lesser experts .
A thousand monkeys writing for 1,000 hours does n't add up to Shakespeare .
They 'll actually create a thousand low - to - medium - quality postings that are n't integrated and that do n't give readers a comprehensive understanding of the topic — even if those readers suffer through all 1,000 blogs .
Thorough content 's added value can rise above the threshold where customers become willing to be separated from their money .
This is the true measure of a sustainable business .
You have to identify opportunities with a non -linear utility function : where paying customers assign more than 10 times higher value to something that costs 10 times as much to produce .
The old open - source manifesto " The Cathedral & the Bazaar " holds much truth : when you 're the duke , you can't trade in coffee beans , because the bazaar dealers will always undercut your price .
You should build a cathedral , because a thousand tents can't compete with the Notre Dame .
The following chart shows another example from my own company : trends for key statistics across three editions of our report on e-mail newsletter usability :
Statistics through three editions of the e-mail newsletter usability report .
All numbers are indexed to make the first edition the baseline with index 100 .
As the chart shows , the fatter the report became , the more it has sold .
Of course , page count ( the blue line ) is only a rough indication of the amount of insight , which is what customers are really paying for .
The new edition has a large number of eyetracking heatmaps , showing how users read various newsletters , and these many illustrations eat up pages ferociously .
Still , there 's no doubt that each report edition contains significantly more information than previous editions .
The report 's price has increased less than its page count : as we keep doing this research , we become more efficient .
You could argue that customers are getting more for their money , and that 's why they 're buying more .
But this argument works only if customers in fact assign extra value to more comprehensive reports .
So either way , I conclude that in - depth content sells .
Why are paying customers ( the people who matter ) attracted by detailed information ?
Because systematic and comprehensive coverage is more actionable .
It also protects them against the risk of losses caused when something important is overlooked .
In my report example , consider an Internet marketing manager who 's in charge of the company 's email newsletter .
The report 's price is trivial compared to the millions of dollars many companies would gain from increased subscription rates , increased open rates , increased clickthrough rates , and enhanced customer loyalty from content that 's both better appreciated and read more often .
To improve these key performance metrics for her newsletter , the manager could spend a week surfing the Web and reading a thousand short pieces about newsletter design .
The result ?
A scattered set of imprecise advice that neglects many important issues .
Instead , that manager could spend a day gaining much deeper insights from reading a single , well - structured report with all - inclusive coverage of the topic ( and based on empirical data instead of each blogger 's personal opinion ) .
Saving 4 days is worth a lot in business , which is another reason to target business customers with value - added information .
In - depth content provides more value in less time than numerous superficial postings .
That 's why business customers have empirically been willing to pay , and that 's why you should emphasize fewer , better pieces as your content strategy .
Expertise vs. Content Usability
This has been a very long article , stuffed with charts , mathematical modeling , and theoretical concepts — like standard deviations and utility functions — that I know most readers find difficult .
Recommending in - depth content flies in the face of all guidelines for Web writing , which call for fewer words and scannable information .
The content usability guidelines are correct : they are indeed the way to make a site easier for most people .
Thus , you should follow the guidelines — rather than emulate this article — for normal business websites and intranets .
( When I say " business sites , " I include government sites and non-profits , as well as e-commerce and corporate marketing sites . )
For most sites , the content is not the point .
Instead , you want to answer customers ' questions as rapidly as possible so that they 'll advance in the sales cycle and start buying ( or donate , or sign up for your newsletter , or whatever else you want them to do ) .
Elite , expertise - driven sites are the exception to the rule .
For these sites , you do n't care about 90 % of users , because they want a lower level of quality than you provide and they 'll never pay for your services .
People looking for the quick hit and free advice are not your customers .
Let them eat cake ; let them read Wikipedia .
Still , even if you run an expertise - driven site , you should comply with the bulk of content usability guidelines : be as brief as you can ; use bulleted lists and highlighted keywords ; chunk the material ; and use descriptive headings , subheads , and hyperlinks .
The small percentage of users who are qualified prospects still read in an F - pattern , so a headline 's first words are more important than its last words , just as they are for normal sites .

Discovery of Buried Impact Craters on Mars Widens Possibility of an Ancient Martian Ocean
The origin of this fundamental " crustal dichotomy " is uncertain both in terms of how and when it formed .
But this recent discovery of the numerous buried craters may pin down the answer to when the lowlands first formed .
Boulder - Nov 8 , 2001
Soon after Mars was formed , it was bombarded by numerous large meteorites and asteroids .
Scientists have discovered an unexpectedly large grouping of impact basins buried under Mars ' northern plains that resulted from this pounding .
They used Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter ( MOLA ) topographic data to find them , because they can't be seen in images of the Martian surface .
Above these basins are thin young plains , but the lowland crust beneath them is actually extremely old and was formed very , very early .
According to Herbert Frey of the Geodynamics Branch of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , this is a radical departure from the popular belief that the northern lowlands were formed later in Martian history , perhaps by plate tectonic style processes .
Frey discussed these findings November 8 , at the Geological Society of America 's annual meeting in Boston , Massachusetts .
This discovery is a crucial piece to one of the greatest unsolved puzzles about Mars - why does its surface have two distinct hemispheres : one that is high and heavily cratered and one that is low and sparsely cratered ?
The origin of this fundamental " crustal dichotomy " is uncertain both in terms of how and when it formed .
But this recent discovery of the numerous buried craters may pin down the answer to when the lowlands first formed .
" The ancient age of the lowlands means whatever process produced them occurred both early and relatively quickly , " explained Frey .
" Things like plate tectonics may not work .
" Another ramification is that there have been lowlands in the northern parts of Mars for essentially all of Martian history .
That means that at whatever early time conditions permitted liquid water to exist on Mars , there was a northern lowland into which that water could drain .
" So it is quite possible that a shallow ocean may have existed on Mars very early in its history , as some have suggested based on completely different data . "
" The origin of the crustal dichotomy on Mars has been one of the main areas of my own research for a long time , so anything that could tell us how old the lowlands really were naturally was of interest , " Frey said .
" And of course , the discovery aspects of ' seeing ' ( in elevation data ) things that no one else had ever seen or even guessed might be there is intrinsically intoxicating .
Not only has this work turned out to be very important , but it 's also been fun ! "

Ancient , Gigantic Drainage Basin Became Aquifer On Mars
Tucson - Oct 9 , 2001
An enormous ancient drainage basin and aquifer system lies hidden and deformed in one of the most geologically dynamic landscapes on Mars , scientists conclude from a comprehensive , more than 10 - year study .
Scientists Find Largest Flood Channels in the Solar System
Tucson - Aug 1 , 2001
Scientists may have discovered the largest flood channels in the solar system on Mars where a system of gigantic ancient valleys , some as much as 200 kilometers wide , lies partly buried under a veneer of volcanic lava flows , ash fall and wind - blown dust in Mars ' western hemisphere .
Watery Tales From Texas
Cameron Park - May 4 , 2001
Some theorists at this year 's Lunar and Planetary Sciece Conference again reiterated their belief that there is evidence that substantial amounts of liquid water flowed on at least some parts of Mars not just in its earliest times , but occasionally in much more recent geological times -- perhaps less than a hundred million years ago .
Tectonics Not Oceans Shaped Ancient Ridges
Tucson - April 4 , 2001
What scientists suspect might be ancient ocean shorelines on the northern plains of Mars is actually a network of tectonic ridges related to dramatic martian volcanism , a University of Arizona planetary sciences graduate student and a collaborating post - doctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology report in the April 5 issue of Nature .
Sedimentary Rocks Suggest An Ancient Land of Martian Lakes
Washington - Dec. 4 2000
Layered geologic outcrops on Mars , that will be described in this week 's issue of the journal Science -- may be composed of sedimentary rock that dates from the earliest span of martian history , between 4.3 . and 3.5 billion years ago .

Patriots coach fined $ 500,000 ; team forfeits No. 1 pick
Advertiser Staff
In addition , NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell also notified the Patriots that they would forfeit their own first - round draft choice in 2008 if they reach the playoffs , or their own second - round and third - round picks if they do not qualify for the playoffs , and that the club would be fined $ 250,000 .
( The Patriots have San Francisco 's first - round pick in 2008 that was acquired during the 2007 NFL draft . )
" This episode represents a calculated and deliberate attempt to avoid longstanding rules designed to encourage fair play and promote honest competition on the playing field , " Goodell wrote in a letter to the Patriots .
NFL policy states that " no video recording devices of any kind are permitted to be in use in the coaches ' booth , on the field , or in the locker room during the game " and that all video shooting locations for club coaching purposes " must be enclosed on all sides with a roof overhead . "
In a memo to NFL head coaches and general managers on Sept. 6 , 2006 , NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations Ray Anderson said , " Videotaping of any type , including but not limited to taping of an opponent 's offensive or defensive signals , is prohibited on the sidelines , in the coaches ' booth , in the locker room , or at any other locations accessible to club staff members during the game . "
In his review of the facts , Goodell determined that the Patriots ' use last Sunday of the video camera , which was seized before the end of the first quarter , had no impact on the outcome of the Patriots - New York Jets game .
Goodell also believes that Patriots ownership was unaware of Belichick 's action , but determined that penalties should be imposed on the club because " Coach Belichick not only serves as the head coach but also has substantial control over all aspects of New England 's football operations .
His actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club . "
Goodell informed the Patriots that the NFL would closely review and monitor the Patriots ' coaching video program , effective immediately .
" I specifically considered whether to impose a suspension on Coach Belichick , " Goodell wrote .
" I have determined not to do so , largely because I believe that the discipline I am imposing of a maximum fine and forfeiture of a first - round draft choice , or multiple draft choices , is in fact more significant and long - lasting , and therefore more effective , than a suspension . "
The Yangtze River dolphin is no more – the first cetacean to disappear as a result of human activity .
After a fruitless search lasting six weeks , scientists failed to find a single Yangtze river dolphin , also known as the Baiji , in its natural habitat in China .
They will now propose that the dolphin be formally reclassified this autumn as “ possibly extinct ” and say there is no longer any hope of resurrecting the species using a captive breeding programme .
During the expedition in November and December 2006 , researchers in two boats scoured the river for the dolphin , using hydrophones to detect its underwater whistles .
Listen to the dolphin ’s whistle here .
They had planned to move any dolphins they found to a nearby lake to establish a breeding programme – a conservation strategy advocated since 1986 .

Edge of existence
Yangtze River dolphins ( Lipotes vexillifer ) have long been recognised as one of the world ’s rarest and most endangered mammals .
The Zoological Society of London , UK , has made it the top priority of its new EDGE of existence programme ( see Conservation bid targets world ’s 100 weirdest creatures ) .
However , last year ’s expedition “ became crushingly depressing as it proceeded ” , says Samuel Turvey of the ZSL .
The World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) is now considering a proposal to change the Baiji ’s status on its Red List of threatened species from simply “ critically endangered ” to “ critically endangered ( possibly extinct ) ” .
Randall Reeves of the IUCN told New Scientist he was in no doubt that the proposal would be accepted and the change would be made when the Red List was next updated on 12 September .
Originally only found in eastern China in the middle and lower Yangtze river and the neighbouring Qiantang river , the Baiji disappeared from the Qiantang in the 1950s .
In the late 1970s , Chinese scientists estimated there were 400 individuals left in the Yangtze and its side channels .
Two decades later they estimated that there could be as few as 13 .
The dolphin ’s decline was probably largely driven by fishing boats accidentally trapping Baiji in their gear .
At least half of all known Baiji deaths in the 1970s and 1980s were the result of such by - catch .
Last sighting
The last confirmed sighting of a Baiji was in 2002 , the same year that the sole surviving captive animal – a male called Qi Qi – died .
Since then , fishermen have reported seeing Yangtze river dolphins on three occasions , but Turvey says it is impossible to confirm the sightings .
He adds that he and his colleagues cannot rule out the possibility that a few remaining dolphins could have been in the side channels of the Yangtze while they were patrolling the river .
But he says all the side channels are too small to accommodate sustainable populations .
The researchers warn that a similar fate could await a subspecies of the finless porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides , which only lives in the Yangtze and is already extremely rare .
They say the extinction of the Baiji “ merely reflects the latest stage in the progressive ecological deterioration of the Yangtze region , home to approximately 10 % of the world ’s human population ” .
During their expedition they noted more than one large fishing boat for every 100 metres of river .
The world ’s most endangered cetacean is now the Gulf of California porpoise Phocoena sinus , or “ vaquita ” , of which a few hundred remain .
It is also threatened by accidental by - catch .

Daily
Kos released a poll this week showing that if the election were held this year , Democrat Ned Lamont would defeat Independent Joe Lieberman by a margin of 48 – 40 with 10 % for the Republican .
A friend in Connecticut ( who knows these things ) tells us that the independent Senator from Connecticut registered as a Democrat when he moved to his new hometown of Stamford .
He moved there this past summer from New Haven .
However , his wife , Hadassah , and his daughter , Hana , are now registered as unaffiliated so there are some independents in the family .
That ’s according to the voter registrar ’s records in Stamford anyway .
Let ’s hope his new best friends , Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter , do n’t find out Joe ’s dirty little secret .
UPDATE : Sprinkles has a post at Daily Kos pointing out that Joe was supposed to join another party , but did n’t :
Exclusive : Pizza Bomb Victim Was Part of the Plot Source : Brian Wells played a role in the bizarre plot .
July 11 , 2007  --
Federal prosecutors will announce today that pizza - delivery man Brian Wells was involved in the bomb - strapped bank robbery plot that took his life , a well - placed law enforcement source has told ABC News ' Law and Justice Unit .
After the robbery occurred in Pennsylvania in August 2003 , Wells was killed when the collar bomb he was wearing exploded while he was in police custody .
ABC News first reported Tuesday that charges were being brought against two Pennsylvania criminals in the bizarre case .
Marjorie Diehl - Armstrong was served with what is known as a federal retainer in prison in Pennsylvania Tuesday afternoon and charged with three felonies related to the case — bank robbery , conspiracy to commit bank robbery and felony use of a firearm in connection with a crime , her attorney told ABC News .
Diehl - Armstrong , who is imprisoned on an unrelated murder charge , says she is innocent , according to her lawyer , Lawrence D'Ambrosio .
Kenneth Barnes , a second longtime suspect , was served with the same federal retainer outlining the same charges Tuesday at a county jail in Erie , Pa. , a source close to the case said .
Barnes is serving an 11 - to 23 - month sentence on unrelated drug charges .
A source close to the case said that murder charges could be forthcoming .
Hours after ABC News first reported the charges , U.S. attorney Mary Beth Buchanan announced that a news conference would be held today in Erie , Pa .
She promised a " significant announcement " in the case .
It is expected she will announce the indictments of Armstrong and Barnes .
A law enforcement source involved in the case confirmed late Tuesday that Wells was , in fact , involved in the plot , but could not elaborate on his specific role .
' I Don't Have Enough Time '
It was August 2003 when Brian Wells walked into an Erie , Pa. , bank wearing a bomb attached to his neck by an elaborate , locked metal collar .
He was also carrying a gun disguised as a walking cane .
Cornered by police in a nearby parking lot after the robbery , Wells said that armed gunmen had locked the bomb around his neck and sent him into the bank .
Police seized a multiple - page note full of instructions that told Wells to move swiftly to a variety of seemingly unrelated spots around the area or the bomb would detonate .
" Why is nobody trying to come get this thing off me ? " he yelled to authorities as he sat handcuffed near a police car .
" I do n't have enough time . "
He did n't .
With a small crowd gathered that included curious media , the bomb exploded , blowing a hole through Wells ' chest and killing him instantly .
He was 46 years old .
The case has taken numerous twists and turns over the years , and investigators have acknowledged at times that they were simply stumped .
Authorities have taken their time to piece together the exceptionally unusual case .
One of the FBI 's top bomb experts , who served time in Iraq , was flown to Pennsylvania to testify before a grand jury , two sources told ABC News .
Through a combination of cooperation — Diehl - Armstrong 's attorney has acknowledged that Diehl - Armstrong cooperated with investigators — and gumshoe detective work , authorities are finally ready to spell out the scenario that led to one of the strangest crimes post - Sept.
11 America has yet seen .
Two witnesses , including a jailhouse informant who spoke to ABC News exclusively in February , say Wells knew two of the suspects in the case .
John Wells , Wells ' brother and the family 's spokesman , has repeatedly and sometimes angrily defended his late brother 's innocence in the plot and chided officials for not clearing Wells ' name .
Federal authorities , for their part , have never ruled Wells ' out of the plot , but have also never specifically implicated him .
It 's expected they will today .
Repeated calls to John Wells ' home were not answered .
Diehl - Armstrong , a high school class valedictorian with multiple graduate degrees who suffers from bipolar disorder , has long been a primary target of the investigation .
While law enforcement sources tell ABC News Diehl - Armstrong has cooperated with investigators , she is still believed to have been the plot 's ringleader .
Barnes is a known associate and fishing partner to Diehl - Armstrong .
Tim Lucas , a lawyer who represents a witness who testified before a grand jury in the pizza bomber case , told ABC News that " It appears the government theory is Diehl - Armstrong is the primary leader … in the robbery that led to Wells ' death . "
It was unclear whether the indictments were expected to include charges related to Wells ' death or just the bank robbery .
Since late June 2007 , Mars has been having a series of regional dust storms , which have obscured most of the planet -- and the Mars rovers -- with dust .
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter image from June 22 , 2007 ( top ) shows the first in the series of storms .
The July 17 , 2007 image ( bottom ) shows a global " veil of dust " encircling the planet .
Updated2:05 p.m. ET .
A ragingdust storm on Mars has cut power to NASA 's twin rovers to dangerously lowlevels , threatening an end to the mission .
The roverswere slated to operate for only 3 months but have been on Mars more than 3years , so mission officials have had ample time to ponder theireventual silencing .
The stormpresents perhaps the rover team 's biggest challenge , NASA said in a statementtoday .
Scientists said the storm , which has been brewing for nearly a month , isblocking around 85 to 90 percent of all sunlight to the surface .
The rovers , Opportunity and Spirit , rely on sunlight to charge their solar panels , and oneor both rovers could be damaged permanently or evendisabled by the limited solar power , officials said .
SPACE.com reported the storm 's freshseverity earlier today .
Theforecast
Scientistsfear the storms might continue for several days or weeks .
If the sunlight isfurther slashed for an extended period , the rovers will not be able to generateenough power to keep warm and operate at all , even in a near - dormant state , thestatement said .
The rovers use electric heaters to keepvital core electronics from becoming too cold .
" We 'rerooting for our rovers to survive these storms , but they were never designedfor conditions this intense , " said Alan Stern , associate administrator ofNASA 's Science Mission Directorate .
SteveSquyres of Cornell University , who is the lead scientist of the MarsExploration Rover Project , said the direct sunlight to the rovers is at anall - time low .
" Togive you a sense of the ' thickness 'of the dust , the brightness of the sun as viewed from the surface is nowdown to less than 1 percent of what it would be with a perfectly transparentatmosphere , " Squyres said .
" Of course , Mars never has a perfectlytransparent atmosphere , but the sun is still very faint . "
The rovers ' scientific operations were stopped Wednesday .
" Thisis , I think , one of the most significant challenges we 've faced over thisentire mission , " Squyres told SPACE.com today .
" The nature ofthe risk is well understood , but the magnitude of the risk is not .
We simply do n't know what 's going to happen next . "
Martian weatheris unpredictable , in part because there are few monitoring instruments and no formal weather forecasting agency as on Earth .
" Whateverwe do , though , the problem is not going to get much better rapidly , " Squyres said .
" I think that we have a good chance .
If Mars really wants tokill these vehicles it can , but we have a lot of things working in ourfavor . "
The coldfacts
If therovers expend too much energy , they may be unable to warm their electronics andprevent circuit - snapping temperatures .
Before thedust storms began blocking sunlight last month , Opportunity 's solar panels hadbeen producing about 700 watt hours of electricity per day , enough to light a 100 - watt bulb for seven hours .
When dust reduced the panels ' daily output toless than 400 watt hours , the rover team suspended driving and mostobservations , including use of the robotic arm , cameras and other site - inspectioninstruments .
On Tuesday , July 17 , the output from Opportunity 's solar panels dropped to 148 watt hours , the lowest point for either rover .
On Wednesday , the output dropped even lower , to 128 watt hours .
MarkLemmon , a planetary scientist at Texas A&M University and member of therover team , said Opportunity is consuming 130 watt hours per martian day in its " sleep mode . "
If the negative balance continues without a break , Lemmon explained , the rover may malfunction in a matter of weeks .
" Evenwith a 10 - 20 watt hour gap , we'd have a healthy rover for over a week , " Lemmon said in a telephone interview .
" We 've never been in situation wherewe 've been in any imminent danger of a battery depleting , but it ' spossible . "
NASAengineers are working to protect the rovers , especially Opportunity , which isexperiencing the brunt of thedust storm .
The rovers are showing robust survival characteristics .
Spirit , in a location where the storm is currently less severe , has been instructed toconserve battery power by limiting its activities .
" Weare taking more aggressive action with both rovers than we needed before , " said John Callas , project manager for the twin rovers at NASA ?s Jet PropulsionLaboratory .
Hangingon
By Opportunity 's 1,236th Martian day , which ended Tuesday , driving and all scienceobservations had already been suspended .
The rover still used more energy thanits solar panels could generate on that day , drawing down its battery .
" Theonly thing left to cut were some of the communication sessions , " Callassaid .
To minimizefurther the amount of energy Opportunity is using , mission controllers sentcommands on Wednesday , July 18 , instructing the rover to refrain fromcommunicating with Earth on Thursday and Friday .
This is the first time eitherof the rovers has been told to skip communications for a day or more in orderto conserve energy .
Since theonset of the storms , engineers have said a similar storm could beweathered by NASA 's next Mars mission , a robotic lander .
Human missions toMars , a plan for the distant future , would be challengedgreatly by storms like this , officials say .
Even ifeither of the rovers do malfunction , Lemmon explained all would not be lost .
" Thisis a really good scientific opportunity to understand how dust storms on Marswork , how they dissipate and how the dust moves around inside them , " hesaid .
" I think we 'll be able to use the information we 're getting now tolook ahead to future mission to Mars . "

The Wildest Weather in the Galaxy
SPACE.com 'sRobert Roy Britt contributed to this story .
Although I have written previously about the hypocrisy of both American Christian soldiers and Christian warmongers , there is another group of Christians that are hypocrites as well : Christian militarists .
As I have pointed out again and again , there is an unholy alliance between conservative , evangelical , and fundamentalist Christians and the military .
Although some of these Christian militarists may oppose the Iraq War , the stationing of U.S. troops around the globe , and U.S. foreign policy in general , they wholeheartedly support the U.S. military as the defender of our freedoms .
They see no problem with Christians joining the military and then going off to fight some foreign war that has nothing to do with defending the United States because soldiers should “ obey the powers that be ” and submit to their commander in chief .
In this respect they are hypocrites .
One very recent event reminds us of another respect in which Christian militarists are hypocrites : the death of Kurt Waldheim on June 14 .
Born in Vienna in 1918 , Waldheim became an Austrian diplomat after World War II .
He served as Secretary - General of the United Nations from 1972 to 1981 and as president of Austria from 1986 to 1992 .
The problem with Waldheim is that , not only was he a member of the German Wehrmacht during World War II , but that he was allegedly complicit in Nazi war crimes .
Although it was never officially established that Waldheim had actually committed any atrocities during the war , he was the only head of a “ friendly ” country to be barred from the United States .
In an interview before being elected president of Austria , Waldheim said about his wartime service : “ What I did during the war was nothing more than what hundreds of thousands of other Austrians did , namely fulfilled my duty as a soldier . ”
Kurt Waldheim ought to be a role model for Christian militarists .
He served his commander in chief .
He obeyed the orders of his superiors .
Like President Bush , the Christian militarist believes that ( outside of the ministry , I suppose ) there is no higher calling than military service .
But what about soldiers in other countries ?
Does n’t the dictum apply to them as well ?
What the Christian militarist really believes is that there is nothing greater than being in the United States military .
How dare “ enemies ” of the United States join their country ’s military and fight against the United States !
And if they are drafted into the military to fight an obviously unjust war ( since it is against the United States ) , they should desert or surrender rather than wage war against the United States .
How dare they try to kill American soldiers !
If members of the U.S. Armed Forces should obey orders then why not the soldiers in other countries ?
Are n’t they justified in bombing , maiming , and killing for their country if their government orders them to do it ?
And why should we get upset if they kill civilians ?
It is inevitable that there will be collateral damage in any conflict .
And after all , an order is an order .
There would be chaos in the ranks if soldiers stopped to question their orders .
If Christian militarists were honest they would admit that they do n’t think that foreign soldiers should “ obey the powers that be . ”
They should not obey orders if it means killing Americans .
They should refuse to obey their superiors and suffer the consequences .
American soldiers should obey orders because the U.S. military defends our freedoms and protects the free nations of the world from communists and Muslims .
And after all , we were attacked on September 11th and our president is a Christian .
The bottom line is this :
If foreigners should question serving in their military and obeying orders then why not Americans ?
Especially since the U.S. military is the greatest force for evil in the world today .
Since that is something I have written about many times over the past few years , I wo n’t revisit that subject here .
But I will say this : Christians should end their illicit love affair with the U.S. military , and they should do it now , before the government enlists their support for next foreign military intervention .
All Christian warmongers are Christian militarists , but not all Christian militarists are Christian warmongers .
Thank God that some Christian militarists recognize the Iraq War for what it is : an immoral , unjust , unnecessary , unscriptural war of aggression .
But when it comes to the subject of the military as the coercive arm of the warfare state , they fail to think consistently .
Indeed , many of them turn into full - fledged apologists for the state if you dare criticize the military in any way .
Some Christian militarists are veterans who refuse to admit that they fought for a lie , some are nationalists who adhere to the notion of “ my country , right or wrong , ” some are super - patriots who blindly follow the U.S. government , some are idealists who refuse to see the U.S. military for what it really is , and some sincerely believe that the troops defend our freedoms , but all of them are hypocrites when it comes to people joining the military and obeying orders .

Day One
Day Two
12:37 pm - The new DCT is installed , but they 're gonna try everything without the CableCARD and see how it handles clear QAM ( basically unencrypted digital cable ) .
1 pm – Craig Cincotta and Joe Chauvin from Microsoft and Janet Argentin from Waggner Edstrom show up .
Craig hauls up a HUGE Dell box containing an XPS 410 .
It 's tower - style , which is n't ideal -- we 'd prefer something a little more home theater - style , but we 'll live .
The CableCARD tuners are external -- it 's the ATI TV Wonder Digital Cable Tuner you 've probably seen pics of -- but what really cracks Ryan and me up is when we spot the XPS 410's internal 3.5 - inch floppy drive .
Old school !
1:05 pm - Two Time Warner Cable technicians , one of them a foreman , show up .
They 're serious about this !
1:09 pm - It 's sorta weird having this many people setting something up in my tiny apartment .
Joe is setting up the PC , Craig is setting up an LCD monitor they brought along ( making it the 7th external LCD in fewer than 600 sq. ft ) , a Time Warner Cable guy is testing the coax coming into the apartment .
1:14 pm – First problem arises !
There 's no integrated WiFi in the XPS 410 , so we 'll have to run Ethernet across the room .
No biggie .
1:24 pm - A third TWC cable guy just showed up !
Not sure what he 's come over to do , but from the questions he 's asking it seems mainly like he heard there was a Vista CableCARD install going on and decided to swing by .
1:30 pm -
The main TWC tech just checked the cable signal coming into the apt and is n't happy with it .
1:32 pm -
He 's poking around in the junction box now .
1:34 pm - Problem no .
2 ! The XPS 410 is n't recognizing the external tuner ( which connects over USB ) .
1:38 pm - Craig and Joe figured out the PC was set to some proxy settings for the Microsoft campus in Redmond .
Not something the average user would have to deal with .
1:40 pm - Does n't look like the PC -- which MSFT got about 7 weeks ago -- has the latest drivers installed .
1:43 pm - Turns out the drivers are on the PC , now they 're power - cycling the DCT ( Digital Cable Tuner ) to see if that solves the problem .
1:44 pm – Rebooting the XPS 410 , hopefully that 'll work , but either way they 're gonna swap the DCT out for another one .
They think maybe it got damaged in shipping ( something inside it is rattling around when we shake it ) .
1:46 pm - Almost done rebooting !
1:47 pm - Great success !
The tuner is recognized !
1:48 pm - Downloading some info from the internet , then scanning for the digital cable signal .
Vista says this should take up to five minutes .
1:50 pm - Still scanning .1:51 pm -
It worked .
Just running through some basic stuff like setting up the EPG , picking my cable provider , etc.1:52 pm - Downloading the EPG right now .
1:54 pm - Just finished downloading the EPG.1:55 pm - Live TV ! 1:56 pm - TWC guy just schooled us – the PC is actually showing us the unencrypted analog cable feed , we still have to set up all the CableCARD stuff .
Looks like this is gonna take a little longer than expected .
1:59 pm - TWC guy is calling into HQ .
Not sure why he 's calling , hopefully not for backup .
2:02 pm -
He 's calling in with the Host ID , which is the serial number for the DCT so he can pair it with the CableCARDs .
2:06 pm - Digital feed is n't happening quite yet , they 're running some diagnostics on the tuner .
2:10 pm - Running through setup again to see if it 's picking up the digital feed .
That means re-downloading the EPG , etc.2:15 pm -
It 's working !
Full high - def and everything .
2:16 pm – Ouch , there are some serious problems with the picture .
There 's this stuttering on all HD channels , it 's like the signal keeps breaking up .
2:18 pm -
The TWC techs are trying to figure out what 's wrong , they think that the cable signal going to DCT might be too weak .
2:20 pm -
They 're comparing it with the signal going into my current Scientific Atlanta HD - DVR .
I 've got no love for that box , but at least there 's no problem with viewing HD channels .
2:24 pm -
They 're not sure if the stuttering is a tuner issue or a video playback issue with the XPS 410.2:31 pm - TWC guys is doing something with the coaxial jack and fiddling with my old HD - DVR .2:34 pm - Still getting the stuttering .
2:42 pm - Ok , Plan B. Craig and Joe want to set up my Xbox 360 as a Media Center Extender , which will hopefully let us isolate whether it really is a problem with the DCT or a video playback issue with the XPS 410.2:45 pm - Well , the good news : setting up the Xbox 360 as a Media Center Extender was a snap .
The bad news : still getting that same stuttering , which means there 's either a problem with the DCT and / or the signal coming into the building .
2:53 pm - Two of the TWC techs are up on the roof checking the signal coming into the building .
2:59 pm -
They ran some new cable from the roof directly into my apartment through my window .
3:00 pm - Just hit the two hour mark !
Not sure when this 'll be sorted but I 've cancelled all my appointments for the rest of the day .
3:07 pm -
They 're still not sure what the problem is .
The third tech is on the phone with HQ .
They want to do another CableCARD diagnostic .
3:14 pm - They 've decided to try another CableCARD.3:21 pm –
They 're updating the firmware on the new CableCARD.3:28 pm - Still waiting !3:31 pm - New CableCARD firmware just finished updating .
3:33 pm - Picture is back up .
Let 's see how good it is !
3:34 pm - Still stuttering !
WTF ?!3:45 pm - It looks like it 's not going to happen today .
They 're not sure if it's an issue with the video card , the DCT , or the signal coming into the building .
They 're going to get a 3rd DCT and try and again later .
3:58 pm - They 're packing stuff up , gonna try again another day .
Three hours and no functioning Media Center PC ! 12:33 pm – The Microsofties are back !
My apartment seemed strangely empty without them .
12:35 pm - They had the Mothership ( AKA Redmond ) run some diagnostic stuff last night , they 're still not sure what exactly is causing the problem , but they 've brought over a fresh DCT and are going to try again .
Fingers crossed !
12:47 pm - Still running through the initial setup .
12:59 pm -
Set up , now they 're looking for an HD channel to test out .
1:03 pm - No glitches with an HD channel in clear QAM .
That means it's not the cable signal coming into the apartment or a problem with the PC itself .
1:10 pm - Ok , gonna try it with CableCARD now .
1:15 pm -
On the phone with TWC again .
1:20 pm - Still trying to get the CableCARD paired with the DCT .
The TWC tech support person on the other end of the line does n't seem to understand what it is we want , Joe has to repeat himself several times .
1:27 pm - TWC says they 'll have to " call us back . "
Usually that means " We 're never calling you back .
" 1:40 pm - No call back from TWC yet , trying other ways to get that CableCARD set up .
1:45 pm - Still waiting !
1:52 pm - The Microsofties have to take off for the airport , so they 're packing up to go .
1:54 pm - Joe 's Blackjack rings .
It 's TWC , could this actually be happening ?
2:03 pm - We 'll see , still on the phone trying to get the CableCARD set up .
2:05 pm - Ok , got a signal !
Better than yesterday , but still some issues stuttering .
Team Microsoft is heading out , but as they were leaving three TWC techs showed up to re-do all the wiring coming into my building .
It 's funny how when I call TWC it takes six days to get anyone to show up , but when Microsoft wants something they send six people out immediately .
It 's as if Microsoft is some kind of powerful entity capable of getting other people to do what it wants !
4:35 pm – After about two - and - a - half hours the TWC techs finally finish whatever it was they were doing on the roof .
I reboot the XPS 410 and hope for the best .
4:39 pm – Still stuttering !
I better go and do some work or something .
Epilogue : It 's several days later .
The damn thing still is n't working , and no one at Microsoft or Time Warner Cable knows why .
I feel really sorry for anyone trying to set this up on their own -- and really jealous that Ryan 's install went so smoothly .
My original plan had been to buy a CableCARD - enabled Media Center PC after the loaner period for the XPS 410 expired , but after this whole experience I have this bad feeling that I 'm going to be stuck with my crappy Sci-Atlanta box for a little while longer .
Children tend and care for their Webkinz avatars much like adults coddle Sims . *

The latest toy craze in North America are stuffed animals called Webkinz that blend the comfort of teddy bears with the addictive challenges of online role - playing games .
Webkinz look like Beanie Babies , but come with a code to unlock a digital doppelgänger children play with in a Sims - like digital world .
The combination has proven as habit forming as the Tamagotchi phenomenon , but with a stuffed animal that sleeps in your child 's bed .
And it might be the ploy that saves the toy industry .
Sold only at specialty stores like Hallmark , more than 1 million Webkinz stuffed animals have been snapped up since their April 2005 debut , making the toy by Ganz a sensation .
In February , the Toy Industry Association named Webkinz the Specialty Toy of the Year for 2007 .
" Kids are on the internet at a younger and younger age , " said Ganz communications director Susan McVeigh .
" They are comfortable in an online environment , more so than their parents .
It just feels natural to them . "
Webkinz kick - started a trend in children 's gaming that ties virtual environments to real - world merchandise .
Online games for kids are n't new .
Sierra Online had tot - focused games in the early ' 90s , and Neopets proved a hot product six years ago with a similar concept .
But the unprecedented success of Webkinz is inspiring everyone from Barbie to Disney to get children invested in both the digital and the physical .
" This is now a very hot area , " said Jim Silver , editor - in - chief of Toy Wishes magazine .
" We will see more and more toys which have codes that interact with websites . "
The strategy is coming into play as physical toy sales decline .
Plush remains a $ 1.3 billion industry , according to the Toy Industry Association , but suffered a 4 percent decline in 2006 .
Indeed , the toy industry saw hardly any growth between 2005 and 2006 .
Video games , meanwhile , saw a 19 percent increase in sales during the same time , and are now a $ 12.5 billion industry .
Marketed to children ages 6 to 12 , Webkinz tries to marry plush with video game .
The attempt has brought new relevance to Ganz , a family - run gift company based in Canada .
High demand had the company dealing with supply shortages earlier this year , McVeigh said .
Ganz declined to give current sales figures – it stopped reporting Webkinz sales and online activity a year ago , when it had a million online accounts .
But Silver estimates Webkinz raked in $ 100 million last year .
Retired Webkinz now sell for hundreds of dollars on eBay , and numerous fan - created sites have launched around the Webkinz community .
Ganz has expanded its product line with a range of supporting merchandise , including Pokémon - esque trading cards that come with unlockable goodies to use online .
But McVeigh said Ganz , which also sells collectible decorations , is uninterested in selling code on its own .
Now other companies are aping the gimmick .
Russ Berrie U.S. Gift launched its own Shining Stars line of soft toys in April .
These plush toys come with an online avatar and the chance to name a star through the International Star Registry .
Andy Gatto , the company 's CEO , said a new Shining Stars account gets created every 22 seconds .
Disney also found success promoting real - world merchandise with virtual fun and games .
Disney 's Virtual Magic Kingdom is based on the company 's physical parks , but is filled with minigames instead of rides .
It now boasts 2.5 million users .
Like Webkinz , Disney 's virtual world is the bait :
The profit comes from real - world promotions and merchandising .
Tourists engage in quests in Disney 's real theme parks to earn digital exclusives online , and the parks sell some items , including a line of T - shirts , that come with online duplicates for avatars to use .
" We were interested in taking the concept of Disneyland or the Magic Kingdom and extending it online so this kids audience could have contact with Disney theme parks every day , all day long , " said Paul Yanover , executive vice president and general manager of Disney Online .
When Expedition Everest opened at Animal Kingdom last year , for example , a month of events were launched at the Virtual Magic Kingdom , and several new virtual products tied to the ride were released .
Disney also has found success with Toontown , a world loosely based on a section of Disneyland .
Geared toward virtual gaming , Toontown has a " velvet rope " model : Users can visit some areas for free but need a paid subscription , at $ 10 a month , for unlimited access .
The site has attracted more than 17 million users since its 1998 launch , and a similar Pirates of the Caribbean game is in the works for next year .
Ultimately , each venture will succeed or fail on the quality of the website , according to Toy Wishes ' Silver .
But to some critics , child - oriented gaming sites bring concerns that sexual predators – like the sex offenders MySpace is trying to rid itself of – may sign into the Webkinz world .
Webkinz and Shining Stars fight creeps by limiting chat capabilities .
While chat is widespread in the Virtual Magic Kingdom , Disney keeps numerous administrators eavesdropping at all times .
These concerns seem unlikely to stop evolution in the marketplace .
Russ Berrie 's Gatto said the toy industry has always been at the mercy of trends , and has been very responsive to the change in children 's habits .
" This really represents a new play pattern , and it is a pattern in its infancy , " he said .
" Over the next few years , it is just going to get more prevalent in this business . "

0 9/28/07 " ICH " -- - - Hillary Clinton was either misinformed or economical with the truth in Wednesday night ’s debate when she responded to my challenge to her by saying the Senate ’s resolution earlier in the day on Iran was designed to permit economic sanctions against individual members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps .
She and her staff should know the United Nations Security Council on March 24 already slapped economic sanctions on individual Guard Members .
Like the Red Army in China , Iran allows Guard commanders to own and run private companies .
Security Council Resolution 1747 , which the United States voted for , froze financial assets held outside Iran on the seven military commanders , including General Mohammad Baqer Zolqadr and six other admirals and generals .
I know of no law dictating the State Department must first designate individuals or groups as terrorists  before sanctions can be imposed on them .
Dozens of countries have been under U.S. unilateral sanctions that are not designated as terrorist .
The U.S. first imposed sanctions on Iran in 1979 over the hostages , not terrorism .
The only possible purpose of the Senate resolution asking the State Department to designate the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organization is to set it up for military attack in George Bush ’s war on terror . 
As Virginia senator Jim Webb valiantly said in the Senate , the United States has never before designated the military services of a sovereign state a terrorist group .
Indeed , though there is international dispute over the definition of terrorism , there is little disagreement on the legal point that terrorists are non-state actors  who target civilians , i.e. , never members of a government .
Governments can be guilty of war crimes , but not terrorism .
And the resolution talks about attacks on American troops , not civilians .
The hypocrisy of Hillary and the 75 other senators who called for more unilateral sanctions on Iran , was exposed Monday by German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier who said , according to Spiegel Magazine , that American companies are violating existing U.S. sanctions by surreptitiously doing business with Iran through front companies in Dubai .
Joe Lieberman wrote the resolution authorizing the invasion of Iraq that was passed with Democratic support on October 11 , 2002 .
Lieberman ’s new resolution setting up a Bush - Cheney invasion of Iran passed by 76 to 22 with Democratic backing on September 26 , 2007 .
These are two dates that will live in infamy in the 21st century .
Led by Senator Clinton , it was another sad day for the Senate and for Senate Democrats , who were elected to the majority in November in order to end a war , not start a new one .
Mike Gravel is a former US Senator from Alaska and is currently running for the Democratic Nomination for President .
WASHINGTON , Jan. 23 - The White House was told in the hours before Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans that the city would probably soon be inundated with floodwater , forcing the long - term relocation of hundreds of thousands of people , documents to be released Tuesday by Senate investigators show .
A Homeland Security Department report submitted to the White House at 1:47 a.m. on Aug. 29 , hours before the storm hit , said , " Any storm rated Category 4 or greater will likely lead to severe flooding and / or levee breaching . "
The internal department documents , which were forwarded to the White House , contradict statements by President Bush and the homeland security secretary , Michael Chertoff , that no one expected the storm protection system in New Orleans to be breached .
" I do n't think anyone anticipated the breach of the levees , " Mr. Bush said in a television interview on Sept.
1 . " Now we 're having to deal with it , and will . "

Javascript provides closures with first - class access to variables declared in the enclosing environment .
Besides being a handy piece of trivia if you are ever playing Programming Jeopardy , what use is this to the actual working programmer ?
There are a lot of ways to take advantage of Javascript ’s closures , I am going to describe just one , replicating Algol ’s block structure ( or Lisp ’ sandmacros , if you prefer ) .
When we ’re all done you ’ll have a handy tool for making your code more readable , separating its concerns , and generally making life easier for programmers who have to read what you ’ve written .
A block is a chunk of code inside a function .
Blocks have well - defined entry and exit points .
Blocks have their own local variables and functions , and they also have first - class access to variables and functions defined around them .
Blocks may nest .
Structuring code into blocks makes large functions more readable and easier to refactor .
All of the variables and logic needed for one thing are encapsulated together in the blocks where they are needed , not scattered about in functions everywhere .
While the idiom may be slightly unfamiliar to some , I think you ’ll agree that it is highly accessible and not some sort of über - contruct of interest only to the self - professed hacker .
And when a programmer encounters it in your code , she will have no trouble figuring out what it does and how it does it .
I think everyone can agree that structured programming is a good thing .
Functions should be composed of blocks , with the blocks linked together by constructs such asstatements : Back before structured programming was introduced , there wereeverywhere .
Looking at a piece of code with labels , it was hard to know what the flow of control might be at run time .
In short , you never had the confidence that everything you needed to know about that code was right there next to that code .
Like almost all modern languages , Javascript ’s blocks do structure the flow of control so that you have nice clean entries and exits from each block .
And also like most other modern languages , Javascript does nothing to structure access to variables inside blocks .
For example : What will be shown ?
You ca n’t guarantee that zero will pop up , because the blocks might modify , like this :
This looks like a programmer error .
After all , thekeyword should be used to declare a new variable .
The code between the braces is n’t really a new block of code with its own variables .
This is hardly a problem with trivial examples .
But if you start building some larger functions , the possibility of accidentally overwriting some code looms larger .
Especially once you start refactoring and moving blocks of code around .
What can we do ?
How about this : the “ block ” idiom ( you can also call itorif you want to sound like a Schemer ) .
Here ’s the code : There ’s a lot of syntactic noise , what does it mean ?
In short , we said : “ Create a new function .
In the body of the new function define a variable calledand assign 42 to it .
Then call that function without any parameters . ”
Because our new instance ofis inside a function , it is not the same variable as theoutside of the function .
That can be handy .
Are there any other benefits of this idiom ?
Yes indeed .
Sometimes you have an assignment and you need some logic on the right hand side .
How do you write :
You can ’t , of course .
There are two problems with trying to use braces in this case .
First , Javascript only allows braces to form code blocks in conjunction with specific keywords likeand .
Second , Javascript code blocks are not expressions — they do not produce values .
This is why languages like Javascript need an if statement and a ternary operator : if blocks produced values , you would only need if expressions .
So in traditional Javascript style , you have to define a function somewhere else and call it …
You ’ll notice our block idiom includes defining and calling a function .
What if our function returns a value ?
In that case , we can use a block anywhere we want a value , for example :
This new idiom allows us to make first - class blocks anywhere we like .
Our blocks are expressions , and we can use them anywhere we need a value .
And as above , Our variables are fully encapsulated , they do not overwrite variables defined elsewhere .
You may be wondering , " Why ca n’t we use a named function ? "
This is the style in languages like Python , where the Benevolent Dictator does not permit constructions like this .
Here is the above code using a named function : I find this almost as good as the block .
Since you only use it in one place , it is defined where you use it .
That is good .
And the name might be helpful documentation , just like a one or two - word comment .
Balanced against this is the fact that you have added a new function to the outer scope .
Reading it later , you might have to scan the rest of the code to see if it is used elsewhere .
There 's also a very small advantage of the block over the named function : since you need two statements ( one to name a function , another to use it ) , you can only use a named function in normal code blocks .
You can not use a named function when you need an expression , unless you resign yourself to naming the function in one place and using it somewhere else .
For example , when constructing array or hash literals , you can use expressions .
A block is an expression , while two statements ( one to create a named function and one to call it ) are not an expression .
So a named function would need to be defined outside of an array or hash literal , while a block can be used inside it , placing the code closer to where it is used .
Structuring code into blocks makes large functions more readable and easier to refactor .
All of the variables and logic needed for one thing are encapsulated together in the blocks where they are needed , not scattered about in functions everywhere .
If you see a variable declared inside a block , you know it is only used inside the block .
If you see a variable with the same name outside the block — a regrettable occurrence — you know that moving or changing the block will not affect the code working with variables outside of the block .
You probably know that you can put a function inside of a function in Javascript :
And this is a good thing , it keeps the functioninside of .
Since that ’s the only place you need it , why declare it anywhere else ?
The fact that you can put a function inside of a function implies that you can put a function inside of a block as well :
If you only need the functionsandto do this one job , in this one place , why should they be defined at top level cluttering up your code ?
Why force other programmers to search through your code figuring out where they are used before making changes ?
Block structure may seemat first , but give blocks a try and see whether you start finding the code even easier to read and refactor with blocks .
Like me , you will find that structuring your code with blocks puts the things you use right where you use them .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu.org
NEW YORK - The American Civil Liberties Union appeared before a federal district court today to argue that the reauthorized Patriot Act's National Security Letter ( NSL ) provision is unconstitutional .
The law permits the FBI to gag those who receive NSLs from disclosing that the FBI has sought or obtained information from them .
" The excessive secrecy surrounding the FBI 's use of national security letters is an invitation to abuse , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU 's National Security Project , who argued before the court today .
" While secrecy may be necessary in rare cases , the FBI 's power to silence the recipients of national security letters should be subject to meaningful judicial oversight .
The FBI can not be given exclusive authority to determine which NSL recipients should be silenced and which should be permitted to speak . "
The case before the court today , Doe v. Gonzales , was originally filed in April 2004 on behalf of an anonymous Internet access company that had received an NSL .
Although the FBI has since dropped its NSL demand , the John Doe remains under a gag order .
In September 2004 , Judge Victor Marrero of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York struck down the Patriot Act NSL provision as unconstitutional , writing that " democracy abhors undue secrecy . "
The landmark ruling held that permanent gag orders imposed under the NSL law violated free speech rights protected by the First Amendment .
The government appealed the ruling , but Congress amended the NSL provision before the court issued a decision .
In May 2006 the appeals court asked the district court to consider the constitutionality of the amended law .
In a concurring opinion , Judge Richard Cardamone strongly criticized the government for continuing to argue that a permanent ban on speech would be permissible under the First Amendment .
The ACLU argued before Judge Marrero today that the gag provision in the amended NSL statute violates the First Amendment by giving the FBI the authority to suppress speech without prior judicial review .
The ACLU also argued that the provision is unconstitutional because the judicial review it allows is illusory : while the amended statute permits NSL recipients to challenge gag orders in court , the provision requires courts to defer to the FBI 's view that secrecy is necessary .
The ACLU said that the gag provision has had significant effects on the John Doe plaintiff .
John
Doe was prevented from participating in the contentious Patriot Act reauthorization debate that raged across the nation in late 2005 and early 2006 .
Even though Doe had firsthand knowledge of this sweeping FBI power , John Doe could not mention the fact that Doe had received an NSL , divulge the breadth of the letter , or discuss the ramifications on Doe 's business relationships .
" The executive branch cannot suppress speech without any real judicial check on its gag power , " said Melissa Goodman , an ACLU staff attorney on this case .
" Without oversight , there is nothing to stop the government from engaging in broad fishing expeditions , or targeting people for the wrong reasons , and then gagging Americans from ever speaking out against potential abuses of this intrusive surveillance power . "
According to documents released last month , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales lied to Congress in order to make a case for reauthorization of the Patriot Act in 2005 .
The Attorney General testified that he was unaware of any civil liberties abuses that had taken place with the use of NSLs .
But contrary to Gonzales ' testimony , internal FBI documents show he was briefed about the abuses .
While reports previously indicated a hundred - fold increase to 30,000 NSLs issued annually , an extraordinary March 2007 report from the Justice Department 's own Inspector General puts the actual number at over 143,000 NSLs issued between 2003 and 2005 .
The same investigation also found serious FBI abuses of the NSL power and numerous potential violations of the law .
In a similar case , the ACLU represented four librarians who are on the board of Library Connection , a library consortium in Connecticut .
The consortium was served with a NSL and challenged both the letter and the accompanying gag .
After many months of litigation in which a district court found the gag on Library Connection was unconstitutional , the government withdrew its demand for information and abandoned the gag order .
More information on Doe v. Gonzales and NSLs is online at :
www.aclu.org/nsl
Attorneys in the case are Jaffer , Goodman and Alexa Kolbi-Molinas of the ACLU , and Arthur Eisenberg of the New York Civil Liberties Union .
Federal Reserve policy actions in August 2007 : frequently asked questions ( updated )
Stephen Cecchetti
A revised and updated version of the 13 August column on the basic how's and why 's of what the Fed has been doing to calm financial markets .
Editors ’ note :
This column updates the 13 August 2007 column on the same topic and includes a slightly revised version of the content of the earlier column .
Let ’s start with the facts :
On Thursday 9 August 2007 the Federal Reserve ’s Open Market Trading Desk ( the “ Desk ” ) injected $ 24 billion into the U.S. banking system .
This was done in two equal size operations , one at 8:25 am and a second 70 minutes later at 9:35 am.1
On Friday 10 August 2007 , the Desk was in the market three times ( 8:25 am , 10:55 am , and 1:50 pm ) putting in a total of $ 38 billion dollars .
By early this week , things seemed to have returned to normal with injections of $ 2 billion on Monday and no action at all on Tuesday .
The Fed ’s operations came on the heels of two even larger injections by the European Central Bank ( ECB ) in Frankfurt .
On Thursday morning the ECB in Frankfurt Germany had put nearly € 95 billion ( $ 130 billion ) into European financial institutions , followed by a somewhat smaller operation of € 61 billion ( $ 83.6 billion ) on Friday .
Things continued to seem unsettled in Europe after the weekend , as the ECB added € 47.7 billion ( $ 65.3 billion ) on Monday ( 13 August ) , and then in two separate operations put € 25 billion ( $ 34.2 billion ) into the European banking system on Tuesday .

How is this actually done ?
What are the mechanics of the transactions ?
In all of these cases , the funds were put into the banking system using what are called “ repurchase agreements ” or “ repos ” for short .

A repurchase agreement is a short - term collateralized loan in which a security is exchanged for cash , with the agreement that the parties will reverse the transaction on a specific future date at an agreed upon price , as soon as the next day .
For example , a bank that has a U.S. Treasury bill might need cash , while a pension fund might have cash that it does n’t need overnight .
Through a repurchase agreement , the bank would give the T - bill to the pension fund in exchange for cash , agreeing to buy it back at the original price – repurchase it – with interest the next day .
In short , the bank gets an overnight loan and the pension fund gets some extra interest .
The details are shown in the figure below .
The easiest way to think about a repo is as an overnight mortgage .
In the same way that you pledge your house to the bank in exchange for a loan , a financial institution pledges a bond to the Fed in exchange for funds .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York ’s Open Market Desk engages in repurchase agreements every morning ( the exact time varies ) .
The quantities normally range from $ 2 billion to $ 20 billion dollars .
3
Most of them are overnight ; but it is standard to engage in repos that are as long as 14 days .
The $ 35 billion on Friday 10 August 2007 was the largest since those in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
The record is $ 81.25 billion on 14 September 2001 .
How does the Fed pay for the repo ?
Where does it get the money ?
There is an important difference between what happens when two private financial institutions would engage in a repo with each other and how it works when the Fed is involved .
When pension fund engages in a repo with a bank , the pension fund transfers cash to the bank .
Looking at the cash accounts of the two institutions , we see the level of one went down ( the pension fund ) and the other one ( the bank ) went up , for a total of zero .
When the Fed engages in a repo , it simply credits a bank ’s reserve account creating money ( albeit for a very short time ) .
Put another way , when the Fed wants to engage in a repo , or buy anything else for that matter , it can simply create liabilities to do it .
It ’s a bit like having a credit card with no limit where the bill never comes .
What happens if the bonds used in the repo fall in value overnight ?
When the Fed engages in a repo the bank ( or securities dealer ) on the other side – what is called the “ counterparty ” – agrees to repurchase the security at a fixed price regardless of what happens in the markets .
4
It is these banks who reap the gains or suffer the losses from prices moving up or down .
The only risk the Fed faces is that the counterparty in a repo goes bankrupt and ca n’t make good on the promise .
Given that these are very large banks , and that the repos are very short term , this is an incredibly unlikely event .
Does this have any impact on the government ’s budget deficit ?
No .
Central bank operations have nothing to do with fiscal policy – federal government tax , expenditure and debt management policies – they are all about the interest rate and the quantity of reserves in the banking system .
The Federal Reserve is the Federal Government 's banker – accepting and making payments , issuing debt when they want , etc. – but they are not connected in any material way .
( I 'm simplifying slightly here , as there is an esoteric connection that creates a quantitatively negligible impact . )
If the Fed has $ 35 billion to help the financial system , why ca n’t they use some of their money to help the poor ?
The Fed is n’t spending the money on bailing out banks , hedge funds , or helping rich people .
It is making fully - collateralized loans that will be repaid the next day ( or week ) .
So , while it ’s putting the funds in today , it ’s taking them out almost immediately .
If , instead , the Fed were to take $ 35 billion in $ 20 dollar bills and go hand them out to the needy , this would be a permanent increase in the quantity of money in circulation .
More money in the long run means higher prices – and that ’s inflation .
What is liquidity and why is it so important ?
The publicly stated rationale for these large interventions is that liquidity dried up .
Unfortunately , liquidity is one of those terms that means different things to different people .
In the glossary to my Money and Banking textbook , I define liquidity as “ the ease with which an asset can be turned into a means of payment such as money . ”
That is , when an asset is liquid it is easy to sell large quantities with out moving market prices .
When something is illiquid , it is hard to sell .
People do n’t want to buy things that they can’t easily sell .
If they are worried that a bond they are considering buying may be difficult or expensive to sell they will lower the price they are willing to pay , assuming anyone are still willing to buy it at all .
For financial markets to function well , it must be cheap and easy to both buy and sell securities .
When market liquidity dries up , the financial markets stop functioning .
This form of liquidity might be better labeled “ market liquidity ” as distinct from what I would call “ lending liquidity . ”
Lending liquidity is the term I attach to the concept that was in the news until recently .
You may recall reading or hearing about “ enormous amounts of liquidity sloshing around the system . ”
When people said this what they meant ( I think ) is that loan supply is plentiful so it is easy to borrow at favorable rates .
Put differently ( and using some technical jargon ) it meant risk spreads were low and insensitive to a borrower ’s balance sheet position .
That is , the risk premium a borrower paid was small and did not increase with additional borrowing , which should be riskier .
Fall 1998 was the last time market liquidity dried up to a greater extent than we observe today .
Then it was difficult to even trade U.S. Treasury securities – usually the most liquid financial market there is .5
So far , things are no where near that bad .
In fact , with few exceptions markets still seem to be operating normally .
$ 35 billion seems like quite a bit of money .
Is it ?
To put the number into perspective we have to understand what these funds are used for .
When the Fed injects “ money ” into the financial system what it does is create balances in something called “ reserve accounts ” .
That ’s where the money goes .
Commercial banks have deposit accounts at the Fed ( you and I ca n’t have one ) .
Those are the bank ’s checking accounts , with the exception that they do n’t pay interest .
Because there is no interest paid on reserve balances , banks try to economize on the quantities .
Banks hold reserves at the Fed for three primary reasons : ( 1 ) They are required to hold them .
( 2 ) They need it to do business , so that meet customer demands for withdrawals and they can make payments to other banks .
And ( 3 ) , it is prudent to do so ; reserves act as the bank ’s emergency fund – they are always ready just in case disaster strikes .
So , is $ 35 billion a big number or not ?
Here are three numbers we could use to get some sense :
(1) Total reserves in the U.S. banking system for the two weeks ending 1 August 2007 averaged $ 45 billion , of which roughly $ 12 billion was held as deposits in reserve accounts at the Federal Reserve .
The remainder is held in cash in banks ’ vaults – that counts , too .
(2) Excess reserves , those above what the Fed requires banks to hold , usually total less than $ 2 billion .
(3) On an average day , the gross quantity of interbank transfers is $ 4 trillion ( that ’s with a “ t ” ) .
This includes $ 1.6 trillion in funds that are transferred for the purpose of settling purchases and sales of various bonds ( primarily U.S. Treasury securities ) .
6
Looking at these numbers , first we see that the Fed ’s action on Friday increased banking system reserves by more than 75 percent .
More importantly , the addition of $ 35 billion increased the size of reserve accounts by a factor of 4 .
Second , the increase was more than 10 times the normal level of excess reserves ( although for complex reasons it is hard to know today exactly how much it will add to average excess reserves ) .
Finally , note the rather amazing fact that during normal times the banking system uses $ 12 billion to engage in $ 4 trillion in daily transactions .
That is , on average a dollar in a reserve account is used more than 300 times PER DAY .
Because reserves do not pay interest , banks have a big incentive to economize on their use – this is pretty efficient .
( This is also the reason that excess reserves are so low . )
That banks do this every day suggests that they know how to do it ; but the fact that they use the funds so many times means that if anyone starts hoarding reserves , there is the potential to disrupt the system .
The conclusion is that the $ 35 billion is a very big number – it is three times the normal level of reserves that banks hold .
Why did the banks need it ?
Why did the banks need this money ?
It is easy to explain why the Fed used open market operations to add $ 81.25 billion on 14 September 2001 in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
People ’s inability to reach their offices in downtown New York had closed some very large banks .
Though those banks could still receive payments from other banks , they could n’t make any payments to anyone else .
Funds were flowing into a few huge reserve accounts , but nothing was coming out .
A few large banks were sucking up the lifeblood of the financial system .
Last week the trigger seems to have been the continued fall in the value of certain mortgage - backed securities .
Mortgage ‑backed securities bundle a large number of mortgages together into a pool in which shares are then sold .
The owners of these securities receive a share of the payments made by the homeowners who borrowed the funds .
The pools create a form of insurance .
In the same way that automobile insurance companies know what fraction of the insured will have collisions ( but not exactly which individuals ) , pools of mortgages mean investors can predict the quantity of defaults and the repayment rates .
There are numerous types of mortgage - backed securities , but the ones that have run into difficulty are in what is called the “ subprime ” segment of the market .
Subprime borrowers are basically people with poor credit who cannot qualify for a standard mortgage .
Making loans to these people is known to be risky .
And when things are risky , sometimes they do n’t work out .
That ’s what happened .
But up to now , the problems in the subprime mortgage market are relatively small .
Currently , losses are estimated to be at most $ 35 billion – equivalent to a stock market decline of about 0.2 percent .
( Last week the value of stocks traded in U.S. markets were down a not terribly unusual1.5 percent , or 7 times the total expected decline in the value of these mortgages ) .
What ’s happened is that problems in this one relatively small part of the financial system been seeping into the rest of the market .
When people see that they have underestimated the risks in one place , they start to question their ability to accurately evaluate risks everywhere else .
Then two things happen .
First , the prices of risky financial assets fall .
Risk requires compensation , and the more risk there is the more compensation .
Second , people flee risky stuff that they find hard to evaluate and put their money in safe assets – what ’s called a “ flight to quality . ”
The flight to quality is reflected in a increase in prices of U.S. Treasury securities and an influx of funds into the banking system .
So , the first reasons the banks need the reserves is to serve the customers that have brought money into their deposit accounts .
But individuals are not the only ones who have reduced their tolerance for risk .
Bankers have , too .
Bankers ’ reduced risk tolerance shows up in two important ways , both of which result in higher demand for reserve balances .
The first is that they simply want a bigger cushion against the possibility of losses .
That ’s pretty simple .
The second reason bankers need more reserves is that they became less willing to lend their reserves to other banks .
There is a huge daily interbank market for overnight loans .
It ’s called the “ federal funds market ” and the interest rate charged on those overnight loans is the “ federal funds rate . ”
The federal funds rate is the rate targeted by the Federal Reserve .7
On a normal day ( which Thursday and Friday of last week were not ) banks are willing to make loans early in the day even if it means temporarily overdrawing their accounts .
( Yes , they are allowed to do that . )
Banks that are overdrawn in the morning figure that if they do n’t receive payments to bring their reserve accounts back into positive territory by the end of the day , they can always go out and borrow it back .
Well , it appears that last week banks were not willing to behave this way and the result was that it was very difficult to borrow late in the day .
The bottom line of this very long - winded explanation is that the banks wanted to hold substantially higher level of reserves .
Keeping the federal funds rate at its target level of 5 ¼ percent – that ’s what the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is supposed to do every day – meant engaging in huge operations .
I ’ve heard that the Fed ’s operation had something to do with mortgages .
Did it ?
Yes it did .
On Friday 10 August the Fed accepted mortgage - backed securities as collateral for the entirety of the $ 35 billion in repos it engaged in that day .
Importantly , though , they did not accept just any mortgage - backed securities .
They only allowed dealers to pledge mortgage - backed securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies .
Two comments are important here .
First , this is not new .
The willingness to accept mortgage - backed securities as collateral in repo goes back to changes made in advance of Y2 K .
At the time there were concerns about being able to get funds into the financial system quickly , and this is one of the changes made to ensure the Desk could do that .
Since then , the Fed has taken mortgage - backed securities as collateral in repo at nearly the same rate they have taken agency securities .
Nevertheless , the way in which the Fed chose to do this on Friday 10 August is notable .
Normally , when the Fed sends out a message they tell dealers exactly what they want in collateral .
Each of the three categories is treated separately .
So , it is common for the Desk to send out a message that they are willing to accept only Treasury securities .
Alternatively they might send out a message that they will accept all three types – Treasury , agency and mortgage - backed – in three separate operations .
What the Desk did on Friday is send out a message that said they would take whatever the dealers wanted to deliver .
Since mortgage - backed securities are the cheapest to deliver ( they have the lowest price in the market ) , that ’s what came in .
My speculation is that the Fed did this to demonstrate to the markets that they believe mortgage - backed securities are good as collateral .
They were trying get financial market participants to value mortgage pools sensibly .
Who decides to do this ?
A number of people are involved in deciding the quantity of a daily open market operation .
On a normal day there is n’t much to decide .
The Desk staff makes a recommendation in a conference call and the participants agree .
( Having listened in on these calls , I can attest to the fact that they are normally not very interesting . )
Last week was obviously not normal .
While I doubt that the entire Federal Open Market Committee decided on the action , they may have been consulted through a conference call .
My guess is that Chairman Bernanke and New York Fed President Geithner had a say .
What I can be sure of is that the decision was made by the Federal Reserve , not by the Secretary of the Treasury or the President of the United States .
Why did this happen when it did ?
It is natural to ask whether there is some specific reason for these events to occur when they did .
Can we identify a specific trigger ?
While we can see something that has happened , as I suggested earlier there has been no fundamental deterioration in economic conditions .
In fact , in the United States there was no economic data released on Thursday 9 August 2007 .
So , it is n’t that people suddenly changed their view of the future .
Instead , what happened was analogous to a bank run .
Bank runs can be the result of either real or imagined problems .
Here ’s what how it works .
Most people , even fairly sophisticated investors , are not in a position to assess the quality of the assets on a financial institution ’s balance sheet .
In fact , most people do n’t even know what those assets are .
So when we learn that one bank is in trouble , investors begin to worry about all financial institutions and investors start to flee .
The inability to accurately value assets leads to a strong shift toward high - quality securities like Treasury bonds .
Thinking about it this way , there are two events that may have precipitated this .
The first was the announcement on 2 August that the German bank , IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG , was in trouble because of investment in U.S. subprime loans .
And then , on Wednesday that one of Europe ’s largest banks , BNP Paribas had three funds with similar problems .
Financial market participants ’ response was to reduce their exposure to risky investments under the assumption that they could not properly assess the risks .
That ’s exactly analogous to a bank run .
It is impossible to predict the exact timing of something like that .
Does this have anything to do with discount lending ?
For those of you who have seen ( and heard ) Jim Cramer ’s diatribe on CNBC on Monday 3 August , 8 you may be wondering about discount lending .
Here ’s the deal .
The Fed has a standing offer to lend to banks ( so long as they have collateral to pledge for the loan ) at a rate that is 1 percentage point above the federal funds rate target of 5¼ percent .
So , today a bank can borrow from the Fed at 6 ¼ percent .
Banks , not the Fed , decide when to request a discount loan .
The borrowed funds are deposited into the bank ’s reserve account and can be loaned out to other banks .
While we do not know for sure , it seems unlikely that discount lending increased much last week .
The reason is that banks always have the option of borrowing from other banks at the federal funds rate , and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports that the highest rate charged for an overnight interbank loan late last week was 6 percent .
9
I seriously doubt that a bank would borrow from the Fed at 6 ¼ percent when they can borrow more cheaply from another bank .
I would guess that Cramer was really arguing for an interest rate cut .
It ’s hard to see why that ’s necessary at the moment .
If you ca n’t buy and sell the securities you own , you probably do n’t care if the cost of funds is 5 ¼ percent or 4 percent , or whatever .
The European Central Bank ’s operation was much larger than the Fed ’s .
Is there a reason ?
The details of the European Central Bank ’s ( ECB ) operating procedures are very different from those of the Fed , and I wo n’t go into the details here .
Nevertheless , I can provide the simplest explanation for the size the ECB ’s operation .
When the ECB announced its intention to provide funds on Thursday 9 August 2007 ( a day they would not normally operate at all ) they said that they would accept all bids at or above the their 4 percent target .
The result was that banks asked for and received € 95 billion ( $ 130 billion ) on Thursday , € 61 billion ( $ 83.6 billion ) on Friday , and € 47.7 billion ( $ 65.3 billion ) the following Monday .10
To explain this , we need to understand two things about how bank reserves work in Europe .
As it turns out , 9 August is the first day of a 35 day reserve maintenance period in the Eurosystem .
As I mentioned earlier , banks hold reserves because they are required .
The amount they need to hold depends ( in a complicated way ) on the size of deposits the bank held in the past .
Because there can be day - to - day fluctuations in accounts , the requirement is enforced as an average over a longer period , called the maintenance period .
In the United States , the maintenance period is 2 weeks .
In Europe it varies from 28 days to 35 days .
That ’s the first thing .
The second point is that in Europe banks receive interest on the reserves that they are holding .
The interest rate paid on required reserves is equal to the average of the overnight lending rate over the maintenance period – a rate that is almost always slightly above the ECB ’s target rate .
( This is very different from what goes on in the United States where no interest is paid . )
Okay , so now imagine that you are a bank and you hear the ECB announce that they will lend you as much as you want at the 4 percent target .
Maybe you know something about what ’s going on , maybe you do n’t .
In either case , when the ECB says that they are going to give you as much as you want on a day when they normally do nothing , you have to wonder what they know that you do n’t .
You also know that since the reserve requirement is an average over the next 35 days , if you hold a high level of reserves today , you can always make up for it with a very low level before the end of the maintenance period .
And , again unlike in the U.S. if you are stuck with excess reserves holdings , in you can redeposit it at the ECB at a 3 percent interest rate .
All of this makes it much cheaper for European banks to take the reserves from the ECB and helps explain why they took so much .

Ex -Iraq General : Bush ' misunderstanding '
Vietnam history RAW STORY
Published : Thursday August 23 , 2007
Print This Email This MSNBC's Alison Stewart interviews retired Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton , senior adviser to VoteVets , who was in charge of training the Iraqi military in 2003 and 2004 .
Alison asks Gen. Eaton his take on the accuracy of President Bush 's recent statement , during his Wednesday speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars , that retreating from Iraq would cause the same kind of " violent reaction " that came from the United States ' pullout from Vietnam .
" It 's a very unfortunate trip back into history , " says Eaton .
" It reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what the Vietnam war was about .
Our enemy there was the North Vietnamese Army and their proxy forces , the Viet Cong .
The issue in Iraq is a religious - based civil war with al - Qaeda thrown in there to complicate the affair . "
Eaton calls Bush 's analogy " unfortunate , " citing " untidy parallels " between the behaviors of senior civilian leadership in Vietnam and Iraq .
There is a failure on the part of the Bush Administration to devote diplomatic resources , in addition to fighting troops , to help the current situation .
On statements from Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri about the United States ' pullout from Vietnam as a sign of weakness , Stewart asks if this is reason enough to " hold firm , " to not give al - Qaeda " fuel for recruitment . "
Eaton reiterates the need for a " diplomatic surge " to , as he puts it , " put this thing in a regional context and to unweight the American soldier . "
" We can't conduct a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq .
This has got to be a very gradual affair : Drawing down forces , taking them out of the direct line of fire , yet retaining forces to fight al - Qaeda , retaining forces to support the Iraqi security forces -- but all the while getting regional actors involved so that we can solve this problem , which everybody recognizes is not a purely military dilemma . "
When asked of his personal feelings on Bush 's invocation of Vietnam in his recent speech , Eaton responds : " My father 's name is engraved on the Vietnam War Memorial -- killed in action after missing in action for 38 years .
I thought it was a bad idea to start going down this link to Vietnam during this speech .
It did not serve the country well , it does not serve the American fighting man and woman in Iraq well , and it certainly does n't serve veterans well . "
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast on August 22 .
1 ) Encourage people not to give money to him for the rest of the quarter
2 ) Ask him to come on Blue America and explain his vote
3 ) Remove him from Blue America completely
I have no idea how much time U.S.
House members have wasted on this bill , but I do know that our troops are still stuck in a quagmire in Iraq .
I know that the healthcare system still leaves millions of Americans uninsured and the front page of my local newspaper featured one more story about a local business closing its doors .
The polling numbers of both the president ( 27 % ) and the United States Congress ( 11 % ) reflect how hungry America is for new leadership . "
One day after voting against extending the same kind of taxpayer - funded health care he himself enjoy to more than four million eligible American children who have no insurance at all , Mike McCaul has found a cause he can support -- condemning the free expression of opinion by a group of citizens during an important national debate .
The testimony to Congress by Gen. David Petraeus about the civil war in Iraq and what the U.S. should do about it was notable for at least two reasons :
* The aimlessness of the White House 's policy
* The absence of one of that policy 's chief cheerleaders , Mike McCaul
That is , until now .
Mr. McCaul has finally roused himself long enough to participate in a shallow charade that does nothing to make us safer , bring our troops home , or make up for rubberstamping the Bush - Cheney administration 's misadventure in Iraq .
I served as a civilian in Iraq .
I watched all kinds of men and women from all walks of life work their hearts out to try to fix this disaster .
And while Mr. McCaul engaged in this pointless theatre , some of those people may have died .
Shame on him .
They did n't condemn Vice President Cheney when he falsely connected Al Qaeda to Saddam Hussein .
They did n't condemn Colin Powell when he lied about WMD to the United Nations .
They did n't condemn President Bush when he started eavesdropping on American citizens without a warrant .
They did n't condemn President Bush and the Republicans when they attacked Sen.
John Kerry 's war record .
They did n't condemn Sen .
Saxby Chambliss when he ran ads comparing triple - amputee and war hero Max Cleland to Osama bin Laden .
They still have n't done enough to slow this dreadful war or protect our troops .
It was very disheartening for House Democrats to play along with or get manipulated into supporting Republican change - the - subject strategies and instead of doing their jobs , vote to condemn a newspaper ad .
Only 79 Democrats seemed to understand what free speech means .
As I said earlier , Blue America has endorsed 8 incumbents and four stood up for free speech today -- Congressmembers Hilda Solis ( D - CA ) , Tom Allen ( D - ME ) , Steve Cohen ( D - TN ) , and Jerry Nadler ( D - NY ) -- and four , in tougher , more Republican - leaning districts , took the bait and voted to condemn the ad : Carol Shea - Porter ( NH ) , John Hall ( NY ) , Jerry McNerney ( CA ) and Patrick Murphy ( PA ) .
Earlier I urged our members to stop donating -- at least for the rest of this quarter -- to the candidates who voted with the Republicans today .
( I also asked everyone to thank Hilda Solis , Jerry Nadler , Steve Cohen , and Tom Allen by making a donation to their campaigns -- even if it 's just a token one dollar each . )
But perhaps we need to go further .
Blue America commissioned a poll to gage what the readers of Crooks & Liars , Firedoglake , Digby andthink .
The survey asks if you agree or disagree with the candidates who voted against censuring MoveOn and then asks what you think we should do about the 4 who voted in favor of censure .
There are 3 choices : Jane , John , Digby and I would like to get some guidance from our readers how strongly you feel about this and how strongly you want us to react .
Please hit this link and take the survey A little while ago I spoke with John Laesch ( D - IL ) , another Blue America - endorsed candidate .
Like Martin Heinrich and Tom Allen he was n't happy to see so many of his fellow Democrats fall into this trap .
He told me he is " appalled that the House wasted one minute of their time condemning a newspaper advertisement .
It 's time to move on from the MoveOn ad .
This is yet one more example of how President Bush continues to control the agenda in Washington . "
John has been fighting against Bush occupation of Iraq for several years -- and , as a vet of that conflict , he 's not kidding around .
He means business and I could just see him shaking his head in disgust on the other end of the phone .
John had called to tell me that the Northwestern Illinois Building and Trades Council had unanimously endorsed his candidacy .
But that got lost in all the hubbub about Democrats voting like Republicans . " MoreDemocrats " is a motto we need to be thinking about .
Dan Grant , a Democrat running against Mike McCaul , a rubber stamp Republican in central Texas , sent me a note about McCaul 's McCarthy - like vote against MoveOn .
I want to share it withreaders :
That 's how Democrats should be answering Republican calumny against citizens exercising their right to free speech in challenging a catastrophic and failed policy that Congress has enabled Bush to carry out -- and still enables Bush to carry out .
Do n't forget to take the survey .
and do n't forget to say thanks to Hilda Solis , Jerry Nadler , Tom Allen , and Steve Cohen A few hours ago , 146 Democrats joined every single Republican voting in the House in condemning a MoveOn.org newspaper ad .

Second Life ’s ‘ Aimee Weber ’ ( Alyssa LaRoche ) recently became the first avatar with a registered trademark .
The application for the registered mark was filed February 18 , 2007 approved for publication July 7 , and published for opposition August 14 .
According to ‘ Weber , ’ no opposition was filed , and she plans to immediately begin using the mark .
In a sea of often silly metaverse firsts , this one could well signal a trend .
‘ Weber ’ runs a respected design studio in - world , has one of the most recognizable avatars in Second Life , and literally wrote the book on Second Life content creation .
And now she gets to wear “ TM ” bling too .
A trademarked avatar , though novel , should n’t really be a surprise .
McDonald ’s trademarked Ronald , so there is no reason an avatar — for many users , a computer generated representation of their brand — could not also be trademarked .
The rather distinct appearance of avatar ‘ Aimee Weber ’ is indisputably identified with the brand .
And ‘ Aimee Weber ’ is as much a Second Life icon as she is a person you chat with at a virtual coffee shop or hire for design work ; the little “ TM ” just makes that official .
One interesting legal angle here : the avatar , once trademarked , is basically locked into a persistent image , so VB hopes that ‘ Weber ’ is happy with her pigtails , butterfly wings , green tutu , zebra leggings , and stompy boots , because that ’s what she ’s stuck with as long as she wants to keep the mark .
VB caught up with the ‘ Weber ’ today for a short interview .
Virtually Blind : First off , why trademark your avatar ?
Some specific problem , or is it more a general move to protect your brand ?
Aimee Weber :
It ’s a general move to protect my brand .
We have n’t seen any problems yet , but prior to the trademark , we would n’t have been as well protected if somebody wanted to plaster my image all over an unrelated product .
VB : Do you plan to pursue people who infringe ?
If someone creates a new avatar that looks just like ‘ Aimee Weber , ’ should that person expect to hear from your lawyers ?
AW : Well I think there are two levels to that question , one is my own personal concerns , which are pretty laid back .
I do n’t want to see my hard work co-opted by another company , but as far as I ’m concerned any non-commercial reproduction of my avatar does n’t bother me .
I ’m more flattered than anything .
The other side of the coin is the general protection of the trademark .
That may compel me to ask for the removal of stuff that does n’t bother me so much .
I ’m not sure where that line is yet , but if there is one thing I learned from Anshe Chung ’s DMCA spree is that I do n’t want to piss off the community by being overly territorial .
VB : How closely do you identify with ‘ Aimee Weber ? ’
Is it at all odd , knowing you ca n’t really alter your avatar ’s appearance much now ?
AW : Well I see Aimee Weber as a “ character ” and myself the creator of that character .
Not that there is much difference between Aimee and myself !
A whole lot of who I am gets channeled into this avatar .
But I do see them as distinct .
Aimee is the Dilbert to my Scott Adams .
Gen Halutz has been criticised for Israel failings in the conflict
Gen Halutz said he wanted to assume his " responsibilities " after a war which has been widely criticised for failing to crush the anti-Israel militia .
A military inquiry is now over , but the government 's handling of the 34 - day conflict is still being investigated .
The resignation is the latest in a series of setbacks for PM Ehud Olmert .
Hours before Gen Halutz made his announcement , the justice ministry ordered a criminal investigation into Mr Olmert 's role in the privatisation of the country 's second largest bank in 2005 .
The BBC's Rachel Harvey in Jerusalem says now that the military chief has fallen on his sword , the spotlight is likely to shift back to the civilian leadership .
Under pressure
The military leadership has been criticised for poor planning , poor strategy and poor execution during the war .
Israeli views on the resignation of Lt Gen Dan Halutz
In pictures
In particular , Gen Halutz is accused of relying too heavily on air power and waiting too long to send in ground troops .
When they were sent in , many soldiers complained of being poorly equipped .
Gen Halutz said he had decided to step down now because military inquiries into the conduct of the war had been completed .
" With the echoes of battle having faded , I have decided to act on my responsibility , " he is quoted as saying in his resignation letter .
State radio said Mr Olmert had tried in vain to convince him to stay until the results of all the investigations were known .
Not freed
Israel attacked the Lebanon - based Hezbollah after the group captured two Israeli soldiers in a cross - border raid last July .
WAR IN LEBANON Began on 12 July 2006 and lasted 34 days Israeli deaths : 116 soldiers and 43 civilians About 1,000 Lebanese killed , mostly civilians Extensive damage to infrastructure , thousands of homes destroyed
Conflict facts and figures
But it failed to free the soldiers or destroy Hezbollah before a ceasefire ended the fighting in August , with Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah claiming a strategic victory over Israel .
About 1,000 Lebanese were killed in the conflict , mostly civilians in Israel 's vast bombardment of the county and land invasion in the south .
Lebanon 's infrastructure also suffered extensive damage .
The Israeli army lost 116 soldiers .
Forty - three Israeli civilians were also killed by more than 4,000 Hezbollah rocket attacks .
A former air force head , Gen Halutz became chief of the armed forces in June 2005 .
Several other senior army commanders have already resigned over the handling of the war .
Click to viewDo n't ditch your classic Xbox just because you can't play Halo 3 on it : nowadays it 's easier than ever to transform that old neglected console into a Unix - based media command center .
While early Xbox hackers had to pry open the black box to solder on a modchip , today a software exploit lets you replace Microsoft 's crippled dashboard and run the incredible , open source Xbox Media Center ( XBMC ) software .
You do n't have to be a hardcore gamer or Unix hacker to get your XBMC on .
On Tuesday Adam showed you how to reach media nirvana with Windows Media Center and the Xbox 360 , but today we 're kickin ' it old school with a classic Xbox softmod .

Why do you want an Xbox Media Center
Because underneath your television there 's a powerful little black computer gathering dust ever since you finished Halo 2 , and it's got a sizable hard drive , fast processor , and most importantly , an ethernet port that can do a hell of a lot more than connect you to Xbox Live .
Your modded Xbox running XBMC will be networked with the rest of the computers in your house and let you :
Play videos , music and photo slideshows located on any shared drive in the house displayed on the television in your living room
Watch Apple movie trailers , YouTube videos , Launch.com videos and see RSS newsfeeds dynamically loaded from the internets
Transfer files to and from your Xbox 's hard drive
Rip DVDs to a shared network drive to play later or backup
Watch DVDs sans " dongle " ( no more DVD Playback Kit required ! )
Plus all your games and saved games work as usual ( EXCEPT for Xbox Live — see more below . )
For more details on file formats and other capabilities , here 's exactly what XBMC can do .

Warnings , disclaimers and the main catch :
Once you 've modded your Xbox you can no longer use Microsoft 's Xbox Live online gaming service .
Xbox mods are not endorsed or supported by Microsoft — in fact , they void your warranty — so you do risk bricking your box and winding up the creek without a paddle .
That said , I 've just softmodded my Xbox using these very instructions so I can vouch for 'em .
Finally , this looks like a lot of work but in reality , once you 've gathered your hardware and software , the actual modding is very quick .
Plus it makes you feel like a freakin ' ninja .
These instructions do n't require you be as smart as Cortana , but you should be comfortable with networking concepts like IP address assignments on your home network , FTP and IRC .
Let 's get started .
Gather the materials
The softmod takes advantage of a game exploit using a saved game you 'll download and move onto your Xbox , so it requires a few specific items .
Here 's what you 'll need :
A classic Xbox ( duh ) — Those of you without an Xbox but interested in building a media center on the cheap , you could easily score one on eBay for under $ 100 .

Install the softmod and Xbox Media Center
Once you 've got the materials together , you 're most of the way there .
Onto the modding .

Determine the location of the softmod installer and XBMC downloads .
Never in my online life have I had to go through such a rigamarole to get ahold of files .
( Update :
The softmod installer binaries are technically illegal to distribute for reasons I do n't quite grok ; but I 'm reprinting instructions on how to obtain them which were freely available and printed in full at this popular tutorial . )
In short , you have to log onto an IRC channel , issue a command to query the FTP server location , and get temporary login details in order to acquire the files ( the equivalent of finding hidden door and using a secret knock ) .
So , using your favorite IRC client ( I went with the Chatzilla Firefox extension ) , type :
/ server irc.efnet.net
Once connected to EFNet , type :
/j #xbins
Then :
/msg xbins !
list
You will receive a private message with 2 sets of FTP login details .
One is for the softmod installer , the other is for XBMC .
Advertisement
Download and extract the softmod installer and XBMC .
Whether it's FileZilla , FireFTP , SmartFTP or Transmit , use your favorite FTP client to hit up the first file location you got from xbins and download the softmod archive , which is located at :
/XBOX / Console Based Applications / exploits / Packages / Softmod Installer Deluxe / Softmod.Installer.Deluxe.v2.0.Xbox-Hq.rar
Then , disconnect and login to the second FTP server to grab the XBMC archive , XBMC - 2.0.1-FINAL-FAT -T3CH.rar .
Using your favorite RAR extractor ( I recommend 7 - Zip
Move the saved game exploit onto a memory card with Action Replay .
Now , break out the Action Replay software that comes on CD in the package and install it on your PC .
Plug in the USB cable and the 8MB memory card that came with it .
From your Softmod .
Installer.Deluxe.v2.0.Xbox
-Hq folder , drag and drop two files into the " PC Database " column of the Action Replay software : the one named SID .
Splinter .Cell.v2.0.NTSC.Xbox-Hq.zip , and the one named SID .
Splinter .Cell.v2.0.Xbox-Hq.zip .
( Note : If you 're in the US , you 'll need the NTSC version of the first file ; UK folks , go with the PAL version . )
That will add a " LINUX_Profile " saved game to the Splinter Cell folder , as well as a " Linux Installer " folder .
Drag and drop the Linux Installer to the Memory Card column , as shown ( click to enlarge ) :

Transfer the Linux Installer to your Xbox hard drive .
Pop the memory card out of the Action Replay kit and plug it into one of your Xbox 's controllers .
Make sure the disc tray is empty and start up the 'box .
Go into the Memory area and drill down to the controller 's memory card .
When you see the Linux installer saved game , hit the right button pad once to select the game , then select " Copy " from the menu to copy it to the Xbox 's hard drive , as shown .

Shut down your Xbox and head back to your computer .
Repeat the same process with the Splinter Cell LINUX_Profile : copy it to your Memory Card ( you 'll have to delete the Linux Installer first , the card is n't big enough to accommodate both ) , then plug the card into the Xbox controller , boot up the 'box and copy the saved game to your Xbox 's hard drive .
Turn off the Xbox .
Now the magic happens .

Use the Splinter Cell exploit .
Insert the Splinter Cell game disk into your Xbox , and start the game .
When it comes time to choose the profile , underneath your regular aliases , you 'll see a new one named " Linux " :

Select Linux and then select " Check points " ( not " Levels " ) .
After a few seconds , Your Xbox will display an UnleashX intro screen and control panel .
This is the Linux - based Xbox dashboard , which will look like this :

Before we hit that magical menu item — Install Softmod — do two things first .
Hit up the " Create MS Backup " item first , and when that 's complete , hit the " Create Mod Backup . "
( Better safe than sorry . )
Finally , the moment you 've been waiting for : select the " Install Softmod " menu item .
Do n't turn off your Xbox during the process , and when the status bar completes and disappears , you 're all good .

Now choose " Install UnleashX " from the menu to replace the standard Microsoft dashboard with UnleashX permanently .
Restart your Xbox and pat yourself on the back .
UnleashX will boot up instead of the Microsoft dashboard , and it's got all sorts of goodies in store for you :

Using only the UnleashX dashboard and its default apps , you can watch DVDs using your controller , and under Applications , you can rip DVDs to your Xbox 's hard drive .
But what we 're really interested in is its FTP server .
Configure the Xbox 's network settings and start the FTP server .
The first order of business is to get your Xbox talking to your PC so you can start transferring files .
First make sure your Xbox is plugged into your working , online home network router .
Then , using the soft pad to navigate UnleashX menus and the green A button to select items , go to System > Settings > Network .
There make sure Enable is set to Yes , Type set to DHCP and FTP Server is set to Yes , as shown :

Note :
These are the most common network settings , but yours may differ depending on your home network .
Advertisement
Restart your Xbox to save your settings .
When you boot back up into UnleashX , you should see your Xbox 's new IP address appear on the lower right hand corner of the screen .
Take note of it .
Install XBMC on your Xbox .
Back at your PC , fire up your favorite FTP client and log into your Xbox .
The server location will be the IP address shown on the UnleashX screen , and your username and password will be in the Xbox 's network Settings ( xbox / xbox , by default . )
Navigate to /E / Apps/ folder .
Back on your local machine , extract the XBMC archive you downloaded , and from the XBMC - 2.0.1 - FINAL -FAT -T3CH folder you unrar'ed , grab the entire XBMC subfolder and FTP it to the Xbox 's /E / Apps / .
Advertisement
Restart your Xbox .
When it 's up , navigate to the Applications section , and you 'll see Xbox Media Center listed .
Select it to launch .

Revel in how much you rule
From here you get treated to XBMC 's beautiful and ( mostly ) intuitive interface for navigating your Videos , Music , and Pictures .
Advertisement
To access your media library , you can either move files onto the Xbox hard drive itself ( which has its size limits ) , or browse and play media on a shared drive on your network .
Using Windows built - in sharing ( or Mac OS X's Windows Sharing ) , you can use XBMC's SMB ( Samba ) support to play videos that you record with your PC 's capture card in the den or download via BitTorrent from the Mac in the bedroom .
As you 'll see , XBMC is very configurable and full of useful features .

Baghdad Burning
... I 'll meet you 'round the bend my friend , where hearts can heal and souls can mend ...
Leaving Home ...
Two months ago , the suitcases were packed .
My lone , large suitcase sat in my bedroom for nearly six weeks , so full of clothes and personal items , that it took me , E. and our six year old neighbor to zip it closed .
Packing that suitcase was one of the more difficult things I ’ve had to do .
It was Mission Impossible : Your mission , R. , should you choose to accept it is to go through the items you ’ve accumulated over nearly three decades and decide which ones you cannot do without .
The difficulty of your mission , R. , is that you must contain these items in a space totaling 1 m by 0.7 m by 0.4 m .
This , of course , includes the clothes you will be wearing for the next months , as well as any personal memorabilia - photos , diaries , stuffed animals , CDs and the like .
I packed and unpacked it four times .
Each time I unpacked it , I swore I ’d eliminate some of the items that were not absolutely necessary .
Each time I packed it again , I would add more ‘ stuff ’ than the time before .
E. finally came in a month and a half later and insisted we zip up the bag so I would n’t be tempted to update its contents constantly .
The decision that we would each take one suitcase was made by my father .
He took one look at the box of assorted memories we were beginning to prepare and it was final :
Four large identical suitcases were purchased - one for each member of the family and a fifth smaller one was dug out of a closet for the documentation we ’d collectively need - graduation certificates , personal identification papers , etc.
We waited … and waited … and waited .
It was decided we would leave mid to late June - examinations would be over and as we were planning to leave with my aunt and her two children - that was the time considered most convenient for all involved .
The day we finally appointed as THE DAY , we woke up to an explosion not 2 km away and a curfew .
The trip was postponed a week .
The night before we were scheduled to travel , the driver who owned the GMC that would take us to the border excused himself from the trip - his brother had been killed in a shooting .
Once again , it was postponed .
There was one point , during the final days of June , where I simply sat on my packed suitcase and cried .
By early July , I was convinced we would never leave .
I was sure the Iraqi border was as far away , for me , as the borders of Alaska .
It had taken us well over two months to decide to leave by car instead of by plane .
It had taken us yet another month to settle on Syria as opposed to Jordan .
How long would it take us to reschedule leaving ?
It happened almost overnight .
My aunt called with the exciting news that one of her neighbors was going to leave for Syria in 48 hours because their son was being threatened and they wanted another family on the road with them in another car - like gazelles in the jungle , it ’s safer to travel in groups .
It was a flurry of activity for two days .
We checked to make sure everything we could possibly need was prepared and packed .
We arranged for a distant cousin of my moms who was to stay in our house with his family to come the night before we left ( we ca n’t leave the house empty because someone might take it ) .
It was a tearful farewell as we left the house .
One of my other aunts and an uncle came to say goodbye the morning of the trip .
It was a solemn morning and I ’d been preparing myself for the last two days not to cry .
You wo n’t cry , I kept saying , because you ’re coming back .
You wo n’t cry because it ’s just a little trip like the ones you used to take to Mosul or Basrah before the war .
In spite of my assurances to myself of a safe and happy return , I spent several hours before leaving with a huge lump lodged firmly in my throat .
My eyes burned and my nose ran in spite of me .
I told myself it was an allergy .
We did n’t sleep the night before we had to leave because there seemed to be so many little things to do …
It helped that there was no electricity at all - the area generator was n’t working and ‘ national electricity ’ was hopeless .
There just was n’t time to sleep .
The last few hours in the house were a blur .
It was time to go and I went from room to room saying goodbye to everything .
I said goodbye to my desk - the one I ’d used all through high school and college .
I said goodbye to the curtains and the bed and the couch .
I said goodbye to the armchair E. and I broke when we were younger .
I said goodbye to the big table over which we ’d gathered for meals and to do homework .
I said goodbye to the ghosts of the framed pictures that once hung on the walls , because the pictures have long since been taken down and stored away - but I knew just what hung where .
I said goodbye to the silly board games we inevitably fought over - the Arabic Monopoly with the missing cards and money that no one had the heart to throw away .
I knew then as I know now that these were all just items - people are so much more important .
Still , a house is like a museum in that it tells a certain history .
You look at a cup or stuffed toy and a chapter of memories opens up before your very eyes .
It suddenly hit me that I wanted to leave so much less than I thought I did .
Six AM finally came .
The GMC waited outside while we gathered the necessities - a thermos of hot tea , biscuits , juice , olives ( olives ? ! ) which my dad insisted we take with us in the car , etc .
My aunt and uncle watched us sorrowfully .
There ’s no other word to describe it .
It was the same look I got in my eyes when I watched other relatives and friends prepare to leave .
It was a feeling of helplessness and hopelessness , tinged with anger .
Why did the good people have to go ?
I cried as we left - in spite of promises not to .
The aunt cried … the uncle cried .
My parents tried to be stoic but there were tears in their voices as they said their goodbyes .
The worst part is saying goodbye and wondering if you ’re ever going to see these people again .
My uncle tightened the shawl I ’d thrown over my hair and advised me firmly to ‘ keep it on until you get to the border ’ .
The aunt rushed out behind us as the car pulled out of the garage and dumped a bowl of water on the ground , which is a tradition - its to wish the travelers a safe return … eventually .
The trip was long and uneventful , other than two checkpoints being run by masked men .
They asked to see identification , took a cursory glance at the passports and asked where we were going .
The same was done for the car behind us .
Those checkpoints are terrifying but I ’ve learned that the best technique is to avoid eye - contact , answer questions politely and pray under your breath .
My mother and I had been careful not to wear any apparent jewelry , just in case , and we were both in long skirts and head scarves .

My mother and I had been careful not to wear any apparent jewelry , just in case , and we were both in long skirts and head scarves .
Syria is the only country , other than Jordan , that was allowing people in without a visa .
The Jordanians are being horrible with refugees .
Families risk being turned back at the Jordanian border , or denied entry at Amman Airport .
It ’s too high a risk for most families .
We waited for hours , in spite of the fact that the driver we were with had ‘ connections ’ , which meant he ’d been to Syria and back so many times , he knew all the right people to bribe for a safe passage through the borders .
I sat nervously at the border .
The tears had stopped about an hour after we ’d left Baghdad .
Just seeing the dirty streets , the ruins of buildings and houses , the smoke - filled horizon all helped me realize how fortunate I was to have a chance for something safer .
By the time we were out of Baghdad , my heart was no longer aching as it had been while we were still leaving it .
The cars around us on the border were making me nervous .
I hated being in the middle of so many possibly explosive vehicles .
A part of me wanted to study the faces of the people around me , mostly families , and the other part of me , the one that ’s been trained to stay out of trouble the last four years , told me to keep my eyes to myself - it was almost over .
It was finally our turn .
I sat stiffly in the car and waited as money passed hands ; our passports were looked over and finally stamped .
We were ushered along and the driver smiled with satisfaction , “ It ’s been an easy trip , Alhamdulillah , ” he said cheerfully .
As we crossed the border and saw the last of the Iraqi flags , the tears began again .
The car was silent except for the prattling of the driver who was telling us stories of escapades he had while crossing the border .
I sneaked a look at my mother sitting beside me and her tears were flowing as well .
There was simply nothing to say as we left Iraq .
I wanted to sob , but I did n’t want to seem like a baby .
I did n’t want the driver to think I was ungrateful for the chance to leave what had become a hellish place over the last four and a half years .
The Syrian border was almost equally packed , but the environment was more relaxed .
People were getting out of their cars and stretching .
Some of them recognized each other and waved or shared woeful stories or comments through the windows of the cars .
Most importantly , we were all equal .
Sunnis and Shia , Arabs and Kurds … we were all equal in front of the Syrian border personnel .
We were all refugees - rich or poor .
And refugees all look the same - there ’s a unique expression you ’ll find on their faces - relief , mixed with sorrow , tinged with apprehension .
The faces almost all look the same .
The first minutes after passing the border were overwhelming .
Overwhelming relief and overwhelming sadness …
How is it that only a stretch of several kilometers and maybe twenty minutes , so firmly segregates life from death ?
How is it that a border no one can see or touch stands between car bombs , militias , death squads and … peace , safety ?
It ’s difficult to believe - even now .
I sit here and write this and wonder why I can’t hear the explosions .
I wonder at how the windows do n’t rattle as the planes pass overhead .
I ’m trying to rid myself of the expectation that armed people in black will break through the door and into our lives .
I ’m trying to let my eyes grow accustomed to streets free of road blocks , hummers and pictures of Muqtada and the rest …
How is it that all of this lies a short car ride away ?
Even more surprisingly , Egan claims that last year , when relations between the U.S. and North Korea appeared to have reached yet another impasse , he counselled the North Koreans to be more demonstrative .
“ I said , ‘ I think you have to bring it up to another level , ’ ” he told me .
“ I said , ‘ Forget all this war rhetoric and all this crap .
Do n’t blow up a plane , do n’t send another submarine to South Korea — do n’t do any of that stupid stuff . ’ ” Instead , he suggested , the North Koreans should show the Americans exactly what they had .
And , in his telling , they listened .
“ I said , ‘ You have them , right ?
Maybe you should test one .
Maybe they have to see it . ’
Four or five months later , the Koreans did that nuclear test .
I called the Embassy that morning and said , ‘ Congratulations , you are in the nuclear club now , boys . ’
They were all happy and stuff .
I said , ‘ Watch the ball start rolling now . ’
And it did . ”
Over the years , Egan claims to have suggested some even more outlandish gambits .
At some point in the mid-nineties , he says , he proposed that North Korea release American P.O.W.s to Iraq in exchange for oil ; Iraq , which was at the time under the rule of Saddam Hussein , would then gain favor with the United States by releasing the Americans .
In the interest of establishing a relationship with Iraq , Egan took the Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoun and his wife to a Giants game .
A photograph on the wall of Cubby ’s shows the couple in the back seat of a limo , next to a grinning Egan .
The prisoner - release plan never came to anything , but Egan , in his office at Cubby ’s , keeps a letter written in Arabic on official - looking stationery .
“ This is a letter from Saddam Hussein to me , thanking me for my help and my ideas , ” Egan , who never had the letter translated , told me .
In fact , the letter is from a lesser official , thanking Egan for his hospitality at the Giants game .
Egan also claims that he once proposed a plan whereby the Koreans would sell their nuclear weapons to the U.S. , achieving denuclearization and economic recovery in the same stroke .
The Americans , he says , rejected the idea .
( Last year , an article in Newsweek described such a proposal , citing Egan . )
Although the name Bobby Egan is largely unfamiliar to those in higher diplomatic circles — Christopher Hill , through a spokesperson , said that he had “ never heard of Mr. Egan ” — there is one senior official who does have some knowledge of him : Charles L. ( Jack ) Pritchard , who was the director of Asian affairs for the National Security Council under Bill Clinton and , between 2001 and 2003 , served as a special envoy for negotiations with North Korea .
While Pritchard was in the Clinton Administration , he went to Cubby ’s to meet with Egan , but he has nothing good to say about him .
“ Ten years ago , I did go to his restaurant , based upon information that he said he had , ” Pritchard told me , adding that the information concerned the possibility of P.O.W.s being held in North Korea .
“ I checked it out , and I decided it probably was not as advertised . ”
Pritchard dismissed Egan ’s claims of having influence in security matters : “ He has made no contributions , no positive suggestions , as far as I can tell . ”
He added that he stopped taking calls from Egan after he discovered that Egan was taping their conversations .
“ I disassociated myself with him , and I have n’t missed him a single day , ” Pritchard said .
Egan said that he made the tapes for his own protection .
“ Pritchard can kiss my big fat uneducated ass , ” he said .
“ The North Koreans are just knock - around guys who need a little insight into what we are really about .
They need to know what the Bobby Egans are about , not the intellectuals in Washington . ”
Minister Kim , whom I called after observing the barbecue summit at Cubby ’s , confirmed that Egan has a relationship with North Korea .
“ He has been interested in improving the relations between the two countries in the past , and he would like to help with the provision of humanitarian assistance , like medicines , for the D.P.R.K. , ” Kim said .
“ He ’s a friend of the D.P.R.K. , especially those people who receive the humanitarian assistance from those organizations . ”
In a follow - up call , however , Minister Kim said that Egan had never proposed an oil - for - prisoners deal with Iraq or a nukes - for - cash deal with the U.S.
He also said that the idea for North Korea ’s recent nuclear test did not originate in Hackensack .
When I passed Kim ’s comments on to Egan , he seemed momentarily deflated , then resigned .
“ That ’s going to be their line , and that ’s O.K. , ” he said .
“ That ’s their right to say what they want , and I can understand their position .
Maybe it ’s because , right now , the Koreans are in a position to move forward with our government .
It is difficult , I guess , for a country to admit to something like this .
They can discount it if they like , but I know different . ”
It has been a few years since Egan was last in North Korea , he says , and he is eager to go back .
“ Why do I do this ? ” he asked me one day .
“ Why did Mozart compose music ?
This is what I do best , and it ’s what I enjoy .
I mean , I run a great restaurant , but this is what I do .
And I have an overwhelming desire to get involved . ”
He also has personal reasons for wanting to get back into action : he has been going through a tough time emotionally since separating from Lilia Mani , he says , and he wants something to take his mind off things .
He also misses Han .
“ The only characteristic I have that the Koreans do n’t have is that I get emotionally attached to people , ” he said .
“ I can take aim , I can break a bone , a nose , a jaw .
I can take burning .
I can take getting cut .
Drop me on my head .
I can take any of it .
But emotional pain is something that would disqualify me from being a North Korean commander .
It is something that is very , very difficult for me .
I have a difficult time saying goodbye to people I really care about . ”
There ’s a lot about North Korean society that Egan admires , he said that afternoon as he drove me into Manhattan .
( He pays the toll on the George Washington Bridge in cash rather than using an E - Z Pass ; he says he does n’t want anyone to know how many trips he has made back and forth , should the American authorities ever decide that he is too much of a liability and try to build a case against him for conspiring with the enemy . )
“ This is what I like — the North Koreans are very disciplined , and I like discipline , ” he said .
“ I think that is what is lacking in this country .
They are a very hardworking people , and they are very family - oriented .
And they have a better take on a man ’s role and a woman ’s role than we do .
I think a lot of women in this country are trying to be men , and I think that could be the downfall of the family structure of this society .
But , in North Korea , the man goes to work and the woman raises the family .
Now , I would n’t want that for my own daughters — I want them to be career girls , not dependent on any man but me — but in my own life I like the fact that a guy ’s a guy and a girl ’s a girl .
You feel like a man when you are in North Korea .
And , security - wise , it is a safer nation to live in .
You are not going to have anybody break into your house , unless it comes from the top .
And if it comes from the top you ’re in trouble . ”
In any case , Egan says , he prefers the American way of life , even if his way of life has been unlike that of any other American .
“ Certainly , I like where I am , or else I ’d move there , ” he told me as we drove along the turnpike , past warehouses and swamplands of bulrushes , his radar detector chirping like a demented sparrow .
“ I ’d be somebody in North Korea .
Maybe I ’d be in a little position of power .
I would n’t take all the power in the world — not to say that I would have much — but I would have more than I have here .
“ But I would n’t give this up , ” Egan went on .
“ I like it where I am .
I am an American .
I love my country .
That is why I am doing all this .
There are certain freedoms that I want , and choices I want to be able to make , that I would n’t be able to make there . ” ♦
Through mechanisms that remain mysterious , then , the impatient parasite induces a precise sort of madness in its host .
It prompts the poor creature to defy all known pill bug precautions , to venture forth in broad daylight and crawl onto a light - colored surface , where the dark pill bug stands out so starkly it might as well flash a sign saying , Snack Time !
As a result , infected pill bugs end up being eaten by birds at a far higher rate than are their unparasitized peers , and the thorn - headed worm lives on .
A similar story applies to the horsehair worm , which thrives as a larval youth inside a cricket or grasshopper , but must be delivered to a stream or lake to breed .
Healthy crickets and grasshoppers are devoutly terrestrial and do not go swimming .
A parasitized insect , however , finds itself with the odd compulsion to head for the nearest body of water and jump in , at which point the ripened , writhing worm bursts its host apart like a comic book villain rupturing from a mild - mannered disguise , and starts seeking another freshly born - again worm .
The tiny brains of invertebrates may seem easier takeover targets than the complex counterpart organs in mammals , but parasites have both opportunity and motive to succeed .
Their generation times are quite short compared with a mammal ’s , allowing them to evolve new tricks faster than mammals can combat them , and their finicky needs can often be fulfilled only by manipulating host behavior .
In the case of Toxoplasma gondii , the parasite appears to have hit on the perfect method for puppeteering a common primary host — the rat .
More than most mammals , rats habitually dig around in garbage and animal waste , where traces of cat fecal matter laced with Toxoplasma eggs may reside .
But how to journey reliably at maturity from rat to cat , when eons of evolution have hammered into rats a keen aversion to the sight and smell of live cats ?
The parasite deftly knocks that antipathy out .
Studies show that while parasitized rats behave much like their healthy peers in aggressiveness and other measures , they differ from ordinary rats in one outstanding trait : they will recklessly frolic in a cat - scented room , and should a cat enter , the rattled rat is as apt to run toward its old foe as away .
We humans are not at risk of being predated on by house cats , and Toxoplasma probably has scant incentive for specifically modulating our behavior .
Yet because our brains are wired much like a rat ’s , infection with Toxoplasma could well exert a behavioral or temperamental effect indirectly .
As Dr. Zuk recounts , when Jaroslav Flegr of Charles University in Prague administered personality tests to two groups of people , one showing immunological signs of a prior Toxoplasma infection and the other not , infected men scored comparatively higher than uninfected men in traits like suspicion of authority and a propensity to break rules , while infected women ranked relatively higher than noninfected women in measures of warmth , self - assurance and chattiness .
This last finding has prompted speculation that there may be a biological basis for the Cat Lady stereotype , the loopy , friendly neighbor who keeps dozens of cats .
She loves them , they ’re her children , and she ’s clearly inured to their smell .
Weird Asian Martial Arts Weapons
From iron claws and meteor hammers to deer antler blades and emei needles , ancient Martial Arts weapons range greatly in shape and design , yet all have only one purpose – to injure .
In the hands of a skilled assassin , even the humble chopsticks can become savage weapons .
Brutal metal - link whips , miniature swords disguised as tobacco pipes , fans edges with razor - sharp blades and poison - tipped arrows are all lethal in their own right but pale in comparison with an almost mystical weapon of decapitation .
1. The Urumi
Also known as “ chuttuval , ” which means “ coiled sword , ” this flexible weapon is used in the South Indian Martial Art of Kalaripayatt .
The blade ( or multiple blades , as in the urumi pictured here ) is flexible enough to be rolled up and stored when not used , or even worn as a belt and whipped out on demand .
The blade or blades are typically razor - sharp and bad news for anyone standing in the vicinity of the person wielding the urumi .
2. The Tekko - kagi ( “ hand claws ” )
Ninjas would use the tekko - kagi claws to guard against sword attacks , allowing them to swipe and potentially knock the sword from an assailant ’s hands .
Or , ninjas could use claws the claws offensively against their opponents with devastating results .
Typically made from aluminum , steel , iron or wood , tekko weapons are believed by martial arts historians to have originated when the Bushi in Okinawa , Japan began wielding the steel shoes of their horses as a means of self - defense against assailants .
3. The Kusari-gama
Kusari - gama is a traditional Japanese weapon that consists of Scythe - like blade , Kama , on a metal chain with a heavy iron weight at the end .
This weapon came from the design of the farmer ’s scythe but this was not a weapon that farmers used .
The art of handling the Kusarigama is called Kusarigamajutsu .
4. The Nunchaku
A nunchaku is two sections of wood ( or metal in modern incarnations ) connected by a cord or chain .
Chinese nunchaku tend to be rounded , whereas Japanese are octagonal .
The traditional nunchaku is made from a strong , flexible hardwood such as oak , loquat or pasania .
Originally , the wood would be submerged in mud for several years , where lack of oxygen and optimal acidity prevent rotting .
The end result is a hardened wood .
The rope is made from horsehair , and was traditionally claimed to be able to block a sword .
Finally , the wood is very finely sanded and rubbed with an oil or stain for preservation .
5 . The Meteor Hammer & Rope Dart
This weapon is comprised of a long rope with twin metal weights , “ hammers ” , or darts on each end .
When used as a weapon , the hammer or dart on the front end is used for attack and the other for protection .
The rope wraps around the neck , back , shoulder , elbow , wrist , thigh , foot , or waist .
When the hammer or dart is released , it strikes outward with stunning and surprising speed .
It is one of Chinese martial arts ’ most unique and difficult - to - master weapons .
6. San -Jie-Gun ( Three Section Staff )
The three sectional staff , is a historical weapon , which appears in the Chinese book “ Sangokushi ” .
Its distinctive feature is three 70 cm sticks chained together making it much longer than a long staff .
It can be swung around , or as a staff , using one ’s whole body space to fend off an attacker .
A Chinese weapon constructed from three pieces of wood connected by metal rings at their ends .
Lengths of the sections are roughly equal , each about the length of the practitioner ’s arms ( with the diameter around one inch ) .
The three sectional staff can be used as a long range weapon when held at one end and swung freely , or a short - range weapon when two of the sections are held and used to strike or parry .
7. Shurikens ( Throwing Star )
One of the most popular weapons of the Ninja , the shuriken was used as more of a distraction than an actual weapon .
Although they can hurt they rarely penetrate deep enough to kill .
Shurikens come with anywhere from 4 to 12 points traditionally .
8. Tessen ( Iron Fan )
Folding fans with outer spokes made of iron which were designed to look like regular , harmless folding fans or solid clubs shaped to look like a closed fan .
Samurai could take these to places where swords or other overt weapons were not allowed , and some swordsmanship schools included training in the use of the tessen as a weapon .
The tessen was also used for fending off arrows and darts , as a throwing weapon , and as an aid in swimming , like hand - flippers .

Many of the world ’s great natural history museums devote at least one hall to creatures that no longer exist today .
In the old tradition , in order to keep any young upstarts from getting any ideas about evolution , skeletons or parts of skeletons were grouped by the functions they performed , a visitor being likely to find the wing of a bat and the wing of the bird in the same display case even though the two animals extremely distantly related .
Newer layouts , conversely , have largely ignored the end - function of one line or another to group animals together by homology and their shared characters , the most well - known example being the remodeled 4th Floor of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City which has attempted to arrange its fossil collections as a walk - through cladistic diagram .
Still , the generally discarded of grouping animals by their adaptations to general habitats or niches is not without it ’s charms .
Over and over again , evolution has produced forms that seem to converge on certain body plans , varying habitats making some traits advantageous and others a liability , helping to adapt different organisms to their local ecologies .
Flight has independently evolved several times ( and the ability to glide an even greater number of times ) , as well as adaptations to marine environments , saber - like canine teeth , immense sails along the spine , and slicing premolar teeth , although each time such familiar features seem to arise it shows that there is more than one way to solve an evolutionary problem from any given point in an organism ’s natural history .
Not everything can be chalked up to convergence of form in order to carry out particular functions , however .
Parallel evolution , although sometimes difficult to determine , also allows relatively closely related forms to take the same evolutionary paths , showing many of the same anatomical characters even though they diverged from a common ancestor at some point in the past and occupy at least two different lines of descent .
In fact , it is often these weird and wonderful creatures that are forgotten or overlooked , more people recognizing the term “ saber - toothed cat ” ( or , loathe as I am to say it , “ saber - toothed tiger ” ) or the genus Smilodon than the term “ Nimravid ” or the genus Dinictis .
The following entry , therefore , will be an attempt to navigate through the somewhat “ entangled bank ” of evolutionary relationships among animals that appear to be shaped in similar ways by the environment but constrained by their species ’ history , showing us that there is more than one way to make a saber - toothed cat .
Back into the pool : Of Ichthyosaurs , Sharks , and Cetaceans
Perhaps one of the most well - known ( or at least widely cited ) examples of evolutionary convergence has been that of the similar body shapes of sharks , ichthyosaurs , and cetaceans .
It ’s difficult to see these three distinct groups of creatures side by side and not recognize the similarities , but why are they similar in the first place ?
If they belong to groups that are distantly - related branches of the evolutionary “ bush , ” why should they have developed similar body forms ?
One of the most well - known examples of evolutionary convergence ; ( From Top to Bottom )
An ichthyosaur Ophthalmosaurus icenicus , a Porpoise , and a Spiny Dogfish ( Squalus acanthias )
From the 1925 creationist book The Predicament of Evolution by George McReady Price .
Creationists have been quick to seize upon the idea of convergence as if it were one of evolution ’s weak points .
In 1926 , George McCready Price wrote the following in one of the more well - known early American anti-evolution texts , The Predicament of Evolution ;
For instance , we have the shark , the ichthyosaur ( an extinct kind of fish - shaped reptile ) , and the dolphin ( a true warmblooded mammal , and not a fish at all ) , all of which greatly resemble each other in external shape and general appearance .
Each has the same long , sharp snout , the same powerful tail , the same general fishlike shape .
And yet the first of these is a true fish , the second was just as true a reptile , while the third is a mam-mal , bringing forth its young alive and feeding them by milk , just as does a cow or a horse , though it lives in the sea .
Here the evolutionists have to say that this peculiar shape and general form has been evolved separately and independently in each of these three instances .
Indeed , Henry Fairfield Osborn , President of the American Museum of Natural History , New York City , declares that a very similar shape and form has been independently evolved “ at least twenty - four times . ” — ” Encyc. Brit. , ” Vol. XX , p. 578 …
From this large group of facts we become convinced that these many similar or identical structures , which must have been evolved quite independently ( if evolved at all ) , make too great a draft on our credulity .
At least , these hundreds of examples of “ parallel evolution ” greatly weaken our confidence in homology , or similarity of parts and organs , as a proof of blood relationship .
Such arguments have become traditional amongst creationist apologists , suggesting that if convergent evolution does occur then we must throw homology out the window as similar structures will only mislead us as to the true affinities of the creatures being studied .
As we will later see with Cuvier ’s Ptero - dactyl , this can be a danger for scientists who are unwary and wish to shoehorn creatures into existing taxonomic categories , but not for those who actually look beyond superficial appearances .
The reason why the shark , the ichthyosaur , and the porpoise should all look vaguely the same is because they live (d ) in the same environment ; the ocean .
An organism that is suspended in a fluid that is much denser than air can be adapted in various ways to such an “ alien ” environment , but physics does dictate what shapes can be taken based upon life history .
It is possible to be a floating filter feeder , exhibiting a round shape , but such a strategy is essentially out of the question for animals that need to move quickly and to hunt for food .
What is required is not only a powerful propulsive organ to keep the organism moving forward , but also extra appendages to allow for the control of movement and a streamlined shape to reduce drag ( and hence reduce energy costs for moving through the water ) .
One of Charles R. Knight ’s renditions of an ichthyosaur .
In fact , sharks as a whole provide a good model for various forms of ichthyosaurs .
While ichthyosaurs are generally presented as already being streamlined and possessing a large caudal fin with two equally long lobes , we would be loathe to forget that they too are products of evolution and many fossils show us that they were not always an Euryapsid ( thank you , johannes ) answer to modern - day Lamnid sharks .
Early ichtyhosaurs actually had more of a “ bump ” towards the back of their tail rather than a full - blown caudal fin , their overall body shape and lack of a large propulsive surface keeping them from moving too quickly through the water .
A similar tail type / form can be seen in many modern day sharks like the Nurse Shark , which generally live along the bottom feeding on crustaceans and inhabitants that can be sucked out of coral crevices .
Being that ichthyosaurs lack gills , it is unlikely that their early representatives were bottom - dwellers , instead preferring shallow areas , which can be especially productive in terms of food .
Modification of the “ tail kink ” ( which was at first thought to be a taphonomic feature , early reconstructions showing “ amphibious ” ichthyosaurs with straight tails ) seen in early forms allowed for the eventual evolution of a crescent - moon shaped tail , as well as adaptations in the skull and of the limbs into fins ( the addition of digits and the addition of bones in the digits being quite common in the latest forms ) .
This more - familiar shape would allow ichthyosaurs maximum propulsion with their caudal fin ( the spine going downwards instead of upwards , as in sharks ) while they would be able to exert control over their motions with their pectoral fins and would be kept from rolling in the water by their dorsal fins .
The evolution of large eyes and other features aside , the overall shape and basic skeletal structure of ichthyosaurs seems to be an optimal design for medium - to - large , fast - moving , oceanic predators ( although mosasaurs , pliosaurs , and plesiosaurs took different evolutionary routes ) .
What allowed ichthyosaurs to develop an effective side - to - side motion of the tail would not work for cetaceans , however .
Ichthyosaurs developed their mode of propulsion by side - to - side motions of the spine , perhaps swimming in a mode similar to eels or cat sharks at first , a common form of locomotion in modern reptiles .
This sort of motion is usually accomplished on land via a sprawling gait , the limbs being held out to the sides and the animal exhibiting a bit of a side - to - side motion as it moves along .
Whether the ancestors of icthyosaurs were sprawlers ( to a greater or lesser extent , predisposing them to side - to - side motions of the tail and body ) or not , cetaceans evolved much more recently in evolutionary history , and developed from ancestors that carried their legs directly underneath their body .
The plasticity of early archaeocetes and their artiodactyl ancestors was greatly diminished , their hip and spine structure adapted to up - and - down undulations rather than the side - to - side motion seen in the video of the salamander .
This sort of constraint has not stopped mammals from becoming adapted to the water , however , and clues to the evolution of cetacean movement can be seen in living animals like Giant River Otters ;
In the water , undulations of the spine accompanied with some propulsion from the limbs proves to be very effective , and it ’s not hard to imagine an archaeocete like Ambulocetus , as my friend Neil so aptly described , as a “ sexy otter . ”
Once undulation of the spine became established as a method of moving through the water , the eventual addition of a tail fluke would do for cetaceans what the crescent - shaped tail of tuna , sharks , and icthyosaurs acheived in terms of speed and power , the body being adapted towards a streamlined appearance with ( again ) the pectoral fins providing lift / control and the dorsal fin preventing rolling .
Larger forms of whales , namely the Mysticetes or Baleen Whales , grew to immense size and gave up some of the features that seem to be convergent with sharks and the smaller ichthyosaurs ( some , in fact , did acheive whale - size ) , but they are derived from more predatory designs and their niche as massive , far - ranging suspension feeders free them from some constrains while imposing some new ones .
A painting of leaping ichthyosaurs by Heinrich Harder ( circa 1916 )
Human engineering has recognized similar constraints for motion in the water and even in the air ; planes and submarines most closely resemble sharks and dolphins in overall shape , the placement and size of the wings on a 747 having much the same function as the large pectoral fins of far - ranging pelagic fish like the Blue Shark .
Life in the water adapted all three groups of animals towards the same shape because there does not seem to be any other way to be a fast - moving , medium - to - large sized marine predator ; speed and some degree of maneuverability are paramount .
Some other lines have diverged from this shape , as noted before , but the sharks , dolphins , and ( I do n’t think it ’s too much of a stretch to say ) ichthyosaurs all occupied essentially the same niche and therefore were adapted in a particular fashion .
Do not think , however , that the convergence of three lines towards one body plan gives credence to a kind of “ orthogenesis ” or progressive force driving evolution .
There was no sort of supernatural or external force manipulating the genetic material of these groups with the shape of a dolphin or shark in mind .
Rather , the environment and local ecology determined what form would be favored through time , and even though the three groups may look the same and have significant convergences , they also have many traits in common with their ancestors , allowing us to trace their evolutionary history ( which is why no one is arguing that dolphins , sharks , and ichthyosaurs are closely related or form a small monophyletic grouping ) .
A marsupial you would n’t want to meet
Living members of the Carnivora ( bears , cats , dogs , civets , weasels , etc. ) have always caught my attention , but there was an entire group of carnivorous mammals , now extinct , that have left no living representatives .
The last known member of this group was named Thylacoleo carnifex by Richard Owen , and it has some of the strangest dentition ever seen in a marsupial .
Marsupial mammals are well - known in Australia , creatures like kangaroos , koalas , and wombats coming most immediately to mind out of living extant taxa .
There was a much more diverse population of marsupials during the Pleistocene , however , and the “ marsupial lion ” was likely a formidable predator .
A skull of Thylacoleo on display at the AMNH .
In order to understand why Thylacoleo is relevant to our discussion of convergence we need to first understand what makes living placental Carnivores so special .
Many carnivores , especially cats , have a rather specialized dentition , certain molars and premolars making up what is known as the “ carnissal shear . ”
These teeth are pointed and act like scissors , easily cutting up flesh or crushing bone .
The molars behind the shear are often reduced ( some groups have retained their molars in order to incorporate a more generalized diet , like dogs and bears ) , the dental specialization perhaps being one of the keys to the success of this group .
Earlier predators of now - extinct lines like Mesonychids lacked such specialized cutting teeth , and the teeth behind the canines of the large Andrewsarchus show that their oral tool - kit was a bit more blunted .
The skull of Andrewsarchus , on display at the AMNH
Thylacoleo , a carnivorous marsupial not descended from the Miacids that gave rise to living carnivores , also developed something of a “ carnissal shear ” but in a different way .
Rather than a battery of teeth that became sharpened , one of the upper and lower premolars of Thylacoleo became elongated and blade - like , and the cleaver - like teeth helped to sharpen each other as they moved past each other when opening or closing the jaw .
Thylacoleo also had a terrible bite , the attachments for the muscles that opened and shut the jaw were massive , somewhat constricting the amount of space the brain could take up , but giving Thylacoleo what was perhaps the most powerful bite forces amongst mammalian predators , especially given it ’s relatively small body size ( it was only about four feet long and 220 pounds ) .
Thylacoleo is an odd marsupial in another respect ; the claw on its thumb was retractable like that of a big cat .
This sort of adaptation is especially useful in keeping claws sharp , and perhaps keeping the claws sharp would allow Thylacoleo to get a good hold on its prey before going to work on it with its teeth .
At this point I should probably mention that some scholars in the past have thought that Thylacoleo was an herbivore , not unlike the extant marsupial Phalangers .
I will leave the response to such an argument to Richard Owen ;
These eminent authors received the support , in reference to objections to my conclusions , of the ( then ) Curator of the Australian Museum , Sydney , Mr. GERARD KREFFT , who , in his contribution to the ‘ Annals and Magazine of Natural History , ’ series 3 , vol. 18 , 1866 , p. 148 , records his opinion that “ the famous marsupial Lion was not much more carnivorous than the Phalangers of the present time . ”
The species of carnivorous Phalanger is not named .
No evidence of such by fossil specimens has reached me , nor have I found such exceptional habit of an existing species of Phalangista elsewhere noted .
As my friend Zach has noted , however , calling Thylacoleo a “ marsupial lion ” is a bit misleading .
Even though some lion - like aspects of the skull ( the results of convergence on a hypercarnivorous lifestyle , and Thylacoleo means “ pouched lion ” ) led the anatomist Richard Owen to name the creature on the basis of such resemblances , the ways in which Thylacoleo shows its marsupial affinities are much more important .
Referring to this animal as the “ marsupial lion ” without qualifications ( as well as calling the extinct Tasmanian Tiger the “ marsupial wolf ” ) usually confuses more than illuminates , and creationists often take the names and superficial resemblances to mean that evolution did n’t occur .
Instead , they propose that God made the beginning of a “ kind ” of carnivorous mammal which was preserved on Noah ’s Ark and gave rise to all later forms , important reproductive habits deemed to be of little consequence .
Even so , Thylacoleo carnifex and its relatives represent a branch of marsupials that became fairly specialized predators , and given the plasticity of tooth structure , it ’s not hard to see how sharp premolars could be adapted into a blade to cut flesh .
While it may be easy to draw connections between this animal and living carnivores , however , perhaps we should be more measured in our descriptions ; both groups met the same challenges in similar ways , but the differences are far more striking and important in this example of convergence on a particular niche .
On what day were the Ptero - Bats created ?
An engraving of the creature now known as Pterodactylus antiquus , the very one described by Collini .
Before there were natural history museums , there were motley assortments of organic odds and ends known as curiosity cabinets , and in the cabinet of Karl Theodor there would eventually come to be a petrified treasure .
Although it was probably collected around 1767 , the first known pterosaur fossil was not described until 1784 , when the appointed caretaker of the collection , Cosimo Alessandro Collini , attempted to determine the nature of the strange creature that came to him from the limestone of Bavaria ( the same deposits that later yeilded Archaeopteryx ) .
Although certain that he was the remains of an animal from an earlier time , Collini was agnostic about what kind of animal he had come to possess .
Years later , the famed anatomist Georges Cuvier investigated Collini ’s paper and illustrations , noting that the creature was certainly a reptile .
Still , the fossil would remain without a proper name until Cuvier would write a more detailed analysis in 1809 , dubbing the fossil “ Ptero - dactyle . ”
Not everyone agreed with the analysis of Cuvier , however , especially since Cuvier did not get to see the fossil himself and had to work from the drawings in Collini ’s paper .
Samuel Thomas von Soemmerring , of the Bavarian Academy of Science , thought that the pterosaur was some unknown type of bat , a view that would remain entrenched in the minds of some scientists for many years .
Indeed , one restoration by Edward Newmann in 1843 ( and “ re - drawn ” for Gosse ’s work Omphalos , as shown below ) , depicted the two known types of pterodactyl known at that time as fuzzy bats , complete with cute little ears .
It is clear from the drawing that pterosaurs do not make good bats , although this did n’t stop many German paleontologists from taking such a stance through the first half of the 19th century .
Newmann ’s “ marsupial bats ” , conspicuously missing their ears , from Gosse ’s Omphalos .
It ’s likely that Gosse recognized the reptilian nature of these Pterodactyl by the time he wrote his book , so Newmann ’s work was copied minus the more mammalian aspects .
But why was there such confusion ?
It is likely because there is something familiar about pterosaurs that had been seen in living bats ; the extension of digits to hold a membraneous wing .
While the first fossil , despite wonderful preservation , did not preserve a membrane impression , it is hard to look at it and not recognize the superficially similar structure of a bat ’s wing , which also carries a membrane to enable flight .
In fact , birds seem a bit unusual in developing feathers for flight ; many varieties of gliding and flying creatures have taken to the air ( regardless of whether they engage in powered flight or glide ) by the use of membranes .
Indeed , gliding may often precede powered flight , and once an animal has developed a membrane that can be stretched between its limbs to glide , the extension of the digits at the point (s ) of attachment can help to expand the wing size .
Such changes likely occur as a result of changes in development , natural selection favoring the invasion of a new niche based upon variations that exist in a population , although in the case of pterosaurs we can no longer test to see if this is correct .
As we just saw with Thylacoleo , however , the convergences of pterosaurs and bats are rather slight , overall .
While both acheived flight on membraneous wings attached to extended digits ( many more in the case of bats ) and have relatively compressed bodies , pterosaurs had a much greater diversity in shape and size than modern bats .
Likewise , they did not elongate the rest of their fingers , suggesting that there was some situation ( be it climbing or hanging on to a perch ) that the pterosaurs still needed their other fingers for ( although bats can climb pretty well with their thumbs , and some have even evolved suction disks ) .
Still , it can be said that both took to the air by similar means and had to deal with similar constraints , but their evolutionary paths are far more divergent than that of the aforementioned sharks , ichthyosaurs , and cetaceans .
It does n’t look like much of a planet - eater to me
A female Gharial at the National Zoo in Washington , D.C .
Perhaps one of the most unnecessarily confusing groups of extinct animals are the phytosaurs .
Filling the niche now occupied by reptiles like the Saltwater Crocodile , the water - dwelling archosaurs have left no living descendants despite their past diversity .
At first glance , the phytosaur Rutidon looks just like a modern - day Gharial , and even though it shares a common ancestor with the reptiles that now exist in tropical watery habitats all over the world , it is not otherwise related .
The most prominent phytosaur feature is that their noses are over or just anterior to their eyes on their head , not at the end of their snouts .
This would allow them to breathe while completely submerged , although their eyes might not have been above water when hiding in such a manner .
Even beyond this feature , their jaws seem to be fairly simple , merely having a hinge at the back to open - and - close .
Compare this arrangement , here represented by the giant Machaeroprosopus gregorii , with the more complex reconstruction of the true crocodilian Deinosuchus ( although , admittedly , this reconstruction was heavily based upon the living Cuban Crocodile and may not be fully accurate .
It still serves to show the differences between the groups , however ) .
Machaeroprosopus , currently on display at the AMNH
Deinosuchus reconstruction , formerly on display at the AMNH
The most notable difference are the complex bones at the back of the throat of Deinosuchus which are arranged to slide past each other as the jaw opened and closed .
No such feature is seen in the giant phytosaur .
Still , even after the phytosaurs died out , crocodilians did not return to the water until about the Cretaceous period , many forms being absolutely terrifying land predators that have also long been extinct .
One of the early forms was Protosuchus , a small true crocodilian that represented a line that changed little during its tenure on the earth .
Reconstruction of Protosuchus
Outside of walking relatively high off the ground , Protosuchus had a foreshortened snout which was lower than its eyes , quite different from the arrangement in living crocodilians .
As seen in the Dwarf Caiman photograph , below , living crocodilians have their eye sockets on the top of their head , their eyes sticking out on the surface as well as the tip of their nose when they lie in wait for prey ( or just rest , for those who would like a less sensationalist tone ) .
Protosuchus , by contrast , has eyes to the sides of the head , even facing somewhat forward , showing that it was much more well - adapted to the land than any swamp or shallow pool .
Crocodilans did eventually enter the water , however , and their fossils are among the most common of any vertebrates .
Some , like New Jersey ’s very own Thoracosaurus , even became marine species , and a few varieties evolved crescent - shaped caudal fins on the ends of their tails to help them swim .
The common belief , however , is that crocodiles have always been crocodiles , “ changing little since the time of the dinosaurs , ” and such generalized half - truths do little justice to crocodilians or their distant phytosaur cousins .
Saber - toothed Nimravid does n’t sound quite the same …
Many museums have cases devoted to the great saber - toothed cats of epochs long gone , but it would take someone with more than just a cursory understanding of paleontology to sort out what is really being displayed .
Saber - teeth , or elongated canines , have evolved many times over in the course of mammalian history , showing up in herbivores like the living Musk Deer as well as extinct groups like the gorgonopsids .
Animals as different as a Musk Deer and Inostrancevia are fairly easy to tell apart , even for the non-specialist , but what about nimravids and the “ true ” saber - toothed cats ?
A diagram of the three ideas of Nimravid / Felid evolution .
James Whitcomb Riley is purported to have once written “ When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck , I call that bird a duck . ”
Unfortunately , this argument is quite popular ( even being utilized by the likes of prominent Intelligent Design advocate Michael Behe ) despite being very superficial and even vapid .
Needless to say , it does n’t apply to our discussion of Nimravids and true felid saber - toothed cats , but in decades past the two groups were lumped together .
< img src= ” ” alt = ” Skulls ” />
So , what makes a nimravid a nimravid ?
They look awfully like cats , so why are n’t they included in the Family Felidae ?
What makes such distinctions so difficult is that those investigating the skull of Smilodon and Eusmilus would have to be relatively well - versed in scientific jargon and anatomy in order to point out the most important differences .
While some nimravids ( like Eusmilus ) had large canines , their teeth alone are not diagnostic , and the original factors used by E.D.
Cope that differentiated these animals from “ true ” cats were the “ alisphenoid canal , postglenoid foramen , carotid , posterior lacerate , and condyloid foramina , postparietal foramina ” in the skull ( Hunt , 1987 ) .
The various canals and foramina listed dictate the paths of various nerves and blood vessels in the skull , and the arrangement in nimravid skulls seem to be more primitive compared with true felids .
Likewise , nimravids lack a two - chambered auditory bulla , which is a rounded bit of bone associated with the ear which true cats posess .
There are a few more obvious giveaways when dealing with some nimravids , however .
Nimravids equipped with long canines often have more cone - shaped canines than those of saber - toothed cats ( which are flatter in cross- section ) , and many have bony “ sheaths ” extending from the lower jaw into which the massive teeth fit .
Perhaps the most famous example of this kind of arrangement is the genus Barbourofelis , an animal that has actually been assigned to its own family as it is likely more closely related to true cats than nimravids ( Barbourofelis was previously classified as a nimravid ) .
Because of this ( and the fact that another cat - like offshoot , the marsupial Thylacosmilus ) the tooth - sheath should n’t be considered diagnostic of nimravids only , but it does give you a substantial clue that you ’re probably not dealing with an actual saber - toothed felid .
Despite these differences , it has often been difficult to differentiate the groups ( and debate still continues ) .
The diagram above , based upon one in Robert Hunt ’s 1987 paper “ Evolution of the aeluroid Carnivora .
Significance of auditory structure in the nimravid cat Dinictis , ” offers three simplified versions of the hypotheses about the relationships of nimravids and felids .
Initially it was thought that there was a progressive evolution from ancestor to descendant in a straight line , the nimravids being the direct ancestors to the saber - toothed cats .
This view does not represent how evolution truly works , however , and was found to be incorrect .
In its place came a view that nimravids and saber - toothed cats diverged from a common ancestor at about the same time , going off in separate directions .
This is better , and is more consonant with the data , but again it suggests that the line representing the common ancestor went extinct , either in becoming nimravids or saber - toothed cats .
What seems to be the case based upon current data is that the nimravids split off from a common ancestor somewhat before the saber - toothed cats , the line containing their common ancestor continuing its own evolution as both groups evolved .
Such a branching pattern is not unusual , and should even be expected , especially since there are living primates like tarsiers and lemurs that represent the overall kind of animal our ancestors once were , but still quite different and undergoing their own evolution alongside our own lineage .
The skull of Thylacosmilus , the marsupial answer to the saber - toothed cat , on display at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City .
Note how far back in the skull the roots of its massive canines extend .
The skull of Megantereon on display at the AMNH .
It was one of the “ true ” saber - toothed cats .
To complicate things even further , the skull or skeleton of the marsupial Thylacosmilus is also often thrown into the mix .
Although totally unrelated to nimravids or felid saber - toothed cats , the South - American Thylacosmilus converges closely on the appearance of the placental predators , although there are some important differences .
As can be seen from the above photographs , the eye of Thylacosmilus is entirely enclosed by bone on the side of the head , while in many felids and nimravids the eye socket is not entirely ringed - in by bone as if someone had bored a hole in the skull ( compare the skull of Thylacosmilus with that of Thylacoleo , above ) .
Further , the teeth of Thylacosmilus have very deep roots , going back in the skull almost over the eye .
Originally it was thought that the teeth faced outward , but this was based upon a distorted skull and later finds showed the true position of the long canines .
Hoplophoneus
Now that we have elimated Thylacosmilus from the running as another case of marsupial convergence , we must ask why the nimravids and felid saber - toothed cats are so close to each other in appearance .
While many of the instances I ’ve discussed previously have been instances of convergence , be it throughout the entire body or merely certain aspects of it , the nimravid - felid connection is a wonerful example of parallel evolution .
W.E. le Gros Clark provides an excellent summation of understanding the difference in his 1959 book The Antecedents of Man ;
From what has already been said , it is clear that , in assessing degrees of phylogenetic affinity , it is always necessary to take into account the factors of parallelism and convergence in the evolutionary development of related or unrelated groups .
These processes can lead to structural similarities , which , taken by themselves , may be misleading .
The term convergence is applied to the occasion in general proportions or in the development of analogous adaptations in response to similar functional needs .
But such similarities are superficial and easily distinguishable by a detailed comparative study of the animal as a whole .
For example , the resemblance in general appearance , even in a number of morphological features , of the Tasmanian wolf to a dog does not obscure the fact that in fundamental details of their anatomical construction they belong to quite different mammalian groups .
On the other hand , the potentialities of parallelism seem often to have been much overestimated by some anatomists , for this phenomenon has sometimes been invoked in support of extreme claims for independant evolution of groups which are almost certainly quite closely related .
We can agree with G.G. Simpson that the whole basis of parallelism depends on an initial similarity of structure and the inheritance of a common potentiality for reproducing homologous mutations , and that , this being so , the initial similarity and the homology of mutations themselves imply an evolutionary relationship .
Expressed in another way , it may be said that convergence increases resemblances ( which are , however , no more than superficial ) , while parallelism does not so much increase resemblances as maintain and perpetuate ( by development ‘ in parallel ’ so to speak ) similarities which have already existed ab initio in the genetic make - up of related types .
Thus , ‘ closeness of parallelism tends to be proportional to closeness of affinity . ’
There are a few problems with this reasoning , namely that it seems to give credence to an almost pre-determined genetic course for the lines to evolve in parallel , although le Gros Clark makes it clear in the work that he does not support in any way the notion of orthogenesis .
Still , the passage makes the important distinction that in order to undergo parallel evolution groups need to be somewhat closely related and already bear similar structures , evolution preserving many of the similar traits instead of working to the same end from two disparate points .
In the case of the nimravids and the felids it seems that they evolved from a common ancestor which was probably taken to carnivory .
Nimravids branched off earlier , being more “ primitive , ” while the felids came off the same line ( or a very similar one ) after it had accumulated a few more evolutionary changes .
Indeed , even if form seems to be static or change little , it ’s hard for me to believe that designs are not slightly adapted this way or that as if the creature was an already perfect creation not influenced by changing ecological circumstances .
Still , it seems that the nimravids and felids were adapted in similar ways , their ancestral lines probably possessing at least semi-retractable claws , long and sharp canines ( although not long to the extreme like its descendants ) , a shortened face , and a developed carnissal shear .
It is really not that difficult to change a civet - like creature ( or in the case of our hypothetical common ancestor , a creature a bit closer to a cat ) into a saber - toothed Smilodon , the changes being modifications of existing structures more than the creation of something entirely new out of nowhere .
In fact , the vertebrate tetrapod skeleton has proven to be quite versatile , and most of the major bones in any vertebrate skeleton can be found to correspond with those in another vertebrate , allowing us to compare rhinos with ceratopsians , dromeosaurs with birds , cats with dogs , ichthyosaurs with cetaceans , and humans with primates .
Of constraints and convergence
I hope that is has become clear why convergence is such a strong theme in the evolution of vertebrates .
At this point in the history of evolution , vertebrates have had a chance to fill nearly every niche imaginable in a large variety of habitats over millions of years , and so common themes are bound to arise .
When groups return to the ocean , the environmental constraints shape them in ways peculiar to their new way of life that would not be advantageous in other situtations ( i.e. being such a large aquatic animal that you ’d be crushed by your own weight if you came onto land ) .
When mammals become adapted to be predators , their dentition and morphology must be altered if they are to be successful hunters , carnivores past and present showing some suprising similarities despite being only distantly related .
Even when taking to the air , laws of physics still apply , and natural selection often works through physical and chemical constraints to produce new forms .
It is of little doubt that the tetrapod design is a versatile one , retaining its overall character through the various changes that it has endured .
Indeed , even when a lineage dies out and may seem gone forever , there is no law that says a similar situtation in the future will not produce forms that may be strikingly familiar , even if such organisms are not directly related to the last group that filled their new niche .
Evolution has produced “ endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful ” and will continue to do so long after I am gone , but random mutation / natural selection do not work in isolation from the rest of the natural world .
Evolution has produced so many amazing creatures precisely because ecology , physics , and chemistry have offered up both opportunities and challenges , and I only regret that I will not be able to witness the familiar and unfamiliar about what is swimming in the seas , flying in the air , or stalking the land 500 million years from now .
Food poisoning bacteria become super - virulent in space , according to a study of salmonella that spent 12 days orbiting the Earth on the space shuttle Atlantis .
The research raises fears that diseases boosted by low gravity could pose unexpected medical problems on future long - haul space journeys or for astronauts on a proposed future moon base .
It is the first study to examine the effect of space flight on the virulence of a pathogen .
" Given the proposed increase in both duration and distance from Earth for future manned space flight missions - including lunar colonisation and a mission to Mars - the risk for in - flight infectious diseases will be increased , " said Cheryl Nickerson at Arizona State University .
Her team sent vials of salmonella bacteria into orbit on Atlantis 's 12 - day mission in September last year .
They kept bacteria from the same strain in conditions as close to the space shuttle as possible on Earth .
When they fed the samples to different groups of mice they found that the bacteria that had been in space were nearly three times as likely to kill the animals .
" Since spaceflight involves a number of environmental changes we do not know the exact part of spaceflight that caused the change in virulence or other phenotypes we observed in our experiment , " said Professor Nickerson , " However , our collective data strongly suggests it is the low fluid shear growth environment , where turbulence and fluid action is minimal , that plays a major role in the response of salmonella to spaceflight . "
The team also compared the pattern of gene expression in the space bacteria and those that had stayed on the ground .
They found that the expression level in 167 different genes had been altered , they report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" This experiment is a ' first of its kind ' in spaceflight biological study .
It is the first study to examine the effect of spaceflight on the virulence of a pathogen , and the first to obtain the entire gene expression response of a bacterium to spaceflight , " said Prof Nickerson .
Although the team cannot be sure that the same increase in virulence occurs in other pathogens , the results will concern those planning future missions in which astronauts spend extended periods in space .
President Bush has committed the US to returning astronauts to the moon by 2020 and setting up a permanent moon base .
This would require much more time in zero gravity and low gravity conditions which would mean more opportunities for astronauts to fall ill .
Two weeks ago a government advisory committee said the UK should reconsider its ban on human space flight and begin a crewed space programme .
The committee , convened by the British National Space Centre , said there would be huge scientific , cultural and economic benefits to sending humans into space .
Building up an astronaut corps from scratch would cost £ 50 m to £ 75 m over five years .
It ’s been a short while since I came back from IWOMP but I would still like to share some of the news and experiences I have brought back from there .
It ’s been a really great experience for me , both at the conference and in the city of Beijing – which is always worth a trip , if you ask me .
So here they go :
Tasking is the next big thing in OpenMP 3.0 .
And it really is big .
I had the opportunity to talk and think this through in multiple sessions with many of the people involved in designing that feature and even play with a reference implementation for a bit ( thanks to the UPC - people at Barcelona for that ) and it really does take OpenMP to a whole new level .
New classes of applications are able to be parallelized with OpenMP without much of a problem ( e.g. recursive algorithms or other , more irregular ones ) .
The last details of tasking are being finalized at this time but this is the one feature that will most definitely make it into OpenMP 3.0 .
Very exciting : grin : !
The target date for a release of OpenMP 3.0 is the time of the Supercomputing conference this year , which is November 10th - 16th .
Of course , this release date is not yet confirmed but the schedule has been set .
Will be very interesting to see what other features make it in until that date .
A couple of new members have joined the OpenMP ARB recently ( the ARB is the Architecture Review Board , which basically controls the fate of the everything related to the specification ) , the most prominent ones being Microsoft , AMD and Cray .
This pushes the list of member organizations up to 16 – which are in case you did not know ( in no particular order ) : ASCI cOMPunity EPCC NASA STMicroelectronics / Portland Group Fujitsu HP IBM Intel NEC SGI Sun RWTH Aachen University Microsoft AMD Cray Quite a long list of supporters now , do n’t you think ?
Two talks at this conference have used the JOMP - implementation as basis for their research .
This is an implementation of OpenMP on top of Java originally done by Mark Bull from EPCC , but has been unmaintained for some time .
As can be seen by these talks , there is obviously some demand for OpenMP on Java , though .
GCC 4.2 . has recently been released , including OpenMP - support for the very first time .
This should help mainstream adaption , as it adds another compiler to the growing list of compilers that can handle OpenMP .
I have also been able to do some interviews with a lot of very interesting people , more on that as soon as I have managed to type them up * sigh * .
I have probably forgotten to put down many other things I should be saying here , but I am sure I will remember them sooner or later and just post them then .
As you can see , although it may not look like it from the outside ( e.g. by judging from the sorry state of the OpenMP - homepage ) , the community is busy and there are exciting developments ahead .
This is probably the only one that would get me up without a fuss ...
An alarm clock that wakes you up with the smell and sizzle of cooking bacon .

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has just released a 319 - page report titled " OECD Communications Outlook 2007 " ( PDF ) .
As you may have guessed by the title and the size , it 's a comprehensive look at the state of the telecommunications industry around the world .
Of particular interest is the section on broadband deployment , which tracks usage , deployment , and pricing trends over the past couple of years .
Overall , broadband has become faster and cheaper , especially in countries where there are a large number of cable and DSL providers .
Pricing
DSL prices fell on average by 19 percent from September 2005 to October 2006 , while comparable speeds jumped by 29 percent .
Cable broadband also got cheaper , dropping 16 percent in price while getting 27 percent faster .
Data source : " OECD Communications Outlook 2007 "
The OECD ranked countries both on affordability of broadband packages and price per megabit .
Somewhat surprisingly , the US is at the cheap end of the spectrum when it comes to the range of prices , coming in at number four behind Sweden , Denmark , and Switzerland .
As of October 2006 , the cost per month of broadband service in the US ranged from $ 15.93 at the low end to $ 191.20 at the opposite extreme .
Swedish broadband ranged from $ 10.79 to $ 46.74 , Denmark from $ 11.11 to $ 105.10 , and Switzerland 's from $ 12.53 to $ 55.65 .
If AT&T 's hard - to - find $ 10 - per- month DSL were considered , the standing of the US would surely improve .
Keep in mind that in the US , that $ 15.93 is likely to buy you a 768 K bps / 128 Kbps DSL connection , while the $ 19.87 per month minimum in Japan will result in much faster service .
Data source : " OECD Communications Outlook 2007 "
On the other hand , when the metric switched to cost per megabit per second , the US did not fare so well , slipping to 12th out of the 30 countries ranked .
In the best - case scenario , broadband in the US cost $ 3.18 / Mbps but could be as expensive as $ 20.74 / Mbps .
As one might expect , given their high speeds and low broadband costs , Japan and Korea were at the top of the list .
Japanese broadband is as cheap as $ 0.22 / Mbps , while Korea is $ 0.42 / Mbps .
Sweden performed very well in the cost per megabit category too , with prices as low as $ 0.35 / Mbps .
Competition is key
The OECD notes that the broadband situation is better in areas with multiple broadband options .
" Price decreases and improved services have been the most marked in markets characterized by intense competition , " says the report .
" Competition may be the product of regulatory intervention , as in the case of local loop unbundling , or may be the result of new infrastructure - based competition . "
The countries with the lowest cost per megabit per second are generally characterized by two things : a significant fiber infrastructure and a healthy amount of competition .
In Japan and Korea , for instance , fiber is widespread , resulting in the fastest residential broadband speeds available anywhere .
In Europe , the regulatory environment allows consumers in many countries to choose from any number of DSL and cable providers .
When Nobel Intent correspondent Chris Lee moved into his flat in the Netherlands , he had no less than three cable and three DSL providers competing for his business , including one company — KPN — that offered both .
France is another country with abundant broadband competition — and it has the fifth - cheapest broadband in the world in terms of price per Mbps .
In contrast , the Federal Communications Commission 's policy of deregulation has left most consumers faced with duopolies ( at best ) and de facto monopolies ( I live over 20,000 feet from the nearest DSLAM in Chicago , so DSL is n't an option for me ) .
The situation is such that the nation as a whole is a broadband laggard , according to one FCC commissioner .
As a result of the FCC 's policies , competition based on price and speed is spotty at best , and fiber deployments are in their early stages .
The FCC 's vision of competition entails different broadband modes ( e.g. , cable versus DSL ) rather than different providers offering the same type of service , which is why there have been rumblings about an " open access " requirement for the upcoming 700MHz auction .
The FCC is on the wrong track , according to the OECD 's reasoning .
" Regulatory decisions across most OECD countries to allow the fixed PSTN 's incumbents local loop to be unbundled has been a major factor in the development of OECD communications markets and stimulating the development and competitive provision of broadband offers , " explains the report .
The need for speed
If speed is your thing , your best bet is to live in Japan and Korea , both of which offer 100 M bps speed , or move into Verizon 's FiOS coverage area in the US ; according to the OECD , Verizon 's fiber offering is the third - fastest residential service in the world .
Cable providers in six countries now offer speeds of greater than 20 Mbps , with another 17 countries offering cable Internet speeds of 10 M bps or faster .
Fiber is becoming more popular worldwide , says the OECD , and not just due to a desire to offer faster speeds .
The big driving force is bandwidth : the triple - play is not just a US phenomenon , and broadband providers around the world want enough bandwidth to be able to offer a solid HDTV lineup .
The study points out that while many of the fast networks under study use ADSL2 + for last - mile connectivity , it 's not enough to support multiple HDTV streams .
As a result , fiber - to - the - premises deployments like Verizon 's are becoming increasingly popular worldwide .
Overall , the OECD 's report paints a positive picture for much of the developed world when it comes to broadband .
Things are looking up in emerging economies too , with what the OECD calls the BRICS economies ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) seeing significant growth in broadband penetration .
BRICS countries are among the fastest - growing ICT ( information and communication technology ) markets in the world , with their share of global ICT spending doubling between 2000 and 2006 .
Broadband still costs significantly more in those markets , both in terms of monthly service fees and cost per megabit , but the outlook is good there .
New Century has been hit by problems in the sub - prime market
New Century sought protection from creditors after it was forced by its backers to repurchase billions of dollars worth of bad loans .
The company said it would immediately cut 3,200 jobs , more than half of its workforce , as a result of the move .
Sub - prime lenders , who target customers with poor credit histories , have suffered from a downturn in the market .
Shares in New Century were suspended in March on fears the company may be heading for bankruptcy , following a sharp rise in people defaulting on their loans .
We suspect the problem in the sub - prime area is just the tip of the iceberg for the mortgage market as a whole
David Shulman , University of California Anderson Report
New Century 's creditors include investment bank Goldman Sachs and Britain 's Barclays bank .
The company said it planned to sell its loan servicing operations to Carrington Capital Management for $ 139 m ( £ 70 m ) , subject to bankruptcy approval .
Barclays deal
Leading US economists warned on Monday that the current tide of defaults in the sub - prime mortgage sector would continue to weigh on the US 's slowing housing market .
" We suspect the problem in the sub - prime area is just the tip of the iceberg for the mortgage market as a whole , " said senior economist David Shulman , in the University of California 's quarterly Anderson Report .
" For all practical purposes , the sub - prime market is in the process of shutting down . "
The slowing US housing market , coupled with rising US interest rates , has meant fewer sub - prime customers have been able to keep up with mortgage and loan repayments .
In a separate development , Barclays Bank said it was buying US sub - prime lender EquiFirst for $ 76 m - substantially less than the $ 225 m the UK firm first offered for the group .
Barclays , which is in merger talks with Dutch bank ABN Amro , said the lower price reflected growing problems in the US housing and sub - prime markets .
However , a spokesman for Barclays said : " We think EquiFirst is positioned for profitable growth . "
Well , the long wait is nearly over .
Microsoft 's elephantine parturition has produced an heir .
Last week the company distributed ' Release Candidate 1 ' ( RC1 ) of Vista , the new incarnation of Windows , to about 5 million favoured customers .
Think of it as the final beta of the software .
Microsoft says it is still on course to deliver a version to corporate customers in November , followed by a consumer release to high - street dealers in January .
Microsoft also released details of US pricing for the new operating system .
The ' Home Basic ' version will cost $ 199 .
' Home Premium ' comes at $ 239 .
' Vista Business ' is priced at $ 299 .
And ' Vista Ultimate ' weighs in at a whopping $ 399 .
Security vulnerabilities come free with all versions .
There is also to be a ' Vista Starter ' edition which will be marketed to people in poor countries in a futile attempt to stop them pirating Vista Ultimate and selling it on the streets of Shanghai , Bangkok and Singapore for a dollar a pop .
There will be a predictable ( and expensive ) PR campaign to coincide with the final release of the software .
But in Redmond , Washington , the Microsoft campus , the only sounds to be heard are of people muttering ' Never Again ' .
For the Vista story has turned out to be an interminable corporate nightmare .
The system is two years behind schedule , and in its released version will be only a shadow of what was envisaged when it was first given the code name ' Longhorn ' .
It has left behind it a trail of corporate wreckage and prompted a major reorganisation of the company 's senior management .
Jim Allchin , one of the company 's most hardline ideologues ( and the guy whose internal memo about ' leveraging ' the Windows monopoly probably triggered the anti-trust suit in 1998 ) , announced that he would go when Vista shipped .
And even as RC1 was released , it was announced that Brian Valentine , Microsoft 's operating systems chief , is leaving to join Amazon.com .
According to the Seattle Times , Valentine 's departure is amicable , but his exit signals the end of an era .
The Vista saga has two interesting lessons for the computer business .
It raises , for example , the question of whether this way of producing software products of this complexity has reached its natural limit .
Microsoft is an extremely rich , resourceful company - and yet the task of creating and shipping Vista stretched it to breaking point .
A lesser company would have buckled under the strain .
And yet while Microsoft engineers were trudging through their death march , the open source community shipped a series of major upgrades to the Linux operating system .
How can hackers , scattered across the globe , working for no pay , linked only by the net and shared values , apparently outperform the smartest software company on the planet ?
Microsofties retort that Vista is much more complex than Linux .
But it 's not the whole story .
It could be that purely networked enterprises like the Linux project are actually a better way of producing very complex products , much as Toyota 's ' lean ' production system is the best way of making cars .
The difficulties in developing Vista stemmed from its monolithic structure and the need for ' backwards compatibility ' , ie ensuring that software used by customers on older versions of Windows will work under Vista .
This vast accumulation of legacy applications acts like an anchor on innovation .
The Vista trauma has convinced some Microsoft engineers that they will have to adopt a radically different approach .
Its outlines are already visible .
It involves , firstly , abandoning the idea of an operating system as a monolith and breaking it into modules , and , secondly , adopting ' virtualisation ' - a key technology that enables a single machine to run several operating systems ( or modules thereof ) in parallel - to deal with the backwards compatibility problem .
Virtualisation is the Next Big Thing in computing , and the lesson of Vista is that Microsoft will have to embrace it to survive in the operating system market .
The trouble ( for Microsoft ) is that the leader in the technology is Xensource , a spin - out from Cambridge University 's Computer Laboratory .
And here 's where the delicious ironies begin .
For not only is the lab housed in the William Gates Building ( in recognition of a donation by the Microsoft boss ) , but Xen 's core technology is - wait for it !
- open source , which in Redmond is still viewed as the spawn of the communist devil .
In due course , an accommodation will be reached - and Xensource will go through the roof .
If you were thinking of investing , however , I 'm afraid you 've missed the boat .
John Doerr , the world 's greatest venture capitalist ( Sun Microsystems , Compaq , Lotus , Intuit , Genentech , Millennium , Netscape , Amazon and Google , inter alia ) , got there before you .
In this business , you have to get up early if you want to get into bed .
Larry Flynt , who once ran for the White House under the slogan " a smut peddler who cares " , yesterday sought to spread his own brand of love around in Washington by offering cash rewards for tales of sexual scandal .
In a full - page advertisement in yesterday 's Washington Post , Mr Flynt , the publisher of Hustler magazine , offered a $ 1 m ( £ 500,000 ) reward for anyone willing to tell all about their affair with an elected official - and provide proof .
" Have you had a sexual encounter with a current member of the United States Congress or a high - ranking government official ? " asks the ad .
" Can you provide documented evidence of illicit sexual or intimate relations with a congressperson , senator or other prominent officeholder ?
Those willing to betray their partners - or , more likely , exes - were invited to contact Mr Flynt or Hustler by a free - phone number or email .
Mr Flynt , who over the last 30 years has tried to use his pornography empire as a platform to campaign for free speech , is no stranger to the ways of Washington .
Yesterday 's ad marks the second time in a decade that he has dredged Washington in search of scandal .
In 1998 , at the height of the campaign to impeach Bill Clinton for lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky , Mr Flynt ran a similar ad in the Post .
Then as now , Mr Flynt was a sworn enemy of the Republican party .
In his last set of ads , he sought to dig up dirt on the Republican members of Congress who were leading the impeachment campaign against President Clinton .
He had only middling success .
Although Mr Flynt claimed at the time to have the goods on up to a dozen prominent Republicans , the ad campaign helped to bring down only one .
Robert Livingston - a congressman from Louisiana who was tipped to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker of the house and had demanded that President Clinton resign because of his conduct with Ms Lewinsky - abruptly retired after learning that Mr Flynt was about to reveal that he had also had an affair .
But Mr Flynt could have some competition this time .
Deborah Jeane Palfrey , who is accused of running a prostitution ring that serviced some of the wealthiest and most powerful men of Washington , has also threatened an exposé .
Ms Palfrey hopes to put pressure on her clientele to provide donations for her legal defence .
So far , she has claimed only one scalp : Randall Tobias , who had led President Bush 's campaign against HIV - Aids .
Mr Tobias stepped down in April .
Fortunes of Flynt
Larry Flynt is arguably America 's most celebrated pornographer .
The 64 - year - old has built a chain of strip clubs , along with an explicit magazine , Hustler , into a business empire .
Left paralysed below the waist by a shooting 30 years ago , he is also a self - styled defender of free speech , a campaign he occasionally pursues through bizarre acts , such as appearing in court wearing a US flag as a nappy .
He won a landmark case in 1988 against the late Reverend Jerry Falwell , a force of the Christian right , who sued him for $ 50 m for a cartoon about losing his virginity .
The city that never sleeps wants to become just like the city that always peeps .
New York City plans to install more than 100 cameras in Lower Manhattan by 2008 , as part of a surveillance architecture that would also wire thousands of public and private cameras into a central command hub .
The idea is to would mimic the ubiquitous and all - seeing camera and traffic monitoring system in London , according to the New York Times .
The Lower Manhattan Security Initiative , as the plan is called , will resemble London 's so - called Ring of Steel , an extensive web of cameras and roadblocks designed to detect , track and deter terrorists .
British officials said images captured by the cameras helped track suspects following the London subway bombings in 2005 and after the car bomb plots last month .
If New York City succeeds in getting the estimated $ 90 million to build the full network , it will include not only license plate readers but 3,000 public and private security cameras , a coordination center staffed by the police and private security officers , and movable roadblocks .
" This area is very critical to the economic lifeblood of this nation , " New York 's police commissioner , Raymond Kelly , said in an interview last week .
" We want to make it less vulnerable . "
Link .
Woe be it for this blog to sound conspiratorial , but should a police department that arrested a guy for having a chalk printer on his bike and infiltrated peace groups to create dossiers on them ahead of a political convention really be trusted with a network of thousands of video cameras ?
Think of the storage costs for all those dossiers ...

Increased security makes life in Baghdad extremely restricted
As my plane made the steep , tactical descent to Baghdad airport , I was thinking about those much debated American benchmarks and realised that , almost subconsciously , I had developed my own .
Mine are , of course , deeply unscientific and highly personal - if not slightly eccentric - but they help .
The first is the width of our street .
When I first came to Baghdad just after Americans troops had marched in four years ago , we lived and worked in a normal street .
We walked around freely - even at night - taking just basic security precautions .
But this did not last long .
The American military floundered , not knowing what to do after taking Baghdad because it did not have a serious plan for the day after declaring victory .
That let members of the former regime seize the initiative , launching a well planned campaign of guerrilla warfare which also attracted Islamic extremists .
So over the next two years , our lives in Baghdad became ever more restricted .
A friend of mine is trying to persuade members of his own family to move abroad for safety - such is the fear of violence in this city
Our street was sealed off and guarded , and it became increasingly narrow as each building had huge concrete blast - barriers placed in front of it .
By the time I completed my last tour of duty in the autumn of 2005 , it seemed that every possible step had been taken to protect us from attack .
But not so .
On my return here two weeks ago , I discovered our street was even narrower because yet more blast - barriers had been brought in .
It is now also much shorter , cut in half by a huge metal gate .
And everywhere there are security cameras .
Living here is deeply claustrophobic .
What had previously felt like a reasonably relaxed prison , has now been transformed into a maximum security jail whose inmates - in other words us - are rarely let out .
The board we use in the office to list shootings , bombings and other violent incidents is now too small - we need something bigger
Even government ministries have now been added to the long list of forbidden territory .
Where once we could go to spend time speaking with top members of the Iraqi government , we now fear to tread because of the threat of being kidnapped .
And that is because at the end of May , a British consultant and his four British bodyguards were seized by gunmen from inside the finance ministry in Baghdad .
Their fate is still unknown .
The incident says so much about the current state of the Iraqi security forces .
The kidnappers were all wearing police uniforms and drove up in police vehicles - clear evidence of the involvement of militia groups within the police force or , at the very least , collusion between the two .
Despair and grief
My second benchmark is the face of an Iraqi friend here .
Over the past four years , I have seen his face evolve into a picture of dejection .
But now there seems to be something even worse : despair .
He is trying to persuade members of his own family to move abroad for safety even if it means being apart for years .
Such is the fear of both random and sectarian violence in this city .
But this is minor league compared to what our colleagues at an international news agency have been through .
A few days ago , I attended a wake for two of their Iraqi staff - a photographer and a driver - who were killed in Baghdad in July .
An American Apache helicopter opened fire on them .
The US military says it was engaged in a fire - fight with insurgents at the time .
In total , the agency has now lost seven staff since the invasion .
The photographer was just 22 years old and an exhibition of some of his most powerful images had been put on display for us to see .
Most of his short professional life had been spent chronicling just one thing : the violence tearing apart his own country .
And that brings me to my third benchmark , the board in our office .
Every day it is used to compile a list of the shootings , bombings and other violent incidents we hear about around the country .
Last week we decided the board was too small .
We needed something bigger .
Recipe for war
My fourth and final benchmark is a more direct look at how the American troops now operate on the ground .
Thousands of volunteers have been stepping forward and offering to protect their own neighbourhoods
It derives from a brief trip we made with General Raymond Odierno , the second most senior American military commander in Iraq .
A great bull of a man with a shaved head , he had some very specific people he wanted us to meet .
They are known as the volunteer security forces or civilian guards .
They have sprung up in the wake of the surge of American troops across central Iraq this year , which has had some success in quelling the violence in some of the most troubled regions .
Thousands of volunteers - all Sunni Arabs - have been stepping forward and offering to protect their own neighbourhoods .
Some are former insurgents who have switched sides .
Others are young unemployed men who have had enough of the violence .
It is a remarkable turn - around that so many now want to co-operate with the Americans , the very people they had previously been trying to kill .
The Americans have been eager to sign them up and give them contracts - 20,000 apparently so far .
In the Sunni district of Baghdad we went to , the volunteers are filling a void because there are no regular police there as the police are mostly Shia .
While the Americans are enthusiastic about this growing force , the majority Shia population is becoming increasingly alarmed .
They fear that a Sunni militia of dubious loyalty to the government is being created across the Sunni heartlands .
And if the Americans hand responsibility to them and then pull back , it could be they have created the perfect recipe for all - out civil war .

When some people think of Global Warming , a vision of comfortable winters , more days at the beach , and less sweaters comes to mind .
For those living away from coastal regions , the concerns of hurricanes or sea levels is non-existent .
Out of sight , out of mind .
The realities are that climate change will affect each and every one of us .
From the ways our communities rely on food produced in other states and nations ; to the costs of energy and sourcing of water .
But it gets worse .
Much worse .
We now present to you The Top 5 Nasty Creatures Getting Stronger Due To Climate Change .
Some of them seem straight out of science fiction .
Brain - Eating Killer Amoeba
Back in grade school we all thought amoeba were the innocent fat blobs sharing space with paramecium and hydras under the microscope .
No longer .
6
Americans have died this year , all young men , from a strain of amoeba that attaches itself to the inside of your nose and quickly burrows through your brain .
Scientists are considering this death toll a spike ; since only 23 people in the US were killed between 1995 and 2004 .
“ This is a heat - loving amoeba .
As water temperatures go up , it does better , ” specialist Michael Beach said .
“ In future decades , as temperatures rise , we ’d expect to see more cases . ”
Great .
Keep plugging your nose when going underwater .
So far , Florida , Arizona , and Texas have had the most cases .

The False Black Widow Spider
As if the real Black Widow spider was n’t enough to deal with ; there ’s an impostor out there moving across the warming United Kingdom and sending grown men to the hospital .
Generally , this little guy would n’t cause so much trouble , since the UK ’s cold winters kept populations in check .
However , thanks to warmer temperatures , their numbers have rocketed into the hundreds of thousands and spreading north to new locales .
Apparently , the pain is more severe than a bee or wasp sting and can lead burning sensations , inflammation , and a couple days in the hospital .
Worse , they love to hide in gloves or other clothing accessories and will bite almost immediately .
Great .

Deadly Irukandji Jellyfish
Australia has some incredible beaches and swimming / snorkeling areas .
Millions come every year to enjoy the Great Barrier Reef and other popular marine haunts .
Sure , sharks have always been a concern , but a new deadly organism is spreading and raising alarm in areas once thought safe for recreational activities .
Call the Irukandji — this nasty , translucent jellyfish ( about the size of a thumbnail ) is one of the most toxic creatures on the planet .
Due to warming oceans , the jellyfish are now 400 miles further south from their previously known habitat .
We do n’t want a perception to spread that every Sunshine Coast beach is a killing field , said Daniel Gschwind , the head of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council .
I ’ll stick to a pool , thanks .

The Disease - Bearing Mosquito , Tick , and Mouse
Your standard nasty critters are getting upgrades in the form of deadly diseases and life - altering viruses .
Carriers like mosquitoes , ticks , mice are surviving warmer winters and expanding their range .
Malaria is reaching higher elevations , Cholera is spreading in warm waters , and Dengue fever and Lyme disease are moving north .
The West Nile virus has infected more than 21,000 people in the United States and Canada and killed more than 800 .
As one biologist said , “ Things we projected to occur in 2080 are happening in 2006 .
What we did n’t get is how fast and how big it is , and the degree to which the biological systems would respond .
Our mistake was in underestimation . ”

Vibrio Vulnificus — The Flesh Eating Bug
A flesh - eating bacterium that normally makes its home in the warmer waters of the Gulf of Mexico is now headed into the cooler Northern areas of the world .
According to MSNBC , recent tests in Germany showed that Vibrio vulnificus was present in more than nine out of 10 samples of Baltic Sea water .
The microscopic marine bug enters the human system through a cut or scrape ( and even through ingestion ) and devours flesh along the way .
About 50 % of cases are fatal ; with patients dying within the first 48 hours of infection .
FEC complaint alleges Rudy got ' soft money ' from NYT Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday September 25 , 2007
Print This Email This Update : Audio of Giuliani contradicts campaign 's denial of inappropriate discount Rudy Giuliani 's presidential campaign effectively received an illegal " soft money " contribution of more than $ 77,000 from the New York Times when he purchased a newspaper advertisement for a discounted rate , alleges a liberal blogger in a complaint to the Federal Election Commission .
The formal FEC complaint from blogger Lane Hudson alleges Giuliani received a " corporate soft money contribution in excess " of campaign finance limits .
It is the latest fallout from MoveOn.org 's " General Betray Us " ad , which ran in the New York Times Sept. 10 .
Hudson 's salvo against one of the ad's harshest critics came a day after the Times finally acknowledged it had charged MoveOn a discounted rate for the ad , in violation of the paper 's policies .
The ad ran on the first day of Gen. David Petraeus 's congressional testimony .
Four days later , Giuliani took out his own ad in the Times attacking MoveOn and attempting to link the liberal anti-war group with prominent Democrats .
The former New York mayor demanded the same rate the Times charged MoveOn , $ 64,575 .
Since the pricing discrepancy was revealed Sunday , MoveOn has said it will wire the Times the difference between the rate it was charged , which is meant for ads that can run on any day anywhere in the paper , and the $ 142,083 the group should have paid to guarantee its full - page ad would run that Monday .
Giuliani's campaign has refused to make up the difference , in violation of federal law , Hudson alleges .
" According to the New York Times ' own policy , Mr. Giuliani should have paid the fixed - date rate instead of the standby rate , " Hudson writes in his FEC complaint .
" Therefore , the difference , $ 77,083 is an in - kind corporate contribution , which far exceeds the limits allowed by law . "
Giuliani's campaign did not immediately return RAW STORY 's call requesting comment .
But a camaign spokesperson told the Washington Post that Giuliani would not be giving the Times any more money because the campaign did not specify on which day it wanted the ad to run .
An audio clip of Giuliani talking to reporters on the day before his ad appeared contradicts that claim .
" I call upon the New York Times to give us the same rate ... tomorrow to print an ad that will obviously take the oposite view , " Giuliani says in the recording from Sept. 13 . FEC regulations allow anyone to file a complaint , which the commission evaluates to determine whether a full investigation is warranted .
Giuliani has 15 days to respond to the complaint , but any action or investigation by the FEC remains confidential until a case is resolved .
Hudson 's complaint , filed Monday , is the second he has filed this year against a Republican candidate .
In August , he filed a complaint against Fred Thompson , who formally announced his presidential bid this month .
Hudson said the actor improperly raised and spent money beyond the " testing the waters " threshold that governs presidential exploratory committees .
The complaints were fist posted on Hudson 's blog News For The Left .
Hudson was the first blogger to publish e-mails between Former Rep.
Mark Foley and underage congressional pages ; his role in exposing the Foley controversy got him fired from the Human Rights Campaign .
The MoveOn ad became a focal point for Republicans in the hours and days after it ran , giving GOP lawmakers ammo to attack Democrats rather than question Petraeus and leading to a symbolic Senate resolution condemning its message .
The American Conservative Union filed its own FEC complaint over the ad Sept. 14 .
It remains unclear whether the FEC will take action against MoveOn , which now has fully paid its bill , or Giuliani 's campaign , which has not .

Local Shelters take many vets of Iraq , Afghan wars
Also housing those from earlier eras NORTHAMPTON -- After Kevin returned from Iraq , he spent most nights lying awake in his Army barracks in Hawaii , clutching a 9 mm handgun under his pillow , bracing for an attack that never came .
His fits of sleep brought nightmares of the wounded and dying troops whom Kevin , a combat medic , had treated over 16 months of suicide attacks and roadside bombings .
He kept thinking about an attack that killed 13 of his comrades .
He hated himself for having survived .
Soon he was drinking so heavily that the Army discharged him .
He moved back in with his parents in Narragansett , R.I. , and drank even more , until they asked him to leave .
Less than two years after he returned , Kevin became one of a growing number of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars who are now homeless .
" I lived in my car , at the Wal - Mart parking lot , " said Kevin , who asked that his last name not be published because he is considering reenlisting .
He has been staying at a homeless shelter in Northampton since early July .
Kevin 's tailspin encapsulates a little - researched consequence of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
As more troops return from deployments , social workers and advocates expect the number of the homeless to increase , flooding the nation 's veterans ' shelters , which are already overwhelmed by homeless veterans from other wars .
" It 's a major problem that 's not going away anytime soon , " said Cheryl Beversdorf , director of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans in Washington , who estimates that hundreds , perhaps thousands of troops who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan are living in shelters .
Kevin 's story illustrates the lagging response of overburdened government agencies to the needs of troops returning from wars , said Jack Downing , who runs the shelter where Kevin and four other veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are staying .
" The general public believes that when a vet comes home , he 's well taken care of , " Downing said .
" That 's a horrible misunderstanding . "
No one keeps track of how many of the 750,000 troops who have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since 2001 are homeless .
Peter Dougherty , director of homeless programs for the federal Department of Veterans Affairs , said 300 veterans of these conflicts have asked the agency for help finding shelter in the last 30 months .
Beversdorf 's agency has helped 1,200 homeless veterans of the current wars .
This reflects only a fraction of the total number of homeless Iraq and Afghanistan veterans , said Amy Fairweather , who works with Iraq war veterans at Swords to Plowshares , a private organization based in San Francisco that assists veterans .
Last year , her agency 's five shelters in California helped 250 such veterans , she said .
She said it is impossible to know how many veterans have not asked for help and are " crashing on their friends ' couch , in a car , in a park . . . [ or are ] people who live in a church . "
Social workers say combat trauma is responsible for the plunge into homelessness for many veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan .
Unable to cope , veterans turn to alcohol and drugs , lose their jobs and the support of their family and friends , and end up on the streets , said Larry Fitzmaurice , whose homeless shelter in Boston is currently providing beds to seven veterans of the Iraq war .
Mental problems " really interfere with the ability to maintain a stable relationship , to maintain a secure employment , " Fairweather said .
Army studies have found that up to 30 percent of soldiers coming home from Iraq suffer from depression , anxiety , or posttraumatic stress disorder .
Dougherty and other specialists who work with homeless veterans say the pattern of homelessness has changed .
The approximately 70,000 veterans of the war in Vietnam who became homeless usually spent between five and 10 years trying to readjust to civilian life before winding up in the streets , he said .
Veterans of today 's wars who become homeless end up with no place to live within 18 months after they return from war , according to Dougherty .
Dougherty said the Department of Veterans Affairs is supposed to recognize and address combat trauma and help the new generation of veterans readjust in civilian life .
But he acknowledged that many veterans " become homeless because there is not a support system . "
" There are more services available to veterans returning today , but I still do n't think there 's enough , " said Allison Alaimo , who works at the shelter for homeless veterans operated by Massachusetts Veterans Inc. in Worcester .
Alaimo said her shelter has hosted a few veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001 .
Joe , who also stays at the Northampton shelter , sustained a traumatic brain injury during the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , when he manned a 155 mm howitzer for the Third Infantry Division .
" My first time killing somebody was very devastating , " he recalled , saying that he fired at a minivan carrying a family of 12 unarmed civilians .
" Just one woman survived . "
Joe said he spent his first year back drinking , abusing drugs , and going AWOL from his military base at Fort Stewart , Ga .
He said he was trying to shut off the horrible fits of screaming and violence brought on by his brain injury and his memories of the most disturbing moments of his war .
" Two months after I 'm back from Iraq I 'm shooting heroin , " said Joe , staring into space at the shelter , where he has been staying for three months .
Since he was discharged from the Army in 2004 , he has been living in shelters and abandoned houses and staying with relatives and friends .
He stole and dealt drugs to support his habit .
He asked that his full name not be used because he has a criminal record .
Kevin said that at least two of his friends have become homeless since his deployment with the 25th Infantry Division ended in 2005 .
One stayed in Hawaii , " because you 've got beaches you can sleep on , " Kevin said .
The other , he said , moved to the Salt Lake City area , " because out there , if you 're homeless , you get meals , you get money " from Mormon charities .
As the wars continue , the number of homeless veterans is " going to radically swell , " Downing said .
Downing and others who work with homeless veterans said the government is not prepared to assist those troops ; a recent report by the Government Accountability Office said there are some 200,000 homeless veterans and only 15,000 beds for them at shelters .
At least 9,600 more beds are needed , the report said .
No government agency provides permanent housing for homeless veterans , said Beversdorf .
" We 're just the fallout , you know ? "
Joe said in the garden of the shelter .
Under the trees , several homeless Vietnam War veterans stood in the shade , smoking in silence .
" We fall through the cracks . "

During hack week , I took an afternoon to add Valgrind support for Mono symbols .
It was kind of a hackternoon thing .
Mono works great with Valgrind , but when there is an error in unmanaged code stack traces only contain symbols from the native libraries and do not contain information from the JITed code .
During the Moonlight hacking sprint we used Valgrind extensively for finding errors in our code and it was becoming annoying to manually lookup addresses from stack traces and match them up with Mono 's - v output .
Today the output looks like this :
==22441== Mismatched free ( ) / delete / delete [ ] ==22441== at 0x4020E26 : operator delete ( void* ) ( in /usr/lib/valgrind/x86-linux/vgpreload_memcheck.so ) ==22441== by 0x5EB49FA : Value:: FreeValue ( ) ( value.cpp:261 ) ==22441== by 0x5EB4AAC : value_free_value ( value.cpp:275 ) ==22441== by 0x66E5E60 : ???
==22441== by 0x66E4587 : ???
==22441== by 0x66E3FF1 : ???
==22441== by 0x66E3DE5 : ???

This app is the culrpit for the above stacktrace .
A developer first reaction to the " ??? " text is to panic .
Today we lower the panic alert level .
At the beginning of the hackternoon , I did not know it , but Nat had written a script that achieved similar results :
I added a new client API to Valgrind that JIT compilers can use to register generated code with Valgrind so that the actual method name is displayed on the stack traces , the new output looks like this for the same error :
==22478== Mismatched free ( ) / delete / delete [ ] ==22478== at 0x4020E26 : operator delete ( void* ) ( vg_replace_malloc.c:244 ) ==22478== by 0x5EB49FA : Value:: FreeValue ( ) ( value.cpp:261 ) ==22478== by 0x5EB4AAC : value_free_value ( value.cpp:275 ) ==22478== by 0x66E5E60 : ( wrapper managed - to - native ) Mono.NativeMethods:value_free_value ( Mono.Value& ) ==22478== by 0x66E4587 : System.Windows.DependencyObject:SetValue ( System.Windows.DependencyProperty , System.Windows.Media.Color ) ==22478== by 0x66E3FF1 : System.Windows.Media.SolidColorBrush:.ctor ( System.Windows.Media.Color ) ==22478== by 0x66E3DE5 : Desklets.Monitor:.cctor ( ) ==22478== by 0x66E3D35 : ( wrapper runtime - invoke ) Desklets.Monitor:runtime_invoke_void ( object , intptr , intptr , intptr ) ==22478== by 0x809D294 : mono_runtime_class_init ( object.c:329 ) ==22478== by 0x815920C : mono_jit_compile_method ( mini.c:10905 ) ==22478== by 0x81595C4 : mono_jit_runtime_invoke ( mini.c:11081 ) ==22478== by 0x809FD34 : mono_runtime_invoke_array ( object.c:2616 )
The patch is here .
Support your Valgrind / Mono addiction by voting my idea up .
From National Journal :
The Bush administration has withheld a series of e-mails from Congress showing that senior White House and Justice Department officials worked together to conceal the role of Karl Rove in installing Timothy Griffin , a protégé of Rove ’s , as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas .
The withheld records show that D. Kyle Sampson , who was then - chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , consulted with White House officials in drafting two letters to Congress that appear to have misrepresented the circumstances of Griffin ’s appointment as U.S. attorney and of Rove ’s role in supporting Griffin .
Paris Hilton smiled and waved at photographers as she left jail
Hilton leaves jail
Hilton 's parents Kathy and Rick arrived to pick her up shortly after 0800 BST .
Reporters were camped outside the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood , California since Monday .
The 26 - year - old , sentenced to 45 days on 3 June , was released early due to crowded jail conditions and time off for good behaviour .
She is scheduled to appear on Larry King 's CNN talk show on Wednesday .
Her mother Kathy was waiting for her outside the detention facility
The network has said she will not be paid for her appearance , which has replaced a planned interview with filmmaker Michael Moore .
Hilton was briefly freed on medical grounds earlier this month but was sent back to jail by a court .
The Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department had not revealed what time the reality TV star would be released .
Her West Hollywood neighbours , however , are reportedly bracing themselves for an influx of paparazzi and TV crews .
Hilton smiled and waved at the huge bank of photographers as she left the detention facility .
She was greeted with a hug from her mother Kathy and was driven away to an undisclosed location .
Best Buy : I want a Quiet Zone card .
I first started shopping at Best Buy maybe 10 or 15 years ago .
It was either them or Circuit City , and back then , Best Buy was the clear winner .
Why ?
Because Circuit City 's employees were always trying to sell me a service contract .
Shopping at Best Buy was relatively painless , so I became a regular customer there .
Fast forward to 2007 and everything has changed .
Circuit City is no longer even a viable alternative .
Based on the store here in Champaign , I 'd say the chain has mostly flatlined .
I hope their stockholders signed some sort of a Do -Not - Resuscitate order .
So Best Buy is really the only choice I 've got .
Unfortunately , Best Buy today is far , far more annoying than Circuit City ever was .
I regret that I ever complained about the teensy little hassle at Circuit City .
No , I do n't want 8 free issues of Sports Illustrated .
I 've been asked this question dozens if not hundreds of times , and the answer has always been " no " .
No , I do n't want to buy an extended warranty .
Ever .
If my new DVD player stops working in three years , I 'll just buy a new one .
Really .
No , I do n't want a Best Buy credit card .
My current card works just fine , but I swear , if you ask me this question one more time I 'm going to go get a credit card from Circuit City just so I can tick you off by using it whenever I shop here .
Once I got asked about the service contract THREE TIMES during the purchase of a single item .
In terms of not being pestered , walking through a Chevrolet dealership is safer than a trip to Best Buy .
I 'll confess that I do have one of their Reward Zone cards .
Care to hear how I got it ?
Glad you asked .
I was buying a DVD one day , preparing to tell them for the fifty thousandth time that I really do n't want a Reward Zone card .
But this time the cashier deviated from the script .
She picked up a fresh new Reward Zone package and said , " I see you in here all the time .
You need one of these . "
And suddenly I had a Reward Zone card , whether I wanted one or not .
I want the old Best Buy back .
I just want to buy DVDs and cordless phones and digital cameras without being asked any questions .
And I have a plan .
What I want is a Best Buy " Quiet Zone " card .
Instead of blue like the Reward Zone card , this one would be red .
I have no idea how my Reward Zone card works , but my Quiet Zone card would work like this :
Whenever a Best Buy employee sees it , they immediately shut up .
That 's it .
All I have to do is wave my red card and suddenly every blue shirt in my vicinity will put a cork in it .
Do n't even finish your sentence .
I am buying exactly what I came here to buy , and nothing else .
I 'd love to assert that the Red Zone card should be free , but I suspect that selling the idea of pleasing customers to the Best Buy management would be like trying to sell air freshener to a fish .
The unfortunate truth is that I would be willing to pay for my Quiet Zone card .
I understand the realities of business .
I know that nothing really comes for free .
I know that the reason you people keep trying to give me magazines is that somebody is paying you to do it , so I am willing to pay you to stop .
Charge me an annual fee .
Or charge me a higher price every time I use my Quiet Zone card .
I do n't care .
Just shut your pie hole .
Frankly , I think this idea is the best solution for everybody involved .
The only possible flaw in my plan is that someday a new Best Buy competitor will emerge .
They 'll have a similar selection of products .
Their prices will be 3 - 5 percent higher , but they will never , ever try to sell me something I did n't come there to buy .
On the day that store opens in Champaign , I will make my last stop at Best Buy to say farewell .
But for now , please , please , sell me a Quiet Zone card .
Google will limit the length of time it holds personally identifiable data
The move comes in response to a data protection group that wrote to the firm questioning its privacy policies .
The European advisory body , called Article 29 , said Google 's current data retention practices could be breaking European privacy laws .
The search giant has said it will now keep personally identifiable search data for 18 months rather than the previous period of 18 to 24 months .
We are committed to data protection principles that meet the expectations of our users in Europe and across the globe
Peter Fleischer , Google
Google currently collects and stores information from each search query , holding information about the search query itself , the unique PC address ( known as an IP number ) , and details about how a user makes their searches , such as the web browser that is being used .
The company says it needs this information to improve its different services and to help fight threats such as fraud , spam and malicious attacks , and to aid " valid legal orders " from law enforcement agencies .
It keeps this information for a set period before " anonymising " it - disconnecting the data from an individual .
New policy
However , some are worried that this collected data from Google and other search engines may be infringing on civil liberties .
In May , working group Article 29 , made up from data protection commissioners from around the EU , wrote to Google expressing particular concern over the length of time personally identifiable data was being retained on the company 's servers .
It said the search engine 's policy did not appear " to meet the requirements of the European legal data protection framework " .
In a response to Article 29's letter , Google 's global privacy counsel Peter Fleischer responded : " We are committed to data protection principles that meet the expectations of our users in Europe and across the globe . "
He said that Google believed their current policy complied with data protection law , but admitted a shorter period of data retention than existed at present was possible .
Mr Fleischer wrote : " After considering the working party 's concerns , we are announcing a new policy : to anonymise our search server logs after 18 months , rather than the previously - established period of 18 to 24 months . "
He said that the company could still " address our legitimate interests in security , innovation and anti-fraud efforts " within the shorter period .
However , he added that " we also firmly reject any suggestions that we could meet our legitimate interests ... with any retention period shorter than 18 months " .
Article 29 has said it will " carefully study " Google 's letter , and will discuss it at its next session taking place on 20 and 21 June .
In a recent piece on red - giant star Mira , we rather foolishly suggested that the " comet - tailed " body was travelling across the heavens at roughly 150,000 times the speed of the average sheep .
This rash assertion provoked many readers to demand the maximum velocity of a sheep and , more to the point , the maximum velocity of a sheep in a vacuum .
Furthermore , the question of Wales has of late been worrying our readership .
Or rather , just how big is Wales and how does it measure up to other classic yardsticks of surface area including the time - honoured football pitch ?
And , indeed , just how big is Wales in cubic furlongs ?
Accordingly , the Vulture Central Weights and Measures Soviet immediately set out to define once - and - for - all a set of agreed standards to which all future quantities would be subject .
Here , then , are the results :
Volume
The base unit of volume shall be the EU standard ( 5 cm radius ) grapefruit , defined as 1gf , representing 523.6 cc , 4.426 US gills , 0.0144 UK bushels , 0.5236 Chinese Imperial sheng , or 0.9625 Ancient Roman sextaria .
For volumes lesser or greater than 1gf , the following should be used :
Walnut = 0.16gf
Chicken 's egg = 0.35gf
Football = 11.07gf
Olympic - sized swimming pool = 4,780,114gf
Known universe = 117,456,206x104925gf
Examples :
When they cut the poor bloke open , they found a tumour the size of a chicken 's egg .
Experts calculate that Bills Gates ' wealth in $ 1 m bills would fill two Olympic - sized swimming pools .
Length
The standard unit of length shall be the EU standard ( Florentine ) linguine ( unboiled at sea level ) , defined as 1lg , representing 14 cm , 0.02784 perches , 0.462 Japanese shyaku or 0.0007568 Ancient Greek stadium ptolemys
For greater than 1lg , the following should be used :
Double - decker bus = 65.85lg
Brontosaurus = 15 double - decker buses laid bumper - to - bumper
Length across known universe at shortest point = 136 trillion brontosauruses laid nose - to - tail
Examples
Paleontologists suggest that while vicious predator Ballmersaurus rex measured three double - decker buses from nose to tail , his brain was no bigger than a walnut .
Imagine Paris Hilton 's dismay when she whipped open the prisoner warder 's flies to find he was only packing a half - linguine .
Important exception
The distance travelled by a tantrum - driven flying PDA shall be defined in Campbells ( 1cB=231lg ) .
Example : " Yeah , I asked that Foxy Brown to turn her car stereo down and she only went and threw her bleedin ' Blackberry about three Campbells . "
Area
The standard unit of area shall be the nanoWales , defined as 1nWa , representing 0.0000207km2 or 20.78m2 , 5.195 Thai talang wah or 28.99 Old Spanish square vara .
The microWales , milliWales and Wales ( Wa ) are , naturally , accepted multiples of the base nanoWales .
Football pitch = 194.89nWa
Wales = 1,000,000,000nWa
Belgium = 1.47Wa
Democratic Republic of Congo = 113.3Wa
Known universe ( rolled out flat ) = 19468502x1012x10256Wa
Example :
The eruption of Vesuvius took out an area of 13 milliWales , although the effects of the blast were felt up to a thousand brontosauruses away .
Survivors reported rocks and pumice the size of Bulgarian airbags falling from the sky for three days before the tragedy , and experts have calculated the total debris would fill around 120,000 Olympic - sized swimming pools .
Velocity of sheep in a vacuum
The theoretical maximum velocity of a sheep in a vacuum is expressed in sheepsecs ( Ssx ) , calculated as follows :
Speed of light ( c ) divided by wooldrag ( Wd ) + Welshmen ( Wm ) , where wooldrag is a species - defined drag coefficient determined by the length and pliability of the fleece and Welshmen is the number of locals who have turned up in their wellies , and are hanging on for dear life .
Wooldrags have recently been calculated by researchers at CERN , and the latest experiments shed some light on the phenomenon , but it is still mysterious .
The effect is similar to friction here on Earth , but is due to the interaction of the wool and fluctuations in the quantum vacuum .
Researchers have applied to the EU for further funding , but it has been put on hold as a result of the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease .
For example , an unshorn Welsh Mountain Badger Face , with a wooldrag of 67 , chased by three Welshmen will ultimately attain a Ssx of c /( 67+3 ) , or 4,282.74 km/sec .
Alternatively , a newly - clipped Finnish Landrace , with a wooldrag of 23 , worried by just one Welshman has a theoretical Ssx of c /( 23+1 ) , or 12,491 km/sec .
Clearly , the difference in these two results means that a compromise standard is required .
The El Reg Ssx uses the classic Cheviot as its sheep of choice , with a wooldrag of 50 .
Wm is in this case 0 , since everyone knows that Welshmen do not in fact have intimate relations with sheep and any reference to the same is just a cheap attempt to drum up laughs .
The Vulture Central standard velocity for a sheep in a vacuum is , therefore , c / ( 50+0 ) , or 5,995 km /sec .
Theoretical versus practical limits of sheep in a vacuum
There are , of course , some tricky real - world problems that interfere with smooth calculations of the speed of a sheep in a vacuum .
So far we have assumed that the sheep is a perfect sphere ( roughly equivalent to 20 footballs , or 220gf ) .
In a perfect vacuum , this is n't a problem , but when you factor in the notoriously sticky interstellar medium and large , the assumption simply will not do .
The interstellar medium and large is , according to research , roughly as dense as the grey matter of the average Hollywood celebutant .
Assuming one super - sticky particle per cubic metre ( or one brain cell per three starlets - do n't ask us to guess which of them is currently using it ) , the interstellar medium and large exerts a drag on the average sheep equivalent to half a slightly scary Welshman .
Thus , we can calculate the maximum real world velocity of a sheep in space :
Ssx space = Ssx max x dragISML
where dragISML is 0.5 .
So , the maximum velocity of a sheep in space is 2997.5 km/sec .
And the size of Wales in cubic furlongs ?
This is a tricky one .
The political debate behind it is long and uninteresting , so we will skip it and report only that it has been determined that the volume of Wales has been defined as including all topsoil , land and equipment , up to , but not beyond , one metre below the surface .
This means everything below ground ( coal ) is English , while the Welsh can retain their cherished national symbol , the leek .
Wales is 20,780 square km x 1 metre depth
= 20,780,000,000 cubic metres = 103,300,000 cubic furlongs .
For those with an unhealthy interest in such things , this is also equivalent to 405000000000000 US tablespoons or 196600000000 biblical letheks . ®
( 09 - 10 ) 17:03 PDT SAN JOSE - A computer expert who served as a confidential source for an elite FBI computer crime squad has been arrested on wire - fraud charges , five years after being released from federal prison for hacking into government computers .
Max Ray Butler , 35 , also known as Max Vision , was arrested Wednesday on a federal arrest warrant issued in Pennsylvania , authorities said .
He was charged a day earlier with wire fraud , identity theft and access - device fraud .
The alleged crimes happened from October through December in Allegheny County , Pa. Further details of the case were unavailable , as the affidavit from a U.S. Secret Service agent that accompanied the criminal complaint remains under seal .
Butler is to appear Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Patricia Trumbull in San Jose for a detention hearing .
Butler was released from federal prison in October 2002 after being sentenced to 18 months and ordered to pay more than $ 60,000 in restitution for computer hacking .
He was indicted in 2000 on charges of hacking into computers used by UC Berkeley , national laboratories , federal departments , Air Force bases and a NASA flight center in 1998 .
Butler grew up in Idaho and lived with his family in Washington , where authorities said he has a 1997 misdemeanor conviction for attempted trafficking of stolen property .
He developed a proficiency with computers , eventually attracting the attention of the FBI 's Computer Crime Squad , which used him as a confidential informant .
But at his sentencing in 2001 , a federal prosecutor said Butler " masqueraded as an informant for the FBI , " claiming to be cooperating with the agency while using computer programs that conducted automated , unauthorized system attacks .
An FBI search warrant affidavit in 2000 said Butler was " well known " to squad members and " has provided useful and timely information on computer crimes in the past . "
In 1997 , Butler started a company known as Max Vision in Mountain View , specializing in " penetration testing " and " ethical hacking " procedures in which he would simulate for clients how a hacker would penetrate their computer systems , according to the company Web site .
Subpoenas :
The Supreme Court has described the congressional power of inquiry as “ an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function .
” The issuance of a subpoena pursuant to an authorized investigation is “ an indispensable ingredient of lawmaking . ”
What is of particular interest now is the prudence of relying on the courts to enforce Congressional subpoenas .
The CRS report discusses the very interesting 1975 Ashland case , which involved the Federal Trade Commission 's resistance to compliance with a Congressional subpoena :
A dispute between a House subcommittee and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) began on April 16 , 1975 , when the commission issued an order requiring Ashland Oil , Inc. to submit information on Ashland ’s estimates of natural gasreserves on various leases .
Ashland submitted the information on August 27 , stating that the information was confidential and of a proprietary nature , and that disclosure to competitors would cause injury to Ashland .
On October 6 , in his capacity as a Member of Congress , John Moss asked the commission to make available to him data gathered by the commission relating to energy development on federal lands .
FTC denied the request . . .
After the commission agreed to furnish Moss with the information , Ashland Oil went to court to enjoin the FTC from releasing the data .
At that point the subcommittee issued a subpoena on December 2 , ordering the FTC chairman to appear the following day with the requested documents .
On the deadline day , the commission wrote to Moss , advising him that on November 24 a district judge had issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the commission “ from disclosing the documents to any third party , including Congress . . . . ”
With the matter tied up in court , the House Committee on House Administration reported a resolution on December 17 , providing for the appointment of a special counsel to represent the House and the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce in judicial proceedings related to the subpoena .
I want to take a moment and highlight the fact that the House can always retain counsel to act on its behalf to enforce subpoenas .
There have been some folks who believe that the Congress is helpless because it depends upon the US Attorney for the District of Columbia in this regard .
It seems obvious that this is not a legitimate concern given the House 's power to appoint its own counsel in such matters .
Now back to Ashland :
A federal district court agreed that the information sought in the subpoena was properly within the subcommittee ’s jurisdiction .
. . .
The court rejected the argument that the transfer of the data from the FTC to the subcommittee would lead “ inexorably to either public dissemination or disclosure to Ashland ’s competitors . ”
Courts must assume that congressional committees “ will exercise their powers responsibly and with due regard for the rights of affected parties . ”
That decision was affirmed by the D.C. Circuit .
Another dispute which is discussed in the CRS opinion seems especially interesting and relevant to some of the current Congressonal investigations , specifically the investigation of the firings of US Attorneys .
In 1991 , the Congress investigated claims that the FBI was arresting suspects in foreign lands without the requisite authorization from these foreign countries .
During the Congressional investigation , it arose that William Barr , a Justice Department official , had written an opinion reversing a public Office of Legal Counsel opinion on the matter .
The Justice Department refused to turn over Barr 's memorandum :
Initially , the Administration decided to withhold the document .
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh wrote to the subcommittee on November 28 , 1989 , explaining why it could not have the 1989 opinion : “ Apart from classified information , there is no category of documents in the Department ’s possession that I consider more confidential than legal opinions to me from the Office of Legal Counsel . ”
Subcommittee chair Don Edwards replied that OLC opinions had been made available to Congress in previous years .
In a letter on January 24 , 1990 , Edwards provided Thornburgh with other examples of OLC opinions being released to Congress .
On January 31 , 1990 , the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , Jack Brooks , wrote to Thornburgh about a number of difficulties that Congress had experienced in receiving executive branch documents .
. . .
The two sides , however , were unable to reach an acceptable accommodation , resulting in the issuance of a subcommittee subpoena on July 25 , 1991 .
The subcommittee argued that it needed the 1989 memo to determine whether it was necessary for Congress to legislate in this area .
Unless Thornburgh turned over the document by 9 a.m. on July 31 , the committee would vote to hold him in contempt .
The Administration decided not to comply with the subpoena , preferring instead to assert executive privilege .
. .
Brooks denied this line of reasoning : “ This committee ’s request will in no way expose sensitive information to the public nor will it in any way deter or slow criminal prosecutions in these matters . ”
As the interbranch collision neared , the two sides were able to find some common ground .
The President decided not to invoke executive privilege , and the Justice Department agreed to allow one or more committee members to review the legal memo if the subcommittee would suspend the subpoena and remove the threat of a contempt vote .
The Executive Branch capitulated .
But there were other disputes :
During the same time period as the confrontation over the kidnapping memo , the House and the Justice Department engaged in another showdown .
On December 5 , 1990 , Chairman Brooks convened a hearing of the Judiciary Committee to review the refusal of Attorney General Thornburgh to provide the committee with access to all documents regarding a civil dispute brought by Inslaw , Inc. , a computer company .
Inslaw charged that high - level officials in the Justice Department conspired to force Inslaw into bankruptcy . . .
Federal Bankruptcy Judge George Bason had already ruled thatthe Justice Department “ took , converted , and stole ” Inslaw ’s proprietary software , using “ trickery , fraud , and deceit . ”
The Justice Department denied these charges , claiming that what was at stake was a contract dispute .
Brooks said that the controversy reached the highest levels of the department , including at least two Assistant Attorneys General , a Deputy Attorney General , and Attorney General Edwin Meese .
Because House and Senate investigating committees had been denied access to documents needed to establish the department ’s guilt or innocence , Brooks concluded that he was “ even more convinced that the allegations concerning INSLAW must be fully and independently investigated by the committee . ” . . .
[ T ]he committee would consider contempt of Congress proceedings against the department .
At that point several hundred documents were delivered to the committee , which later released a formal investigative report on the Inslaw affair .
Yet again , the Executive capitulated in the face of a resolute Congress .
The CRS report reminds us when a Republican Congress was intent on investigating the Executive , the Executive being Bill Clinton :
On December 8 , 1995 , the Special Senate Committee to Investigate Whitewater Development Corporation and Related Matters ( the Senate Whitewater Committee ) issued a subpoena for certain documents .
The White House announced that it would withhold material concerning a November 5 , 1993 , meeting at the law offices of Williams & Connolly , which had been retained by President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton to provide personal counsel for Whitewater - related matters .
. . .
Within a few days , the White House offered to turn over the . . . notes if the committee agreed that the meeting was privileged .
The committee refused because it learned of other meetings attended by White House officials and private attorneys .
. . .
Unable to reach an acceptable compromise , the committee voted to send the issue to the Senate floor and from there to federal district court .
Clinton objected that he should not be “ the first president in history ” to give up his right to attorney - client confidentiality .
By December 15 , the White House had indicated its willingness to drop most of the conditions it had established for turning over the Kennedy notes to the committee .
The change occurred hours after the committee voted to ask the full Senate to go to court to enforce the subpoena .
Yet another Executive Branch capitulation .
It seems les surprising now that there has been such little litigation in this area .
It seems that the Executive Branch has well understood the weakness of its claims .
The CRS report then discusses the other power Congress can invoke , the contempt power :
The Contempt Power
When the executive branch refuses to release information or allow officials to testify , Congress may decide to invoke its contempt power .
Although the legislative power of contempt is not expressly provided for in the Constitution and exists as an implied power , as early as 1821 the Supreme Court recognized [ it. ] . .
If either Housevotes for a contempt citation , the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House shall certify the facts to the appropriate U.S. Attorney , “ whose duty it shall be to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action . ”
Individuals who refuse to testify or produce papers are subject to criminal contempt , leading to fines and imprisonment .
. . .
This section begins by covering contempt actions , from 1975 to 1981 , against six Cabinet officers who refused to surrender documents to Congress : Secretary of Commerce Rogers C. B.M orton , Health , Education , and Welfare Secretary F. David Mathews , Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano , Jr. , Secretary of Energy Charles W. Duncan , Jr. , and Secretary of Energy James B. Edwards .
With contemptcitations looming , the two branches reached a compromise settlement that gave Congress access to the documents .
In the " old days , " the Executive conceded .
But what of the Republican Presidents once Reagan came into office ?
What of the famous Gorsuch matter ?
Here is what the CRS report says :
The contempt action against Gorsuch revealed a weakness in the procedures that Congress relies on for contempt , especially when the Justice Department has already taken a position on legal and constitutional issues .
Citing an executive official for contempt requires the executive branch––through a U.S. Attorney – –to bring the action .
In the Gorsuch case , which show cased executive privilege doctrines advanced by the Justice Department , that action was slow in coming and required a federal judge to nudge it along to encourage an accommodation between the two branches .
The Gorsuch case is especially interesting because the current White House counsel Fred Fielding , was the White House counsel during the Gorsuch matter .
The CRS report discusses it as follows :
EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch , acting under instructions from President Reagan ( meaning the Justice Department ) , refused to turn over “ sensitive documents found in open law enforcement files . ”
Reagan ’s memorandum to her , dated November 30 , 1982 , claimed that those documents represented “ internal deliberative materials containing enforcement strategy and statements of the government ’s positions on various legal issues which may be raised in enforcement actions relative to the various hazardous waste sites ” by the EPA or the Department of Justice .
On December 2 , the Administration withheld 64 documents from the subcommittee .
. . .
By a vote of 9 to 2 , a subcommittee of the House Public Works Committeedecided to cite Gorsuch for contempt .
The full committee did likewise , after it rejected a Justice Department proposal to give briefings on the contents of the documents .
The House of Representatives voted 259 to 105 to support the contempt citation .
. .
Pursuant to the statutory procedures for contempt citations , the Speaker certified the facts and referred them to the U.S. Attorney for presentation to a grand jury .
The Justice Department , anticipating the House vote , moved quickly : “ Immediately after the House vote and prior to the delivery of the contempt citation , ” the department chose not to prosecute the case .
Instead , it asked a district court to declare the House action an unconstitutional intrusion into the President ’s authority to withhold information from Congress .
This is now cited as the example of why the contempt procedure will not work .
Personally , it seems to me the better method was always hiring special counsel to seek enforcement of a subpoena in court .
The contempt citation procedure seems rife with potential conflict .
But even given this problem , the action filed by the Justice Department could still be the vehicle to decide the issue .
Consider the CRS description of what happened :
Stanley S. Harris , responsible for bringing the case to a grand jury , listed his name on the Justice Department complaint and advised Congress that “ it would not be appropriate for me to consider bringing this matter before a grand jury until the civil action has been resolved . ”
The Justice Department occupied an unusual ethical position .
First it had advised Gorsuch to withhold the documents , and now it decided not to prosecute her for adhering to the department ’s legal analysis .
In court , the department argued that the contempt action marked an “ unwarranted burden on executive privilege ” and an“ interference with the executive ’s ability to carry out the laws . ”
Clearly the Justice Department was in a conflict situation and in an untenable position .
The House Counsel , Stan Brand , took , to me , a very curious course .
The CRS report describes :
Counsel for the House of Representatives urged the court not to intervene , requesting it to dismiss the case .
The court dismissed the government ’s suit on the ground that judicial intervention in executive - legislative disputes “ should be delayed until all possibilities for settlement have been exhausted . ”
The court urged both parties to devote their energies to compromise and cooperation , not confrontation .
After the court ’s decision , which the Justice Department chose not to appeal , the Administration agreed to release “ enforcement sensitive ” documents to the House Public Works Committees , beginning with briefings and redacted copies and eventually ending with the unredacted documents .
Yet again , despite this legal mismanagement by the House counsel ( imo of course ) , the House prevailed over the Executive .
I wanted to provide this background here as a setup for my post to follow on what this all means for oversight , separation of powers , the need for impeachment and other related matters .
There is a lot of disinformation that has been bandied about on this point and it is important to start with the facts .
Part 2 to come shortly .
Let it first be noted that I did n't watch the video , because I 'm at work , and am therefore responding more to the comments than to the video .
Let it also be noted that I am not looking to advance my own views on abortion here , because while I have been known to " rock the boat " around here , that is one bee 's nest that I have no interest in poking .
1 . I understand the complaint many of you have , that it seems hypocritical that pro-lifers can't answer this question .
But , if they all had come back immediately and said " The women should go to jail , " I 'd bet most of you would attack them for being cruel .
This is one of those questions that a pro-lifer simply can't answer adequately , because whatever answer they give could be criticized .
I suppose a hesitancy to want women who get abortions to be punished may demonstrate a subconscious belief that maybe abortion is okay , but I doubt it .
There are plenty of times when someone commits a crime , and while we do n't deny that it was a crime , we hesitate to punish the " criminal " harshly .
It 's simply a recognition of the difficult circumstances in which the act was performed , not a denial that the act was a crime .
2 . In regards to the " They think it 's murder , but they should n't force their views on others " : this argument has never made sense to me .
Logically , if all murder is illegal , and abortion is murder , then abortion must be made illegal .
It 's one thing to argue against their reasons for claiming that abortion is murder , but it would be hypocritical to claim that abortion is murder while agreeing that it should be legal .
3. Roe v.
Wade should be overturned , because that 's not a decision which should have been made by unelected judges .
Laws , especially ones as important to the American people as abortion , must be made by the Congress , not by judges .
Congress should decide whether abortion is legal or not , and its decision should probably be in the form of a Constitutional amendment .
( okay , that 's my own view , but it has more to do with the nature of the issue than with my opinion about that issue ) .
DMF
The president of Universal Music Group 's digital division , Larry Kenswil , dipped into Slashdot to illustrate the kind of laggards who are holding up progress in digital music .
How did he figure that out , exactly ?
Kenswil was speaking at the Digital Music Forum in New York , earlier today , where we 're in town to take the pulse of the industry .
The RIAA director drew attention to three groups he called " pie throwers " .
One group was manufacturers - such as Samsung and Helix - who he highlighted for producing hybrid MP3 players and satellite radios that record the streams .
Thanks to a loophole in US copyright law , satellite radio recorders are the next big legal battleground - with Apple believed to be in the advanced stages of adding satellite streams as podcasts to its iTunes store .
" It 's a great example of how you can lose it all for everyone if you set out to gain an extra cent for yourself , " said Kenswil .
The second group were the telcos , who Kenswil said might threaten to bring in tiered internet pricing .
When we asked Larry about this later , he said he still was n't sure how seriously to take the big telcos hints that they wanted to charge differential pricing .
" We 're probably neutral on net neutrality right now , " he joked .
The final group he referred to as " the utopians " .
" It 's the capitalism - is - evil crowd , the folks who want stuff for free - and you will find them on Slashdot , " he said .
Kenswil quoted , to much appreciative laughter from the music industry audience , a Slashdot author called " albertpacino " for the saying that the music industry had " chosen to be blind about the issue . "
Alas , when we tried to check the citation , neither Slashdot nor Google could produce any trace of a user with that name .
None of the search engines could locate the phrase " blind about the issue " .
Kenswil 's presentation included the quote reformatted for a PowerPoint presentation - so errors may have crept in as it was transcribed by his staff - or your reporter .
Maybe the user cited figured out a way to leave and wipe all trace of his comments behind him - but it's all a little odd .
He was on firmer ground with his evidence when he quoted TechWeb editor Fredric Paul , for an article entitled " Why Everyone Hates the Music Industry " , which you can find here .
Wow , even FOX News has n't tried this little trick .
The conservative tabloid , New York Post , owned by Republican media magnate Rupert Murdoch , published a story today criticizing Democrats for giving a " death sentence " to millions of Iraqis .
The only problem ?
The AP never wrote any such thing .
You would n't really call this plagiarism - I 'm not sure what you call it .
Faking someone else 's byline in order to print a story blasting a political enemy .
Wow .
TPM's Greg Sargent spoke with the AP reporter , David Espo , who the NY Post claims wrote the story .
Espo says :
" I did n't write anything remotely like that .
My name was on the story and I did n't write it anything like the way it was printed . "
Publishing a fake AP story .
I certainly hope the Associated Press is going to weigh in on this one .

" Nobody gets out of here alive . "
-- Jim Morrison of the band The Doors
Somewhere among the ancestors of human beings there apparently existed the first animal to truly comprehend its own mortality .
This realization probably accompanied the newly emerging ability to think and plan ahead .
For sooner or later , thinking ahead brought you smack up against the fact you might personally get eaten by a saber tooth tiger , just like aunt Cecilia .
Eventually this new skill ( and sobering realization ) became a readily accessed blessing ( or curse ) to just about every human being on the planet .
Today , just as back then , mostly people try to use the thinking part without acknowledging their personal end scenario which must ultimately punctuate all their actions on Earth .
But sometimes it can be awfully hard to ignore that final exit door at the end of our journey .
The actual mother of invention
So eventually our ancestors came up with a neat solution : they decided to pit their newfound thinking skills against their end scenarios themselves .
To fight fire with fire .
Use the very thing which enabled us to understand our end was inevitable , to come up with creative ways to either avoid it , delay it , or at least dress it up to look nicer .
And the art of invention was born .
Invention of ways to put off or deny death , by cleverly eradicating ( or rendering less likely ) possible causes of same .
Or make death itself less scary in general .
We invented weapons that helped in two ways : one , to defend us from the wolves , lions , tigers , bears , etc. , etc. , that were eating us .
And two , to help us eat other animals who were now less scary than a man with a club or a spear .
The weapons were a fantastic way to stave off death -- at least until we began using them on each other too .
Ouch !
Falling short
But we continued to invent new ways of cheating or delaying death .
As well as making life ( and death ) more comfortable in general .
Unfortunately , despite all our best efforts over millions of years , our inventions basically did no better than raise our average life expectancy at birth to maybe two or three times what it was when we first awoke to thinking in the first place .
Damn it !
Plus , we discovered we were prone to all sorts of new and unexpected ailments after the age of 25 or so .
Which created the need for a whole new set of inventions !
The original S.W.A.G.s ( super - wild - assed - guesses )
This frustrating lack of progress ( compared to our hopes ) was of course obvious to our ancestors long , long ago .
So maybe as far back as a million years BC , they started a separate imaginative track from the invention course ( but parallel to it ) , regarding everything outside the realm of existing knowledge and therefore inventive potential .
The second track was the metaphysical .
Or spiritual .
Or supernatural .
Basically the unknown , and maybe ever unknowable .
This second track was at once easier and harder than the invention one .
For unlike inventions , metaphysical ideas did n't have to actually work , or accomplish anything more than intrigue or entertain your fellow tribesman .
Tall tales are born
And so the best story tellers rose to prominence among humanity .
Amazingly enough , usually beating in local popularity and support all the members who actually did the work ( and faced the dangers ) required to feed and protect the tribe !
Eventually the story tellers ' family lines became known as shamans or witch doctors , and their tribes turned to them for just about everything outside the realm of the known and invented .
Which -- of course -- meant just about everything , from advice regarding toe nail fungus , up through whether they should kill their neighbor or not ( and how ) .
Camp fire politics preceded office politics
Early shamans and witch doctors tended to cater to relatively small groups or tribes .
But over time the total human population grew ever larger , and people traveled more , and the tales of story tellers from different regions came to be compared and contrasted among their respective flocks .
This led to increasing competition between story tellers .
One of the ways they competed was by literal self - promotion .
That is , they would give themselves grand new titles , which they said were higher ranked than the previous labels of shaman or witch - doctor .
The new titles included terms like priests , or prophets or seers .
There were almost as many different new titles as there were story tellers , back then .
But today we know only of the titles which won the competition in those early times .
Usually the storyteller with the most appealing and popular stories won the contest .
Truth and accuracy were much less important than entertainment and novelty .
Just as is so today .
1
However , those story tellers who amassed sufficient wealth or power through their tales could dispense with creativity in story telling thereafter , and simply drive off , conquer , or kill rivals , as well as their rivals ' followers .
The invention of writing helps reduce the competition ( as literacy is a rare commodity in the early days )
And that 's when lots of the old stories were lost forever , while the ' winners ' were enshrined as religious gospels or forms of government ( kingdoms and empires ) for various peoples around the world .
My title is better than your title
Some of the most powerful early storytellers dropped the act entirely , and started a new one : claiming ' royal ' bloodlines ( the ' royal ' title of course was simply yet another ratcheting up of the original new title contest ) .
That is , they proclaimed themselves kings or queens or emperors , and their children to be the rightful heirs to everything which the new kings / queens / emperors had seized from others , in their rise to occupy newly built , fancy - made furniture they now referred to as ' thrones ' .
Yes : by this point even inanimate furniture was beginning to get grandiose titles of its own .
Not all story tellers anointed themselves as royalty , however .
For the title contest was still raging , and it was unclear which titles which end up being the most valuable .
A whole other group of world conquering hopefuls stuck with the original metaphysical theme of storytelling , now re-branding their accounts as " religious " , and straight from the mouths of strange , usually omnipotent beings , beyond mortal ken5 .
These guys are the ones who created " churches " of various names : each meant to sound more important than all the others .
Yeah : it was basically a huge spitting contest which lasted thousands of years ( and still goes on today ) .
Unfortunately , way too many people take it all way too seriously , and actually kill others over details in the stories -- and even different interpretations of the same stories !
Yes .
Even the original winning stories from centuries ago have today been splintered into a multiplicity of interpretations : or stories about stories -- about stories .
The most glaring example ?
All the different denominations ( or churches ) of Christianity .
There may be an entirely new one formed about once a week now .
But anyway --- !
Humanity went to a huge amount of trouble to create two major but highly separate ways to imaginatively deal with death and dying .
Tools invention , and story - telling .
The tools invention seemed to stall out at extending our average life expectancies at birth by around 300 % from the natural one of ' tooth and claw ' .
The story - telling policy always seemed better than the invention path for many of us -- but for reasons we could never quite define in logical or reasonable detail .
Ergo , the reason that today that path is often referred to as ' blind faith ' .
2
Time , money , and fine - tuning breeds misplaced reverence
Unfortunately , as mentioned before , as time passed the original stories seemed to take on ever more weight and reverence among their adherents .
Basically because the later followers were so far removed from personal familiarity with the original story tellers , who close friends knew for a fact had been absolutely no better or worse or smarter or holier than most anyone else around at the time : they 'd simply been decent story - tellers ( or liars , as is also an accurate synonym for such folks -- wherever they claim a story is true when it is n't ; and most did just that ; for the competition could be fierce , remember ! ) .
Over time , those original story tellers took on a mythical , or even magical status with new generations of fans of their works .
And their stories began to be taken far more seriously than they had ever been in their own lifetimes ( something like how the works of certain long dead ' starving ' artists fetch fortunes today ) .
And I mean deadly serious .
As decades and centuries passed , more and more people came to be killed over the stories themselves .
Until at some point the stories ended up at least neutralizing the life extension or enhancement advantages conveyed by inventions -- if not rolling them back outright .
For if you compare the toll of death and suffering stemming from the stories to the life extension gains from invention , it may be we 've actually begun losing ground overall , by the dawn of the 21st century .
But all that 's a secular perspective on the past and present tangible aspects of the storytellers ' legacy .
What about the stories themselves ?
Regarding death and the afterlife ?
Their first and main reason for being made up in the first place .
Is n't there anything useful there ?
If nothing else , the stories do offer up a wide and creative variety of possible explanations of death and any possible afterlife .
Especially if you examine all the surviving stories , and not just the handful which have come to dominate the modern world .
Indeed , the more obscure and lesser known tales are often more engrossing than their better - known counterparts , these days .
For the mainstream tales have gradually been pruned and revised by later editors to better suit their own preferences as time passed .
So this makes it a shame that we lost so many other stories from those times entirely .
Today 's astonishing territorial struggle between the powers of invention and story - telling ( science versus religion versus business versus government )
On the other hand , the art of invention ( or science ) has in some ways come along far enough by now to give the original story tellers a run for their money .
That is , science is getting ever closer to explaining so much of the world in a comprehensible way , that the great unknowns once the exclusive territory of the story tellers is now shrinking fast .
And of course , with shrinking territory comes more frequent and more violent territorial spats .
Partly between science and religion .
But also between science and business .
And science and governments .
And between religions themselves .
SETI results indicate storytellers usually come out on top -- and civilization collapses
It 's hard to predict which faction will ultimately come out on top -- as humanity has shown a propensity to go backwards about as often as it has to move forward .
And the absence of any signs of other civilizations in the void so far may indicate most cultures eventually turn their backs entirely upon science and curiosity and exploration -- and simply go extinct .
3
For people can't live by stories alone .
No matter what some extremists claim .
One thing science has on its side is that it works .
Pit science against plain old stories in the real world -- like using well - established farming practices to grow food , versus praying for manna from Heaven -- and science will virtually always win .
It 's people 's love of stories -- no matter their veracity or real world usefulness -- which may forever represent the greatest threat to reason , science , logic -- and so world peace and prosperity too .
For lies are often far more attractive than the truth .
4
Especially to the ignorant , the prejudiced -- or sophisticated thieves or plain old hate mongers in search of a victim .
For millions of years the primary ways we got to live better and longer came solely from invention -- not the tall tales of our storytellers .
No matter how pretty they painted their fictions , or how much faith we wanted to place in them .
An actual fire ( one of our earliest inventions or scientific discoveries ) wards off predators , lights our way , and warms us against the cold .
A story about the fiercest , most powerful , and most magical fire imaginable only leaves us in the dark , defenseless , and cold .
Below is a list of links I 'm compiling about the science and stories of death , dying , and the afterlife .
I hope you will find it BOTH useful and entertaining !
For those who like what they 've already read on this page , I 'll start off the catalog with my own related story list and links :

Specifically , the vast archives of historic DNA data and other information from millennia past are used to generate yet another variation on Old Earth , whereby every possible human being that could ever have lived is brought back to life again .

Let ’s start today ’s column with a warm - up exercise .
Ready to waken up that brain ?
Name the first five things that come to mind when you think about Japan .
Ready .
Set. Go !
??????????????????????????
Zero .
Need more time ?
Sorry – I ’m working with a limited amount of space here !
So , did you come up with sushi ?
Sumo wrestling ?
Cherry blossoms ?
Rock gardens ?
How about Hello Kitty ?
Easily one of the Japan ’s most recognizable cartoon characters , Har ?
Kiti ( Hello Kitty , ?????????????????? ) is known and loved the world over .
From Hello Kitty bento boxes and chopsticks to cell phone straps and designer tennis shoes , Hello Kitty is a global trademark that appeals to virtually all age groups and both sexes .
According to estimates , Hello Kitty adorns over 22,000 products worldwide , and earns almost a billion dollars a year in revenue for the Sanrio Company of Japan .
Hello Kitty was created in 1974 by Sanrio – the very first product was a clear vinyl coin purse bearing the face of Hello Kitty , which sold for 240 yen or approximately two dollars .
Surprisingly , Hello Kitty was intended to be named ‘ Kitty White ’ after one of Alice ’s cats in the Lewis Carroll classic Through the Looking - Glass .
At the time , British culture was the height of fashion amongst Japanese girls , and Hello Kitty was never intended to have any appeal beyond the pre-adolescent female market .
Of course , the designers at Sanrio failed to fully appreciate the Japanese obsession with all things cute .
One of the first words foreigners learn upon arriving in Japan is the all - important catch phrase kawaii ( cute , 可愛い ) .
The favorite three syllables of most women in Japan , cuteness is a cultural obsession that few foreigners completely understand .
While Western beauty and fashion stresses the importance of women looking sexy , a large percentage of Japanese females strive to attain the highest possible level of kawaisa ( cuteness , 可愛さ ) .
Incorporating everything from brightly colored hair - extensions and fluorescent eye make - up to knee - high socks and flowery dresses , Japanese fashion can simultaneously shock your senses and melt your heart .
With that said , cute culture extends far beyond the realms of beauty and fashion , and it ’s by no means limited to the female segment of the population .
If you look for it , kawaisa appears virtually everywhere in Japan , even in places that Westerners would consider juvenile .
For instance , the Japanese think nothing of using cartoon characters and ran dom bits of cuteness for public service announcements , office memos , government letters and even police notices .
So , it should come as no surprise that Hello Kitty is a marketing phenomenon unlike no other .
Greying salarymen think nothing of dangling a hot pink Hello Kitty strap from their cell phone , while middle - aged housewives swear that the Hello Kitty toaster is the best on the market .
( And , truth be told , I ’ve been known to rock out some Hello Kitty chopsticks from time to time ) .
Tune in tomorrow for Part II of Hello Kitty and Culture of Cute .

I consider the Internet to be one of the world 's great wonders .
And also America 's last hope for a free press .
When I was growing up in the 1970s , there were many people with a lot of things to say , but they generally had no platform .
That 's why we needed figures like Bob Dylan to be " the voice of a generation . "
The present generation has YouTube , whose motto - irresistible to young people - is " Broadcast Yourself . "
So now , for example , a pert 18 - year - old known as " AngryLittleGirl " can challenge her peers regarding their lack of critical thinking , especially when it comes to religion , by uploading a video op - ed .
As of this moment , her piece has been viewed by more than two million people .
YouTube is but one manifestation of a rapidly expanding " social media " that performs the vital function of promoting honest discussion and analysis at a time when spin , trivia , and advertising dominate the mass market profit - driven mainstream media -- or MSM as it is often called on the net .
Social media also encompasses web - based interactive communication tools such as blogs , message boards , forums , pod casts , online communities , and wikis .
I have seen bloggers expose mistakes and biases in the MSM within hours or even minutes of an article 's release .
For instance , when New York Times science writer William Broad ran a piece deflating Al Gore 's claims about global warming , numerous bloggers pounced on it for being sloppy and skewed .
Among them were Robert Dietz and Julie Millican at Media Matters , who documented how Broad had misrepresented the backgrounds of most of the supposedly " rank - and - file " experts quoted .
I do n't know what possessed Broad to so bend his reporting that he would lose credibility across a wide swath of readers ( something he has in common with journalist Judith Miller , with whom he co-authored a book ) , but I do know that the MSM has become consolidated to the point that just a few transnational conglomerates and capital management companies control network TV , commercial radio , and most of our newspapers .
As for the repercussions of this ominous development , John Carroll , former editor of the Los Angeles Times , states them quite clearly : " Gone is the notion that a newspaper should lead , that it has an obligation to the community , that it is beholden to the public . "
The current owners , he explains , care only about money , and " are sometimes genuinely perplexed to find people in their midst who do not feel beholden , first and foremost , to the shareholder . "
Bloggers are in an entirely different position :
They tend to be mavericks who work for free , and operate far from the sources of power .
Feeling no need to ingratiate themselves with the movers and shakers of industry and government , they simply tell it like it is from where they sit as concerned , informed citizens with diverse areas of expertise .
Though they do n't often have professional training as journalists , many of them exceed professional journalistic standards , because they answer to their consciences alone rather than to corporate honchos and fund managers .
We need to hear from such people , and the fact that there are more blogs out there worth reading than anyone has time to read is a hopeful sign .
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat .
Get our best delivered to your inbox .
Of course , the blogosphere is also filled with nonsense , and worse -- as might be expected in any open space that lacks gatekeepers .
The all - too - human reality of the web is that the majority of its traffic is directed to sex sites .
What 's more , hate groups of all kinds find it a perfect forum to purvey their sick ideas .
Even the benign Wikipedia can be used to disseminate false information with an effortlessness that has earned it the gratitude of propagandists everywhere .
How remarkable , then , that out of the cyberslime the lotus of a truly free press has been able to grow .
Citizens seeking to avail themselves of the valuable commentary to be found on the web , as well as the fact checking services of legions of bloggers , can learn to easily bypass the detritus and go directly to those sites that offer valuable content .
Where , though , does one turn for in - depth investigative reporting ?
Though projects such as The Real News Network are attempting to create an alternative , the MSM is still pretty much the only show in town .
Bloggers are generally not trained or equipped to do such reporting , and anyway , it´s a full time job that usually requires travel and a support staff , as well as knowledge and contacts developed over many years .
Newspapers carry out at least 80 % of primary reporting .
And yet the newspapers have repeatedly failed us , sometimes with tragic consequences , such as during the buildup to war in Iraq .
In his documentary Buying the War , Bill Moyers ( an exception to the rule that there are no outstanding journalists working in television ) exposes how reporters at newspapers such as the Washington Post consistently deferred to the wishes of the Bush administration or were tricked , pressured or seduced into doing so .
And behind Bush are the huge corporations that helped to put him into power , including those that own the MSM .
What 's a citizen to do ?
Again I say : go to the Internet .
Though it 's worthwhile to read the print publications that pursue quality reporting - and some of the smaller ones really need our support - subscribing is not essential : nearly all of the important articles from these publications may be found on the web , and bloggers often link to them .
And besides , there is also some fine web - based reporting , such as ( to pick an example that is apropos to this discussion ) the Salon piece that dissected and disposed of the myth , perpetuated by the MSM in tandem with then press secretary Ari Fleischer , that the exiting Clinton staff had removed the W's from their keyboards , and in other ways vandalized government property .
As our titanic democracy is sinking and the band of trivia and denial plays on , each Internet connection can function as an intellectual life preserver .
The net has also proved invaluable as a way for concerned citizens to offer support to each other , and to act together for political and social change .
From Salon in 1995 , to Common Dreams in 1997 , AlterNet in 1998 , truthout in 2001 , The Raw Story in 2004 , and The Huffington Post in 2005 , the news coverage on the Internet has matured to the point where we do n't really need to deal directly with the MSM anymore .
As my wife says , " No MSG in my takeout ; no MSM in my living room . "
One household at a time , we 'll escape the grasp of the Rupert Murdochs of this world , at least when they meddle with our freedom of the press .
“ How do I look ? ”
What it really means : “ Tell me I am attractive .
Now . ”
If there ’s one thing human beings cannot stand , it ’s the truth – and women are no exception .
If your girlfriend walked out of the bathroom with her panties around her neck , mud rubbed in her hair and torn spandex pants , she ’d still ask you how she looked and expect a complimentary response .
In a way , she ’s almost being generous – the boyfriend is given an easy excuse to earn brownie points by sycophantically praising his girlfriend ’s physical attributes .
Whether or not the boyfriend is lying through his teeth is irrelevant to the girlfriend .
How to deal with it :
Pretend to have your mind focused on something else for a second .
Then look back at her , as if you just now realized she ask you something .
The moment your eyes hit hers , suddenly act as if you have become overwhelmed with a wave of absolute astonishment – who is this beautiful woman , and how did she get here ?
Widen your eyes and try to look as childlike as possible , dumbfounded with amazement at her beauty .
These theatrics may seem unnecessary or silly , but one must realize that a simple “ you look great ” will result in nothing more than an argument and a likely denial of sex for the next 24 hours .
If a woman deems it necessary to ask you how she looks , then she ’s obviously spent some degree of effort on her appearance , and wants to be rewarded with an unusually positive reaction to it .
“ Do you think she ’s pretty ? ”
What it really means : “ Prove to me you are n’t attracted to other women . ”
Typically asked in reference to a female celebrity or supermodel , your woman is feeling insecure about the fact that many , many women on the planet are most likely more attractive than her .
She needs you to show that “ mainstream ” attractive women hold no interest for you , because otherwise she cannot consider herself the most attractive woman in your life – if the whole of society agrees that they ’d cut off four fingers if it meant they ’d get to sleep with Angelina Jolie , then your stated lack of attraction toward her means that you find your girlfriend more doable than Lara Croft herself .
It ’s complicated , but can be summarized like this :
- Everybody thinks Scarlett Johansson is gorgeous .
- If you think Scarlett Johansson is gorgeous , then that also means you think Scarlett Johansson is more attractive than your girlfriend , thus making your girlfriend feel less special than Scarlett Johansson .
- If your girlfriend thinks you do n’t think Scarlett Johansson is gorgeous , then your girlfriend can continue to operate under the assumption that she is the most gorgeous woman in your life and that you are lucky to have her .
How to deal with it :
There are a dozen ways to handle this question , most of them pretty straightforward ( “ No ” is the shortest and easier to remember ) , but this question presents a fantastic chance to subtly show your girlfriend how much you really care about her .
When she asks the question , only refer to the celebrity in question by drawing comparisons between her and your girlfriend .
For example :
“ Do you think Eva Mendes is pretty ? ”
“ Well , she ’s got sort of a nice body , but she does n’t have your eyes . ”
“ I was n’t asking whether or not she looks like me .
I was asking whether you thought she ’s pretty . ”
“ I do n’t understand .
I just told you she was n’t pretty -- she does n’t have your eyes . ”
She ’ll pause for a minute , and then come to the realization that you are essentially using your girlfriend as the standard of beauty to which all other girls will be judged : she ’ll be so flattered that she might manage to have long , arduous sex with you without crying once .
“ Where do you want to go tonight ? ”
What it really means : “ Read my mind . ”
In all relationships , the time comes when the passion is over and done with , and the couple is required to actually go somewhere in an effort to stave off boredom .
When that time comes , the relationship basically becomes one big game of 20 questions .
Your girlfriend wants to go somewhere interesting , but she ( A ) wants to have nothing to do at all with where you end up , ( B ) wants to enjoy herself , and ( C ) wants you to pay for everything .
The problem , of course , is in actually guessing a destination that your girlfriend will enjoy .
If you ask her what she ’s in the mood for , you ’ll either get a bullshit answer ( “ I dunno ” ) or she ’ll tell you and immediately get irritated that you did n’t know her well enough to predict what she wanted .
How to deal with it :
Get a calendar .
Every four days , make sure you have a different activity planned , and follow through with each day ’s activity .
Alternatively , if she asks the question too many times just fill a bag with oranges and swing it around menacingly .
“ If you ask me that one more time , ” you can say , “ then this is what we ’re doing tonight . ”
“ What are you thinking ? ”
What it really means : “ Give me an excuse to yell at you . ”
No woman , in the history of humankind , has ever given two shits about a man ’s thoughts unless it involves him buying her something .
Ever .
So when she asks you “ what are you thinking , ” recognize it for the goddamn trap that it is .
There is literally no right answer to this question .
If you say you ’re thinking about her , she ’ll know you ’re lying .
If you say what you ’re really thinking about – usually about what a particular celebrity looks like naked – she ’ll get angry .
If you say something shallow ( “ Uh , nothing ” ) , she ’ll get angry that you are n’t deep , and if you say something deep , then she ’ll feel like you ’re totally full of shit .
And just so nobody accuses me of being Carlos Mencia / Eric Bauman , I know that Rondell Sheridan basically did a variation of this complaint during his standup routines .
How to deal with it :
“ How was your day ? ”
Kiss her on the mouth , really really hard .
With any luck , the pain will be enough that she ’ll forget what she asked you , and you can go about your business as if nothing happened .
What it really means : “ Ask me how my day was . ”
To be fair , this is not an exclusively female question : wanting to talk about oneself is just as big a part of human nature as wanting to seem like you do n’t actually want to talk to yourself .
Every person who asks you how your day was may nod and smile , may kindly pretend to listen as you recount the monotonous , depressing sequence of shit that was your day , but they ’re really just waiting you to get finished with your goddamn speech so they can tell you about how interesting their day was .
With girlfriends , the stakes are simply higher .
If you do n’t listen to a friend who tells you about their day , it does n’t really matter .
If you do n’t listen to your girlfriend , then you better get used to masturbating alone for the next week and a half .
Or buy roses .
But fuck that -- what ’s a week and a half , anyway ?
How to deal with it :
“ Do n’t our married friends seem happy ? ”
Make the summary of your day short and sweet so she can launch into her diatribe early and get it done quicker .
You do n’t really need to listen to the actualshe speaks so much as you need to watch her facial expressions .
Women ’s faces have a tendency to recreate the way they looked during specific parts of a story , and mimicking those facial expressions as she delivers them to you will make you seem like you are not only paying attention , but also extremely interested in her story .
What it really means : “ I want to get married . ”
Nine out of ten times the question wo n’t be phrased like this ( or worse , it wo n’t be a question ) , but the basic idea remains : your girlfriend is ready for a commitment that no intelligent man should ever , ever want to engage in .
The question might be somewhat forgivable if it was even halfway accurate : no , Diane , our married friends do n’t seem happy .
Rob ’s wife definitely seems happy , considering she gets to turn nagging into a full - time job , but there ’s a certain … deadness to Rob ’s eyes that is n’t really indicative of jubilance .
How to deal with it :
RUN
“ Do you love me ? ”
What it really means : “ Lavish me with compliments or I ’m leaving you . ” OR “ I am a clingy psychopath , please dump me . ”
We ’ve all dated that one chick who says “ I love you ” after two dates , and those are the chicks who most frequently ask this question .
It ’s tragic , really – psycho girls are so fun in short bursts , and yet all they want is a long - term commitment .
They ’re so cute and forgiving and nice and enthusiastic at the beginning of a relationship , but at the halfway point ( which , with chicks like this , is usually about a week after you ’ve met her ) they just lose it .
Dating and sex turns into love and marriage .
But still , at least those women are easy to diagnose and treat .
It ’s much more difficult to handle this question coming from someone you ’ve been dating for a long time .
Women in such a position usually ask this question because they have low self - esteem , or because their boyfriend is acting distant or selfish .
How to deal with it :
If we ’re talking about the psycho chick , the answer is simple ( albeit involved ) : dump her , cut off all contact with her , and change your locks .
If the question is coming from someone you ’re in a serious relationship with , no amount of reassuring will make a difference : if words meant anything to her , she would n’t have bothered asking in the first place .
The only real way to solve this problem is with money .
Buy her something .
It does n’t matter what , so long as it ’s more than 100 dollars .
You can buy her a goddamn fishing rod made of peppermint , so long as you include the receipt to show her the exact dollar value you place on her love .
“ Why ? ”
What it really means : I ’m not sure , actually
I have n’t personally had a lot of experience with this question , but I ’m told it pops up somewhat frequently .
In the same way that toddlers refuse to accept a simple answer to a complex question by constantly asking “ why , ” women will do the same in an attempt to trick you into saying something that ’ll make you look like a moron , so they have an excuse to verbally berate you .
How to deal with it :
“ Do you want to try new things ? ”
As I said , I have n’t personally had any experience with this one , so I ca n’t be sure .
Based on my limited knowledge , however , I would suggest simply leaving the room and doing something else : getting into a “ why ” conversation with a child only results in making the adult look like a moron , so who ’s to say that the same is n’t true when applied to an adult female ?
What it really means : “ I want to know exactly how much of a pervert you are . ”
The word “ things ” in that sentence refers to sexual experimentation .
While many women are , indeed , freaks in bed , they ’re usually not the ones who ask this question .
No , Superfreaks tend to be very up front with their sexual freedom , and will never even bother asking you if you ’re into something .
This question only comes from someone you ’ve been dating for a while , who is curious to see exactly how much of your “ I ’m just a romantic guy who does n’t just want to bone you ” act is true , and how much is total bullshit ( usually there ’s more of the latter than the former ) .
Your lady will sound like she ’s totally into any kinky sex act you ’re into , right up until you actually tell her : once you reveal that your ultimate fantasy is to dress up like an Elizabethan merchant and have your fanny spanked with a wooden oar , your lady will most likely drop the act and yell at you for being the total perv you are .
How to deal with it :
“ How come we do n’t ________ anymore ? ”
Do NOT say threesomes .
EVER .
Say something quasi-naughty , but not depraved : suggest a schoolgirl outfit , or make reference to “ role - playing ” without specifically stating what roles you want each partner to play .
Keep it vague , because it ’s not like she ’ll follow up on those desire anyway : after this question has been asked , your answer basically just serves as damage control .
What it really means : “ You ’re getting boring , and I am going to cheat on you next week if you do n’t do something interesting soon . ”
If you ’ve managed to stay with a woman long enough to hear this question , congratulations : you have more patience and self - control than most men will ever know .
This question ( hopefully ) does n’t pop up until after a few years of dating , at which point every story has been told , every sexual position has been attempted , and you ’ve gone to about a hundred different places on dates without managing to find anywhere interesting .
You usually hear this after getting married , which means you have n’t listened to any of the above advice – in which case , we ca n’t really help you .
How to deal with it :
At this point , the relationship is pretty much dead .
You can either do something drastic like plan a vacation in Venice , but the novelty of such a diversion will wear off shortly after returning home .
Your only two options are to ride out the misery for years and years simply because you have nowhere else to go ( like my grandparents did ) , or to find a really dramatic way of permanently ending your relationship .
My personal suggestion : wait until you ’re positive that your girlfriend is cheating on you ( which , statistically , shecheating on you ) , and simply catch her in the act .
You ’ll finally get an excuse to yell all those obscenities at her you ’ve been building up over the years .
And the best part ?
You ’ll never have to answer one of these questions that are n’t really questions ever again .
- ADD ME - 100 % Proof Google is Keeping Conspiracy Sites Down
" Link Relevance " Suppressed on Alternative Media
LUCUS 08/13/07
As if it were not bad enough that we are censored by the main stream media , now there 's a new type of suppression being implemented upon conspiracy related websites and alternative media sources .
It 's called Link Relevance Suppression , and it's being used on most of the alternative media websites to lower traffic being driven to them by the popular search engine Google .
It 's also being used in the opposite way to " Promote " Neo -Con supporting websites by giving them double the " Link Relevance "
Let me explain how Google indexes sites that go into the search cue when someone types in certain keywords relating that site .
Google has many different criteria when it decides how close to the top a website gets , but the main and most important one is Link Relevance .
It simply means in laymen 's terms ;
The more sites that link to your site , the higher you go on the list .
There is a simple way to check on Google how many other websites are linking to your website .
You go to Google and type in the word link : before the web address , for example ; link : www.theultimateconspiracy.com
Now here is where the proof is that Google has implemented some kind of script that is giving all the alternative media sites less that 1/4th of the Link Relevance that they deserve .
If you go to Google and simply type in www.yourwebsite.com you will find the REAL number of sites that have a link back to your website .
This does not mean that the sites are being added to the Link Relevance , it only shows that they have the link on their website .
Want proof ?
Let 's do some searches of various alternative media related websites and see what we get .
Click the links to see results ; link : www.infowars.com
http://www.infowars.com
Now notice that the " Link Search " brings up 2,960 pages that are linked back to www.infowars.com, but when you look at the actual numbers of sites with links to www.infowars.com the real number is 207,000 .
How about ; link: www.prisonplanet.com
www.prisonplanet.com
You get 2,530 " Link Relevance " , but the real number is 331,000 .
link:www.whatreallyhappened.com
www.whatreallyhappened.com
You get 2,840 " Link Relevance " , but the real number is 111,000 .
link:www.theultimateconspiracy.com
www.theultimateconspiracy.com
You get 0 " Link Relevance " , but the real number is 56 .
They are even doing it to popular alternative media sites like Huffingtonpost.com link:www.huffingtonpost.com
www.huffingtonpost.com
You get 47,000 " Link Relevance " , but the real number is 851,000 .
Now , let 's turn the tables and do a link search on a popular Neo - Con supporting website called Hotair.com , run by the Fox News Shill Michelle Malkin .
link: www.hotair.com
www.hotair.com
You get 11,400 " Link Relevance " , and the real number is 526 .
How about doing a search on Michelle Malkin 's personal site .
link:www.michellemalkin.com
www.michellemalkin.com
You get 38,200 " Link Relevance " , and the real number is 15,900 .
Notice how the numbers are flipped ?
This should have ANY webmaster up in arms .
Blatant censorship being implemented to keep the alternative media down and promote the Neo - Con Draconian agendas .
Did Google not think that somebody would figure this out eventually ?
Did they not think that this very noticeable censorship would go unchecked forever ?
I urge ALL Webmasters , Alternative Media Users , and anybody who cares about how sites are indexed on Google to contact them en mass and state your dissatisfaction about suppressing " Link Relevance " .
If Google gave sites like Infowars.com and Prisonplanet.com the " Link Relevance " that they deserve , these alternative media sites would be in direct competition with Main Stream Media sites that so dominate the Internet as we know it today .
Nothing like beating the competition by eliminating them , right Google ?

Peruvian archeologists have identified the earliest documented gunshot victim in the Americas , an Inca warrior who was shot by Spanish conquistadors in 1536 in the aftermath of a battle now known as the siege of Lima .
The body , of one of 72 apparent victims of the uprising , was found in a cemetery in the Lima suburb of Puruchuco during excavation for a new road , researchers reported Tuesday .
Many of the victims , including women and children , showed signs of extreme trauma , having been hacked , torn or impaled , said archeologist Guillermo Cock of Peru ’s National Institute of Culture .
Spanish records indicate the battle , which occurred near the area known as Lati Canal , took place Aug. 14 , 1536 , as a small group of conquistadors tracked down a group of Incas who had fought them the day before .
Advertisement
The records maintain that a few hundred conquistadors , led by Francisco Pizarro , used their superior weaponry and their horses to repel an attack by tens of thousands of Incas led by Manco Yupanqui .
After breaking the siege , the Spaniards tracked down and killed many of the Incas who had attacked , including the group at Puruchuco .
But the evidence casts the conquistadors in a less heroic light , Cock found .
The archeological evidence makes it clear that the Spaniards were accompanied by a large group of Indians who were fighting the Incas to escape subjugation .
Although as many as three of the Inca warriors were clearly shot and others had injuries apparently made by the Spaniards ’ metallic weapons , most of the 72 victims apparently were bludgeoned with more primitive stone weapons wielded by other Indians .
“ The great siege must have taken place in a very different manner than we have been told , ” said Efrain Trelles Arestegui , a historian at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in Lima , who was not connected with the research .
Only now , he added , are researchers revealing “ the great cover - up that took place in the 16th century . ”

The tale of the Puruchuco Inca “ is a remarkable detective story , ” said UCLA archeologist Christopher Donnan , who was not involved in the find .
“ Many archeologists might have missed [ the gunshot ] or assumed it was an anomaly . ”
The find , announced by the National Geographic Society and to be featured in a PBS special on Tuesday , “ has enormous symbolic value , ” said explorer Keith Muscutt of UC Santa Cruz .
“ We all have a mental image of indigenous people being destroyed by superior European technologies , and here it is -- tangible remains . ”
The Inca warrior was undoubtedly not the first native shot by Spaniards in the 44 years between Christopher Columbus ’ arrival and the Inca ’s death .
But the odds of finding such a victim are small , and the odds of finding a victim who could be linked so closely to documentary evidence are extremely low .
“ Putting together all the evidence , we do n’t have a doubt about what happened , ” Cock said .
“ Sometimes we have to speculate in order to connect evidence and event .
Here we found archeological evidence and the written record to connect it . ”

The site is only half a mile from the Lima shantytown where , in 2002 , Cock reported the discovery of more than 2,200 Inca mummies and more than 60,000 artifacts , the largest trove ever unearthed in Peru .
Cock and archeologist Elena Goycochea of the institute were asked to investigate the new Puruchuco site in 2004 by Lima ’s government , which planned to build a road there .
A preliminary trench on the site showed that it was a graveyard , and Cock immediately sought funding from the city and the National Geographic Society to excavate it .
“ It was unlooted -- had never been excavated by grave - robbers -- which is really , really rare in Peru , ” he said .
“ But it was at risk because it was too visible and looters would destroy it . ”
They have so far excavated more than 500 skeletons from the site , all dating from the Inca period .
The bulk of them exhibit classic Inca burials .
The skeletons are posed in a crouched position , carefully wrapped and buried facing east toward sunrise , ready for their rebirth .

But 72 of the skeletons were different .
They were not crouched but had been tied up or hastily wrapped ; their graves were unusually shallow , and they had been buried without offerings .
Most of them showed evidence of violence -- many quite severe .
One of the skeletons , in particular , had what appeared to be a bullet hole in its skull .
Cock initially thought the male was the victim of a modern crime .
Then , when it was clear that the bones were ancient , he feared that someone had been shooting into the ground at the site , damaging the skeletons .
But researchers also had the plug that had been knocked out of the skull by the projectile ’s entry , and analysis showed that the force of the impact was not caused by a modern weapon , but was consistent with the muzzle velocity of the arquebuses , or muzzleloaders , used by the Spanish during that period .
“ I saw the skull a year or so ago and was pretty convinced that it was a gunshot entry wound , with the classic clean entry hole and irregular fracturing and beveling on the internal table of the skull , ” said archeologist John W. Verano of Tulane University in New Orleans .
Advertisement
Cock ’s team took the skull and other bones to a hospital and had a CT scan done but could find no trace of metal .
Undaunted , Cock called in forensic scientists Tim Palmbach of the University of New Haven in West Haven , Conn. , and Al Harper , executive director of the university ’s Henry C. Lee Institute of Forensic Science .
They examined the skull and bone plug under a scanning electron microscope and found both were impregnated with iron , which was commonly used in Spanish musket balls .
“ We were skeptical that it was a gunshot wound .
We sought to disprove that , ” Palmbach said .
However , he said , “ there is nothing we have found or evaluated that is inconsistent with a gunshot wound . ”

The team has since found what appear to be bullet holes in two of the other skeletons .
Wounds on many of the bodies could only have been produced by steel weapons , the team found , indicating that conquistadors must have been involved in the battle .
But more of the skeletons showed evidence of massive damage not produced by modern weapons .
After examining Inca weapons at museums , Palmbach and Harper concluded that these injuries were most likely caused by the stone - headed clubs used by natives .
The bodies were hastily buried , Cock speculated , because the Inca , in the midst of their uprising , had no time to bury their dead in the appropriate traditional manner .

Last week , Mauricio Fernandez announced a new Ruby to OCaml bridge that he ’s working on , called rocaml .
With the growing interest in functional languages in the Ruby world , this seemed like the sort of thing I needed to talk to him about , so I sent off a quick set of questions , and this is what I heard back1 .
The strict typing and academic rigor of a language like OCaml and the free - wheeling nature of Ruby seem rather antithetical .
What made you want to combine them ?
I would n’t approach the relationship between Ruby and OCaml from that point of view :)
OCaml and Ruby are no more opposed than C and Ruby , and I do n’t think anybody questions the utility of writing extensions in C. Coding in Ruby is generally much more enjoyable than in C , but Rubyists , of all people , still do it for two reasons : for speed to access functionality provided by external libs with a C interface rocaml is only concerned with ( 1 ) , and must thus be judged by how easily you can make your Ruby application perform better .
In this regard , OCaml can be a better choice than C because : there ’s a huge difference in the level at which you can approach the problem to be solved
OCaml provides so many guarantees C just cannot .
You ’ll often see your C extension segfault while you ’re developing it ( and even worse , when it ’s in production too :| ) , and this just does n’t happen with OCaml .
rocaml allows you to pass rich native data types between Ruby and OCaml very conveniently .
Whereas RubyInline performs only a few basic conversions ( strings and integer types ) by default AFAIK ( it can be extended to recognize more complex types , but you have to write the conversion routines by hand ) , rocaml allows you to pass e.g. native lists of arrays of arrays of Structs containing floats from Ruby to OCaml and vice versa , and will verify that you ’re passing values of the correct type to the OCaml functions , ensuring type - safety .
Operating with native types is important : it means that your OCaml code needs not be sprinkled with functions to convert from an opaque Ruby VALUE type to concrete types , i.e. that your OCaml code must not be developed with Ruby in mind , and can be used standalone or come from a third party library that does n’t know anything about Ruby .
Going back to your question , it turns out that Ruby and OCaml have several things in common : they are both type - safe , strongly typed , and you could even say that OCaml is duck - typed to some extent .
But most importantly , they are both pleasant to work with .
One thing separating them is their relative performance at some tasks ; this difference is what makes rocaml worthwhile , very much like temperature differences can be used to perform work ( in the physical sense ) .
What kinds of things are you using ROCaml for ?
Have you heard of other people using it for other things ?
I do n’t know if anybody is using rocaml yet ; after all , the public has only been aware of its existence for a week , and all I did was post an announcement to the ruby - talk mailing list .
I ’ve seen in my httpd logs that a few people have made a local copy of the darcs repository , though .
As for what I am using rocaml for , I have an application where DB queries can be a bottleneck .
I ’m talking about everything from DB query execution to ORM to processing of the results within Ruby — queries that take several seconds ( before the ORM even kicks in ) and which you just cannot let PostgreSQL perform fast enough by adding indexes or denormalizing some tables .
I made a moderately - sized system in Objective Caml that can yield the desired performance ( I ’m talking about up to 2 - 3 orders of magnitude speed gains ) .
While I was working on it , I did n’t think about how it would interface to Ruby ; I only concerned myself with how clean the design was , and how well it could perform .
When the OCaml part was close to being “ ready ” , I created rocaml to generate the necessary interface .
Having native Ruby to / from OCaml conversions was an important aspect of it , as I did n’t want to pollute the OCaml code with things like ( int_of_VALUE num ) or ( string_of_VALUE s ) .
What kind of performance are you seeing with it ?
The short answer is : rocaml extensions will be as fast as the underlying OCaml code .
This means you often get a couple orders of magnitude faster .
rocaml ’s source tree includes a couple interesting examples : a ~30 - line implementation of sets based on RB trees , with 3X faster lookup than RBTree ( which is written in C )
a family of 2 - line specialized marshallers ( built upon OCaml ’s Marshal module ) that often operate ~ 5X faster than Ruby ’s ( again , we ’re talking about C code here )
The performance you get out of extensions written with rocaml is pretty much the speed you can get out of your OCaml code2 , except for the FFI and data conversion overheads .
Since rocaml converts Ruby VALUEs to native OCaml types , there ’s a small overhead ; for instance , if you have a function taking a string and you call it on a Ruby String object , the underlying string will have to be copied .
The cost of argument passing / return value copying is thus proportional to the size of the objects being passed from / to Ruby .
In practice , it will normally be irrelevant ; e.g. passing an array of floats takes half as much time as iterating over the elements in Ruby without doing anything ( array.each { } ) .
There is one case where you want to pass large values from ( to ) Ruby to ( from ) OCaml and copying the whole thing would be too expensive : data structures .
Say you have a sorted array of strings and need to find the position ( index ) of a given string using binary search .
Using an OCaml function of type string array -> string -> int ( equivalent to def binary_search ( array , string ) .... ) would make no sense , since we ’d end up copying the whole array in order to turn it into an OCaml array before performing the search !
rocaml can create opaque Ruby objects that wrap OCaml ones , in order to keep the data structures on OCaml ’s side and avoid large argument passing costs .
This is what the sets based on RB trees shipped with rocaml use .
The dual of that is to wrap Ruby VALUES in order to use them in OCaml .
This is doable , but the other approach is preferable in general because it allows you to write / reuse OCaml code oblivious of Ruby and it is faster .
That said , I might implement it anyway :)
1 Well , this is most of what I got back .
The rest is over at my On Ruby blog
Thank you Stu - Rock , I do n't know where cs1984 gets his info , but he needs to de-friend that person quick .
The big - 3 have laid - off more Americans than Honda or Toyota even emply .
Tons of US autos are still built in the US , and tons of foreign autos are not .
Try to buy a new Jeep that is n't built in the US , I dare you .
It 's ridiculous anyway .
The reason people buy foreign cars is not because it * might * be built in the US , and the reason people avoid US cars is not because they * might * be built in a different part of North America .
I would venture that over 90 % of people could n't even tell you where their car is manufactured .
Perception is everything .
I live in one of the counrty 's wealthier cities , and if you drive a domestic you will be questioned , it 's not socially acceptable .
If you tell someone you drive a domestic , the first thing they 'll say is " Why ? "

Google is trying to clean up its search results by cracking down on dubious Web sites that contain little content but lots of ads .
The search giant has notified a number of Web publishers in the last few days that they will be dropped from its popular “ AdSense ” program starting June 1 .
The cut - off notices jolted the online ad world , where hundreds of thousands of people make money in exchange for allowing Google to place ads on their Web sites .
Google ’s AdSense software has made it easy for advertisers to piggyback on any Web site – no matter how obscure – that attracts an audience .
For example , on a travel Web site , Google ’s AdSense will automatically serve up relevant travel - related ads on that site .
Web site publishers then get paid each time a visitor clicks on one of the ads supplied by Google .
The easy money has led to a rise in “ made - for - AdSense ” Web pages that critics say clutter up the Internet and divert online searches .
These content - free sites , which often are nothing more than links to other sites and a bunch of Google ads , exist solely to exploit AdSense .
“ The economy has built up to game the Google system , ” said Darren Chervitz , the director of research for Jacob Asset Management .
Web site publishers do it by pocketing the difference between what they pay Google to drive traffic to their site and the amount they get for running Google ads .
For instance , a publisher can bid on a cheap search term , say , “ purple raincoat ” so that its site purporting to be about raingear is displayed each time someone searches for the term on Google .
The publisher may pay a nickel to Google each time someone clicks on the link to their Web site , which may be nothing more than a picture of a purple raincoat .
The publisher makes money if , on average , they collect a dime each time a user then clicks on one of the Google - supplied AdSense ads .
Although Google still makes money off of these sites , they do n’t like them because they hurt the quality of search results and reduce the “ click through ” rate for advertisers .
“ If advertisers get a bad return on their investment , they will stop spending money , ” said Jeremy Schoemaker , an AdSense expert who runs the popular ShoeMoney.com blog .
Search experts said Google routinely cuts off publishers who run afoul of AdSense rules , but they believe this latest round of notices was a more widespread effort to clean up its ad network .
“ I do n’t really remember where this many people reported it at one time , ” said Chris Winfield , president of Internet search marketing firm 10e20 .
Google confirmed that it had sent out notices , but characterized it as part of an ongoing review .
“ In some cases , violations of our program policies will result in termination from AdSense , ” Google said in a statement .

A Post By : Darren Rowse
This tip was submitted via email by DPS reader , Todd .
Hi Darren , here ’s a tip that I ’d love to share with your readers .
When I ’m out and about with my digital camera I ’ve gotten into the habit of taking at least two shots of almost every scene that I see .
A Symmetrical shot and an Asymmetrical one ( or one with the subject dead centre and one with it off centre ) .
I know that compositional rules like the rule of thirds say to put your main object off centre to create more interest in your shot ( and I agree that it usually gets the best results ) but sometimes the most stunning shot is the one when you put the main point of interest slap bang in the middle of your shot and where there ’s real symmetry in the image .
As a result I ’ve trained myself to always take at least two shots – one looking for to use the rule of thirds and asymmetry and the other with as much symmetry as possible .
The beauty of digital photography is that it does n’t cost any more to take two shots than one and the results of doing so mean when I get back to my PC I have the choice of two shots of most scenes .
PS from Darren : Great tip Todd .
I have another friend who tells me that she does something similar – but her two shots are always one in a horizontal framing and the other in the vertical framing .
Why do some online communities succeed , like Second Life , Facebook and , well , this one , and some fail ?
The answer may be in what their communities think about ' giving ' and it can tell us a lot about people in general .
Everyone does something on social sites for a reason .
People like to ' get paid ' even if that does n't mean money .
It is why people submit articles to Digg - submitters get the satisfaction of knowing they brought an interesting article to people that they may not have found themselves .
Or , in the case of Newsvine , they may literally be getting paid to write interesting articles for the community .
Jörgen Skågeby of Linköping University in Sweden has broken this into five aspects of " giving " and it can tell us a lot about who we are as a society on a macro - level and on a micro - level , like here .
Those five aspects are :
Initiative - Advice to a stranger , a useful URL , making a file available .
Direction - A public gift , like an MP3 from a band to a group of listeners , a photographer sharing their work on ImageShack .
Incentive -
If you give , you get .
BitTorrent and file sharing service that offer you things you want in return for sharing it with others .
Identification - an anonymous gift is an entirely different mindset than a public one .
Myspace as opposed to anonymous file sharing .
Limitation - a trial version of software , for example , is different than freeware .
These only talking giving and not about getting .
What people ' get ' in return is implied .
A trial version of software might lead to a full purchase , one MP3 may lead to a listener buying a CD , some BitTorrent users like tweaking large media companies so they want to share files .
Everyone is ' getting paid ' in that sense .
What about science and science sites ?
Some scientists like to write but why would that be the case ?
Writing peer reviewed articles is almost as thankless as doing the peer reviewing .
On a site such as this one , most writers will not make enough in advertising revenue to change their lifestyles .
So there must be other reasons .
Those other reasons are how empires are made in the social community world .
I do n't truly understand a site like Dogster.com , which seems to be Friendster - for dogs - but it doubled its users last year and made over a million dollars .
That is an unqualified success .
The dogs , the focus of the site , are n't really getting anything out of it but the people are .
So it may be with science blogging .
Nothing in science itself is materially changed because we write about it .
Stars are not born , biology is not advanced , the mysteries of the brain are not solved .
Yet we started this as a private beta with just a few writers in the beginning of February and had 100,000 readers in just the last week .
Why did that happen ?
Science is inevitably intertwined with science policy .
By writing about science , and having people read about science , we affect policy and voting so if science is important to us we ' get paid ' by knowing we have made a difference .
Our gift is good science and at that we succeed but can you really even be a failure if your costs are low ?
Not on a balance sheet , but a failure in this kind of site would be if scientists do n't know their writing - their gifts to society - are appreciated and so they stop doing it .
Everyone knows how many readers they get for an article but a pat on the back from other writers or a healthy discourse with readers in the comments section is a good thing also .
So if you 're reading this , ' gift ' something back to the community .
Sign up as a registered member , vote for articles you like on the site ( that little + you see below " Peers " ) , leave a comment , refer your friends , submit an article here to a large social site .
Or even write your own articles if you know science and want to write about it .
That 's the Initiative gift Skågeby talks about above .
Writers feel good knowing you 're reading and they 'll feel good if they know you care .
' Gifting ' is not a sometimes thing , it really is a central human activity .
As our reach extends to more and more online social and science communities , how we ' gift ' will really shape who we are .
Sparse gets a maintainer
The " sparse " utility has long been one of Linux 's best - kept secrets .
It is a static analysis tool which can find a wide variety of bugs in the kernel code base ; sparse is a useful tool , but it can be surprisingly hard to find .
It has never had a web page , and almost no distributions package it .
Interested users must , instead , track down the git tree or Dave Jones 's snapshot directory
Sparse was originally written by Linus Torvalds , but he has not done much with it for a while , and he recently suggested that somebody else should take it over :
Anyway , I suspect it would be better if people did n't consider me the maintainer for sparse , simply because it does the things I really cared about , and as a result I 'm not really very active .
As a result of this discussion , sparse has a new maintainer : Josh Triplett .
Josh started things off with sparse 0.1 , the first - ever sparse release with a version number .
He has set up a new git tree for sparse , and , even , a sparse web page .
Josh was kind enough to answer some questions posed by your editor .
It turns out that he has been working with sparse for a while ; it was part of his PhD work , where he enhanced it to be able to verify proper use of the read - copy - update ( RCU ) primitives .
That work continued at IBM over the summer , where he was able to work on RCU verification with Paul McKenney .
As a result , his first priority for sparse in the near future is the continuation of the RCU work .
This effort is also expanding into locking verification in general ; some of the necessary annotations and resulting fixes have gone into the 2.6.18 and 2.6.19 - rc kernels .
Josh also plans to work on the elimination of false positives and on noise reduction in general .
Then , there 's various patches from other developers which have been floating around for a while and really need to be merged into the sparse mainline .
In terms of project management , Josh says :
I plan to continue making regular Sparse releases , and I 'd like to get Sparse packaged in various distributions , at least in their " experimental " sections or equivalent .
Any potential distribution packagers , feel free to join the linux - sparse list , and let me know what I can do to help or to get things going more smoothly .
Getting sparse into distributions could only help increase its use - and bring about a corresponding reduction in bugs in shipped code .
This will be especially true if Josh succeeds in another one of his goals : expanding sparse usage beyond the kernel into user - space projects .
X.org seems like it could be an early sparse adopter .
Longer - term , Josh wants to look at more advanced techniques which can look at larger chunks of a program and find potential bugs .
Part of this effort will require attracting other researchers interested in static analysis to the sparse platform .
Says Josh :
I feel that several classes of bugs exist in the Linux kernel and in userspace code which simply should not exist , because the tools exist to find and eliminate almost all of them .
This includes bugs like " scheduling while atomic " , __init - related bugs , errors on error paths , and many locking - related bugs .
One can only imagine that free software users all over are wishing Josh the best of luck in his effort to track down and get rid of all those unnecessary bugs .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Offering a grammar lesson guaranteed to make any English teacher cringe , President George W. Bush told a group of New York school kids on Wednesday : “ Childrens do learn . ”
President George W. Bush talks , surrounded by children from Public School 76 , in New York , September 26 , 2007 .
Offering a grammar lesson guaranteed to make any English teacher cringe , Bush told the group of school kids on Wednesday : " Childrens do learn . "
REUTERS / Larry Downing
Bush made his latest grammatical slip - up at a made - for - TV event where he urged Congress to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act , the centerpiece of his education policy , as he touted a new national report card on improved test scores .
The event drew New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , Education Secretary Margaret Spellings plus teachers and about 20 fourth and fifth graders from P.S. 76 .
During his first presidential campaign , Bush -- who promised to be the “ education president ” -- once asked : “ Is our children learning ? ”
On Wednesday , Bush seemed to answer his own question with the same kind of grammatical twist .
“ As yesterday ’s positive report card shows , childrens do learn when standards are high and results are measured , ” he said .
The White House opted to clean up Bush ’s diction in the official transcript .
Bush is no stranger to verbal gaffes .
He often acknowledges he was no more than an average student in school and jokes about his habit of mangling the English language .
Just a day earlier , the White House inadvertently showed how it tries to prevent Bush from making even more slips of the tongue than he already does .
As Bush addressed the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday , a marked - up draft of his speech briefly popped up on the U.N .
Web site , complete with a phonetic pronunciation guide to get him past troublesome names of countries and world leaders .
Police followed the vehicle in a sedately paced chase
Tank on rampage
John Robert Patterson , 45 , allegedly smashed six properties including an electrical substation in a path of destruction through six suburbs .
Police followed the vehicle in a sedately paced chase until it stalled .
A defence lawyer said Mr Patterson claimed " that certainly he had authority to behave in such a manner " .
Mr Patterson appeared in the Parramatta Bail Court on Saturday and was denied bail pending another hearing on Monday .
He has been charged with malicious damage , breaking and entering , using a weapon to avoid arrest , predatory driving , possessing a prohibited drug and driving dangerously .
The magistrate recommended Mr Patterson receive psychiatric attention .
' Coverage problems '
The incident began when police noticed the vehicle destroying a substation in Minchinbury at about 0200 local time on Saturday ( 1200 GMT ) .
Officers called for back - up and pursued the vehicle at speeds averaging 30 km / h ( 19 mph ) as it crashed through masts , fences and telecom relay sheds .
They moved in as it stalled trying to bring down another mobile phone tower in the suburb of Dean Park .
Police gave no reason why Mr Patterson had targeted the masts .
Telecoms firm Telstra said there would be " coverage problems " and it might have to install temporary phone towers once it was given access by police .
INDIANOLA , Iowa ( Reuters ) - Six Democratic
White House contenders mixed grilled steak and raw politics on Sunday , courting Iowa voters with promises of change and pledges to end the Iraq war and reverse many of President George W. Bush ’s policies .
Democratic Presidential candidates and U.S. Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) ( L ) , Bill Richardson ( C ) , Governor of New Mexico and U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) stand for the National Anthem during the 30th annual Harkin Steak Fry in Indianola , Iowa , September 16 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Joshua Lott
At Iowa Sen .
Tom Harkin ’s 30th annual “ steak fry , ” the candidates sampled the cuisine and fired up a big crowd of Democratic activists in the state that holds the first nominating contest in less than four months .
“ Iowa is going to decide who will be the next president , not the chattering classes in Washington D.C. , ” said New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson .
More than 12,000 people , a record for the event , gathered on a grassy field normally used as a launching pad for Indianola ’s summertime hot air balloon races to cheer the White House candidates .
New York Sen. Hillary Clinton leads the Democratic pack in national polls , but in Iowa state polls she is in a three - way dogfight with Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards , the party ’s 2004 vice presidential nominee .
The candidates urged Iowans to turn out to the polls in the November 2008 election , when Democrats hope to recapture the White House and increase the party ’s majorities in Congress .
“ Some of you out here -- you ’re just sick and tired of George Bush , ” Obama said .
“ We need a fundamental change . ”
Slideshow ( 10 images )
Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , said Bush made it clear last week he had no intention of ending the Iraq war before he left office .
“ One of us on this stage is going to have to end the war he started , and that is deadly serious , ” Biden said .
Obama , Biden , Richardson , Clinton , Edwards and Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut appeared at the event .
Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich and former Alaska Sen .
Mike Gravel were not invited because they do not have active campaigns in Iowa .
The crowd was bigger than the 10,000 who gathered in the rain in 2003 to hear from the Democrats running for president and from former President Bill Clinton , who took the stage at the end .
Harkin , who endorsed former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean in 2004 only to see his campaign collapse in Iowa , has said he is unlikely to endorse a Democrat before Iowa votes in January .
Last year , about 3,000 people gathered to get an early glimpse of Obama , who had not declared for president but urged the crowd to send Democrats to Congress .
To enter the field , ticket - holders had to walk a gauntlet of mostly college - aged kids yelling , ringing bells , blowing whistles and beating drums for their favorite candidate .
Dave Hammer , 46 , of Urbandale , Iowa , said he was not ready to make a choice yet .
“ It ’s way too early , ” Hammer said , saying he wanted to hear the candidates but his sole hope for the afternoon was “ for some good steak . ”
Julie Bulver , 50 , of Pleasant Hill , Iowa , was staking out some ground about two hours before the candidates were to begin speaking , aiming for the best view of the outdoor stage .
“ It ’s history .
I ’m hoping that one of these people will be our future president , ” she said .
“ That ’s why we brought the kids . ”

[ Meadow 1 ] ハイレベル API で定義されたフォントの読み込みを高速 化
Meadow （1.15 以前）のフォント設定は、README.Meadowにありますが、ハイレベルAPIでの設定だと、どうも時間がかかってしまうようです（PIII 850 MHzの環境で起動 7 秒中 5 秒くらいは取られている感じ）。 一方、ローレベ ルAPI で設定すると、今度は逆にゴミが残ったりして、なかなかうまくいきません。どうしたもんかな、Meadow メーリングリスト アーカイブを眺めていたらハイレベル API で設定した fontset の情報をキャッシュとして書き出す方法が書いてある記事を見つけました（[ MD:2019 ] change - fontset - from - request can't change Japanese-italic - fonts .）。

.emacs.el 2,565行、バイトコンパイル済み
、Pentium M 1.6G , Memory 1G , meadow 2 で 1.256 msec.
くらいでした。meadow 1 に比べると meadow 2 は起動が遅いようです。この時点では、 「 使わないファイルは load しない 」 、 「 ネットワーク越しのファイルを見にいかない」というくらいしか注意していませんでした。 次に .emacs.el を少しダイエットして 2,009 行 で 591 msec. ぐらいになりました。数百 msec.
かかる migemo - init を消したり（さらに 、SKK - JISYO.L の代わりにSKK - JISYO .ML を辞書に用いると migemo - init は 1/3 程度）、幾つか elisp package を読み込まないようにしました。まだ meadow 1 ( 220 msec. ) との差は大きいです。起動時間のうち、scroll-bar-mode を消したり、menu - bar- mode を消したりするのが約 100 msec.
占めているようなので、これらを最初から消す方法がないか調べてみました。
色々調べて、meadow 2 の lisp / startup.el の設定と lisp / term /w32 - win.el の ( scroll - bar - mode nil ) のコメントアウトを外して 、meadow の再インストールしたら、起動時から menu- bar , scroll - bar , tooltip , tool - bar , blink - cursor をオフにすることができました。この変更の結果、起動時間は 500 msec となり（体感はそれ以上）だいぶ速くなってきました。（追記 : tool - bar や tooltip などの幾つかの built - in な elisp は不要に思えるが、他の elisp との依存関係から除くのは難しいようです） いつの間にか 611 msec .
ぐらいまで遅くなっていたので、昔の version の meadow でコンパイルされた *.el を今の meadow でバイトコンパイルし直すと 、530 msec .
になりました（追記 : これはどうも他の既に正しくバイトコンパイルされているファイルを、不適当にバイトコンパイルしてしまった副作用のようです）。ps-print.el
が 5,000 行以上あって重いようだったので、後で notepad 経由の印刷にでも置き換えることにして消したら 490 msec .
となりました。さらに、時間のかかっている shell - command は個人的には grep の時にしか使わないので、 ( eval - after - load " compile " '( require ' shell - command ) ) として、440 msec.、それでもまだ meadow1 ( 170 msec. ) との差は大きい。portable dumper と unexec の違い ( Meadow.dmp の読み込み ) のためだろうか？ after - init - hook の末尾に ( my- time - lag ) を置いて、より正確なロード時間を測ってみたら、480 msec. となりました。30 msec.
ぐらい、履歴のロードなどに時間をとられているようでさらに調べると、locate-library のライブラリチェックが 70 msec.
ぐらいかかっているようだったので ( load " physical - line " t) のように書くことにした。これで、401 msec .。 さらに、最初に読み込まれるロードパス？のうち、今はまず使わない
BDF フォント関係のファイルをよそに移動したら、320 msec.
になった。ついでに、mule-ucs も普段は使わないので、load-path 上に置かないようにしました。これで、260 msec. となった。不用意に沢山のディレクトリに load - path を通すと良くないのだろうか？いちいち下位ディレクトリ subdirs.el を探しに行くからか？これ以上は無理かな。これで meadow 1 ( 220 msec. ) と起動時間は変わらない。ただし最初の frame が出るまでのタメのようなのがあるのは気になる。
Emacs のマニュアル （GNU Emacs Internals / Building Emacs の章）によると、ソース中で lisp / site - load.el とやらを作ってファイルを作り、その中にデフォルトで load する elisp などを書いておくと、それらを読み込んで dump してくれるらしい。より正確には、dump 時に読み込む lisp / loadup.el から lisp / site - load.el や lisp / site - init.el が読み込まれるようです。*Message* で確認できるのは ( load " ... " t) で読み込まれたファイルだけなので、 ( insert ( prin1 - to - string features ) ) （ features は最後に読み込まれたものが先頭要素になっている）を * scratch *
で評価して他に読み込まれているファイルを確認した後、試しに、ソースに含まれている以下のファイルを依存関係に注意して site-load.el に入れてみました。コンパイルするために、src/alloc.c
の PDUMP_SUBR_DOC_SIZE
と、src/makefile.meadow.w32-in と nt/makefile.def の PDUMP_OBJECT_ARRAY_SIZE
を1〜2割ぐらい増やしておく必要がありました。*
印は入れておくと特に効果があると思われるもの。あまり入れすぎると、Meadow.dmp が肥大化して IO に時間がかかってしまうと思う。コメントアウトしてあるのはあまり効果がなかったもの。 ;; ( load " toolbar/tool - bar " t ) ;; ( load " tooltip " t) ;; ( load " language /japan-util " t ) ( load " international / encoded - kb " t) ( load " emacs-lisp/bytecomp " t) ;; * ( load " emacs-lisp/byte-opt " t) ;; * ただし、emacs-lisp/bytecomp に依存 ( load " emacs-lisp / advice " t) ;; * ( load " emacs-lisp/regexp-opt " ) ;; * ( load " font - lock " t) ;; * ただし、regex - opt に依存 ( load " time " t ) ( load " minibuf - eldef " t ) ( load " uniquify " t) ;; ただし、emacs - lisp / advice に依存 ( load " paren " t ) ( load " hl - line " t ) ( load " windmove " t ) ;; ( load " international /mw32script " t) ( load " emacs-lisp/easymenu " t) ( load " emacs-lisp/easy - mmode " t) ;; ( load " time - stamp " t ) ;; ( load " international / fontset " t) ;; ( load " image - file " t ) portable dumper はちゃんとこれらのファイルを読み込んで dump してくれたようです。また、外部 emacs lisp （例えば physical - line.el とか mcomplete.el） は site - load.el でなく、site - init.el で読み込むことで dump できました。ただし、結局読み込めないもの（minibuf-isearch.el , mic - paren.el , session.el など）もありました 。Meadpw.dmp のサイズが1割強 ( 2199 KB -> 2565 KB ) 大きくなったのが気になるが、load するファイルの半分ぐらいを dump に回したおかげで 、1,951行 、100 msec .
になりました。体感でも確かにさらに少し速くなったように感じます。
最後に、起動時の最初の frame の出現位置とサイズが気になっていたので、これも変える事にしました。まず site - init.el に initial - frame - alist として default - frame - alist で指定しているのと同じ位置に emacs が立ち上がるように書き、初回起動時に左上の隅っこの方で立ち上がってズズズと後で動く気持ち悪さを無くしました。さらに、lisp/term/w32-win.el の " default " フォントを設定しているところを書き換えて、いつも使うフォントを書いたら、windows
のリサイズを見なくて済むようになりました。（注意）個人で変更する設定を dump 時に読み込まれるこれらのファイルに書くのは、マニュアルによれば非推奨とのことです。 色々追加したりしていたら 130 msec.
かかるようになっていたので、徹底した on demand 化をした。具体的には 、migemo , tex - site ( auctex ) , mode - info の3 つ 。migemo は論文を書いたりプログラム書くときには使わないし、tex -site は latex を書かない限り使わないし、mode - info は .emacs.el を書き換えるときしか使わないため。80 msec. と 100 msec. を切った。dump に入れてたファイルでも、こっちに回せるのがあるかも。after-init-hook でファイルを読み込んだりしてるパッケージはダメ（migemoはそうだけど、自分はキャッシュファイルとかを使っていないので）だけど。こんなコードを書いて 10 msec. でも速くしようという感覚はもはや病的かもしれない。require-safe は load - safe を参考に書いた 「 失敗してもこけない 」 require です。 ;; migemo は日本語のファイルを初めて開いたときに読み込む ( defadvice find - file ( after my - migemo - invoke activate ) ( when ( my- language - check " Japanese " ) ;; 参照 : 日本語でない文書では isearch 時に migemo をオフにする ( when ( require - safe ' migemo ) ;; ( require - safe ' kogiku ) ( setq w32-pipe-read - delay 0 ) ) ( ad - deactivate ' find - file ) ( ad - disable - advice ' find - file ' after ' my - migemo - invoke ) ; 自分を消す ( ad- activate ' find - file ) ) ) ;; auctex は tex ファイルを初めて読んだときに読み込む ( defadvice find - file ( before my - auctex - invoke activate ) ( let ( ( file ( ad - get- arg 0 ) ) ) ( when ( or ( string - match " \.tex $ " file ) ( string - match " \.bib $ " file ) ) ( require - safe ' tex - site ) ( ad - deactivate ' find - file ) ( ad - disable - advice ' find - file ' before ' my - auctex - invoke ) ; 自分を消す ( ad- activate ' find - file ) ) ) ) ;; mode - info は .emacs.el を初めて読んだときに読み込む ( defadvice find - file ( after my - mode - info - invoke activate ) ( when ( string= ( expand - file - name ( ad - get- arg 0 ) ) ( expand - file - name " ~/.emacs.el " ) ) ( when ( require - safe ' mode - info ) ( define - key global - map " \C - hf " ' mode - info - describe - function ) ( define - key global - map " \C - hv " ' mode - info - describe - variable ) ( define - key global - map " \M -.

上に書いたログも含めて、この通りやってとんでもないことが起きても何の責任も取りませんが、
当たり前だが無駄な elisp を削除する。特に（サイズの大きい）別ファイルを load しているもの。 新しく追加した elisp ( package ) は、使用するバージョンの emacs でバイトコンパイルする。 余分な IO を減らすため、 ( when ( locate - library " ... " ) ( load " ... " ) ) しないで単に ( load " ... " t ) するか load - safe を使う。 HOME で他のサーバー上のディレクトリを指定している場合、save - history , session , saveplace , migemo などの使う （after - init - hook で起動時に読み込まれる）ファイルはローカルに保存するようにする。.emacs.el の最初に、 ( cd " ローカルのダミーパス " ) 最後に ( cd ( getenv " HOME " ) ) OR ( cd " ~/ " ) と書くと起動が速くなることがあった。
余計なロードパスを削除する。subdirs.el があるディレクトリは特に注意。site - lisp など。他にも 、( Meadow - version ) / lisp/ subdirs.el に書き連ねてあるデフォルトのロードパスで、自分にとって必要の無いパスを幾つか消すと、何となく最初のフレームが出るまでの1秒ぐらいの「ため」の頻度が減るような感じがする。でも、理由は良く分からない。さらに下位ディレクトリに subdirs.el を探しに行くからだろうか。 起動していても使わないで終わってしまう elisp はできるだけ eval - after - load を使って on demand で読み込むようにする。例えば、ローカルの html ファイルしか表示しないのなら 、w3 m の設定は ( load - path を通すところから ) ( eval - after - load " html- helper - mode " '( progn ... ) ) とする。 （もし自分一人しか使わない環境であれば）build 時に最適化する。ソースディレクトリの lisp / startup.el と lisp / term /w32 - win.el を編集する。menu-bar , tool - bar , scroll - bar を消すなら最初から消しておく。lisp / site- load.el にデフォルトで読み込まれる elisp を書き並べる。lisp/site-init.el にデフォルトのフレームを書いておく。また、dump 時には lisp / loadup.el から lisp / site- load.el -> lisp / startup.el -> lisp / site - init.el の順に読まれる。emacs のマニュアルの System Interface / Starting Up / Start - up Summary 辺りを読むと分かるが、lisp / term/w32-win.el は dump 時には読まれない。 もう体感は meadow 1 とあまり変わらない。ほぼ一瞬 。Emacs は、一度立ち上げたらしばらく（時には何日も）立ち上げっぱなしだから、起動に時間がかかっても気にはならないけど、やはり素早く立ち上がると気持ちがいい。ランチャーを使っていて emacs を起動するまでの手続きが気にならないので、沢山沢山ファイルを開いて、気分的にもっさりしてうんざりしたときなど、サッと消してまた気分一新して立ち上げ直す、そういうことをしたくなる快適さだ。ブラボーだ。もうこれ以上スピード上げなくてもいい。 追記 ( 04/02/08 ) : Meadow memo さんの PukiWiki の起動速度で紹介してもらった。load , require を autoload に置き換えると良いらしい。なるほど。しかし、そもそも自分の環境には既に autoload に置き換えられる load , require があまり無かった・・・。ロード後であることを想定した設定（キーバインディング等）などは、autoload で指定するファイルに load や require で読むファイルを指定しているのなら、eval - after - load でやったらダメかなーと思った。あと良く考えると autoload を提供しているパッケージを読み込むときはデフォルトの設定が autoload なことが多いので、それであまり無かったのかも。気がついた関数については、時間があるときに試してみよう。と思ったが、徹底した on demand をした結果、起動時に は mic-paren.el しか .emacs.el からは読んでいないので、最適化の余地が無くなってしまった。
エラー箇所へのジャンプつき .emacs.el の自動バイトコンパイル 巷でよく見る .emacs.el の自動コンパイル の改良バージョンです。既存のもので何が問題かというと、三好さんの
Emacs Evil Tips にもあるように、終了時に .emacs.el を自動バイトコンパイルしようとするとエラーを見逃すということです。かと言って、保存のたびにバイトコンパイルされるのも煩いので、その辺が起きないようにしたバージョンです。まずは
M-s での手動コンパイル。 ( defun my - emacs - lisp - byte - compile ( ) ( interactive ) ( if ( save - window - excursion ( emacs - lisp - byte - compile ) ) ( message " current buffer is successfully byte - compiled . " ) ( let ( errs errl errc errp ) ( with - current - buffer " * Compile - Log * " ( goto - char ( point - max ) ) ( forward - line - 1 ) ;; * Compile - Log* がエラー箇所の情報を含まないときだけ ;; * Compiler Input * に基づきジャンプ ( cond ( ( re- search - forward " ^.+:\\(.+\\) :\\(.+\\) : Error : \\ (.+\\ ) $ " nil t ) ( setq errl ( string - to - number ( match - string 1 ) ) errc ( string - to - number ( match - string 2 ) ) errs ( match - string 3 ) ) ) ( ( re-search - forward " !! \\(.+\\ ) " nil t ) ( setq errp ( with - current - buffer " * Compiler Input * " ( point ) ) errs ( match - string 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( cond ( errp ( unless ( = errp ( point - max ) ) ( goto - char errp ) ) ) ( t ( goto - line errl ) ( forward - char errc ) ) ) ( message errs ) ) ) )
M-s でバイトコンパイルしますが、バイトコンパイルの結果についてはミニバッファで報告します。どうせ
* Compile - Log* なんか見なくてもどこでエラーが出てるかが分かることがほとんどでしょうから、バイトコンパイルに失敗したときは、*Compile-Log*
からエラーメッセージだけ抜き出して出力しています。これを使って終了時に自動バイトコンパイルするコードは次のような感じ。
( add - hook ' kill - emacs - query - functions ( lambda ( ) ( if ( file - newer - than - file - p " ~/.emacs.el " " ~/.emacs.elc " ) ( if ( save - window - excursion ( byte-compile - file " ~/.emacs.el " ) ) t ;; 自動コンパイルに成功→ emacs を終了 ( let ( errs errl errc errp ) ( switch - to - buffer ( find- file " ~/.emacs.el " ) ) ( with - current - buffer " * Compile - Log * " ( goto - char ( point - max ) ) ( forward - line - 1 ) ;; * Compile - Log* がエラー箇所の情報を含まないときだけ ;; * Compiler Input * に基づきジャンプ ( cond ( ( re- search - forward " ^.+:\\(.+\\) :\\(.+\\) : Error : \\ (.+\\ ) $ " nil t ) ( setq errl ( string - to - number ( match - string 1 ) ) errc ( string - to - number ( match - string 2 ) ) errs ( match - string 3 ) ) ) ( ( re-search - forward " !! \\(.+\\ ) " nil t ) ( setq errp ( with - current - buffer " * Compiler Input * " ( point ) ) errs ( match - string 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( cond ( errp ( unless ( = errp ( point - max ) ) ( goto - char errp ) ) ) ( t ( goto - line errl ) ( forward - char errc ) ) ) ( message errs ) nil ) ) ;; 自動コンパイルに失敗→ emacs を終了しない t ) ) ) ;; ファイルが更新されていない→ emacs を終了 これで終了時に .emacs.el を自動バイトコンパイルして失敗したときは、emacs
を終了せずその旨ミニバッファに出力してくれるでしょう。 追記 : この手のコードは、.emacs.el
のできるだけ先頭に書いておくことをお勧めします。というのは、.emacs.el
をいじった結果「バイトコンパイルは出来たけど起動したらエラーメッセージが出た」ということが時々あります。そういう場合、エラーの出たところで処理が止まってしまいます。そういうとき、エラーの出たところより前にこのコードを書いてあれば、変更した後でも M-x byte-compile- file などと面倒なコマンドを打たなくて済みます。 [ 追 記
05/01/02 ] lisp / bytecomp.el のバージョンが新しければ" * Compile - Log * " の情報を、そうでなければ "
* Compiler Input * " の情報を利用して、エラーが起きた行数に自動ジャンプするようにした。ただし、有意な情報が取れなかったときにはジャンプしない。
ちょっとした機能を追加する
emacs に幾つかの機能を追加します。既存の emacs lisp パッケージでカバーできるものも含まれていますが、最低限の emacs lisp で必要な機能を実現することを目指してみました 。
[ emacs 21 ] バッファ移動を簡単に（バッファリスト表示付き）
バッファ移動を簡単に，C-,（降順）とC-.（昇順）で出来るようにします。バッファの数が多くなりすぎて目的のバッファがどこにあるのか分からなかったときのために、バッファリスト表示するようにしました。バッファをそんなに開かない人向け。emacs

のようにインクリメンタルには絞り込みません。先頭一致だけで良いなら、( icomplete や mcomplete などのパッケージを読み込んで ) ( = my - op - mode 4 ) の body 部で read - string の代わりに read - buffer を使えば良いです。部分一致でインクリメンタルに絞り込みたいなら最初から iswitchb を使った方が良いでしょう。 ( defvar my - ignore - blst ; 移動の際に無視するバッファのリスト '( " * Help * " " * Mew completions * " " * Completions * " " * Shell Command Output * " " * Buffer List * " ) ) ( defvar my - vblst nil ) ; 移動開始時の buffer list を保存 ( defvar my - bslen 15 ) ; buffer list 中の buffer name の最長値 ( defvar my - blst - display - time 2 ) ; buffer list の表示時間 ( defface my - cbface ; buffer list 中の current buffer を示す face '( (t ( : foreground " red " : underline t ) ) ) nil ) ( defvar my - op - mode ) ; 自動設定される変数 ( 1 前移動 2 次移動 3 ID 移動 4 フィルタ ) ( defvar my - spliter - alist ; バッファ表示中のバッファ間のスプリッタ '( ( 1 .

マルチバイト文字でバッファを作ると改行幅計算がおかしくなるので length を string - width に直した 。
isearch でコメント行だけをサーチ／コメント行をスキップ
LaTeX で論文などを書いていて、コメントアウトを大量にしたりしたときに、isearch でコメント行をスキップしたくなるときがあります。また逆に、プログラムを書いているときに、コメント行だけを検索したくなるときがあります。それらを実現する emacs lisp です。 ;; comment 行を skip する search - forward ( defadvice search - forward ( around my - comment - skip disable ) ( while ( and ( integerp ad - do - it ) ( not ( string= ( ad - get- arg 0 ) " " ) ) ( nth 4 ( parse - partial - sexp ( point - min ) ad - return - value ) ) ) ) ) ;; comment 行以外を skip する search - forward ( defadvice search - forward ( around my - comment - only disable ) ( while ( and ( integerp ad - do - it ) ( not ( string= ( ad - get- arg 0 ) " " ) ) ( not ( nth 4 ( parse - partial - sexp ( point - min ) ad - return - value ) ) ) ) ) ) ( fset ' isearch - forward - comment - only ' isearch - forward ) ( fset ' isearch - forward - comment - skip ' isearch - forward ) ;; isearch - forward が内部で使っている search - forward を、 ;; isearch - forward - comment - skip ではコメント行を無視するように ;; isearch - forward - comment - only ではコメント行以外を無視するように変更 ( defadvice isearch - forward - comment - skip ( before my - ad - activate activate ) ( ad - enable - advice ' search - forward ' around ' my - comment - skip ) ( ad- activate ' search - forward ) ) ( defadvice isearch - forward - comment - only ( before my - ad - activate activate ) ( ad - enable - advice ' search - forward ' around ' my - comment - only ) ( ad- activate ' search - forward ) ) ( add - hook ' isearch - mode - end - hook ( lambda ( ) ( ad- deactivate ' search - forward ) ( ad - disable - advice ' search - forward ' around ' my - comment - skip ) ( ad - disable - advice ' search - forward ' around ' my - comment - only ) ( ad- activate ' search - forward ) ) ) isearch - forward （より具体的に は、isearch - search）内で使われる search - forward を wrap して実現しています。使うときは 、
M-x isearch - forward - comment - skip でコメント行を無視した isearch が、 M-x isearch - forward - comment - only でコメント行以外を無視した isearch ができます。一旦上記関数を呼び出したら、後は isearch - forward （ 要するに通常のキーバインディングであれば
C- s）で isearch できます。 追記 ( 04/02/03 ) : すいません、以前のコードは、migemo じゃない isearch を使っている時に確実に無限ループするコードだったようなので、上記に直してください。どうも、普通の isearch だと最初に呼ばれる search - forward には空文字列が渡されるようです。 「 日本語でない文書では isearch 時に migemo をオフにする 」 を作ったので気がつきました。 上記の関数は、（最新版の）migemo だとうまく行きません。というのは、 isearch は search - foward で文字列を探索している（ハイライトする文字列も）のに対し、migemo は search - forward - regexp（ハイライトする文字列は re-search - forward ） で探索しているためです。従って、上記のコードに加えて、re-search - forward , search - forward - regexp についても同様の advice 定義を行い 、search - forward と同じように ad - disable - advice , ad - activate すると、migemo のときにも探索対象の文字列だけハイライトするようにできます。isearch , migemo 両方の場合に対応したコードは以下の通り。 ;; 文字列探索し、コメント行かどうかをチェックする関数
( defun my - search - comment ( point str flag ) ( and ( integerp point ) ( not ( string= str " " ) ) ;; ↓トリック的なコード ( if ( nth 4 ( parse - partial - sexp ( point - min ) point ) ) flag ( not flag ) ) ) ) ;; コメント行を無視する ( re -) search - forward ( - regexp ) ( defadvice search - forward ( around my - comment - skip disable ) ( while ( my - search - comment ad - do - it ( ad - get- arg 0 ) t ) ) ) ( defadvice search - forward - regexp ( around my - comment - skip disable ) ( while ( my - search - comment ad - do - it ( ad - get- arg 0 ) t ) ) ) ( defadvice re-search - forward ( around my - comment - skip disable ) ( while ( my - search - comment ad - do - it ( ad - get- arg 0 ) t ) ) ) ;; コメント行以外を無視する ( re -) search - forward ( - regexp ) ( defadvice search - forward ( around my - comment - only disable ) ( while ( my - search - comment ad - do - it ( ad - get - arg 0 ) nil ) ) ) ( defadvice search - forward - regexp ( around my - comment - only disable ) ( while ( my - search - comment ad - do - it ( ad - get - arg 0 ) nil ) ) ) ( defadvice re-search - forward ( around my - comment - only disable ) ( while ( my - search - comment ad - do - it ( ad - get - arg 0 ) nil ) ) ) ( fset 'isearch - forward - comment - only ' isearch - forward ) ( fset ' isearch - forward - comment - skip ' isearch - forward ) ;; isearch - forward ( migemo - forward ) が内部で使っている search - forward ;; ( search - forward - regexp , re-search - forward ) を ;; isearch - forward - comment - skip ではコメント行を無視するように ;; isearch - forward - comment - only ではコメント行以外を無視するように変更 ( defadvice isearch - forward - comment - skip ( before my - ad - activate activate ) ( mapcar ( lambda ( x ) ( ad - enable - advice x ' around ' my - comment - skip ) ( ad- activate x ) ) ( list ' search - forward ' search - forward - regexp ' re - search - forward ) ) ) ( defadvice isearch - forward - comment - only ( before my - ad - activate activate ) ( mapcar ( lambda ( x ) ( ad - enable - advice x ' around ' my - comment - only ) ( ad- activate x ) ) ( list ' search - forward ' search - forward - regexp ' re - search - forward ) ) ) ( add - hook ' isearch - mode - end - hook ( lambda ( ) ( mapcar ( lambda ( x ) ( ad - deactivate x ) ( ad - disable - advice x ' around ' my - comment - skip ) ( ad - disable - advice x ' around ' my - comment - only ) ( ad- activate x ) ) ( list ' search - forward ' search - forward - regexp ' re - search - forward ) ) ) ) 遊びで作った emacs lisp だったが，実用しなければいけない状況になったので、toggle できるよう作りかえたものは以下 ．

[ migemo ] 自動連文節検索 migemo では、辞書で定義される単語区切りを超えて検索を行うために、連文節検索という機能があります。例えば、「明日は金沢で買い物」は、単語の区切りで大文字に打ち変えて、「asitaHaKanazawaDeKaimono」とタイプすれば検索できます。しかしながら、辞書の単語定義に精通していても、ついつい単語の頭を大文字にすることを忘れ、検索にヒットしないことに首をかしげて一文字戻って大文字に打ち直すということを良くやります。そこで、検索にヒットしないときは自動で次文節に切り替える自動連文節検索を実装してみました。
与えられたローマ字文字列から、単語の先頭を正確に推定することはできませんが、インクリメンタルに検索している場合、検索にヒットしないときだけ大文字化すれば、経験上ほとんどのケースは救える上に、検索できていた単語が検索できなくなるというような副作用もありません。
( defun my - upcase - at - pos ( str pos ) ; upcase str at a given pos ( store - substring ( copy - sequence str ) pos ( upcase ( aref str pos ) ) ) ) ( defun my - gen- renstr ( str &optional index ) ; 次単語の先頭を大文字化 ( setq index ( or index ( 1- ( length str ) ) ) ) ; 検索文字列の末尾から ( cond ( ( = index 0 ) ; 1 - depth fallback ( cond ( ( let ( ( case - fold - search nil ) ) ( string - match " [ ^a - z ] $ " str ) ) str ) ( t ( my - gen - renstr ( my - upcase - at - pos str ( 1- ( length str ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( and ; 文節の先頭となり得る位置で ( let ( ( case - fold - search nil ) ) ( string - match " ^[ a - z ] " ( substring str index ) ) ) ( string - match " ^[ aiueon ] \\ ( ?:[ a - mo -z ] .*\\ |n[ aiueo ] .*\\ |n\\ ) $ " ( substring str ( 1- index ) ) ) ) ( save - excursion ; 検索が成功するかどうか検査 ( goto - char ( point - min ) ) ( migemo - forward ( my- upcase - at - pos str index ) nil t ) ) ) ( my- upcase - at - pos str index ) ) ( t ( my - gen - renstr str ( 1 - index ) ) ) ) ) ; try backward ( defadvice isearch - update ( after my - migemo - auto - ren activate ) ( when ( and ( featurep ' migemo ) migemo - isearch - enable - p ; migemo が on で， ( eq this - command ' isearch - printing - char ) ; 検索文字列を伸ばして ( not isearch - success ) ; 検索に失敗し， ( save - excursion ; 残りのバッファを検索しても検索文字列がない場合

自動連文節変換は文節の先頭位置に曖昧性があるため、本質的に検索漏れの可能性がある。鉄道の日きっぷで電車で移動中に時間ができたので、ちょっといじってみた。具体的には、1-depth
の fallback を行うようにした。検索文字列を追加していけば、実用的には大体まともに動くようになったかもしれない。例えば、 ;; 東京都京都 ;; 東京と京都には ;; 東京と今日と雨は ;; 東京ときょうと雨が とあって 、" toukyoutok " とタイプすると、 「 東京都京都 」 に" toukyoutoK " でマッチし、続い て" toukyoutoKyouton " だと、 「 東京と京都には 」 に" toukyouToKyoutoN " でマッチ 、" toukyoutoKyoutoa " とタイプすると、 「 東京ときょうと雨は 」 に" toukyouToKyoutoA " でマッチ 、" toukyouToKyoutoAmeg " とタイプすると 「 東京と今日と雨が 」 に" toukyouToKyouToAmeG " でマッチする。 以前は送り仮名に曖昧性がある場合、例えば「 相変わらず」のような場合は、" aikawa " で " 相変 " にマッチするた め " aikawar " で検索できなかった （ " aikawaR " になる）が、文節の先頭位置を全探索するようにしたおかげで検索できるようになった。また、連文節の位置の判定のときに case - fold- search を適切に設定するようにした。ただし、二カ所以上文節位置が違う同じ読みの文字列があるときは検索漏れがある（例えば、「東京都京都」と「東京と今日と雨は」だけを含むバッファで検索してみると分かる）。
[ 06/10/15 追記 ]
今日も電車の中で時間があったので、全探索するコードを書いてみました。 ;; 文字列に対する全連文節候補（文節？の先頭可能位置の巾集合）を、接頭辞ごと ;; にまとめあげる（インクリメンタル検索なのでこれで探索範囲を枝狩りできる） ;; なお、高速化のため以下の順で連文節候補の探索が行われるようにする ;;

( defun my - try - rensearch ( str ptrie fallback ) ( if ( null ( car ptrie ) ) ; 検索失敗 ( if ( null fallback ) ;; fallback スタックが空でなければ fallback nil ( my - try - rensearch ( caar fallback ) ( cdar fallback ) ( cdr fallback ) ) ) ( let* ( ( renstr ( store - substring ( copy - sequence str ) ( caar ptrie ) ( upcase ( aref str ( caar ptrie ) ) ) ) ) ( renp ( or ( caar ( cdar ptrie ) ) ( length str ) ) ) ( renpstr ( substring renstr 0 renp ) ) ) ( if ( save - excursion ; 接頭辞検索が成功するかどうか ( goto - char ( point - min ) ) ( migemo - forward renpstr nil t ) ) ( if ( string= renstr renpstr ) renstr ;; 検索終了 ;; 成功すれば fallback スタックに積んで探索文字列を伸ばす ( my - try - rensearch renstr ( cdar ptrie ) ( cons ( cons str ( cdr ptrie ) ) fallback ) ) ) ( my - try - rensearch str ( cdr ptrie ) fallback ) ) ) ) ) ( defadvice isearch - update ( after my - migemo - auto - ren activate ) ( when ( and ( featurep ' migemo ) migemo - isearch - enable - p ; migemo が on で， ( eq this - command ' isearch - printing - char ) ; 検索文字列を伸ばして ( not isearch - success ) ; 検索に失敗し， ( save - excursion ; ; 残りのバッファを検索しても検索文字列がない場合
( not ( funcall ( if isearch - forward ' migemo - backward ' migemo - forward ) isearch - string nil t ) ) ) ) ;; migemo で isearch に失敗したら連文節検索を試みる ( let* ( ( ptrie ( my - gen - renpos - trie ( my- ren - pos - list isearch - string 1 ) ) ) ( renstr ( my - try - rensearch isearch - string ptrie '( ) ) ) ) ( when renstr ( setq isearch - string renstr isearch - message isearch - string ) ( goto - char isearch - opoint ) ; 再検索 ( isearch - search ) ) ) ) ) さてこのコード、成功するときは割と順調にマッチしてくれますが、失敗する場合、全探索するため結構時間がかかります。また、文節の可能性がある位置が増えるたびに2の冪乗で可能な連文節のパターンも増えるため、変数
max - lisp -eval - depth がデフォルト（300ぐらい）だと、九文節（512の連文節候補）以上が含まれ得る文字列の検索に失敗すると max - lisp -eval - depth の超過エラーが出ます。何らかの方法で探索範囲を制御する必要があるのですが、最初のコードで大体ことは足りるのでこれ以上何かする工夫する意義は無さそうです（前のコードで fallback の深さを制限付きで反復深化するのはやってもいいかも）。
[ 06/10/21 追記 ]
前の版と同じような動作をするコードを xyzzy 用に書いている方がいた。同じようなことは考えつくものだ。
[ 06/11/10 追記 ] migemo を使っていると、たまにキャッシュファイル . migemo - pattern が壊れて migemo の検索ができなくなるときがあります。そういう場合は、advice 中で 「 ;
残りのバッファを検索しても検索文字列がない」かどうか検査するところで必ず失敗するので常に連文節にしようとして動作がおかしくなります。どのみち migemo 自体も正常に動かないので、そのときはキャッシュファイルを .migemo-pattern を消すとまともに動くようになると思います。

[ migemo ] isearch で IME をオフにする migemo を使うと、かな漢字交じりの日本語を検索する際に、辞書を使ってローマ字を動的に漢字かな文字に展開することで、アルファベットのままインクリメンタル検索することができます。この migemo での検索をより快適にするために、二つの emacs lisp を書いてみました。 まず、isearch で IME をオフにします 。migemo を使っていれば、isearch で 日本語を打つ必要は無いはずです。 [ meadow - users - jp : 1340 ]

[ migemo ] 日本語でない文書では isearch 時に migemo をオフにする migemo を使うと、普通に英語の単語などを検索するときにも（それをローマ字とみなして）かな漢字に動的な展開してしまうので、検索が（普通の isearch で英語の単語を検索するときに比べて）重くなってしまいます。これを避けるためには、
C-u C-s を代わりに使うという手がありますが、これだとユーザはそのたびごとに isearch のコマンド を
C-s か C-u C-s かで打ち変える必要があり、面倒です。 もちろん、ユーザの入力だけからローマ字かどうか（かな漢字に展開する必要があるかどうか）を正しく判断するのは不可能ですが、例えばバッファの文字コードを調べて、（プログラムや英語の論文などのファイルのような）明らかに日本語を含まないバッファだと分かれば、そのようなバッファに対する検索は100 %普通の isearch で検索して良いはずです。そこで、普通に非日本語の文書で isearch をするときに migemo をオフにして検索するための簡単な elisp を考えてみました。 以下では 、buffer - file - coding - system を調べて 、migemo をオフにするようにしています。これでちょっと検索が速くなるはずです。 ;; buffer - file - coding - system から言語判別 ;; unicode も入れた方がいいのかも。 ( defun my - language - check ( lang ) ( let ( ( coding ( coding- system - base buffer- file - coding - system ) ) ) ( memq coding ( cdr ( assoc ' coding - system ( assoc lang language - info - alist ) ) ) ) ) ) ;; 日本語じゃないときは migemo を使わない ( eval - after - load " migemo " '( progn ( defadvice isearch - mode ( before my - migemo - off activate ) ( unless ( my- language - check " Japanese " ) ( make-local - variable ' migemo-isearch - enable - p ) ( setq migemo - isearch - enable - p nil ) ) ) ( add - hook ' isearch - mode - end - hook ( lambda ( ) ( unless ( my- language - check " Japanese " ) ( setq migemo - isearch - enable - p t ) ) ) ) ) ) isearch - mode に対する defadvice と isearch - mode - end - hook とに、文字コードを判別するに関数を入れて migemo をオフ・オン しているのが非対称的で気持ち悪いが、migemo が isearch - message - prefix など isearch - mode - hook が動く前に実行される関数に defadvice しているので、仕方な い

find - file で補完し損なって新しいファイルを開くのをなんとかしたい C-x C-f ( find - file ) は基本的に、既存のファイルを使うときと、新しいファイルを作るときに使います（後者はやや慣例的）。しかし、既存のファイルを開くつもりで、TAB や SPC で補完していて、補完対象が複数あって最後まで補完されず、勢いで
RET を押すと新しいファイルを作って嫌な気持ちになります。そこで試しにこんなのを作ってみました。 ( defadvice find - file ( before my - find - file - if - exists activate ) ( let ( ( file ( ad - get - arg 0 ) ) ) ( while ( and ( not ( file - exists - p file ) ) ;; ファイルが存在しなくて ( or ;; 直前のコマンド が TAB や SPC による補完だったのなら ( eq last - command ' minibuffer - complete ) ( eq last - command ' minibuffer - complete - word ) ( eq last - command ' hc - exit - and - then ) ;; highlight - completion 用 ) ) ( message " File %s does not exist .

TAB や SPC で補完した直後に RET を押した場合に、そのファイルが存在しなければ再入力を促す（そのままもう一度 RET を押せば新しいファイルとして開ける）ようになります。 追記 ( 04/11/11 ) : これ、便利だったのに、meadow 2.10 ( emacs 21.3 ) 以降で動かなくなってしまった。2.10 で動かない理由は良く分からなかったが、2.20
では files.el で定義されている関数が軒並み find - file - read - args で引数を読みに行くようになっていたので上の代わりに、read - file - name に以下のように defadvice すると動いた。 ( defadvice read - file - name ( after my - read - file - if - exists activate ) ( let ( ( file ad - return - value ) ) ( while ( and ( not ( file - exists - p file ) ) ;; ファイルが存在しなくて ( or ;; 直前のコマンド が TAB や SPC による補完だったのなら ( eq last - command ' kogiku - complete ) ( eq last - command ' minibuffer - complete ) ( eq last - command ' minibuffer- complete - word ) ;; ( eq last - command ' hc - exit - and - then ) highlight - completion 用 ) ) ( message " File %s does not exist .

ミニバッファの履歴を綺麗にする ミニバッファの履歴に重複を残さないようにする emacs lisp は ヒストリから重複を削除 ( Meadow Memo ) を使えばいいですが、時々、重複したの以外のも消したくなるときがあります。例えば、ファイルを新しく開いたけど、保存しなかったとか、間違った名前で開いてしまったとか（一番多いと思われる、補完していて勢い余ってというパターンについては、find-file
で補完し損なって新しいファイルを開くのをなんとかしてして大丈夫なのですが）。とりあえずここではこのようなファイル履歴を消してみることにします。他にも拡張するかもしれません。 ;; ミニバッファの履歴の重複削除＋ファイル履歴から読み込めないファイルを削除
( defun my - minibuffer - delete - duplicate ( ) ( let* ( ( hist ( symbol - value minibuffer - history - variable ) ) ( last ( car hist ) ) ) ( when (> ( length hist ) 1 ) ;; 履歴が存在するときのみ ( when ( eq minibuffer - history - variable ' file - name - history ) ;; $ HOME や " ..

" は正則化する ( let ( ( home - re ( concat " ^ " ( expand - file - name ( getenv " HOME " ) ) ) ) ( fn ( expand - file - name last ) ) ) ( unless ( file - readable - p last ) ( set minibuffer - history - variable ( cdr hist ) ) ) ( when ( string - match home - re fn ) ( setq last ( replace - match " ~ " t t fn ) ) ) ) ) ( set minibuffer - history - variable ( cons last ( delete last ( cdr hist ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( add - hook ' minibuffer-setup-hook ' my - minibuffer-delete -duplicate ) )
ミニバッファの履歴を編集 ミニバッファの履歴で消したいものがあるときに、C-delete で消すための elisp です。 ;; ミニバッファの履歴を編集 ( defun my - delete - history - element ( ) ( interactive ) ( let* ( ( hist ( symbol - value minibuffer - history - variable ) ) ( curr ( nth ( 1- minibuffer - history - position ) hist ) ) ) ( set minibuffer - history - variable ( delete curr hist ) ) ( next - history - element 1 ) ) ) ;; C - delete で削除 ( define - key minibuffer - local - map [ \C - delete ] ' my - delete -history - element )
prolog も perl も拡張子を .pl にしたい prolog の一般的な拡張子は .pl で、かつ、perl の一般的な拡張子も .pl。メジャーモードの設定は拡張子ごとにするのでこれは困ります。というわけで、
prolog - mode および cperl - mode で、ファイルの先頭 " # ! " があるかないかで適切なモードに switch する設定を書いてみました（というか，interpreter-mode-alist が auto - mode - alist より優先されてくれればそれで済むのだけれど）。 ;; バッファが prolog か perl プログラムかをチェック ( defun my - pl- switch ( ) ( save- restriction ( widen ) ( if ( string= " # !

を書いてから保存してください（書く前に保存した場合はファイルを開き直してください）。
( defun my - pl- switch ( ) ( save- restriction ( widen ) ( if ( string= " # ! " ( buffer - substring 1 ( min 3 ( point - max ) ) ) ) ( cperl - mode ) ) ) ) ( eval - after - load " prolog " '( add - hook ' prolog - mode - hook ' my - pl- switch ) )

If one aspect of design has suffered most in its transition to the Web , it is the art of typography .
For years ,
Web typography involved little more than choosing a typeface and font size .
Unstyled Times New Roman was the norm , and the integration of established typographical techniques and rules was unimagined .
But times change .
Since the adoption of CSS into mainstream Web design , we have entered a new age of Web typography .
This facet of design has been opened up to the Web designer in a way that was n’t possible in the past .
We now have the tools to return typography to its true role within the sphere of design .
However , if we ’ve learnt anything over the last ten years , it ’s that the Web is not print .
The basic principles of typography will cross over to any format , but it ’s vital that we allow the features of the medium — in this case , the computer screen or monitor on which our type is displayed — to define the rules and techniques that we practice .
So , how can we transfer the established and time - tested principles of typography to the online environment ?
The best place to start is to look at the differences between print and screen , and to understand how those differences will affect our use of typography in Web design .
The Technology
The most obvious difference between the Web and its print ancestor — a most important point for those wanting to grasp the art of Web typography — is that your type is displayed on a computer screen or monitor .
If you ’re reading this tutorial on your computer screen , you ’re having a very different experience than if you ’d printed this text with a modern laser printer .
Additive and Subtractive Color Systems
When you look at a computer screen , you see colors and shapes that are made up of light .
Colors are built up by combining red , green , and blue light together in different mixtures and intensities .
This is the additive color system .
On the other hand , if you printed this page out , and are reading it on paper , the colors and shapes you ’re looking at are comprised of pigments in the ink .
These colors are perceived by the absorption and reflection of light from their surfaces .
This is known as the subtractive color system .
Why is this important ?
Well , let ’s consider the most common color combination for text and its background : black on white .
In a subtractive color system ( i.e. print ) , this is a perfectly suitable practice .
The contrast of black on white is as stark and clear as possible , making for good legibility and comfortable reading .
However , with an additive color system ( i.e. on screen ) , the color white is produced by mixing red , green , and blue at full intensity .
This is why the black on white combination can be overly luminous and too harsh on the eyes to allow extended reading on screen .
There is never more light radiating from a screen than when it displays pure white , and this intensity can affect the clarity of fine detail in typefaces and other intricate patterns .
Wikipedia gives more details on the additive and subtractive color systems .
Screen Resolution
If you have printed this text with a modern laser printer , you may be enjoying a print resolution of up to 2400 dpi ( dots per inch ) .
On screen , you ’ll be lucky to have a resolution of 96 dpi .
The conclusion to this point should be fairly obvious : there ’s no way you ’re going to get the same clarity and detail when displaying text on screen as you can with print .
It is this factor , more than any other , that defines the recommendations and principles behind good Web typography .
The Unknowns
The other key issue we should think about is what I like to call the unknowns .
One of the biggest hurdles designers have to overcome as they move from print to Web is the idea that they do n’t have real control over their finished product .
No matter how much we try to second - guess users ’ browsing habits , hardware configuration , and software choices , we must live with the fact that we cannot control 100 % how people experience our Web pages .
In terms of Web typography , this has some pretty sobering consequences .
We can spend hours choosing the perfect combination of typefaces to complement our design or meet corporate requirements , but if the user has stipulated that she wants all text to be displayed in 18px Comic Sans , there is absolutely nothing we can do about it .
The key is to think of this not as a limitation of the Web , but as a strength .
Which other medium gives so much freedom to the end user ?
As designers , we merely suggest a design or layout ; the final say is in the hands of the individual , and their requirements and choices trump ours every time .
Do n’t inhibit this freedom by assuming users ’ requirements or by attempting to force too many of your own preferences onto users .
Another unknown that applies particularly to Web typography is anti-aliasing .
Modern operating systems such as Windows XP and Mac OS 10 give users the option to display anti-aliased text as standard .
This is a good thing , and it makes reading and working on your machine much more comfortable and pleasing to the eye .
However , there is a danger when experimenting with typefaces and sizes that we forget that users may not have anti-aliasing available or switched on .
Comparing anti-aliased and aliased text .
Again , do n’t assume anything about the people who use your site .
I would encourage any designer to at least check a site ’s pages with anti-aliasing switched off .
The discovery you make may come as a shock , and in the worst case , you may even be moved to rethink your typographic choices .
Basic Principles of Web Typography
Having seen the technological issues that are going to inform our typographical choices , it ’s time for a more detailed look at the principles of typography as they apply to the Web .
Typefaces
Choosing a typeface is the starting point of typographic design , and may even go on to inform the overall design or feel of a page .
Traditionally ,
Web typography suffers from a lack of options when it comes to typeface choice simply because fonts can be displayed only if they ’re available on users ’ computers .
The first job of the Web typographer , then , is to distinguish the fonts that are readily available , and to understand which are best suited to his or her particular tasks .
Very generally speaking , there are two main groups of typefaces that are used on the Web : serif and sans - serif .
The difference is easily demonstrated in this image :
Serif and sans - serif type
Serifs are the extra lines or small decorations added to the ends of the main strokes of the Georgia typeface above .
The theory behind these serifs is that they help the letters flow , and lead the eye across the text during reading .
Serif fonts are very popular in print , and although there is a certain amount of debate regarding which family of typeface is most legible on the screen , I fall firmly in to the camp that believes that sans - serif faces are a more suitable option .
The variable boldness and fine extra strokes of the serif fonts , particularly at smaller sizes of body text , often appear pixilated and untidy .
This is still the case even with the most modern anti-aliasing techniques .
With anti-aliasing enabled , the serif fonts look blurred ( which is exactly what they are ) around their curves and terminals .
On the other hand , the straight , low contrast , open strokes of a sans - serif font , such as Verdana , will always leave a good impression on - screen .
The Common Web Fonts
Most designers are probably familiar with what could be considered the common Web fonts .
The following CSS rule probably wo n’t raise too many eyebrows .
body {
font - family : verdana , " trebuchet MS " , helvetica , sans - serif ;
}
Here , we have three classic fonts that are used all over the Web .
However , instead of just copying and pasting this rule , let ’s look at why we have made the decision to use those three fonts , and what characterizes them as suitable for our purposes .
Verdana is our first choice font here .
This font was designed for the screen and is the most common sans - serif typeface used on the Web today .
The Verdana face in detail
Note the generous amount of space between each character , as well as the amount of whitespace within the characters ( glyphs ) themselves .
This is what makes Verdana so legible on screen , and an excellent choice for a sans - serif on the Web .
Trebuchet is another face created for the screen .
Designed in 1996 by Vincent Connare , it is probably the most distinctive of the common Web fonts , and can convey a great deal of energy and personality .
Certain features of this typeface depart significantly from what we would expect from a classic grotesk font , for example , the uppercase M seen below .
The Trebuchet face in detail
Despite its distinct personality , Trebuchet ’s strokes are blocky and clear .
It has a large x-height , helping to increase legibility at smaller sizes .
Finally , we ’ve gone for Helvetica .
Helvetica , designed in the 1950s and hugely popular throughout the second half of the 20th Century , is a classic in its own right .
That it transfers so well to screen is both a testament to its legibility and a blessing for Web typographers .
The Helvetica face in detail
Despite its compact width , Helvetica reads well on screen due to its large x -height .
It has a consistent and uniform feel to it , which not only makes it economical with space , but also means it ’s easy on the eye .
Finally our CSS rule declares sans - serif as a generic font family .
This ensures that users ’ systems will at least default to a sans - serif font if they do not have any of the others we have specified .
If you use the rule above , you ’ll be certain to provide good , legible text to the vast majority of your users .
However , why not experiment a bit more ?
What are some of the other good screen fonts out there that we can provide to users who have them available ?
What Characterizes Good Screen Fonts ?
Having looked at the properties of the above fonts in a bit more detail , you should have a clear idea of the features that define a good screen font :
Low contrast and simple strokes with a consistent weight and thickness
Generous x -height
Generous width and letter spacing
Generous punch width ( space within letters )
With those points in mind , you should be in a position to begin looking beyond the common Web fonts .
So , what are the design principles you should bear in mind when thinking about typeface choice ?
Choose a typeface or a group of faces that will honor and elucidate the character of the text .
– R. Bringhurst
Your typeface sets the tone or personality of your text .
Type is a part of your design that the user has no choice but to interact with directly , so its power should be taken seriously .
If you were designing a site for a large bank or mortgage company , it ’s unlikely that you would choose to set the body text in Comic Sans .
Comic
Sans is a fun , cartoony , frivolous typeface that would not at all be appropriate for the corporate image required .
This is a rather over - the - top example , but the principle is clear : let the nature of your content and the goals of your design lead you in your choice of typeface .
This means reading the text and having an understanding of what it conveys , then choosing a typeface that best illustrates and clarifies the key concepts .
The best way to ‘ get into type ’ is to immerse yourself in what ’s available and understand how people are using those fonts .
Visit some of the good type foundries , in particular Linotype and , for the more adventurous , Letterhead Fonts .
Another resource I find invaluable in the early stages of typographic work is the fantastic tool , Typetester .
Typetester allows you to easily style text with any number of CSS properties and compare them to one another on - screen .
It even builds the CSS rule for you when you find a combination of styles that you like !
This tool is well worth spending some time with , particularly if you ’re new to many of the detailed text properties in CSS .
This brings us to look a little more closely at those detailed CSS properties .
With so many capabilities now available to the Web designer through CSS , how should we be using these properties to deliver the best possible experience to our users ?
Size
Type size is one of the easiest factors to control on - screen , and as such it is often not given the importance that it deserves in the field of Web typography .
Size is an important device for giving your content a hierarchy , and the relative sizes of your headings , body text , and footers can have a big influence on the overall feel of a page .
Type size is also very closely linked to other characteristics of your page , such as column width , line - height , and so on .
As early as the sixteenth century , typographers had begun to use a common scale for type size , and there is no reason not to replicate this approach on the Web , particularly if you ’re looking for a traditional and highly legible result .
Like a musical scale , the series below has a natural elegance to it , and is considered by typographers to be a standard for relative type sizes .
The traditional type size series developed in the sixteenth century
A great example of a site that uses this type size scale on the Web is Jaredigital.com [ http://www.jaredigital.com]
It ’s clear that traditional and stylish typography was required for this site , and a little discreet poking around in the CSS finds the rules that make it all possible :
h3 {
font - size : 16 px ;
}
h4 {
font - size : 12px ;
}
p {
font - size : 11 px ;
}
A good rule of thumb is that the closer to one another are the font sizes of the various levels , the more elegant the overall impression will be .
If you ’re after a disjointed or modern feel , try using font sizes that are further apart on the scale .
A good example of this can be seen at Coudal.com .
The large headers used here are fairly unusual , and in my opinion , give a much more modern , less traditional feel to the design .
Note , however , that the headings are displayed in a much lighter color than the main body text .
Another good rule of thumb states that , if you want to use larger sizes for headings , use a lighter color to keep the overall feel of the page balanced .
It ’s also worth pointing out those headings as a particularly successful use of a serif font ( in this case , Times ) on the screen .
Emphasis
Emphasizing text is a relatively simple way to bring your words to life on the Web .
There is a great fashion at the moment — particularly in online promotional or advertising text — to scatter bold font weights liberally around the page .
Although traditional typographic convention would warn against the over - use of related faces such as bold or italics , on the Web , this technique can be used to encourage the eye through the text when there are so many other distractions on screen .
There are various ways we can introduce emphasis into text :
Bold :
On the Web , the most common and effective method is the use of a bold face from the current font family .
Of course , as with all these techniques , ensure that you do not over - use the bold face .
The key is to use bold faces sparingly , or not at all .
Italics : Italic text can suffer on low - resolution monitors because of the slanted and more curved shapes of italicized letters .
These are likely to look too pixilated when aliased , and too blurred when anti-aliased , and will spoil legibility when used in lengthy body text .
However , this should not stop you from using an italic face when convention approves it , for example , quoting foreign words and phrases , or listing books and periodical titles .
Underlining :
It ’s commonly understood that underlining text on the Web is not a good idea .
Web conventions tell us that any underlined text is a link , and can be clicked on .
It ’s a pretty fair bet that if you go around underlining text that ’s not clickable , you ’re going to confuse users .
Color : Using color for emphasis is also a rather tricky business .
Like underlined words , colored words could be mistaken for a link within body text .
In the past it was common to use a distinct background color to give emphasis to a passage of text , but even this has now become a convention for identifying links .
Furthermore , there are the accessibility issues assocaited with using color to display important meaning on the Web , which further add to the conclusion that using color for emphasis is not an ideal method .
Capital Letters :
Never set passages of text in full or small caps .
Not only is doing this considered rather rude and inelegant , but typographically , it is a very poor choice .
CONSIDER THE LEGIBILITY OF THIS SENTENCE COMPARED TO THE ONES THAT PRECEDE AND FOLLOW IT .
There is no doubt that , without the distinct shape of the words created by the lower case letters , readability is severely inhibited .
The example below highlights this clearly .
There is no doubt that it is easier to make out the words in the upper half of the sentence due to the more obvious shape of the words .
Note how the upper half of the sentence is easier to read than the lower
However , nice touches can be achieved using full or small caps in the right situation .
Try using small caps for abbreviations and acronyms within text , and of course , full caps for acronyms that stand for personal names or place names .
This is a detail that is rarely considered on the Web , but that should be simple to achieve with site - wide CSS files .
Line Spacing
A crucial detail when setting type on the Web is the issue of line spacing , or leading .
The vertical distance between lines of body text can make a huge difference to the legibility and overall style of your message .
A comparison of the two blocks of text below should demonstrate the point clearly .
A general rule of thumb when selecting a line - height value is that the longer the line length ( measure ) of your text , the more leading is required for legibility .
Notice the clarity that the increased line height brings to the text
The default line - height for most browsers is around 1.2 ( where 1 is where the tops of one row of characters would touch the base of the row above ) .
This is not sufficient for text on screen ; I ’d recommend increasing your line - height value to between 1.4 and 1.6 .
Letter Spacing and Kerning
In my opinion , letter spacing ( or tracking ) as controlled by the letter - spacing property in CSS should never be used for body text .
It ’s not very cross - browser friendly , and what you may see in Firefox may be drastically different in Internet Explorer or Safari .
Furthermore , it seems wrong to mess about with the tracking that each font has built into it .
The type designer carefully calculates these spaces , and most of the time , they ’re going to provide good results without any extra tampering .
However , letter spacing can be a very effective tool in short headings .
A classic example of this can be seen at Zeldman.com .
The large letter spacing of the titles in the right hand column allows for a bolder , uppercase typeface , but ensures that the overall balance of the page is consistent .

Kerning refers to improving the appearance of a word by adjusting spacing between certain pairs of letters .
On the Web , it ’s not realistic to attempt this with body text .
However , if you ’re creating headers or logos in graphics software , a little kerning can make a dramatic difference to the overall result .
Look at the two examples below .
The first shows the default kerning of the Verdana font ; the second has been tweaked in Fireworks with the goal of creating a more balanced and well - proportioned word shape .
Word Spacing
As with letter spacing , word spacing should be considered carefully before it ’s applied to the screen .
I am of the belief that if you think your text needs spacing and tracking manually , then you have probably chosen the wrong typeface for the job .
As with all the text properties that CSS allows us to control , consistency is the key .
Keep readers focused on the text , and make it easy for their eyes to flow through the words .
If you ’re breaking up the letters and words , you ’ll only serve to distract them , and disrupt the flow of the text .
Alignment
Margins can have a surprisingly large influence on the look and feel of your pages .
They help keep your text apart from other elements of your site , and from the edges of the browser window .
Larger margins produce an open , free feeling , while smaller , tighter margins give a constricted and more intimate aesthetic .
Assuming your content is in a language that flows left - to - right ( ltr ) , you should nearly always left - align your text on the Web .
Right - aligning should only be used for very specific purposes , and certainly not for long passages of text .
The ragged left edge of right - aligned text makes it very difficult for the eye to move from one line to the next and reduces legibility considerably .
Text that is set flush with both left and right margins is known as justified text .
Justification is extremely popular in books and newspapers , and gives a uniform and controlled feel to a page .
Justification on the Web would be far more popular if it were n’t for the fact that no browser or operating system has a hyphenation dictionary built in .
This means that the only way the browser has to justify text is to space out and / or squash up words to fit into the specific line length .
This is fine to an extent , but there comes a point — particularly with shorter line lengths — when a bit more flexibility is required .
The designer Todd Dominey provides an option on his site to justify all text , and the two screen shots below shows the good and bad results of doing that .
Good justified text at Whatdoiknow.org
Bad justified text at Whatdoiknow.org
The text in the wider column looks great , and the browser has dealt well with the justification .
However , in the smaller left - hand column you can see that the word spacing is very mixed and inconsistent , and this drastically affects the legibility of the text .
Extending Web Typography
While a lot can be achieved with CSS in the ways described above , designers must still endure a number of limitations when it comes to Web typography .
We are still stuck with a limited number of good screen fonts , but even if more were available , we ’d still be relying on users having them available on their machines .
With this system , designers are never going to have the true control of type that they desire .
It is frustrating that in the ten years since designers came to the Web , this problem has not been solved .
Replacing Text
One way in which designers work around the limitations today is to use image and Flash text replacement techniques to display headers or navigation .
This kind of text is often an integral part of a site ’s design or brand , and designers are keen to get as much control over these elements as possible .
The rules for using images or Flash to replace text are no different from those we use to choose body text typefaces .
Legibility should always be your prime concern , followed by suitability for the task at hand .
However , you do have a little more flexibility , mainly because you are more likely to be working with large font sizes and thus many legibility issues are already solved .
This situation may then be a suitable case for experimentation , and for basing a typeface choice solely on the character , or personality that you ’re trying to convey in your design .
One Flash replacement method that has caused a lot of buzz over the last year or so is sIFR ( pronounced siffer ) .
SIFR is touted as an accessible , scalable method of embedding custom typefaces in Web pages , and as such has generated a great deal of excitement among designers .
It is a superb tool for Web designers to have at their disposal .
There are specific cases in which sIFR is an unrivalled solution to the problem of creating dynamic headers in a custom typeface .
However , it is not the final solution to custom typography on the Web , and it ’s important to understand what the specific cases are before deploying it in your next design .
Like any powerful tool , sIFR has the potential for serious misuse .

The Future
Flash replacement techniques , such as sIFR , hint at the future of Web typography , but they themselves are not the future .
They are stop - gap solutions that , with luck , will show browser makers , type foundries , and the W3C that Web designers will not rest until they have a way to display custom typefaces in their pages .
There have been attempts in the past to solve this problem , notably Microsoft ’s Web Embedding Fonts Tool ( WEFT ) , which allows for fonts to be stored on a Web server and downloaded when required .
Unfortunately , this has never developed into a satisfactory tool , simply because no other browser maker has implemented the Microsoft technology .
The type foundries too , are worried about the consequences of having their copyrighted type easily spread around the Web .
Once this problem is finally overcome , which it surely will be ( albeit later , rather than sooner ) , we will enter another age of Web typography .
However , the same rules will still apply , because the fundamental principles of typography will transfer to any medium .
The real challenge is to continue understanding the medium we are designing for as it develops , and to continue adapting these rules and guidelines to fit it .
In the meantime , though , keep an eye on what will surely prove to be an incredible new resource for Web typographers : Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web .
This new site takes the principles of Robert Bringhurst ’s classic book , The Elements of Typographic Style , and steps through them one by one , explaining how they can be applied to the Web .
If this article has got you thinking about what you could do with typography on your site , this will be the perfect place to take your knowledge a step further .
The site ’s owner , Richard Rutter , is adding one chapter per week .
Each illustrates examples of practical CSS that can be used to replicate the principles of Bringhurst ’s classic text , and explaining how and why they work on the Web .
It ’s definitely a site to keep an eye on over the coming months .
