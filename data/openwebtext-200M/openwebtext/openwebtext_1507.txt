People talk to their plants , pray to humanlike gods , name their cars , and even dress their pets up in clothing .
We have a strong tendency to give nonhuman entities human characteristics ( known as anthropomorphism ) , but why ?
In a new report in Current Directions in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , psychological scientists Adam Waytz from Harvard University and Nicholas Epley and John T. Cacioppo from University of Chicago , examine the psychology of anthropomorphism .
The term anthropomorphism was coined by the Greek philosopher Xenophanes when describing the similarity between religious believers and their gods -- that is , Greek gods were depicted having light skin and blue eyes while African gods had dark skin and brown eyes .
Neuroscience research has shown that similar brain regions are involved when we think about the behavior of both humans and of nonhuman entities , suggesting that anthropomorphism may be using similar processes as those used for thinking about other people .
Anthropomorphism carries many important implications .
For example , thinking of a nonhuman entity in human ways renders it worthy of moral care and consideration .
In addition , anthropomorphized entities become responsible for their own actions -- that is , they become deserving of punishment and reward .
Although we like to anthropomorphize , we do not assign human qualities to each and every single object we encounter .
What accounts for this selectivity ?
One factor is similarity .
An entity is more likely to be anthropomorphized the more similar it appears to humans ( for example , through humanlike movements or physical features like a face ) .
Various motivations may also influence anthropomorphism .
For example , lacking social connections with other people might motivate lonely individuals to seek out connections from nonhuman items .
Anthropomorphism helps us to simplify and make more sense of complicated entities .
The authors observe that , according to the World Meteorological Organization , " the naming of hurricanes and storms -- a practice that originated with the names of saints , sailors ' girlfriends , and disliked political figures -- simplifies and facilitates effective communication to enhance public preparedness , media reporting , and the efficient exchange of information . "
Anthropomorphism in reverse is known as dehumanization -- when humans are represented as nonhuman objects or animals .
There are numerous historical examples of dehumanization including the Nazis ' persecution of Jews during the Holocaust and torture at the Abu - Ghraib prison in Iraq .
These examples also suggest that those engaging in dehumanization are usually part of a cohesive group acting against outsiders -- that is , individuals who feel socially connected may have an increased tendency towards dehumanization .
The authors note , " Social connection may have benefits for a person 's own health and well - being but may have unfortunate consequences for intergroup relations by enabling dehumanization . "
The authors conclude that few of us " have difficulty identifying other humans in a biological sense , but it is much more complicated to identify them in a psychological sense . "
Fr. Marcial Maciel Degollado greets Pope John Paul II in St. Peter 's Square in this 2000 file photo .
( CNS )
First of Two Parts
In his time , the late Fr. Marcial Maciel Degollado was the greatest fundraiser of the modern Roman Catholic church .
He was also a magnetic figure in recruiting young men to religious life in an era when vocations were plummeting .
Behind that exalted façade , however , Maciel was a notorious pedophile , and a man who fathered several children by different women .
His life was arguably the darkest chapter in the clergy abuse crisis that continues to plague the church .
The saga of the disgraced founder of the Legion of Christ , a secretive , cult - like religious order now under Vatican investigation , opens into a deeper story of how one man 's lies and betrayal dazzled key figures in the Roman curia and how Maciel 's money and success helped him find protection and influence .
For years , the heads of Vatican congregations and the pope himself ignored persistent warnings that something was rotten in the community where Legionaries called their leader Nuestro Padre , " Our Father , " and considered him a living saint .
The charismatic Mexican , who founded the Legion of Christ in 1941 , sent streams of money to Roman curia officials with a calculated end , according to many sources interviewed by NCR : Maciel was buying support for his group and defense for himself , should his astounding secret life become known .
This much is well established from previous reporting : Maciel was a morphine addict who sexually abused at least 20 Legion seminarians from the 1940s to the ' 60s .
Bishop John McGann of Rockville Centre , N.Y. , sent a letter by a former Legion priest with detailed allegations to the Vatican in 1976 , 1978 and 1989 through official channels .
Nothing happened .
Maciel began fathering children in the early 1980s -- three of them by two Mexican women , with reports of a third family with three children in Switzerland , according to El Mundo in Madrid , Spain .
Concealing his web of relations , Maciel raised a fortune from wealthy backers , and ingratiated himself with church officials in Rome .

" What I can say about Fr. Maciel is that he was a consummate con artist , " Fr. Stephen Fichter , a sociologist and former Legion official , told NCR .
" He would use any means to achieve his end , even if that meant lying to the pope , or any of the cardinals in Rome . "
When Maciel died on Jan. 30 , 2008 , the Legion leadership announced that the 87 - year - old founder had gone to heaven .
While God alone knows Maciel 's fate , the Legion 's statement stands in hindsight as one final act of deception by a figure whose legacy is still wreaking havoc from the grave .
In February 2009 , the Legionaries revealed that Maciel had a daughter .
Late last month , the Legionaries issued a vaguely worded statement of regret to unnamed victims of Maciel -- four years after Pope Benedict XVI banished him from active ministry to " a life of prayer and repentance " for abusing seminarians .

Maciel left a trail of wreckage among his followers .
Moreover , in a gilded irony for Benedict -- who prosecuted him despite pressure from Maciel 's chief supporter , Cardinal Angelo Sodano , Vatican secretary of state from 1990 to 2006 -- Maciel left an ecclesiastical empire with which the church must now contend .
The Italian newsweekly L'espresso estimates the Legion 's assets at 25 billion euros , with a $ 650 million annual budget , according to The Wall Street Journal .
The order numbered 700 priests and 1,300 seminarians in 2008 .
On March 15 of this year , five bishops , called visitators , from as many countries , delivered their reports to the pope after a seven - month investigation .
A final report is expected by the end of April .
Not in centuries has a scandal in the church had such complexity as this one .
A huge financial operation is in the hands of a religious order many critics have likened to a cult , a group whose leadership is suspected of hiding its superior 's corrupt life .
As the Vatican grapples with the Legion -- and thorny legal questions as to whether the Holy See can intervene in the Legion 's far - flung financial operations -- three of Maciel 's sons and their mother in Mexico demand compensation , claiming they were cut off by the Legion when Maciel died .
Besides the complex questions of whether to dismantle or " reform " the Legion , Benedict is under pressure from a resurgent sex abuse scandal in Ireland , and cases from years back in Germany , Wisconsin and Arizona , in which he reportedly failed to discipline abusive priests .
The Legion scandal stands out for another reason :
The Maciel case and the trail of money he reportedly gave cardinals raises profound ethical questions about how money circulates in the Vatican .
In an NCR investigation that began last July , encompassing dozens of interviews in Rome , Mexico City and several U.S. cities , what emerges is the saga of a man who ingratiated himself with Vatican officials , including some of those in charge of offices that should have investigated him , as he dispensed thousands of dollars in cash and largesse .
Maciel built his base by cultivating wealthy patrons , particularly widows , starting in his native Mexico in the 1940s .
Even as he was trailed by pedophilia accusations , Maciel attracted large numbers of seminarians in an era of dwindling vocations .
In 1994 Pope John Paul II heralded him as " an efficacious guide to youth . "
John Paul continued praising Maciel after a 1997 Hartford Courant investigation by Gerald Renner and this writer exposed Maciel 's drug habits and abuse of seminarians .
In 1998 , eight ex-Legionaries filed a canon law case to prosecute him in then - Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger 's tribunal .
For the next six years , Maciel had the staunch support of three pivotal figures : Sodano ; Cardinal Eduardo Martínez Somalo , prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life ; and Msgr. Stanislaw Dziwisz , the Polish secretary of John Paul .
During those years , Sodano pressured Ratzinger not to prosecute Maciel , as NCR previously reported .
Ratzinger told a Mexican bishop that the Maciel case was a " delicate " matter and questioned whether it would be " prudent " to prosecute at that time .
In 2004 , John Paul -- ignoring the canon law charges against Maciel -- honored him in a Vatican ceremony in which he entrusted the Legion with the administration of Jerusalem 's Notre Dame Center , an education and conference facility .
The following week , Ratzinger took it on himself to authorize an investigation of Maciel .
John Paul 's support gave Maciel credibility as he moved with seamless ease among the ultra - wealthy .
At a 2004 fundraiser in New York , a video cameraman filmed him running his fingers down the tuxedo lapel of the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim , a major Legion supporter .
Besides donations , Legion schools in Mexico with high tuitions and low salaries subsidized the operations in Rome , say men familiar with the order 's finances .
As questions swirl about how Maciel misled so many people , his ability to attract the powerful and influential is beyond dispute .
Legion supporters ranged from Steve McEveety , producer of Mel Gibson 's " The Passion of the Christ " ( Legion priests advised on the film ) , to Thomas Monaghan , founder of Domino 's Pizza and Ave Maria University in Florida .
Others who supported the Legion include former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Pennsylvania Sen .
Rick Santorum , who spoke at Legion conferences ; Spanish opera singer Placido Domingo , who performed at a fundraiser ; and the late Fr. Richard John Neuhaus , editor of First Things , who wrote that he believed with " moral certainty " that the charges against Maciel were " false and malicious . "
Harvard Law Professor and former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican Mary Ann Glendon taught at Regina Apostolorum Athenaeum , the Legion 's university in Rome , and advised in the planning that led to the order 's first university in America , University of Sacramento , Calif .
In a 2002 letter for the Legion Web site she scoffed at the allegations against him and praised Maciel 's " radiant holiness " and " the success of Regnum Christi [ the order 's lay wing ] and the Legionaries of Christ in advancing the New Evangelization . "
Author and conservative activist George Weigel also endorsed the Legion in 2002 on its Web site : " If Fr. Maciel and his charism as a founder are to be judged by the fruits of this work , those fruits are most impressive indeed . "
Weigel has since called on the Vatican to investigate the order .
CNN commentator William Bennett spoke at Legion gatherings and also said : " I am fortunate enough to know and trust the priests of the Legionaries of Christ .
...
The flourishing of the Legionaries is a cause for hope in a time of much darkness . "
Former CNN religion correspondent Delia Gallagher spoke at a Legion fundraiser , and William Donohue , president of the New York - based Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights , defended Maciel in a letter to the Hartford Courant , after a 1997 article that exposed Maciel 's history of pedophilia .
Two Legion priests are TV news celebrities : Jonathan Morris on FOX , and Tom Williams , a theology professor at the Legion university in Rome , for NBC during Katie Couric 's coverage of the 2005 conclave and again with Couric at CBS .
Consequences came late
In April 2005 , Ratzinger was elected pope .
In 2006 , as Benedict , he banished Maciel from ministry to a " life of prayer and penitence . "
Maciel left Rome in disgrace , though the Legionaries mounted a defense of his innocence .
In the last week of January 2008 , Maciel 's 21 - year - old daughter and her mother reportedly traveled from Spain to the Miami hospital where he lay dying .
That pleased him , while jarring several Legionaries ; but the women did not go on to Mexico for the funeral .
His three sons and their mother in Mexico avoided the funeral too .
His chosen Legion successors gathered in his remote hometown , Cotija de la Paz , for burial at a family crypt , far from his previously designated tomb at Rome 's Our Lady of Guadalupe Basilica , which he built in the 1950s .
Besides Fichter , who has a parish in New Jersey , two priests still serving the church who left the Legion several years ago drew on detailed knowledge of Maciel 's financial practices in lengthy interviews , answering questions in continuing telephone calls and e-mails .
These priests -- and two priests in Rome who are members of the Legion -- spoke on background , fearing repercussions to their careers were they to be identified .
This story also relies on international press accounts , works by Spanish and Mexican researchers , and attorneys who are piecing together information on Maciel 's financial strategy and his families .
NCR made repeated efforts to seek comment from the three cardinals who allegedly received substantial payments under Maciel 's auspices , by speaking with Vatican spokesman Fr. Federico Lombardi on the telephone and via follow - up e-mails .
Besides calls to the residences of the two cardinals in Rome , the paper made an extensive effort to contact now - Cardinal Dziwisz , in Krakow , Poland .
Iowana Hoffman , a Polish journalist in New York , translated a letter with questions for the cardinal , faxed it to Dziwisz 's press secretary , but was told that the cardinal " does not have time for an interview . "
Sodano , the former secretary of state and now dean of the College of Cardinals , and Martínez Somalo , former papal chamberlain , did not respond to messages left with Lombardi .
A receptionist who answered Sodano 's residential number said to call the Vatican .
The woman answering Martínez Somalo 's phone , when asked in Spanish if he would speak with a journalist , said emphatically , " No entrevista ! " --
" No interview . "
Had Sodano , Martínez Somalo and Dziwisz responded , the cardinals might have answered one question that hovers over this baroque financial drama :
How do Vatican officials decide what to report , and to whom , if they are given large sums of money ?
The Vatican has no constitution or statutes that would make such transactions illegal .
But those familiar with the strategy say it was Maciel 's goal to insulate himself from the Vatican 's archaic system of secret tribunals by making friends with men in power .
For most of his life , it worked .
Making friends in the right places
The Vatican office with the greatest potential to derail Maciel 's career before 2001 -- the year that Ratzinger persuaded John Paul to consolidate authority of abuse investigations in his office – was the Congregation for Religious , which oversaw religious orders such as the Dominicans , Franciscans and Legionaries , among many others .
According to two former Legionaries who spent years in Rome , Maciel paid for the renovation of the residence in Rome for the Argentine cardinal who was prefect of religious from 1976 to 1983 , the late Eduardo Francisco Pironio .
" That 's a pretty big resource , " explains one priest , who said the Legion 's work on the residence was expensive , and widely known at upper levels of the order .
" Pironio got his arm twisted to sign the Legion constitution . "
The Legion constitution included the highly controversial Private Vows , by which each Legionary swore never to speak ill of Maciel , or the superiors , and to report to them anyone who uttered criticism .
The vows basically rewarded spying as an expression of faith , and cemented the Legionaries ' lockstep obedience to the founder .
The vows were Maciel 's way of deflecting scrutiny as a pedophile .
But cardinals on the consultors ' board at Congregation for Religious balked on granting approval .
" Therefore , Maciel went to the pope through Msgr. Dziwisz , " said the priest .
" Two weeks later Pironio signed it . "
Dziwisz was John Paul 's closest confidante , a Pole who had a bedroom in the private quarters of the Apostolic Palace .
Maciel spent years cultivating Dziwisz 's support .
Under Maciel , the Legion steered streams of money to Dziwisz in his function as gatekeeper for the pope 's private Masses in the Apostolic Palace .
Attending Mass in the small chapel was a rare privilege for the occasional head of state , like British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his family .
" Mass would start at 7 a.m. , and there was always someone in attendance : laypeople , or priests , or groups of bishops , " Dziwisz wrote in a 2008 memoir , A Life With Karol : My Forty - Year Friendship With the Man Who Became Pope .
" When the guests came in ( there were never more than 50 ) , " Dziwisz wrote , " they often found the pope kneeling in prayer with his eyes closed , in a state of total abandonment , almost of ecstasy , completely unaware of who was entering the chapel .
...
For the laypeople , it was a great spiritual experience .
The Holy Father attached extreme importance to the presence of the lay faithful . "
One of the ex-Legionaries in Rome told NCR that a Mexican family in 1997 gave Dziwisz $ 50,000 upon attending Mass .
" We arranged things like that , " he said of his role as go - between .
Did John
Paul know about the funds ?
Only Dziwisz would know .
Given the pope 's ascetic lifestyle and accounts of his charitable giving , the funds could have gone to a deserving cause .
Dziwisz 's book says nothing of donations and contains no mention of Maciel or the Legion .
The priest who arranged for the Mexican family to attend Mass worried , in hindsight , about the frequency with which Legionaries facilitated funds to Dziwisz .
" This happened all the time with Dziwisz , " said a second ex-Legionary , who was informed of the transactions .
Fr. Alvaro Corcuera , who would succeed Maciel as director general in 2004 , and one or two other Legionaries " would go up to see Dziwisz on the third floor .
They were welcomed .
They were known within the household . "
Struggling to give context to the donations , this cleric continued : " You 're saying these laypeople are good and fervent , it 's good for them to meet the pope .
The expression is opera carita -- ' We 're making an offering for your works of charity . '
That 's the way it 's done .
In fact you do n't know where the money 's going . "
He paused .
" It 's an elegant way of giving a bribe . "
Recalling those events , he spoke of what made him leave the Legion .
" I woke up and asked : Am I giving my life to serve God , or one man who had his problems ?
It was not worth consecrating myself to Maciel . "
What 's a bribe ?
In terms of legal reality , does " an elegant way of giving a bribe " add up to bribery ?
The money from Maciel was given to heads of congregations in the early 1990s and the newspaper exposure of Maciel did not occur until 1997 , and the canon law case in 1998 .
Further , such exchanges are not considered bribes in the view of Nicholas Cafardi , a prominent canon lawyer and the dean emeritus of Duquesne University Law School in Pittsburgh .
Cafardi , who has done work as a legal consultant for many bishops , responded to a general question about large donations to priests or church officials in the Vatican .
Under church law ( canon 1302 ) , a large financial gift to an official in Rome " would qualify as a pious cause , " explains Cafardi .
He spoke in broad terms , saying that such funds should be reported to the cardinal - vicar for Rome .
An expensive gift , like a car , need not be reported .
" That 's how I read the law .
I know of no exceptions .
Cardinals do have to report gifts for pious causes .
If funds are given for the official 's personal charity , that is not a pious cause and need not be reported . "
Because the cardinals did not respond to interview requests , NCR has been unable to determine whether they reported to Vatican officials the money they allegedly received from the Legion .
" Maciel wanted to buy power , " said the priest who facilitated the Mexican family 's opera carita to Dziwisz .
He did not use the word bribery , but in explaining why he left the Legion , morality was at issue .
" It got to a breaking point for me [ over ] a culture of lying [ within the order ] .
The superiors know they 're lying and they know that you know , " he said .
" They lie about money , where it comes from , where it goes , how it 's given . "
When Martínez Somalo , a Spaniard , became head of the congregation overseeing religious in 1994 , Maciel dispatched this priest to Martínez Somalo 's home .
The young priest carried an envelope thick with cash .
" I did n't bat an eye , " he recalled .
" I went up to his apartment , handed him the envelope , said goodbye .
...
It was a way of making friends , insuring certain help if it were needed , oiling the cogs . "
Martínez Somalo did not respond to NCR interview requests .
Glenn Favreau , a Legionary in Rome from 1990 to 1997 , and today an attorney in Washington , D.C. , recalled : " Martínez Somalo was talked about a lot in the Legion , always in the context of ' our superior ' because he was our friend .
Un amigo de Legion . "
Favreau , who knew nothing of the donation to Martínez Somalo , continued : " There were cardinals who were n't amigos .
They would n't call them enemies , but everyone knew who they were .
Pio Laghi did not like the Legion . "
Cardinal Laghi , former papal nuncio to the United States , was then prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education .
Martínez Somalo's office took a new name : Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life .
But the job description stayed the same .
From 1994 to 2004 , the Spanish cardinal 's duties included investigating any complaints about religious orders or their leaders .
In the files of that congregation , according to several former Legionaries , sat letters that dated back many years , accusing Maciel of abusing seminarians .
When the wrenching accounts of nine seminary - victims of Maciel made news in the 1997 Hartford Courant , Martínez Somalo did nothing .
That was the reaction throughout the Roman curia .
John Paul named Martínez Somalo to the post of carmelango , or chamberlain , the official in charge of the conclave when a pope is elected .
Today , the cardinal in charge of the congregation that oversees religious orders is Franc Rodé .
He lavished praise on Maciel , the Legion and its lay wing , Regnum Christi , for years .
One cardinal who rebuffed a Legion financial gift was Joseph Ratzinger .
In 1997 he gave a lecture on theology to Legionaries .
When a Legionary handed him an envelope , saying it was for his charitable use , Ratzinger refused .
" He was tough as nails in a very cordial way , " a witness said .
Maciel 's modus operandi
Maciel traveled incessantly , drawing funds from Legion centers in Mexico , Rome and the United States .
Certain ex-Legionaries with knowledge of the order 's finances believe that Maciel constantly drew from Legion coffers to subsidize his families .
For years Maciel had Legion priests dole out envelopes with cash and donate gifts to officials in the curia .
In the days leading up to Christmas , Legion seminarians spent hours packaging the baskets with expensive bottles of wine , rare brandy , and cured Spanish hams that alone cost upward of $ 1,000 each .
Priests involved in the gifts and larger cash exchanges say that in hindsight they view Maciel 's strategy as akin to an insurance policy , to protect himself should he be exposed and to position the Legion as an elite presence in the workings of the Vatican .
Fichter , the former Legion member , is today pastor of Sacred Heart Parish in Haworth , N.J .
He has been a diocesan priest for a decade , and serves in the Newark archdiocese .
He coordinated the Legion 's administrative office in Rome from February 1998 until October 2000 .
" When Fr. Maciel would leave Rome it was my duty to supply him with $ 10,000 in cash -- $ 5,000 in American dollars , and the other half in the currency of the country to which he was traveling , " explained Fichter .
" I would be informed by one of his assistants that he was leaving and I would have to prepare the funds for him .
I never questioned that he was not using it for good and noble purposes .
It was a routine part of my job .
He was so totally above reproach that I felt honored to have that role .
He did not submit any receipts and I would have not dared to ask him for a receipt . "
Fichter was reluctant to be interviewed , expressing concern that his views be fully reflected .
" As Legionaries our norms concerning the use of money were very restricted , " he began .
" If I went on an outing I was given $ 20 and if I had a pizza I 'd return the $ 15 to my superior with a receipt .
The sad thing is that we were so naive .
We were scrupulously trying to live our vow of poverty and yet never questioned [ Maciel 's ] own fidelity to the same .
" So many of my old classmates are still in the Legion and I feel that they are going through such a hard time right now .
I do n't want to have my words misconstrued .
... Maciel hoodwinked everyone .
In hindsight I regret that I and so many others were so gullible .
Thankfully , for me that was many years ago . "
Since earning his doctorate in sociology from Rutgers University , Fichter has worked as a research associate for the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate ( CARA ) at Georgetown University in Washington .
" I am very happy as a pastor and in the research work I am doing for the good of the church .
At this stage of my life , having collaborated with the Vatican investigation of the Legion , I pray each day for those who are still Legionaries .
If I can help them in any way I will . "
Justice delayed
After the ex-Legion victims filed a canonical case in 1998 against Maciel in the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , Sodano as secretary of state -- essentially , the Vatican prime minister -- pressured Ratzinger , as the congregation 's prefect , to halt the proceeding .
As NCR reported in 2001 , José Barba , a college professor in Mexico City and ex-Legionary who filed the 1998 case in Ratzinger 's office , learned from the canonist handling the case , Martha Wegan in Rome , of Sodano 's role .
" Sodano came over with his entire family , 200 of them , for a big meal when he was named cardinal , " recalled Favreau .
" And we fed them all .
When he became secretary of state there was another celebration .
He 'd come over for special events , like the groundbreaking with a golden shovel for the House of Higher Studies .
And a dinner after that . "
The intervention of a high Vatican official in a tribunal case illustrates the fragile nature of the system , and in the Maciel case , how a guilty man escaped punishment for years .
" Cardinal Sodano was the cheerleader for the Legion , " said one of the ex-Legionaries .
" He 'd come give a talk at Christmas and they 'd give him $ 10,000 . "
Another priest recalled a $ 5,000 donation to Sodano .
But in December 2004 , with John Paul 's health deteriorating by the day , Ratzinger broke with Sodano and ordered a canon lawyer on his staff , Msgr. Charles Scicluna , to investigate .
Two years later , as Benedict , he approved the order that Maciel abandon ministry for a " life of penitence and prayer . "
Maciel had " more than 20 but less than 100 victims , " an unnamed Vatican official told NCR 's John Allen at the time .
The congregation cited Maciel 's age in opting against a full trial .
An influential Vatican official told NCR that Sodano insisted on softening the language of the Vatican communiqué -- to praise the Legion and its 60,000 - member lay wing , Regnum Christi -- despite the order 's nine - year Web site campaign denouncing the seminary victims .
The Legion 's damage control rolled into a new phase with its statement that compared Maciel to Christ for refusing to defend himself , and accepting his " new cross " with " tranquility of conscience . "
Maciel left Rome , the scandal seemingly over .
Internally , the Legion insisted to its members and followers that Maciel was innocent .
In 2009 , a year after Maciel 's death , the Legion disclosed its surprise on discovering that he had a daughter .
The news jolted the order and its lay arm , Regnum Christi .
Yet in an organization built on a cult of personality , the long praise from John Paul suggested a legacy of virtue in Maciel .
Legion officials scrambled to suppress skepticism .
Two Legion priests told NCR in July that seminarians in Rome were still being taught about Maciel 's virtuous life .
" They are being brainwashed , as if nothing happened , " said a Legionary , sitting on a bench near Rome 's Tiber River .
Thanks to Sodano 's intervention , the order clung to a shaky defense in arguing that the Vatican never specifically said that Maciel abused anyone .
How much Legion officials knew about Maciel 's other life -- the daughter with her mother in Madrid and three sons with their mother in Mexico -- is a pivotal issue in the Vatican inquiry underway .
How much money did Maciel use to support his families ?
How much did he siphon off for other purposes behind the guise of a religious charity ?
Behind these questions loom others about money in the Vatican .
Are envelopes with thousands of dollars in cash given to cardinals when they say Mass , give talks or have dinner in a religious house mere donations ?
The Legion of Christ raises money as a charity .
How does it record such outlays ?
Does anyone in the Vatican have access to Legion financial records ?
When Dziwisz became a bishop in 1998 , the Legion covered the costs of his reception at its complex in Rome .
" Dziwisz helped the Legion in many ways , " said a priest who facilitated payments .
" He convinced the pope to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Legion . "
In a book on Maciel published in Spain , journalist Alfonso Torres Robles calls an event on Jan. 3 , 1991 , " one of the most powerful demonstrations of strength by the Legion ... at St. Peter 's Basilica in Rome , when John Paul II ordained 60 Legionaries into the priesthood , in the presence of 7,000 Regnum Christi members from different countries , 15 cardinals , 52 bishops and many millionaire benefactors . "
Maciel had the event filmed and a sequence used in a video the Legion sold until 2006 .
John Paul was a strategic image in Legion mass mailings and the video shown to potential donors when seminarians accompanied priests to their homes .
The Legion no longer circulates the video .
The Legion has a presence in 23 countries , with dozens of elite prep schools , religious formation houses , and several universities .
Maciel 's strategy of buying influence unrolled over five decades .

Part II : How Fr. Maciel built his empire
First , officials in Hollywood proposed capping a portion of the Hollywood Freeway and building a park on top of it .
Then Santa Monica officials began talking about another park - cap project above a section of the Santa Monica Freeway .
Now Caltrans is reviving talk of a massive park and development project atop what is known as the Slot , the below - grade section of the 101 Freeway that runs between the Civic Center and Chinatown .
The concept has gotten less publicity than the Hollywood Freeway cap proposal , but it has been talked about for several years .
And it 's very ambitious .
According to Caltrans , the idea would be to cap about a half - mile of the 101 just east of the 110 Freeway .
Designers have said the park project could help unite neighborhoods now divided by the freeway , which is bisected by a series of bridges .
On the south is the Civic Center , Bunker Hill and Little Tokyo ; on the north is Olvera Street , Chinatown and the Union Station area .
Britain has expelled Mossad 's chief representative in London and has described as “ intolerable ” the Israeli spy agency 's alleged use of British passports to aid the assassination of a senior Hamas operative in Dubai .
The Foreign Secretary , David Milliband , made a special statement in the House of Commons overnight , accusing Israel of a “ profound disregard ” for Britain and its sovereignty .
" No country or government could stand by in such a situation .
I have asked that a member of the embassy of Israel be withdrawn from the UK as a result of this affair and this is taking place , " Mr Milliband said .
" The fact that this was done by a country which is a friend , with significant diplomatic , cultural , business and personal ties to the UK , only adds insult to injury . "
Mr Milliband refused to identify the diplomat to be expelled or even if he or she was an intelligence officer , but newspapers in London reported that senior Foreign Office sources have confirmed it was Mossad 's top representative at the embassy .
Supermarket group
Tesco , which pumps out some four million tonnes of carbon a year , today opened its first zero carbon store as part of its bid to be a carbon ­neutral company by 2050 .
The shop , in Ramsey , Cambridgeshire , is timber - framed rather than steel , and uses skylights and sun pipes to cut lighting costs .
It also has a combined heat and power plant powered by renewable bio-fuels , exporting extra electricity back to the national grid .
In addition the refrigerators – one of the biggest blackspots for food retailers trumpeting their green credentials – have doors to save energy and harmful HFC refrigerant gases have been replaced .
Tesco chief executive Sir Terry Leahy said : " It shows that you can dramatically alter how much carbon you use and life can go on " .
The new store , he said , " cost 30 % more to build , but it uses 50 % less energy , and with oil at $ 70 a barrel it is a business case in itself " .
To coincide with the Ramsey opening , the supermarket chain said it intended to spend more than £ 100 m with green technology companies , although Leahy was unsure of the level of supermarket 's current spend on this .
Tesco has been at the forefront of the grocers ' race to be green .
The UK's biggest supermarket has provided £ 25 m of funding for the University of Manchester to set up a sustainable consumption institute , and has a 10 - point community plan , with pledges to increase local sourcing and to consult local communities in an attempt to be viewed as a good neighbour .
Separately , new market research data released today showed that Tesco 's bid to lure back shoppers with double clubcard points and a surprise pre-Christmas mail - out of money - off vouchers has paid dividends and put pressure on Asda .
The Kantar Worldpanel data , formerly known as TNS , shows Tesco 's market share climbed from 30.4 % to 30.5 % in the 12 weeks to 24 January compared to the same period a year ago .
Asda meanwhile , has slipped from 17 % to 16.9 % over the same period .
Last weekend Asda broke with tradition and offered discount vouchers in a bid to entice lost shoppers .
Morrisons recorded a more than 10 % sales improvement , resulting in a market share of 12.5 % , up from 11.8 % a year ago .
Waitrose is the biggest winner , with growth of 17.5 % , taking the upmarket grocer to a market share of 4.1 % , compared to 3.5 % a year ago .
At the other end of the scale the discounters – led by Aldi and Lidl – are now losing market share after a boom at the start of the recession .

ATHENS , Greece —
When civil unrest hits Greece , Giorgos Papadapoulos is usually standing behind a riot shield , protecting parliament , not protesting outside .
But today , the 28 - year - old policeman joined tens of thousands of teachers , dockworkers , postal employees and journalists marching against a set of painful government austerity measures that mean his already small paycheck will shrink even further .
“ It ’s a different feeling for me , ” he said , glancing at Greece ’s parliament .
“ But this is important .
It hurts me and my family . ”
Under pressure from international markets and its European partners to reduce its deficit , the Greek government last week announced a raft of tax increases and a 30 percent cut to the two - months of “ bonus ” pay Greek civil servants receive each year .
That may not sound like a big deal , but for low - paid state workers like Papadapoulos , the holiday pay — known as “ gifts ” or “ doro ” in Greek — is n’t extra money .
It ’s part of the yearly income they rely on to survive .
In Greece , as in some other European countries , salaries are divided into 14 months , rather than 12 .
Workers get an additional month ’s salary at Christmas , and half a month ’s salary both at Easter and before the August summer holidays .
This is mandated by law and is true for employees in both the public and private sectors .
Many Greeks set aside the money for vacations and big purchases , or use it to pay off debts accrued during the rest of the year .
But for Papadapoulos , even before the cuts , there was n’t money for holidays or luxuries — he relied on the bonuses to help meet regular bills .
After five years on the force , Papadapoulos takes home 1,000 euros a month , about $ 1,360 .
About 600 euros — $ 820 — goes to pay rent and utilities , leaving him just 400 euros ( $ 546 ) a month to support his wife and 4 - year - old child .
With the cuts , this Easter he will receive a bonus of only 350 euros , instead of the normal 500 euros .
“ Four - hundred euros to take care of my wife , my child , ” he said .
“ You can see how difficult it is to live on this . ”
Faced with a soaring deficit and oversized state debt , Greece ’s government implemented the measures in an attempt to reassure international markets and its eurozone partners that it would not go bankrupt .
The measures come after an initial round of spending cuts and revenue increases announced in December failed to assuage international fears about the country ’s credit worthiness .
But the new measures are unpopular and anger against them is growing .
Today a protest organized by the country ’s main unions turned violent .
Groups of masked youths smashed the windows of banks and luxury stores and hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police .
Greece 's government says it had not choice but many analysts still fear the measures could deepen the country 's current recession , causing widespread pain across Greek society .
Konstantinos Michalos , president of the Athens Chamber of Commerce , says Greece needed to make deep cuts to deal with its debt crisis , but he disagrees with the specific measures the government has announced .
Instead of an across - the - board pay cut for all civil servants , Michalos said the government could have structured cuts to target higher paid civil servants and brought in more revenue by tackling the widespread tax evasion among the self - employed .
The cuts to public workers ’ salaries , along with the 2 percent increase in the value added tax ( VAT ) , he warned , would result lower consumption and could mean a longer , more painful recession for all Greeks .
“ There are measures which are absolutely necessary and painful , but the time delay that the government has taken over these measures , and the actual direction of the measures , we feel they ’re in the wrong direction , ” he said .
While the cuts to bonus payments will only hit public employees , all Greeks will feel the impact of the increase in the VAT from 19 percent to 21 percent , which is applied to most services and goods .
Greece ’s socialist government had initially resisted raising the tax , fearing that it would have a disproportionate effect on the country ’s poorest .
But given Greece ’s widespread tax evasion , indirect taxes like VAT are the most effective way to raise money quickly .
Most vulnerable to the increases are Greece ’s urban poor , like Aris Diamandaras , a 76 - year - old pensioner .
After working for 45 years as a painter , he now receives a monthly payment of 650 euros , about $ 885 , from a state pension fund .
With this , he supports his wife and an adult daughter who graduated from university five years ago with a degree in French philology , but ca n’t find a job .
Like 68 percent of Greeks , he owns his apartment , but even so , his meager pension allows for few luxuries .
Under the austerity measures , this year his pension will be frozen .
But the increased taxes mean prices will continue to go up .
“ The money the government gives us to live is not enough .
The prices keep going up , but our pensions stay the same , ” he said , worry beads clicking between his fingers .
“ Sometimes I am desperate , because I do n’t see anything getting better in the future . ”
As for Papadapoulos , the policeman , he ’s unused to the novelty of being cheered by protesters .
Usually , they hurl abuse and stones at police .
He says he ’ll keep protesting , but he has little hope anyone is listening .
“ I hope the government will hear us , but I do n’t think so , ” he said .

Powerful Scientific Evidence PROVES evolution is a lie

From Creation to Sabbath
Mr & Mrs Atheist :
What say ye now ?!
VIDEO : Think about the God that created you as you watch this
Genesis 1:1 , " In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth . "
Ever notice how evolutionists will manipulate reality to try and do away with creationism ?
For example , when you ask an evolutionist how they come up with the age of the sedimentary layers in the earth , they will always tell you they date them by the fossils found in those sedimentary layers .
Then when you ask them how they come up with the age of the fossils , they say their age is determined by which sedimentary layer of rock they 're found in .
But how can that be ?
How can the rocks date the layers , if the layers date the rocks ?
That 's what 's called " circular reasoning . "
One minute they say the rock determines the age of the fossil , the next they say the fossil determines the age of the rock .
Darwin said " It is a truly wonderful fact .
that all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other . "
- The Origin of the Species p 170 .
The evolutionist agrees with Darwin and says all life on earth evolved from primordial soup , which then somehow formed into many different species like birds , animals , plants , fish etc ; and those birds , animals , plants and fish evolved into many different types of species themselves .
For example , they believe a bird later formed different types of lizards , horses and dogs .
They also believe that plants created everything from vines to trees to flowers , and fish evolved into dinosaurs , apes and humans .
If that 's true , then I have to ask the evolutionist why is it for the last 6000 years of recorded history that not a single new species has ever been created ?
Scientific fact is , we still have many of the old species among us , and we know of many that did in fact become extinct .
But not a single bird has been found that used to be a fish .
And not a single bird has been found that is related to a lizard .
If life truly evolves like they say it does , why did it all of a sudden stop dead in its tracks 6000 years ago ?
After all , if life is as they define it to be , then it must be a constant evolutionary process for life to continue , which means that evolutionary process be never ending .
Some have claimed that mutations are evolution because of some moth that changed its color years ago .
Real scientists discovered that the moth changed its color because of its environment .
In other words , if just changing its color means they evolved , then that must mean that every time I work in the garden and get a tan I 'm actually evolving ?
And by the way , I say 6000 years because as Christians we know by reading Genesis chapters 1 & 2 that our Lord created all that is seen and unseen in creation week 6000 years ago .
We also know this is when creation stopped and He hallowed the day He rested .
We call that day Sabbath to this day and we keep it holy to acknowledge Him as our Creator every seventh day .
Could it be this is why Satan inspired Darwin with evolution ?
I believe so because evolution allows you to hide the fact you were created and in so doing removes your requirement to acknowledge Him as Lord which would mean you need to and obey Him since
He truly would know what 's best for you seeing how it is He that made you .
Getting back , the evolutionist believes the evolutionary cycle is never ending , but they too cannot explain why according to their Darwin inspired calculations that there has been no new species recorded for hundreds of millions of years , let alone the true 6000 years as reality dictates .
They also state it takes billions of years for each animal , insect or plant to evolve .
If that 's true , why do we have termites ?
Termites eat wood but can't digest it .
In their intestines are smaller insects that digest the cellulose the termites place in there for them .
Kind of like the worm inside the cricket .
The termite can't exist without the smaller insect , and the smaller insect can't live without the termite .
If evolution is true neither insect should be on this planet .
There are even some that believe in Creation , but not the Bible version wherein it took only 6 days .
These so called " Creationists " insist it took 1000 years for each " day " of creation because 2 Peter 3:8 says , " one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day "
If they are n't twisting that passage out of context and it is as they claim , why do we have wasps that rely on certain plants to lay their eggs within them to procreate .
And if this is true , how do those plants survive without the wasp pollinating them ?
If the plants and the wasps were created thousands of years apart , how does the plant pollinate without the wasp , and how does the wasp procreate without the plant ?
That means the 1000 years for each day recorded in Genesis must be wrong by simply applying easy to research reality .
Moving right alone , we have the big bang theory which declares a spinning dot of absolutely nothing exploded to form all the planets , stars , asteroids , black holes , quasars , nova's , and primordial soup found on earth .
According to the scientific discovery called , " conservation of angular momentum " , which actually means , if what 's spinning in a clockwise manner explodes , everything flying off of it will explode in the exact same manner .
That being the case , why is it 2 planets , and numerous moons orbiting many planets in our galaxy alone spin in a different direction than all the others .
If their big bang theory was true , why is it those planets and moons appear to have come off of a different explosion ?
Were there two big bangs ?
Jumping ahead a bit , let 's take a look at man for example .
The Word of God says we were created with Human bodies that have organs that are designed to live forever .
Science has recently proven that if we were to learn something new every second , we would take well over 3 million years to exhaust the memory capacity of our " post flood " brains .
( Pre - flood brains were 3 times larger )
Now keep in mind , no one learns something every second .
They just calculated it that way to get an educated idea .
Most will learn something new once a week or even once a month and later in life once every few months or so .
That means the human brain , as small as it is now , can handle the data for literally billions of years .
That being the case , we see that evolutionists also claim that all species evolve after there is a need for a change .
So I have to ask , how is it possible for us to have a brain that could hold enough info to last over billions of years , when all we can live up to is 90 - 100 years ?
If evolution is true , why have n't we evolved to age extremely slow so as to meet the requirements of our own brains , wherein we can live for an eternity ?
When you get time I would like to ask you to view a video of a scientific experiment wherein they show how sound waves can actually create visible light when they are directed towards a body of water .
The video can be found online .
It 's titled , " What happens when you collapse an underwater bubble with a soundwave ? "
The link is found in box # 4 of this sermon 's notes .
When you watch that video you will be amazed at how nothing but sound - waves pointed at water did in fact create light , just as the Bible dictates .
Genesis 1:2-3 , " And the earth was without form , and void ; and darkness was upon the face of the deep .
And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters .
And God said , Let there be light : and there was light . "
Ok ..
Picture a sphere of water in Space .
God literally SPEAKS and says , " Let there be light . "
That amazingly loud blast of sound causes the water to form a small bubble within it .
Then that sphere of water collapses internally upon that bubble , and as we see in that video , " there was light " created at that exact moment .
Better yet , the scientists also discovered there was an enormous amount of heat generated when that happened , and the method by which the heat arrives is what they deduce to this day is what caused our Sun to be formed in our Solar System .
Pretty convincing argument for the creationist is it not ?
Ok .. let 's talk dinosaurs .
Were you aware that Tyrannosaurus Rex was not a meat eater ?
Yes , I am fully aware that every evolutionist , and Hollywood director insists that he was .
But Christian scientists have recently discovered two things about T - Rex that proves we have all been lied to for quite some time .
They found that the roots of T - Rex 's teeth were only 2 inches deep .
That means , had he bit into the hide of another dinosaur in his day he would have lost all his teeth .
When you compare the size of T - Rex and the fact his roots were only 2 inches deep , he could n't have possibly been able to break the hide of such animals as most evolutionists have him eating .
His teeth would have broken off before he even broke the skin .
Better yet , were you also aware that these same scientists took one of the teeth they dug up , cut it in half , and they actually found the teeth to be gorged with chlorophyll all the way to the center of the tooth .
This confirms he never ate meat .
Ever .
Now because this evidence is so well known now among scientific circles , evolutionists know they cannot say it 's not true .
The data has been published , and they were caught in a lie .
But to try and cover the lie , some evolutionists now claim his teeth are gorged with chlorophyll because he ate dinosaurs that were vegan .
Problem with that theory is , it still does n't negate the fact that the teeth of T - Rex only had roots that went 2 inches deep , which would still make it impossible for them to eat meat .
Still , the Christian scientists also offered data that showed the teeth of modern day animals that eat only herbivores .
That 's right , their teeth had absolutely no chlorophyll in them .
By the way , this discovery concerning T - Rex also validates the Biblical record once again !
Before the flood of Noah , which is when evolutionists claim dinosaurs roamed the earth , and they also claim no man was alive then , we have a Bible verse that declares they were not originally designed to be meat eaters .
Genesis 1:30 , " And to every beast of the earth , and to every fowl of the air , and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth , wherein there is life , I have given every green herb for meat : and it was so . "
Still , some claimed this to be impossible by using mankind as an example .
They claimed that we as humans must eat meat to receive the proteins found in meat to grow big and strong .
They claim that without meat we could n't gain weight or become strong enough to sustain life .
Besides the fact that you can actually find much more protein in some plant life than you will ever find in meat , look around on planet earth for a moment .
Look at all the HUGE animals like cows , horses , hippos , elephants , rhinos .
etc .
Or look at some of the ancient dinosaurs that evolutionists do admit were herbivores , like the brontosaurus or thunder lizards that were the largest mammals ever to walk the earth .
All of them were herbivores !
How did they get so big ?
How is it the elephant , giraffe or hippos , just to name a few , are so large yet they never eat meat ?
Now I would like to get into a few scientific facts I found that can do a much better job and confirming what I saw .
After all , I 'm no scientist .
So , I would like to quote a few if you do n't mind .
As we know just by opening our educational science books , evolutionists have constructed the Geologic Column in order to illustrate the supposed progression of how " primitive " life forms into " more complex " systems we observe today .
Problem with that assumption is .
" since only a small percentage of the earth 's surface obeys even a . portion of the geologic column .
the claim of their having taken place to form a continuum of rock / life / time .over the earth is therefore a fantastic and imaginative contrivance . "
- Woodmorappe , John , " The Essential Non-Existence of the Evolutionary Uniformitarian Geologic Column : A Quantitative Assessment , " Creation Research Society Quarterly , vol. 18 , no.1 ( Terre Haute , Indiana , June 1981 ) , pp. 46-71 Furthermore , it was found that .
" The lack of transitional series cannot be explained as being due to the scarcity of material .
The deficiencies are real , they will never be filled . "
- Nilsson , N. Heribert , as quoted in Arthur C. Custance , The Earth Before Man , Part II , Doorway Papers , no .
20 ( Ontario , Canada : Doorway Publications ) , p. 51 " This supposed column is actually saturated with " polystrate fossils " ( fossils extending from one geologic layer to another ) that tie all the layers to one time - frame .
" To the unprejudiced , the fossil record of plants is in favor of special creation . "
- Corner , E.J.H. , Contemporary Botanical Thought , ed. A.M. MacLeod and L.S. Cobley ( Chicago : Quadrangle Books , 1961 ) , p. 97
And yes , " special creation " means a Creator had to have done this .
Next we have .
The decay of earth 's magnetic field .
One of the benefits of living in today 's world is that we not only have ample evidence the magnetic field is diminishing , thanks to all the beached whales that migrate in accordance with the magnetic poles .
We also have concrete evidence that it 's shifting its position at airports .
Just a few years ago most airports had to re-paint the numbers on their runways for the pilots who use them in their landing sequence .
Those numbers represent the numeric position of true magnetic north and need to be entered into the plane 's computer for landing safely .
But since the poles are changing , they needed to recalculate .
" Planes and their technology rely on the earth 's magnetic fields to navigate around the globe safely .
The shift this time has been so great , that Tampa International has had to close its main runway until January 13 th , so that they can get everything changed , including taxi way signs , so that they can make sure the shift , has been accounted for . " - art. Magnetic North Pole Shift Affects Airports .
Fox News .
" Dr. Thomas Barnes , Emeritus Professor of Physics at the University of Texas at El Paso , has published the definitive work in this field .
Scientific observations since 1829 have shown that the earth 's magnetic field has been measurably decaying at an exponential rate , demonstrating its half - life to be approximately 1,400 years .
In practical application its strength 20,000 years ago would approximate that of a magnetic star .
Under those conditions many of the atoms necessary for life processes could not form .
These data demonstrate that earth 's entire history is young , within a few thousand of years . "
- Barnes , Thomas , ICR Technical Monograph # 4 , Origin and Destiny of the Earth 's Magnetic Field ( 2 nd edition , 1983 ) Think about that .
We now have scientific evidence that as little as 20,000 years ago our planet would have been a magnetic star had evolution been correct .
Some scientists even claim it was as little as 10,000 years ago .
Life cannot form or survive on or near a magnetic star because the properties of such an environment would cause the atoms that form our bodies , trees , animals , planet or even water and earth unable to adhere to each other .
This one basic fact confirms all of evolutionary theory to be bad science at best .
Now for the global flood .
Scientists and historians have stated ; " The Biblical record clearly describes a global Flood during Noah 's day .
Additionally , there are hundreds of Flood traditions handed down through cultures all over the world . "
- Blick , Edward , A Scientific Analysis of Genesis ( Oklahoma City : Hearthstone , 1991 ) p. 103 " M.E. Clark and Henry Voss have demonstrated the scientific validity of such a Flood providing the sedimentary layering we see on every continent . "
- Clark , M.E. and Voss , H.D. , " Fluid Mechanic Examination of the Tial Mechanism for Producing Mega - Sedimantary Layering " ( Third International Conference on Creation , Pittsburg , July 1994 ) " Secular scholars report very rapid sedimentation and periods of great carbonate deposition in earth 's sedimentary layers .. " - Ager , Derek , The Nature of the Stratigraphical Record ( New York : John Wiley and Sons ) p. 43 and p. 86 " It is now possible to prove the historical reality of the Biblical Flood . " - West , John Anthony , Serpent in the Sky : The High Wisdom of Ancient Egypt ( New York : Julian Press , 1987 ) pp. 13 - 14 Next we have population statistics .
" World population growth rate in recent times is about 2 % per year .
Practicable application of growth rate throughout human history would be about half that number .
Wars , disease , famine , etc. have wiped out approximately one third of the population on average every 82 years .
Starting with eight people , and applying these growth rates since the Flood of Noah 's day ( about 4500 years ago ) would give a total human population at just under six billion people .
However , application on an evolutionary time scale runs into major difficulties .
Starting with one " couple " just 41,000 years ago would give us a total population of 2 x 10 89 .
- See Morris , Henry , Scientific Creationism ( El Cajon , CA : Master Books )
In other words , if we are to believe the evolutionists , there would be so many people on earth right now that we would not be able to survive because every bit of farmland and every bit of open range where animals graze would be taken up by humans standing side by side .
In fact , there would n't even be room enough for us to build homes or even walls between us .
We would be that tightly packed .
And not just on Earth , but that number suggests it would be this way on every planet in the Universe .
And all this would happen within 41,000 years .
I can't even contemplate how bad it would be if as evolutionists claim modern man came to be around 400,000 years ago .
Ok , here 's where it gets interesting .
My favorite , radio halos that are still to this day found in samples of granite .
" Physicist Robert Gentry has reported isolated radio halos of polonuim - 214 in crystalline granite .
The half - life of this element is 0.000164 seconds !
To record the existence of this element in such short time span , the granite must be in crystalline state instantaneously . " - Gentry , Robert , Creation 's Tiny Mystery ( Knoxville , Tenn. : Earth Science Assoc.,1988 )
This runs counter to evolutionary estimates of 300 million years for the granite crust to form .
Recently there have been evolutionists online in newsgroups and on blogs that have claimed Polonium 214 does n't exist .
Main reason being is because they declare the Granite in the earth 's crust took many hundreds of millions of years to form and finally cool down .
Seeing how Polonium 214 takes less than a thousand of a second to expend all its half - lifes , they assume evidence of it can't possibly be found in granite .
HOWEVER , if you click here you will see one of many online Scientific websites that list the element Polonium 214 to be found on Planet earth .
On that page they share evidence that Polonium 214 is in fact a chemical profile that can and has been recorded by many scientists .
Praise the Lord we have yet another factoid to prove evolution is a lie of Satan .
What I like about the evidence unearthed on all this is that , even though they claim the granite took hundreds millions of years to cool , and polonium 214's half - life is only 0.000164 seconds , the fact those halos are seen clearly in every sample of granite the world over proves the granite had to have been created instantly without any cooling period as they claim .
If the cooling period was even just one hour , the halo or circular shadow caused by the polonium would have been dissolved in the molten granite .
But those halos are still very visible !
Now we have human artifacts found throughout the geologic column .
" Man -made artifacts - such as the hammer in Cretaceous rock , a human sandal print with trilobite in Cambrian rock , human footprints and a handprint in Cretaceous rock - point to the fact that all the supposed geologic periods actually occurred at the same time in the recent past .
" - Baugh , Carl , Why Do Men Believe Evolution AGAINST ALL ODDS ?
( Oklahoma City : Hearthstone , 1999 ) In other words , evolutionists claim mankind arrived at a certain time and therefore all evidence of humans can only be found in a certain layer in the geologic column .
But this scientist , as well as hundreds of others , have proven evidence of man have been found in all periods , including those when dinosaurs roamed the earth .
Next we have to ask the evolutionist about the helium content in Earth 's atmosphere .
" Physicist Melvin Cook , Nobel Prize medalist found that helium - 4 enters our atmosphere from solar wind and radioactive decay of uranium .
At present rates our atmosphere would accumulate current helium - 4 amounts in less than 10,000 years . "
- Cook , Melvin , " Where is The Earth 's Radiogenic Helium ? "
Nature , Vol. 179 , p. 213
That means , calculating by the actual content of helium in the atmosphere today , the planet can't possibly be older than 10,000 years .
If it was much older as the evolutionist claims , all of us would suffocate due to the fact helium would be the main gas in the air today .
Now we have the expansion of the space fabric itself to contend with .
" Astronomical estimates of the distance to various galaxies gives conflicting data . " - Cowan , R. , " Further Evidence of a Youthful Universe , " Science News , Vol. 148 , p. 166 " Astrophysicist Russell Humphries demonstrates that such space expansion would dilate time in distant space . "
- Humphries , Russell , Starlight and Time ( Green Forest , AR : Master Books , 1994 ) " The Biblical Record refers to the expansion of space by the Creator . " - Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 Psalms 104:2 , " Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment : who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain :"
Isaiah 40:22 , " It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth , and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers ; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain , and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in :"
The biblical record confirms a recent creation as well as gives credence to the great distances we now see between the stars and planets in our present day .
Now we have the obvious evidence of a designer in all living systems .
" A living cell is so awesomely complex that its interdependent components stagger the imagination and defy evolutionary explanations .
A minimal cell contains over 60,000 proteins of 100 different configurations . "
- Denton , Michael , Evolution : A Theory in Crisis ( Bethesda , Maryland : Adler & Adler , 1986 ) p. 263 " The chance of this assemblage occurring by chance is 1 in 10 4,478,296 .
- Mastropaolo , Joseph , " Evolution Is Biologically Impossible , " Impact # 317 ( El Cajon , CA : Institute For Creation Research , 1999 ) p. 4 I can't even contemplate a number that big !
All I know is , if we were to place an atom for ever digit in that number alongside another atom , the entire Universe would become a very dense brick of matter that nothing , not even life or light itself could coexist .
And finally , the design of the human brain .
" The human brain is the most complicated structure in the known universe . " - Restak , Richard , The Brain : The Last Frontier , 1979 , p. 390 " It contains over 100 billion cells , each with over 50,000 neuron connections to other brain cells . "
- The Brain , Our Universe Within , PBS Video " This structure receives over 100 million separate signals from the total human body every second .
If we learned something new every second of our lives , it would take three million years to exhaust the capacity of the human brain . "
- Wonders of God's Creation , Moody Video Series
" In addition to conscious thought , people can actually reason , anticipate consequences , and devise plans - all without knowing t hey are doing so . "
- Weiss , Joseph , " Unconscious Mental Functioning , " Scientific American , March 1990 , p. 103
There are many other instances of creation that scientists have recently confirmed can only be the end result of intelligent design of course , but I felt that the few I compiled here would be enough to convince the scoffer to at least plant a seed of truth deep within the heart that one day may be the means by which our Creator God can actually introduce Himself to them .
That is the hope and prayer of this ministry as well as that of every believer in the God of all creation .
Sir Isaac Newton 's Atheist Friend :
That a maker is required for anything that is made is a lesson Sir Isaac Newton was able to teach forcefully to an atheist - scientist friend of his .
Sir Isaac had an accomplished artisan fashion for him a small scale model of our solar system which was to be put in a room in Newtons home when completed .
The assignment was finished and installed on a large table .
The workman had done a very commendable job , simulating not only the various sizes of the planets and their relative proximities , but also so constructing the model that everything rotated and orbited when a crank was turned .
It was an interesting , even fascinating work , as you can image , particularly to anyone schooled in the sciences .
Newtons atheist - scientist friend came by for a visit .
Seeing the model , he was naturally intrigued , and proceeded to examine it with undisguised admiration for the high quality of the workmanship .
 My !
What an exquisite thing this is ! he exclaimed .
 Who made it ? 
Paying little attention to him , Sir Isaac answered ,  Nobody . 
Stopping his inspection , the visitor turned and said :  Evidently you did not understand my question .
I asked who made this .
Newton , enjoying himself immensely no doubt , replied in a still more serious tone .

How sunshine can help your body fight disease
A spot of sunshine does n't just lift your spirits , it also boosts your immune system .
Research shows that vitamin D , made when our skin is exposed to sunlight , plays a key role in activating white blood cells that protect the body from flu , food poisoning and even cancer .
Without the ' sunshine vitamin ' , the cells do not join the fight against disease .
Bright skies , bright eyes ?
Vitamin D , created when skin is exposed to the sun , can help protect the body from disease
The discovery could help in the development of vaccines and ways to combat auto - immune diseases and cancer .
It is well known that vitamin D is vital for calcium absorption and bone health and some studies have suggested it has an anti-cancer effect .
But scientists had not realised what a crucial role it played in the immune system .
A series of laboratory tests showed that the vitamin triggers dormant white blood cells into turning into ' killers ' that seek out and destroy infections .
Other
white blood cells turn into ' helpers ' that enable the immune system to build a ' memory ' of the infection , allowing it to mobilise more quickly on the next encounter .
Researcher Carsten Geisler , of the University of Copenhagen , said : ' If the T - cells ( white blood cells ) cannot find enough vitamin D in the blood , they wo n't even begin to mobilise . '
The discovery , documented in the journal Nature Immunology , could shed new light on conditions caused by immune system malfunctions , such as multiple sclerosis and organ transplant rejections .
Although vitamin D is found in foods such as oily fish and eggs , most of that found in the body comes from sunlight exposure , and many of us simply do not have enough .
In England , half the population is low in the vitamin when winter ends .
In Scotland , it is two - thirds .

A teenager discovers he 's the descendant of a Greek god and sets out on an adventure to settle an on - going battle between the gods .
Donating blood saves lives , and many University of Cincinnati students helped do just that by participating in this week ’s Hoxworth Blood Center blood drive .
That is , except gay male students .
A 1983 Food and Drug Administration regulation , made at the height of the AIDS epidemic when very little was known about the disease , permanently banned men who have had sex with other men from donating blood because the organization considers this a high - risk behavior for transferring HIV .
Consequently , blood centers across the United States do not allow gay men to donate blood and blood products , such as blood platelets , blood plasma and other human blood clotting agents .
“ It is the policy of the FDA and we are regulated by the FDA , ” said Alecia Lipton , a public relations representative for Hoxworth .
The organization must comply with all of the FDA ’s regulations to be a licensed blood center .
Without this licensing , Hoxworth would not be able to supply blood and blood products to patients and hospitals .
While Hoxworth must comply with the regulation to function , the organization has championed its stance against the ban on gay men ’s blood donations since 1997 , joining forces with the American Red Cross and America ’s Blood Centers to remove the policy .
Once blood is collected , it is tested for a myriad of reasons , detecting such things as HIV , syphilis and hepatitis .
An individual ’s blood that tests positive for illnesses such as these is deferred and a notice is mailed to the donor .
The donor must then call the blood center for the reason why their blood was deferred .
When tests such as these are in place to ensure that no HIV positive blood is passed on to recipients , why ban gay men from donating ?
Most gay men are not HIV positive , and anyone who wants to donate blood should not be denied because of their sexual identity .
The questions donors are asked before their blood is drawn are basically answered on the honor system anyway .
While the technician may test iron levels by pricking a donor ’s finger , there is no homosexual test .
A gay man could still donate as long as he says no to the question that asks if he has had sex with other men .
And while 47 percent of new HIV cases are a result of male - to - male sexual content , 44 percent of people with AIDS are black , according to AVERT , an international AIDS charity .
Along the FDA ’s reasoning , black people should also not be allowed to donate for fear they are HIV positive .
People who are intravenous drug users are also not allowed to donate blood , as the practice accounts for 22 percent of new HIV / AIDS cases .
But high - risk heterosexual contact ( unprotected sexual contact between a man and a woman ) , accounts for 24 percent of new HIV / AIDS cases .
The News Record reported in a Jan. 11 article titled “ Hoxworth Center thirsty for more , ” that the blood center is not meeting the demand for blood .
So why deny someone who could potentially save a life by donating blood the ability to do so ?
Anyone who donates could potentially have HIV / AIDS , that is why all blood donations are tested .
Individuals who wish to leave the FDA comments regarding this policy should call 800-835-4709 .
Environmentally friendly products are everywhere one looks .
Energy efficient dishwashers , bamboo towels , the paperless Kindle and , of course , the ubiquitous Prius are all around .
But why do people buy these " green " products ?
Do they care about the environment or is there something else at play ?
" Green purchases are often motivated by status , " says Vladas Griskevicius , assistant professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota 's Carlson School of Management .
" People want to be seen as being altruistic .
Nothing communicates that better than by buying green products that often cost more and are of lower quality but benefit the environment for everyone . "
In the recently published paper " Going Green to Be Seen : Status , Reputation , and Conspicuous Conservation , " Griskevicius and co-authors find that people will forgo luxury and comfort for a green item .
The catch ?
People will forgo indulging for themselves only when others can see it .
" Many green purchases are rooted in the evolutionary idea of competitive altruism , the notion that people compete for status by trying to appear more altruistic , " says Griskevicius .
His research finds that when people shop alone online , they choose products that are luxurious and enhance comfort .
But when in public , people 's preferences for green products increases because most people want to be seen as caring altruists .
Nowhere is this clearer than the highly visible and easily identifiable Toyota Prius , which essentially functions as a mobile , self - promoting billboard for pro-environmentalism .
" A reputation for being a caring individual gives you status and prestige .
When you publicly display your environmentally friendly nature , you send the signal that you care , " states Griskevicius .
Interestingly , the study also shows that status motives increased desirability of green products especially when such products cost more -- but not less -- relative to non-green products .
This explains why the Prius price tag and why old - fashioned items like hand operated reel lawn mowers are holding their price .
" When you are motivated by status , you will forgo luxury features to obtain an inferior green product that tells others that you care , " Griskevicius says .
For entrepreneurs and companies looking to capture the green market , the key may be getting the product to be purchased and used in public .
When others can see you do good , both you and the environment benefit .
But in the privacy of ones home , luxury and comfort is still the winner .
Vladas Griskevicius 's teaching and research utilizes theoretical principles from evolutionary biology to study consumers ' often unconscious preferences , decision processes , and behavioral strategies .
The paper , published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , was co-authored by Joshua Tybur ( University of New Mexico ) and Bram Van den Bergh ( Rotterdam School of Management ) .

I started this website in 2009 as a means of sharing my EDM findings with my friends .
Since then , the website has experienced an explosion in growth that I never once imagined .
This excitement and growth inspires me to make ElectroJams the # 1 source for new electronic music .
A small battalion of public interest groups filed an amicus brief on Monday on behalf of YouTube in its battle with Viacom .
The latter accuses the Google - owned company of massive , even " brazen , " copyright infringement of its content .
While much of the he said / she said in this huge case centers around whether Youtube or Viacom staff allegedly uploaded the lion 's share of Viacom content to the video sharing site , the brief does n't delve deeply into that war .
Instead these advocates take aim at what they see as Viacom 's " dangerous and unnecessary " interpretation of the crucial " safe harbor " provisions in the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act — those that take the heat off online service providers for copyright infringement under reasonable circumstances .
" Were [ Viacom 's ] views to be endorsed by this ( or any other Court ) , " they warned the United States District Court 's Southern District of New York , " the profusion of online services that have benefited the public ( as well as future ventures ) would be imperiled by the threat of multi-billion dollar statutory damages awards like the ones Plaintiffs seek here . "
The filers include the American Library Association , the Center for Democracy and Technology , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , the Internet Archive , Public Knowledge , and five other groups .
They 've got a tricky job — getting past the " smoking gun " accusations that Viacom makes of YouTube , and trying to get the court to see the big issue : the harder it becomes for a service provider to paddle into that safe harbor , the more exposed it will be to killer lawsuits from big content .
Disqualify me
At stake is how broadly the safe harbor protections in Section 512 ( c ) of the DMCA should be extended to service providers like YouTube .
These safe harbors include a " knowledge disqualifier " clause which keeps a service in safe harbor as long as it does n't have " actual knowledge " of some infringing activity on its servers , does n't see red flags or " facts and circumstances " that make the activity obvious , and acts to deal with the copyright problem once it becomes clear .
Then there 's 512 ( c ) 's " control and benefit disqualifier , " which triggers the safe harbor only when the service provider does n't make any money " directly attributable to the infringing activity . "
The law also grants this kind of protection when infringement takes place because a user has stored material on the system or network in question — " storage at the direction of the user " is the legal language .
Viacom says that YouTube has practiced a policy of " willful blindness " towards the thousands of infringing Viacom clips that showed up on its site .
Its staff turned a blind eye to this in a bid to hold onto knowledge disqualifier protection .
" They determined to embrace the avowed pretense that the hundreds of thousands of clips on YouTube that were stolen from popular movies and TV shows were actually owned by the uploading users , " Viacom attorneys charged in their petition for summary judgment , citing internal YouTube e-mails .
" [ T ] he copyright fringement stuff , " one Youtube manager allegedly wrote , " I mean , we can presumably claim that we do n't know who owns the rights to that video and by uploading , the user is claiming that they own that video[ , ] we 're protected by DMCA for that .
[ W ] e'll take it down if we get a cease and desist [ i - e. , a takedown notice ] . "
But the amicus briefers counter that , whatever management at YouTube thought was going on , Viacom 's standards for " knowledge " are very risky
The media company 's " expansive notion of the knowledge disqualifier " would tempt copyright owners to abandon takedown notices in favor of blanket accusations of infringing , they warn .
" In fact , in Plaintiffs view , if an employee of a service provider were to come across a newspaper article stating that a substantial amount of infringing activity were going on somewhere on her service , her ' knowledge ' would potentially strip the service provider of safe harbor . "
Controls and benefits
These advocates also worry about Viacom 's argument that YouTube was " vicariously liable " because it enjoyed a direct financial benefit from infringing activities on the site , and did n't do enough to stop them .
The company could have found infringing clips , Viacom says , by more community flagging , digital fingerprinting , and manually searching for keywords linked to copyrighted content .
" Indeed , until October 2006 , YouTube employees sporadically engaged in just such term searches for copyrighted material , " Viacom 's petition argued .
" But they removed only some of the infringing content they found , and left other blatantly infringing clips on the site when they thought the increased site traffic outweighed the risk of getting caught . "
What the interest groups say they fear , however , is that this line of reasoning could create an impossible burden for online video sharing .
In the face of this " cavalcade " of requirements , they 've asked the court , " how can a service provider ever be certain it had done enough to satisfy every copyright owner intent on shifting the burden of copyright enforcement onto it ? "
Viacom finds the EFF 's position unconvincing , to say the least , accusing the advocacy group of supporting " copyright theft " in a statement given to Ars .
" Consistent with their unsuccessful defense of Grokster and other businesses built on unlawful conduct , the EFF has once again taken an extremist public position in support of copyright theft , " said Viacom VP of media and editorial Jeremy Zweig .
" They simply rehash Google 's claims and broadly misrepresent Viacom 's position .
The EFF brief offers no new insight or perspective , and does nothing to change the evidence that YouTube was clearly and intentionally built on the theft of copyrighted content , in stark violation of the law . "
You 've been served
Finally , the brief is particularly nervous about Viacom 's argument that 512 ( c ) 's user storage provisions were n't designed for YouTube .
The law was " intended to protect services like Web hosts that passively provide server storage as an empty vessel for someone else 's websites or other activities , " the media giant wrote .
" It does not protect companies that actively operate the websites as online entertainment centers . "
But this " bizarre construction " would have given the DMCA the power to kill a host of startup online experiments right after its passage in 1998 , the advocacy groups counter , among them Yahoo !'s message boards , which allowed users to post content , and AOL 's online bulletin boards as well .
If Viacom 's " cramped interpretation " of Section 512 ( c ) were allowed to prevail , a wide variety of innovative cloud storage enterprises would lose safe harbor protection .
" Congress meant to protect more than just the most primitive kind of ' plain vanilla '
Web hosting services , " they wrote .
The point was to foster the growth of " new businesses on the Internet .
The flourishing of innovative services to host user generated content online has , in turn , afforded the public unprecedented opportunities for free expression online . "
Between their hip - hop collaboration with Damon Dash , BlakRoc , Dan Auerbach 's solo album , and Patrick Carney 's Drummer project , it sure seemed like the two men of the Black Keys were putting their main band on hold for the time being .

Representing Accident Victims Since 1995
Michael C. Black , P.A. , is an experienced cruise ship injury attorney in Miami who serves clients with a variety of maritime - related injuries .
We have a strong understanding of the laws associated with cruise ship accidents and can use this knowledge to protect the rights of injured clients .
Since 1995 , our firm has been providing strong , compassionate representation for people with cruise - passenger injury claims .
More Than 20 Years of Experience
When you are suffering injury or have lost a loved one because of a cruise ship accident , you need a Miami cruise ship accident lawyer who offers thorough representation .
We have more than 20 years of experience in helping clients obtain the compensation they deserve .
At Michael C. Black , P.A. , we are prepared to listen to your concerns and fight for your rights .
You can count on our firm to be your guide through each step of your case .
Make sure your voice is heard .
Our office is ready to listen and provide you with a free assessment of your case .
Under Arizona , law police can seize your car or other property , sell it and use the proceeds to fund agency budgets - including paying personnel salaries - all without so much as charging you with a crime .
This is called " civil forfeiture , " a legal fiction that allows law enforcement to charge property with a crime .
Unlike criminal forfeiture , in which property is taken away after its owner has been found guilty in a court of law , with civil forfeiture , owners need not be convicted of any crime to lose homes , cars , cash or other property .
According to a new national report published by the Institute for Justice , " Policing for Profit : The Abuse of Civil Asset Forfeiture , " Arizona has some of the nation 's worst civil - forfeiture laws , earning a grade of D- .
This should come as no surprise .
A highly publicized report I co-authored six years ago and published by the Goldwater Institute came to the same conclusion , but the Legislature has taken no significant action to curb forfeiture abuse .
Arizona law makes civil forfeiture incredibly easy and profitable for law enforcement .
Officers can seize your property merely by claiming they have probable cause to believe it was used in an illegal activity .
Perhaps the officer thinks you are carrying a larger - than - normal amount of cash or that your travel pattern is " suspicious . "
To then forfeit - and permanently keep - your property , prosecutors need merely show that it is more probable than not that your property is connected to a crime .
This is a far cry from proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , as in a criminal trial .
If you protest that you are innocent because , for example , you did not know the property was being used illegally , you must prove your innocence in court to get your property back .
In other words , Arizona treats property owners as guilty until proved innocent .
Proving your innocence can be an expensive proposition , usually requiring you to hire an attorney .
And you must act quickly or you 'll lose your rights to protect your rights .
Worst of all , the law allows police and prosecutors to keep 100 percent of the proceeds to fund their own agency budgets .
By giving law enforcement a direct financial stake in forfeiture efforts , Arizona 's laws encourage policing for profit , not justice .
In fact , in " Policing for Profit , " independent criminal - justice researchers examined national forfeiture data and concluded that law - enforcement agencies respond to incentives in state and federal law by engaging in forfeiture more under laws that make it easier and more profitable .
To protect the rights of innocent citizens , legislators should reform Arizona 's forfeiture laws .
First , police and prosecutors must be required to obtain a conviction before taking away someone 's property .
This would restore the principle that you and your property are innocent until proved guilty .
Second , police and prosecutors should not be paid on commission .
The Legislature must remove the direct - profit incentive in forfeiture efforts by directing forfeited funds to the state general fund or another neutral fund , not to law - enforcement coffers .
Finally , Arizona should forbid state and local agencies from participating in a practice called equitable sharing , in which state and local police turn property over to federal agents for forfeiture and then split the proceeds .

Computing Thoughts
Programming in the Mid-Future
by Bruce Eckel
March 10 , 2010
Summary
In 25 years or so , we 'll look at the current morass as only a small step above assembly - language programming .
Here 's what I think programming will be like then .
Advertisement
Further in the future than what I 'm describing here , our IDEs might just hack into our brainstems to produce a Matrix - like world within which we manipulate programming ideas .
There are a number of breakthroughs required for that to happen , and breakthroughs are difficult to predict , and their fallout is even more difficult to know .
Here 's how far forward I can see now .
Most of these points really just address problems that we have now , so I 'm not being particularly clairvoyant .
But for some reason humans seem to accept their problems and limitations .
Perhaps it 's just because of the effort necessary to change , and the fact that the toys we have now are still somewhat new so we 're transfixed by how shiny they are , not noticing the problems they do n't solve and , worse , how they limit us .
I encountered this at the beginning of my career , programming hardware with assembly language while yearning to move to so - called " higher level languages " like C .
There was a lot of suspicion and resistance , and that may be the throttle , the limiting factor , when trying to move the technology of programming forward , rather than the technology itself .
( You could also argue that the suspicion and resistance is learned , from too many companies trying to make a quick buck by promising magic ) .
Extremely dynamic
There is a significant and growing class of programming problems that static languages can't solve .
Programming is going to become more and more dynamic .
This does n't mean that code analysis tools are not valuable ; far from it .
But we will discover ( are discovering ) that dynamic analysis is more powerful than static analysis , so things will continue to move in that direction .
Stupidly parallel objects
Objects will manage their own processes ; right now we call these " active objects " but in the future this idea will be incorporated into the basic idea of an object ( you ca n't really say that an object models reality unless it has its own process ) .
Even if Moore 's law gets a reboot from new technology , we 've started down the path of multiple cores and farms of machines , and that wo n't stop .
There are lots of problems that , as much as a faster single processor might be helpful , a bunch of fast processors will be better .
And I would also argue that tons of processors is a better model of the world .
The problem is that currently , parallelism is virtually impossible to get right ( I wo n't re-argue this here , I 've done it elsewhere ) .
While it 's theoretically possible that a handful of experts exist that can deal with some level of concurrent complexity , there is always a limit to what those people can manage .
And they are rare , and parallelism is becoming common .
What I mean by " stupidly parallel " is that a brand - new student programmer can create objects that run in parallel without bugs , while knowing little or nothing about parallel programming .
It will just be part of the atmosphere of programming that parallelism happens and you do n't have to tie your brain in knots to get it right .
Persistent diskless environment Eventually the idea that we have to " store something to disk " will go away ; the difference between memory and disk will be seen as an arbitrary artifact of the past .
You 'll just have data , and the data will be accessible for as long as you need it .
It will live on your machine and in the cloud , as necessary , and you wo n't have to think about whether it 's being garbage collected or swapped .
You 'll just make objects and use them , and the objects will contain data as necessary .
Transparency between local and cloud
This is really just a continuation of the previous point .
Programmers wo n't have to think about storage , period .
Right now there 's a lot of time spent on issues that should be automated , and this is one of them .
Swarm testing Tests are a form of program analysis .
We know that test coverage produces better programs , but we 're still on the leading edge of how to create tests .
JUnit has traditionally required too much boilerplate and rote work , and that has slowed the test creation process ( I like Python 's Nose , which uses reflection to minimize coding ) .
Eventually we 'll be able to create tools that recognize patterns in the code you write , and automatically apply tests to those patterns .
The only tests you 'll have to write are the ones that are n't in the database , and when you write them they 'll go into the database so no one has to write them again .
The reason I call it " swarm " is that I imagine it like a swarm of bees .
You create an object ( which I think will still be the basic granularity of component in the future ; it will be much more than today 's objects but we 'll still think in terms of objects ) , and the tests will swarm over that object looking for places to apply themselves ( the same way that chemicals look for the appropriate receptors in your brain ) .
You 'll only need to add tests for the empty spaces .
Testing will become faster , more thorough , and far more automated .
Security via suspicious systems I initially wrote about this idea in a science fiction story .
A robot receives ideas visually , by signals passing through the eyes ( no physical contact ) .
The ideas -- new code , basically -- pass into a kind of limbo where they are analyzed for suspicious content .
I think not only swarm testing would come into play , but logical testing , checking whether an object does what it says it will do .
Only after it is thoroughly tested will it be incorporated into the program .
Note that this not only helps in system integration for your own code , but allows much greater use of off - the - shelf components as well .
Effortless data stores Data stores , too , will just become another kind of object , integrated into the objects where they are used .
In confluence with the aforementioned transparent storage , data stores are just objects where you can store data and later ask for it .
You wo n't have to re-code every time you need a new one , just slap it in without a lot of effort .
In addition , you wo n't have to think ahead of time about scaling issues for your data store .
There will be no rewrite when going from a small data store to a large one .
Data stores will become a non-issue .
Query - based data
The point of data storage is that sometime later we want to query it .
But we get lost in the details of how it should be structured rather than keeping this fundamental idea in mind .
Progress has been made in this area .
The transition from hierarchical data to SQL was a big step .
Programming systems like LINQ and SQLAlchemy have provided better abstractions to separate the programmer from the underlying structure of the data .
You 're able to make a query that the engine dynamically optimizes .
Who knows , in the future querying your database efficiently might end up being as easy as doing a Google search .
Reusability on a vast scale
The future object incorporates the concept of " component " and will be the basic unit of code .
It manages its own processes and comes with its own swarm of tests .
The interface between components and other components ( thus , components and systems ) becomes universal .
Adding a new component to a system becomes as easy as adding ingredients to a recipe .
Component discovery will have its own search engine .
I actually hope it will be even better than this .
Effortless System Integration
I think you 'll be able to throw components into a soup , and they 'll wire themselves together , negotiating or asking for advice when two components have overlapping functionality .
The result will just be a larger object / component , that you 'll either use in a bigger system or as a standalone application .
Naturally , swarm testing applies at all levels .
Reusable UIs
UIs are stored and categorized in a way that it makes it easy to search for them .
UIs capture and display data , so the intermediate connection to the main program is a data store , which that program queries and updates .
This is basically a more sophisticated form of MVC , but without miring you in all the redundant low - level boilerplate every time you create a UI -- there 's no reason we should have to repeat ourselves constantly this way , and no reason that programmers should n't benefit from great UIs without having to be UI experts .
Most of the time you 'll be able to select UIs from a list and paste them into your system .
If you need to make a new one , or modify an existing one , the result becomes a new entry in the UI store .
Effortlessly Scalable
This follows from the other features that I 've described above , but it 's worth emphasizing .
When you write a program , it will work in the small and in the large without modification .
We currently spend way too much effort on scaling issues , which should be transparent , and eventually it will be .
Built - in Evolvability
The collection of features described above solves problems of program complexity , especially those that appear when a program gets large and sophisticated .
Programming in the future will eliminate the concept of scale , so that adding features to an existing program will be unaffected by how big or complex that program is .
Big Talk
Yes , big ideas .
We can't necessarily think about how to solve these problems yet .
But just imagine what programming would be like in such a world .
What other features do you imagine we 'll see in the future ?

10 . Adjust Your Mirrors for Better Vision
Advertisement
Most people set up their car 's mirrors in a way that keeps the edge of their own car in their vision , mostly to provide a sense of perspective .
This limits the amount of " blind spot " coverage provided by your mirrors .
Car and Driver suggests a new alignment technique supported by the Society of Automotive Engineers that covers more angles with your side and rear view mirrors .
When we first highlighted this tip , several commenters asked what 's wrong with just looking over your shoulder as you change lanes — technically , nothing .
But if you 're willing to commit a little practice time to a new mirror setup , you might find yourself more in control of what 's happening as you 're speeding down the highway .

Those estimates of driving time that online maps provide ?
They do n't always know your commute like you know your commute .
If you must be on time , avoid stress , or maybe just want to try a different route , check out Google 's traffic mapping on desktop , iPhones , and Android units , give Bing 's experimental maps a go , or , in larger cities , try a service like Commuter Feed , or simply run a Twitter search to see if drivers at a stand - still have shared their misery with the wider world .

Managing your commuter stress is n't about a zen state of mind or leaving five hours early .
Avoiding minor cases of road rage every time you hop in the car can be accomplished by stepping back from your drive and examining it objectively , suggests auto writer Tom Vanderbilt .
Do n't change lanes in slow traffic , because it almost never matters .
Make eye contact with other drivers when you can , look ahead down the road , and try to avoid a sense of personal entitlement to your lane merge , says Vanderbilt .
Mixed with a good audiobook or other good use of down time , your commute might just become a lot less stressful , or even better — something you look forward to .

What tips , tricks , projects , or simple tactics have made your commute better , faster , or less annoying ?
We 'd love to hear about them , and maybe post about them , if you 'd leave them in the comments .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A small group of U.S. lawmakers unveiled legislation on Thursday to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement in the latest sign of congressional disillusionment with free - trade deals .
Mississippi congressman Gene Taylor ( D - MS ) ( 2nd R ) speaks of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina alongside ( L - R ) Mississippi Congressman Bennie Thompson ( D - MS ) , House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) on Capitol Hill in Washington , September 15 , 2005 file photo .

The bill spearheaded by Rep. Gene Taylor , a Mississippi Democrat , would require President Barack Obama to give Mexico and Canada six months notice that the United States will no longer be part of the 16 - year - old trade pact .
“ At a time when 10 to 12 percent of the American people are unemployed , I think Congress has an obligation to put people back to work , ” Taylor said .
He argued NAFTA has cost the United States millions of manufacturing jobs and hurt national security by encouraging companies to move production to Mexico .
The high unemployment rate makes it the “ perfect ” time to push for repeal even though past efforts have failed , he said .
“ You ’ll see the American people rally behind this , in my humble opinion , ” said Rep. Walter Jones , a North Carolina Republican who is one of about 28 co-sponsors of the bill .
Business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly support NAFTA , which they say has spurred U.S. economic growth by tearing down trade barriers between the three countries .
The repeal proposal comes as Obama says he wants to resolve problems blocking congressional approval of long - delayed trade deals with South Korea , Panama and Colombia .
The strongest opposition to those agreements comes from Obama ’s fellow Democrats .
The United States also will begin talks later this month with Australia , New Zealand , Singapore , Chile , Peru , Vietnam and Brunei on an Asia - Pacific regional free - trade agreement .
Obama criticized NAFTA during the 2008 presidential election campaign but has not followed through on threats to withdraw from the agreement if Canada and Mexico did not agree to revamp the pact ’s labor and environmental provisions .
But many Democrats are pushing for that and other changes to existing trade deals before considering any new deals such as the deals with South Korea , Colombia and Panama .
The House of Representatives is expected to vote later this year on whether the United States should remain a member of the World Trade Organization .
U.S. law allows House and Senate members to request a vote on that issue every five years .
In 2005 , 86 of the House ’s 435 members voted to withdraw from the world trade body .
Could wiki technology find Osama bin Laden ?

But on a given day , a surge of dots might point to the same village , in what could not be coincidence .
Troops could be ordered in .
This kind of everyone - as - informant mapping is shaking up the world , bringing the Wikipedia revolution to the work of humanitarians and soldiers who parachute into places with little good information .
And an important force behind this upheaval is a small Kenyan - born organization called Ushahidi , which has become a hero of the Haitian and Chilean earthquakes and which may have something larger to tell us about the future of humanitarianism , innovation and the nature of what we label as truth .
After Kenya ’s disputed election in 2007 , violence erupted .
A prominent Kenyan lawyer and blogger , Ory Okolloh , who was based in South Africa but had gone back to Kenya to vote and observe the election , received threats about her work and returned to South Africa .
She posted online the idea of an Internet mapping tool to allow people anonymously to report violence and other misdeeds .
Technology whizzes saw her post and built the Ushahidi Web platform over a long weekend .
Earlier today , President Obama and President Medvedev of Russia signed the New START treaty and its protocol .
PDF versions of these documents are available here :
UPDATED with video :
[ [ nid:10804 ] ]
After signing these documents , both presidents gave remarks and answered questions .
Read the full transcript , video will be posted here later today .
An excerpt of President Obama 's opening remarks is below :
Finally , this day demonstrates the determination of the United States and Russia -- the two nations that hold over 90 percent of the world ’s nuclear weapons -- to pursue responsible global leadership .
Together , we are keeping our commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , which must be the foundation for global non-proliferation .
While the New START treaty is an important first step forward , it is just one step on a longer journey .
As I said last year in Prague , this treaty will set the stage for further cuts .
And going forward , we hope to pursue discussions with Russia on reducing both our strategic and tactical weapons , including non-deployed weapons .
President Medvedev and I have also agreed to expand our discussions on missile defense .
This will include regular exchanges of information about our threat assessments , as well as the completion of a joint assessment of emerging ballistic missiles .
And as these assessments are completed , I look forward to launching a serious dialogue about Russian - American cooperation on missile defense .
But nuclear weapons are not simply an issue for the United States and Russia -- they threaten the common security of all nations .
A nuclear weapon in the hands of a terrorist is a danger to people everywhere -- from Moscow to New York ; from the cities of Europe to South Asia .
So next week , 47 nations will come together in Washington to discuss concrete steps that can be taken to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years .
And the spread of nuclear weapons to more states is also an unacceptable risk to global security -- raising the specter of arms races from the Middle East to East Asia .
Earlier this week , the United States formally changed our policy to make it clear that those [ non ] - nuclear weapons states that are in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and their non-proliferation obligations will not be threatened by America ’s nuclear arsenal .
This demonstrates , once more , America ’s commitment to the NPT as a cornerstone of our security strategy .
Those nations that follow the rules will find greater security and opportunity .
Those nations that refuse to meet their obligations will be isolated , and denied the opportunity that comes with international recognition .
That includes accountability for those that break the rules -- otherwise the NPT is just words on a page .
That ’s why the United States and Russia are part of a coalition of nations insisting that the Islamic Republic of Iran face consequences , because they have continually failed to meet their obligations .
We are working together at the United Nations Security Council to pass strong sanctions on Iran .
And we will not tolerate actions that flout the NPT , risk an arms race in a vital region , and threaten the credibility of the international community and our collective security .
While these issues are a top priority , they are only one part of the U.S. - Russia relationship .
Today , I again expressed my deepest condolences for the terrible loss of Russian life in recent terrorist attacks , and we will remain steadfast partners in combating violent extremism .
We also discussed the potential to expand our cooperation on behalf of economic growth , trade and investment , as well as technological innovation , and I look forward to discussing these issues further when President Medvedev visits the United States later this year , because there is much we can do on behalf of our security and prosperity if we continue to work together .
When one surveys the many challenges that we face around the world , it ’s easy to grow complacent , or to abandon the notion that progress can be shared .
But I want to repeat what I said last year in Prague :
When nations and peoples allow themselves to be defined by their differences , the gulf between them widens .
When we fail to pursue peace , then it stays forever beyond our grasp .
Updated :
For even more information , a series of fact sheets on individual aspects of the New START Treaty are included after the break .
Table of Contents
1. THE NEW START TREATY AT A GLANCE
Treaty Structure : The New START Treaty is organized in three tiers of increasing level of detail .
The first tier is the Treaty text itself .
The second tier consists of a Protocol to the Treaty , which contains additional rights and obligations associated with Treaty provisions .
The basic rights and obligations are contained in these two documents .
The third tier consists of Technical Annexes to the Protocol .
All three tiers will be legally binding , and all three tiers will be submitted to the U.S. Senate for its advice and consent to ratification .
Strategic Offensive Reductions : Under the Treaty , the U.S. and Russia will be limited to significantly fewer strategic arms within seven years from the date the Treaty enters into force .
Each Party has the flexibility to determine for itself the structure of its strategic forces within the aggregate limits of the Treaty .
These limits are based on a rigorous analysis conducted by Department of Defense planners in support of the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review .
Aggregate limits :
1,550 warheads .
Warheads on deployed ICBMs and deployed SLBMs count toward this limit and each deployed heavy bomber equipped for nuclear armaments counts as one warhead toward this limit .
This limit is 74 % lower than the limit of the 1991 START Treaty and 30 % lower than the deployed strategic warhead limit of the 2002 Moscow Treaty .
A combined limit of 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers , SLBM launchers , and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments .
A separate limit of 700 deployed ICBMs , deployed SLBMs , and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments .
This limit is less than half the corresponding strategic nuclear delivery vehicle limit of the START Treaty .
Verification and Transparency : The Treaty has a verification regime that combines the appropriate elements of the 1991 START Treaty with new elements tailored to the limitations of the Treaty .
Measures under the Treaty include on - site inspections and exhibitions , data exchanges and notifications related to strategic offensive arms and facilities covered by the Treaty , and provisions to facilitate the use of national technical means for treaty monitoring .
To increase confidence and transparency , the Treaty also provides for the exchange of telemetry .
Treaty Terms :
The Treaty ’s duration will be ten years , unless superseded by a subsequent agreement .
The Parties may agree to extend the Treaty for a period of no more than five years .
The Treaty includes a withdrawal clause that is standard in arms control agreements .
The 2002 Moscow Treaty terminates upon entry into force of the New START Treaty .
The U.S. Senate and the Russian legislature must approve the Treaty before it can enter into force .
No Constraints on Missile Defense and Conventional Strike : The Treaty does not contain any constraints on testing , development or deployment of current or planned U.S. missile defense programs or current or planned United States long - range conventional strike capabilities .
2. NEW START TREATY AND U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS
The New START Treaty makes America more secure .
The New START Treaty will enhance U.S. national security by stabilizing the strategic balance between the United States and the Russian Federation at lower levels of nuclear forces .
The Treaty will establish lower limits for U.S. and Russian nuclear forces of 1,550 deployed strategic warheads and 700 deployed ICBMs , SLBMs , and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments .
It also will limit to 800 the total number of deployed and non-deployed ICBM and SLBM launchers and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments .
The Treaty ’s lower strategic force limits were validated through rigorous analysis conducted by Department of Defense Planners in support of the Nuclear Posture Review .
The New START Treaty allows the United States to determine our own force structure , giving us the flexibility to deploy and maintain our strategic nuclear forces in a way that best serves U.S. national security interests .
As long as nuclear weapons exist , the United States will maintain a safe , secure , and effective arsenal to deter any adversary and protect our allies .
The New START Treaty ’s verification provisions provide visibility into Russia ’s nuclear forces and thereby help to mitigate the risks of surprises , mistrust , and miscalculations that can result from excessive secrecy or decisions based on worst - case assumptions .
The Treaty will give us a vital window into the Russian strategic arsenal .
This goal is achieved through a verification regime that is adapted from START , but is simplified , less costly to implement , and tailored to the specific provisions of the new Treaty , as well as transparency measures such as the exchange of telemetry on flight tests .
3. Senate Consideration of Treaties – A Primer
Under Article II of the Constitution , the President “ makes ” treaties , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate .
Approval of a treaty requires a supermajority of two - thirds of the senators present ( assuming all 100 senators are present , 67 votes are required for approval ) .
After signature of the New START Treaty on April 8 , the U.S. and Russian negotiators will complete their work on several technical annexes .
Only then will the President be able to submit the treaty to the Senate ( expected to be later this spring ) .
In addition to the text of the treaty , protocol and annexes , the President will submit to the Senate a detailed analysis of the treaty .
The treaty will be referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations , which under the Senate rules has exclusive jurisdiction over treaties .
If past practice on major arms control treaties is a guide , the Foreign Relations Committee will likely conduct several hearings on the New START Treaty .
The Committee held four hearings on the last such treaty , the Moscow Treaty , in 2002 .
Similarly , past practice suggests that other Senate committees , such as the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees , may also conduct hearings and report their views to the Foreign Relations Committee , but the treaty would not be formally referred to those committees .
Once the Foreign Relations Committee has completed its review of the treaty , it would draft its recommendations for a resolution of advice and consent , which is the document by which the Senate approves treaties , and vote in a formal markup session .
Then it would file a detailed report with the Senate analyzing the treaty and the Committee ’s findings resulting from its review .
Once the Committee reports the treaty to the Senate , it is placed on the Senate ’s Executive Calendar .
Unlike bills , the decision of the Senate to begin consideration of a treaty ( the motion to proceed ) is not subject to a filibuster .
The Senate typically takes at least two or three days to consider a major treaty , and to vote on amendments to the resolution of advice and consent .
If approved , the treaty is then returned to the President , for the formal act of ratification .
Specifically , he will sign an instrument of ratification .
The treaty must also be approved by the Russian parliament , or Duma .
If both the Senate and the Duma approve the New START Treaty , it will enter into force on the date that the United States and Russia exchange the instruments of ratification .
Senate votes on recent major strategic arms control treaties : Moscow Treaty ( approved 2003 ) : 95-0 START II ( 1996 ) : 87-4 START I ( 1992 ) : 93-6
On Ratification
Secretary of State Clinton : “ Some of the time that had to be taken in order to really get the point where we both felt like we had the package necessary to go to our legislative bodies . ”
“ I believe that a vast majority of the Senate at the end of the day will see that this is in America 's interest and it goes way beyond politics . ”
“ I 'm not going to , you know , set any timetables , but we 're confident that we 'll be able to make the case for ratification . ”
Secretary of Defense Gates : “ Let me first say a word about ratification from my perspective .
There has been a very intense continuing consultation on the Hill as the negotiations have proceeded .
Two of the areas that have been of concern in the Senate , among senators :
Are we protecting our ability to go forward with missile defense ?
And are we going to make the investment in our nuclear infrastructure so that the stockpile will remain reliable and safe ? ”
“ We have addressed both of those .
Missile defense is not constrained by this -- by this treaty .
And we have in our budget , the president 's budget that went to the Hill for F.Y. ' 11 , almost $ 5 billion for [ new ] investment in the nuclear infrastructure and maintaining the stockpile .
So I think we have addressed the concerns that there may have been on the Hill , and so I echo the sentiments of Secretary Clinton .
I think the prospects are quite good . ”
4. CENTRAL WARHEAD AND DELIVERY VEHICLE LIMITS OF THE NEW START TREATY
The Treaty reduces by about 30 percent the limit on the number of Russian nuclear weapons and helps us better track the remaining ones .
At the same time , the United States retains the nuclear force level we need to protect ourselves , as validated by the Defense Department ’s planners through rigorous analysis in the Nuclear Posture Review .
The principal U.S. objective in bilateral strategic arms control is to increase stability in the U.S. - Russian nuclear relationship at significantly lower levels of nuclear weapons .
The New START Treaty sets aggregate limits which are 56 % lower than the limit for deployed strategic nuclear delivery vehicles and 74 % lower than the limit for deployed warheads established in the 1991 START Treaty , which expired in December 2009 .
The New START Treaty limit for deployed warheads will be 30 % lower than the limit for deployed strategic warheads established under the 2002 Moscow Treaty , which the New START Treaty will supersede .
The New START Treaty provides the United States the flexibility to determine for ourselves the structure of our strategic forces within the aggregate limits of the Treaty .
The Central Limits of the New START Treaty are :
Deployed Warheads : 1,550
All warheads emplaced on deployed ICBMs
and SLBMs are counted under this limit
Deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments
are each counted with one warhead
Deployed and Non-Deployed Launchers and Heavy Bombers : 800
Deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers
Deployed and non-deployed SLBM launchers
Deployed and non-deployed heavy bombers
equipped for nuclear armaments
Deployed Ballistic Missiles and Heavy Bombers : 700
Deployed ICBMs
Deployed SLBMs
Deployed heavy bombers equipped for
nuclear armaments
Timetable for Limitations : Limits begin to apply seven years from the date the Treaty enters into force
Duration of Agreement :
Ten years with an option to extend , if both sides agree , by no more than five years
5. Strong verification measures are built into the New START Treaty so that we monitor compliance with the Treaty .
The New START Treaty can be effectively verified with a verification regime that builds on lessons learned from 15 years of implementing START .
The regime , which will be simpler and less costly to implement than START , provides for data exchange and notifications regarding strategic systems and facilities covered by the Treaty , two types of on - site inspections , exhibitions , and as a transparency measure provides for the exchange of telemetric information .
NATIONAL TECHNICAL MEANS ( NTM ) – The Treaty provides for the use of and non-interference with national technical means of verification ( e.g. satellites ) .
There are explicit provisions that prohibit interference with NTM and the use of concealment measures that may impede monitoring by NTM .
As in the 1991 START Treaty , the prohibition against concealment measures does not apply to cover or concealment practices at ICBM bases or to the use of environmental shelters .
DATA EXCHANGE AND NOTIFICATIONS –
The sides will exchange data on numbers , locations , and technical characteristics of weapons systems and facilities that are subject to the Treaty and will provide regular notifications and updates .
ON - SITE INSPECTIONS
– The Treaty provides for 18 on - site inspections per year .
There are two basic types of inspections .
Type
One inspections focus on sites with deployed and non-deployed strategic systems ; Type Two inspections focus on sites with only non-deployed strategic systems .
Permitted inspection activities include confirming the number of reentry vehicles on deployed ICBMs and deployed SLBMs , confirming numbers related to non-deployed launcher limits , counting nuclear weapons onboard or attached to deployed heavy bombers , confirming weapon system conversions or eliminations , and confirming facility eliminations .
Each side is allowed to conduct ten Type One inspections and eight Type Two inspections annually .
UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS
– Each ICBM , SLBM , and heavy bomber will be assigned a unique identifier ( number ) , which will be included in the applicable notifications and may be confirmed during inspections .
TELEMETRIC INFORMATION
– During ICBM and SLBM flight tests , measurements of various technical parameters are made to monitor missile performance .
To enhance transparency and supplement verification provisions , the Parties have agreed to an annual exchange of telemetric information on a parity basis , for up to five ICBM and SLBM launches per year .
COMPLIANCE – The Treaty establishes the Bilateral Consultative Commission ( BCC ) as a compliance and implementation body that will meet at least twice each year , unless otherwise agreed .
Compliance or implementation questions may be raised by either Party in the BCC .
6. THE TRIAD AND U.S. NUCLEAR FORCE STRUCTURE
The New START Treaty ensures our own military the flexibility to deploy and maintain our forces – including bombers , submarines , and missiles – in ways that best meet U.S. national security interests .
An early task for the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review ( NPR ) was to develop U.S. positions for the New START negotiations .
The Treaty ’s lower strategic force levels are based on analysis conducted last year , at the initial phase of the 2010 NPR process , which also considered how U.S. forces should be structured at the levels established by the new agreement .
The NPR reached the following conclusions :
Stable deterrence can be maintained while reducing U.S. strategic delivery vehicles by about 50 percent from the START I level and reducing deployed strategic warheads by about 30 percent from the 2002 Moscow Treaty level .
Contributions by non-nuclear systems to U.S. deterrence and reassurance goals should be preserved by avoiding limitations on missile defenses and preserving options for using heavy bombers or long - range missile systems in conventional roles .
During the ten - year duration of New START , the triad of ICBMs , SLBMs , and nuclear - capable heavy bombers will be maintained , keeping all 14 Ohio - class strategic submarines ( SSBNs ) in the force at least for the near term and “ de - MIRVing ” all Minuteman III ICBMs to a single warhead each to increase stability in a crisis .
The FY 2011 budget request includes funds to sustain the Triad , including : continuing the Minuteman III life extension program ; developing new technologies to replace the current fleet of Ohio- class SSBNs , which begin to retire in the 2027 timeframe ; and investing over $ 1 billion over the next five years to support upgrades to the B - 2 stealth bomber .
The New START Treaty affirms the right of the United States to determine the composition and structure of our strategic offensive arms within the Treaty ’s overall limits .
This allows the United States to adjust our force structure over time as appropriate to the strategic circumstances .
The Treaty limitations take effect seven years after the date the Treaty enters into force .
7. Fact Sheet on U.S. Missile Defense Policy – A " Phased , Adaptive Approach " for Missile Defense in Europe
President Obama approved the recommendation of Secretary of Defense Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff for a phased , adaptive approach for missile defense in Europe .
This approach is based on an assessment of the Iranian missile threat , and a commitment to deploy technology that is proven , cost - effective , and adaptable to an evolving security environment .
Starting around 2011 , this missile defense architecture will feature deployments of increasingly - capable sea- and land - based missile interceptors , primarily upgraded versions of the Standard Missile - 3 ( SM - 3 ) , and a range of sensors in Europe to defend against the growing ballistic missile threat from Iran .
This phased approach develops the capability to augment our current protection of the U.S. homeland against long - range ballistic missile threats , and to offer more effective defenses against more near - term ballistic missile threats .
The plan provides for the defense of U.S. deployed forces , their families , and our Allies in Europe sooner and more comprehensively than the previous program , and involves more flexible and survivable systems .
The Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to the President that he revise the previous Administration ’s 2007 plan for missile defense in Europe as part of an ongoing comprehensive review of our missile defenses mandated by Congress .
Two major developments led to this unanimous recommended change :
New Threat Assessment :
The intelligence community now assesses that the threat from Iran ’s short - and medium - range ballistic missiles is developing more rapidly than previously projected , while the threat of potential Iranian intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) capabilities has been slower to develop than previously estimated .
In the near - term , the greatest missile threats from Iran will be to U.S. Allies and partners , as well as to U.S. deployed personnel – military and civilian –and their accompanying families in the Middle East and in Europe .
Advances in Capabilities and Technologies :
Over the past several years , U.S. missile defense capabilities and technologies have advanced significantly .
We expect this trend to continue .
Improved interceptor capabilities , such as advanced versions of the SM - 3 , offer a more flexible , capable , and cost - effective architecture .
Improved sensor technologies offer a variety of options to detect and track enemy missiles .
These changes in the threat as well as our capabilities and technologies underscore the need for an adaptable architecture .
This architecture is responsive to the current threat , but could also incorporate relevant technologies quickly and cost - effectively to respond to evolving threats .
Accordingly , the Department of Defense has developed a four - phased , adaptive approach for missile defense in Europe .
While further advances of technology or future changes in the threat could modify the details or timing of later phases , current plans call for the following :
Phase One ( in the 2011 timeframe ) – Deploy current and proven missile defense systems available in the next two years , including the sea - based Aegis Weapon System , the SM - 3 interceptor ( Block IA ) , and sensors such as the forward - based Army Navy / Transportable Radar Surveillance system ( AN / TPY - 2 ) , to address regional ballistic missile threats to Europe and our deployed personnel and their families ;
Phase Two ( in the 2015 timeframe ) – After appropriate testing , deploy a more capable version of the SM - 3 interceptor ( Block IB ) in both sea- and land - based configurations , and more advanced sensors , to expand the defended area against short - and medium - range missile threats ;
Phase Three ( in the 2018 timeframe ) – After development and testing are complete , deploy the more advanced SM - 3 Block IIA variant currently under development , to counter short - , medium - , and intermediate - range missile threats ; and
Phase Four ( in the 2020 timeframe ) – After development and testing are complete , deploy the SM - 3 Block IIB to help better cope with medium - and intermediate - range missiles and the potential future ICBM threat to the United States .
Throughout all four phases , the United States also will be testing and updating a range of approaches for improving our sensors for missile defense .
The new distributed interceptor and sensor architecture also does not require a single , large , fixed European radar that was to be located in the Czech Republic ; this approach also uses different interceptor technology than the previous program , removing the need for a single field of 10 ground - based interceptors in Poland .
Therefore , the Secretary of Defense recommended that the United States no longer plan to move forward with that architecture .
The Czech Republic and Poland , as close , strategic and steadfast Allies of the United States , will be central to our continued consultations with NATO Allies on our defense against the growing ballistic missile threat .
The phased , adaptive approach for missile defense in Europe :
Sustains U.S. homeland defense against long - range ballistic missile threats .
The deployment of an advanced version of the SM - 3 interceptor in Phase Four of the approach would augment existing ground - based interceptors located in Alaska and California , which provide for the defense of the homeland against a potential ICBM threat .
Speeds protection of U.S. deployed forces , civilian personnel , and their accompanying families against the near - term missile threat from Iran .
We would deploy current and proven technology by roughly 2011 – about six or seven years earlier than the previous plan – to help defend the regions in Europe most vulnerable to the Iranian short - and medium - range ballistic missile threat .
Ensures and enhances the protection of the territory and populations of all NATO Allies , in concert with their missile defense capabilities , against the current and growing ballistic missile threat .
Starting in 2011 , the phased , adaptive approach would systematically increase the defended area as the threat is expected to grow .
In the 2018 timeframe , all of Europe could be protected by our collective missile defense architecture .
Deploys proven capabilities and technologies to meet current threats .
SM - 3 ( Block 1A ) interceptors are deployed on Aegis ships today , and more advanced versions are in various stages of development .
Over the past four years , we have conducted a number of tests of the SM - 3 IA , and it was the interceptor used in the successful engagement of a decaying satellite in February 2008 .
Testing in 2008 showed that sensors we plan to field bring significant capabilities to the architecture , and additional , planned research and development over the next few years offers the potential for more diverse and more capable sensors .
Provides flexibility to upgrade and adjust the architecture , and to do so in a cost - effective manner , as the threat evolves .
Because of the lower per-interceptor costs and mobility of key elements of the architecture , we will be better postured to adapt this set of defenses to any changes in threat .
We will work with our Allies to integrate this architecture with NATO members ’ missile defense capabilities , as well as with the emerging NATO command and control network that is under development .
One benefit of the phased , adaptive approach is that there is a high degree of flexibility – in addition to sea - based assets , there are many potential locations for the architecture ’s land - based elements , some of which will be re-locatable .
We plan to deploy elements in northern and southern Europe and will be consulting closely at NATO with Allies on the specific deployment options .
We also welcome Russian cooperation to bring its missile defense capabilities into a broader defense of our common strategic interests .
We have repeatedly made clear to Russia that missile defense in Europe poses no threat to its strategic deterrent .
Rather , the purpose is to strengthen defenses against the growing Iranian missile threat .
There is no substitute for Iran complying with its international obligations regarding its nuclear program .
But ballistic missile defenses will address the threat from Iran ’s ballistic missile programs , and diminish the coercive influence that Iran hopes to gain by continuing to develop these destabilizing capabilities .
Through the ongoing Department of Defense ballistic missile defense review , the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff will continue to provide recommendations to the President that address other aspects of our ballistic missile defense capabilities and posture around the world .

The house in southern Germany where Pope Benedict XVI was born has been vandalized with obscene graffiti , police say .
Someone found the 30 - centimetre - high blue letters early Tuesday on the wall over the door of the house in the town of Marktl , they say .
Police spokesman Andreas Guske told The Associated Press that authorities will not release the exact words , but " it was a defaming remark from the realm of the obscene . "
He said the words were not specifically directed against the Pope , who has been fiercely criticized recently for his role in what critics allege is a church - wide coverup of sexual abuse of children by clerics .
Pastoral assistant Ludwig Raischl told the DAPD news agency that the graffiti was removed after police took samples .
Hi Fernando ,
I listened to Rawles 's interview and even if I like his blog , I think he 's too radical .
I 'd like to hear you and I sent an email to C2C as you asked .
I email you today to ask you about veggies during the economic crisis in your country .
I 'm working for an organic market gardener and I 'm planning to run a small scale market garden in two or three years .
I wonder what were the availability and prices of vegetables in post -2001 Argentina ?
Are there CSA or box schemes ?
Do people started to plant private gardens ( that 's competition for the professionals indeed ) ?
Is there a strong market for seedlings ( which would be a direct result of more people gardening their yard ) ?
Regarding security and transportation , I suppose it would be wise to have my garden on the edge of a small town , so that I 'm not isolated and I do n't have hundred miles to drive to sell my products .
What 's your opinion ?
Your readers interested in market gardening should buy Eliot Coleman 's " The New Organic Grower " , it contains relevant informations for those who want to start such a business IMHO .
I read Don Williams 's comment about self - sufficient agriculture on the meat prices surge topic and I disagree about fertilizers being a problem .
Before we mined phosphate rock , we had to make do with cow poo and other organic matter !!
Crop rotation , greem manures , composting grazers ' poo : these are the solutions .
And do n't forget humanure , because it 's the only way to fully close the nutrients cycle .
China used it for thousand of years ( it 's like gold in a way xD ) .
Another thing : you mentioned in your book the availability of game in the city .
I can add rabbit to your list as I found some of them on the edge of a half - a- million souls ' city .
I think they would be wiped out if the push come to the shove but it 's interesting thing to know .
Bye ,
Etienne
Hi Etienne ,
Thanks for sending an email .
Every single one helps and I ’m sure I ’ll eventually get a call .
( I aslo so several new 5 star reviews in Amazon , so thanks a lot for that as well guys )
Prices went up consistently but that does n’t mean gardening will make you rich .
Its usually due to prices in general going up , the middle man ’s cost , transportation , rent , power and taxes for the grocery store going up as well , as well as everyone increasing their own profit margin trying to stay up to date with inflation .
The Hollywood survival theory says that you ’ll grow your food , feed yourself and your family , and sell / trade what ’s left for whatever products and services you need but do n’t produce yourself .
Why , according to that logic , half of the poor in Latin America should be rich or at least well off since that ’s what they do .
rd world countries or after a collapsed economy .
So , it does n’t work that way in 3world countries or after a collapsed economy .
When I say it does n’t work , I mean that you have several other much more profitable jobs and income generating activities that make small scale gardening for a living in most cases impractical .
( there are exception and we ’ll talk about that later )
First , its impossible to produce yourself everything you need for a balanced diet .
As my buddy Nomad concluded after years of survival and preparedness research and some time in Emergency Response school “ Money makes the world go around ” , even after SHTF , I might add .
Again the Hollywood based theory says you ’ll sell your beans and tomatoes for whatever you need , it ’s a perfect plan !
Well … no .
I ’ve even read some comments in forums ( and I ’m pretty sure the posters did consider it a joke ) say that they ’ll trade one of their chickens for a bar of gold .
Because that would be HIS price … after SHTF .
Today he would be just a fool for even suggesting such a trade , what on earth makes these people believe that will change with a worse or collapsed economy ?
Unless you ’re dealing with a guy with a bar of gold in a stranded island , that unrealistic .
Neither you nor I set the price of gold or anything else for that matter , the market does it .
You can either accept it or customers will go somewhere else .
But then again , food , just like everything else is expensive when you have hyperinflation .
It was just last year or the year before , that tomato reached a world wide historic record in Argentina , a kilo of tomato cost about 4 dollars in grocery stores and supermarkets .
The small producers thoughts they could just grow gold , but as soon as everyone got into tomatoes , the excess of production sent it back to normal prices , even below that .
Damned tomatoes where everywhere .
The truth is that , while the price is inflated at the grocery , the guy actually growing and otherwise producing the food is n’t getting rich .
He gets a couple cents for what he does , he needs BULK , and that ’s why the great majority of small producers are poor .
Poor as in they would be better of getting a regular job in town .
With the succession of economy crisis in Argentina that ’s what most people ended up doing .
Buenos
Aires got overpopulated and many of the small towns in the country just died .
Another example , milk costs around one dollar if you want one that is n’t shamelessly cut with water .
That ’s around 3 pesos per liter .
The producer ?
He gets paid 7 cents per liter , that ’s pesos guys , so he gets 0,02 dollars per liter of milk produced .
The inflation makes it expensive at the shelf .
Go with a truck full of milk and sell it yourself ?
Good luck with that .
Argentine farmers protest in the province of Santa Fe during the the " Country Crisis " ( Crisis del Campo )
Some people do sell vegetables on the streets or in market fairs .
I do n’t envy their lifestyle nor does anyone that has at least a minimum wage job .
What I mean by this is the following :
Please , understand I ’ve got nothing against gardening , or hard working people , specially farmers which is such a honorable job .
What I ’m saying is that its only going to be harder to make money out of it , not easier as the couch survivalists that apparently did n’t bother to check their own country ’s history seem to believe .
Now , for the good news , you do have options if you know how to market your products well , find several organic stores that may be willing to sell your products .
“ Farm chicken ” and “ Farm butcher ” are still pretty popular here and they usually have cheaper prices that supermarkets .
That means people will buy .
They offer these products supposedly free of all the junk found in the mass produced supermarket meats , but the price is the most attractive thing people notice .
You ’ll either need : a ) A store somewhere where there ’s enough clients b)
Store owners , groceries , butchers or organic food stores that may be interested .
If you market it well and the price is right you may do good money .
If you ’re planning on getting involved in this type of activity , specially with hard economic times already here and getting worse , I ’d tell you that without a doubt the mot important aspect of your business and the key for its survival will be the connections you have to offer your product and how well you market it .
You have to be clever regarding doing business .
Just producing a good product wont cut it .
Another tip , aim for clients with good income levels .
The poor guy will find a way to save as much money as he can .
Even with inflated grocery prices , you still have places like Mercado Central where meat , milk , fruits and vegetables cost 5 to 10 times less .
Takes time , requires you to go to some dangerous parts of town but people do find away , so aim for the higher income client interested in “ organic ” “ green ” “ pesticide free ” ” 100 % natural ” “ I read Hamlet to the chickens before cutting their heads off ” .
The “ CSA or box schemes ” may work beautifully ... if you know how to market it well and have the right clients .
Advertising is important , fliers in your target neighborhoods , maybe publicity in local radio , TV or papers , but so is connections , developing friendly business relations and word of mouth reputation spreading in your community .
Edible game does disappear pretty fast when things like these occur .
Suddenly everyone feels like hunting instead of paying for burgers .
It happened during the Great Depression and it happened here too , anything that can be eaten it hunted almost to extinction fast .
FerFAL
Ah , USB thumb drives .
In the not - so - distant past , these were prized possessions .
Their ability to store tensnay , hundreds of megabytes on a few flash chips strapped to a USB connector drew oohs and aahs , and some of us pondered whether , once prices came down , these devices could one day come to replace the mighty floppy disk .
Today , USB thumb drives are all but exciting .
Odds are you ’ve bought several , scrounged a few more , and left all but a couple sitting quietly in a forgotten drawer , waiting for their siblings to go missing .
Once in a while , though , someone spices things up .
Corsair did just that at CES 2007 with the original Flash Padlock , a USB thumb drive whose contents users could lock by setting a code on the device itself .
Today , we ’re looking at the 8GB Flash Padlock 2 , a smaller , more rugged , and purportedly more secure successor that retains its predecessor ’s principal feature and lets you reset the code if your memory ever fails you .
The Flash Padlock 2
Corsair dresses the Flash Padlock 2 in the same thick , curvy rubber garb that covers the Flash Voyager GT , although the top surface has much more going on : red and green lock lights , six buttons ( including one key button and five number buttons ) , plus a big , blue activity light .
Popping off the soft rubber cap also reveals a shiny USB 2.0 connector .
Everything related to encryption and locking happens on the drive itself , so you wo n’t need any software to get going .
You will , however , want to check the manual , because configuring the drive using the six surface buttons is n’t as intuitive as it might seem .
Unlocking is simple enough : press the key button , enter your PIN , and once the green padlock light flashes , you can insert the Flash Padlock 2 in the nearest available USB port and access your data .
The drive will lock itself again as soon as you remove it form the port .
Feel like trying to brute - force someone else ’s PIN ?
Not so fast .
After five erroneous inputs , the Flash Padlock 2 will disable itself for two minutes .
Other features are a tad less straightforward to memorize , though .
To set a PIN , for instance , you ’ll want to press and hold the key button for three seconds , enter your PIN ( up to 10 digits ) , then press and hold the key button again , enter your PIN again , then press the key button one last time .
If you ever forget your PIN , you can press the key and 0/1 buttons simultaneously for three seconds , enter “ 911 , ” and hit the key icon again .
After that , the drive will mount as an unformatted volume .
There are other features , too , like a master PIN that can be set in addition to the user PIN ( likely a useful feature for administrators in business environments ) .
There ’s even a way to keep the Flash Padlock 2 unlocked all the time , should you wish to move it back and forth between multiple systems without having to enter the PIN each time .
Good luck figuring any of those things out without the manual .
Corsair says it keeps the Flash Padlock 2 ’s contents secure using 256 - bit encryption .
The firm claims to have “ dramatically increased ” the security of transfers between the drive and USB controller compared to the first - gen Flash Padlock , as well .
We hear the drive might even be eligible for certification under the Federal Information Processing Standard , should Corsair wish to spend the necessary cash .
In any case , we reckon the PIN system and the fact that the drive does n’t mount when locked will probably suffice to keep data safe from the vast , vast majority of muggers , thieves , or nosy co-workers .
Fancy security features aside , the Flash Padlock 2 ships in a fairly inconspicuous package with a blue lanyard and a USB extension cord .
Why the cord , you might ask ?
Well , this drive is a little chubby chubby enough that the rubber enclosure can spill across to other USB ports and render them unusable .
On my MacBook , for example , plugging in the Flash Padlock 2 without the extension means sacrificing two other ports : either one Ethernet and one USB or one USB and one Mini DisplayPort .
The drive similarly intrudes on other USB ports when hooked up to a typical desktop motherboard ’s port cluster .
Now that we know a little bit about the Flash Padlock 2 , let ’s see if it performs as advertised and if it ’s really as rugged as Corsair claims .
Our testing methods
Because the Flash Padlock 2 encrypts and decrypts data on the fly , we were especially curious to see whether transfer rates were in the same league as those of other USB thumb drives .
So , we singled out three other contestants a 4GB OCZ Rally2 , a 2GB OCZ Diesel , and a beat - up 2GB Kingston DataTraveler Mini , whose sliding plug cover broke off many moons ago and ran a handful of performance tests .
We used the following system configuration for testing :
Processor Core i5-750 2.66GHz
Motherboard Gigabyte GA - P55 - UD3R
North bridge P55 PCH South bridge Memory size 4GB ( 4 DIMMs ) Memory type Kingston ValueRAM DDR3 SDRAM at 1333MHz Memory timings 9-9-9-24 1T
Chipset drivers Matrix Storage Manager 8.9.0.1023 Audio Creative SoundBlaster X - Fi XtremeGamer with Creative 2.18.0013 driver Graphics XFX Radeon HD 5770 1GB with Catalyst 10.2 drivers Hard drives Dual WD Caviar SE16 320 GB SATA hard drives in RAID 1 mode Power supply Corsair HX450W OS Windows 7 Ultimate x64 Edition RTM
All tests were run at least three times , with their results averaged .
We used the following versions of our test applications :
All the tests and methods we employed are publicly available and reproducible .
If you have questions about our methods , hit our forums to talk with us about them .
Test results
Let ’s get started with a staple of storage benchmarking , HD Tach .
We tested with that application ’s full variable zone size setting .
At least in this synthetic test , the Flash Padlock 2 delivers strictly middle - of - the - pack performance .
OCZ ’s Rally2 leads by a comfortable and consistent margin , but OCZ specifically advertises that product as “ one of the fastest flash drives available , ” so we ’re not particularly surprised .
The Flash Padlock 2 fares well compared to the 2GB drives , though .
To add to our synthetic testing , we busted out our stopwatch and timed the transfer of a 656MB directory containing 83 files , most of them MP3 songs , from our test system to the Flash Padlock 2 .
Satisfyingly , this test echoes HD Tach ’s average write speed benchmark .
The Rally2 comes out on top , the Flash Padlock 2 ends up not too far behind , and the 2GB OCZ and Kingston offerings take third and fourth places , respectively .
( We tried timing file copies from those drives toward our test system , too , but the results were n’t all that enlightening .
All four drives took about four to five seconds , and manual stopwatch testing made it difficult to detect minute differences . )
If we can draw one conclusion from these tests , it ’s that the Flash Padlock 2 ’s encryption hijinks do n’t translate into unusually slow file transfers .
However , folks chiefly concerned with performance will find there are quicker USB thumb drives on the market .
We were n’t finished with the Flash Padlock 2 .
Is that chubby rubber enclosure actually good for something , or does it just block off other USB ports for no reason ?
To find out , I threw the Flash Padlock 2 into the front pocket of my jeans .
I then placed the jeans and some other laundry in the washing machine on a 90 - minute cycle , at a temperature of 40 °C ( 104°F ) .
The drive came out of the wash safe and sound and it remains fully functional over a month later .
This Flash Padlock 2 has also gotten sat on , tossed around at the bottom of a loaded backpack during a transatlantic flight , and thrown multiple times onto a hard tile floor , all without suffering a scratch .
Speaking of scratches , Corsair has neatly embossed the labels on the six surface buttons ( as well as its logo , of course ) , so even if the white paint does get scratched off , the symbols will live on .
KOLKATA : A 55 - year - old Kolkata businessman found out what it would perhaps be like to have an overdose of Viagra .
The father of two , ended up with a prolonged erection that lasted for — hold your breath — a full 21 days .
And the exasperated gentleman , who found the situation too hot to handle , had not consumed the magic pill .
His predicament resulted from a neurological disorder .
It took an emergency surgery to relieve him but the man might have lost his ability to resume sexual activity , said doctors at the Wockhardt Hospitals .
The man had been suffering from a problem called priapism — triggered by a peripheral nervous system disorder .
While for normal individuals , penile erection subsides once sexual excitement has ceased , victims of priapism fail to return to a normal state .
Prolonged erection usually leads to a permanent damage to the penis and could even cause death .
It has to be treated within six hours , but doctors in this case managed to save his life .
" It was too late by the time he sought treatment , " said Avishek Mukherjee , urosurgeon at Wockhardt .
Priapism prevents blood from draining out of the penis .
There are two penile cylinders ( corpora and cavernosa ) inside which blood accumulates and that leads to a stiffening of the organ .
During erection , the blood flow stops .
So , if erection persists for more than an hour , the supply to penis is reduced , which can damage the organ .
If the supply remains cut off for a long time , the penis can even be gangrenous .
To treat the disorder , blood needs to be drained out to allow fresh blood to flow in .
For this , a passage or a shunt is created .
The tip of the penis , called glans pens , has an outlet for the blood to be drained out .
" We created a passage between corpora and cavernosa by perforating the walls separating the cylinders .
It drained the choked blood out and relieved him , " explained Mukherjee .

The zebra finch is the first songbird to have had its genome decoded
Scientists have created a " blueprint " of the genome of a songbird .
The advance , described in the journal Nature , could reveal some of the evolutionary secrets of vocal learning in animals , including humans .
The researchers say it will aid the study the genetics of speech disorders , such as those related to autism , stuttering and Parkinson 's Disease .
The international research team was led by Dr Wesley Warren from the Washington University in St Louis , US .
" The zebra finch is a beautiful model for vocal learning , " Dr Warren said .
He explained to BBC News that earlier research had shown that certain genes in the brains of zebra finches were activated when the male birds heard a familiar song .
" We looked for the position of these genes in the bird 's genome , and then looked for the [ equivalent ] genes in the chicken genome , " he explained .
The chicken is the only other bird to have had its genome fully sequenced .
And by comparing the chicken genome to that of a songbird , the scientists were able to identify genes that were most important in vocalisation and song - learning .
Under pressure Dr Warren said that he and his colleagues looked at which genes changed as vocal communication evolved .
To reveal this , the team worked out what the genome of a common ancestor of both birds would look like .
" Then we looked for genes that had changed faster in the zebra finch than we would have expected , " said Dr Warren .
" This shows that there was a [ natural ] selection pressure on those genes . "
This revealed the steps - the tiny molecular changes within each gene - that were most likely to have been associated with the evolution of vocal communication .
Dr Richard Wilson , director of Washington University 's Genome Center and another senior researcher involved in the study said : " Now we can look deep into the genome , not just at the genes involved in vocal learning , but at the complex ways in which they are regulated . "
" There are layers and layers of complexity that we 're just beginning to see .
This information provides clues to how vocal learning occurs at the most basic molecular level in birds and in people . "
Dr Warren said that the findings would take the research " into the human realm " .
" We can start to look at the structure of those genes in humans with stuttering , autism , Parkinson 's Disease and a lot of other neurological disorders [ where speech is affected ] to see if they 're altered in any way . "
Dr Carlos Botero , a specialist in animal communication from Duke University in the US said that this work brought us " a little bit closer to understanding the links between genes and behaviour . "
Dr Botero , who was not involved in this study , added : " These results should be appealing not only to those interested in the evolution of song or communication but also to anyone who has ever wondered how the tiny little molecules in our genes can ultimately influence what we are and what we are able to do .

I beg to differ .
You made no such point .
You merely hinted at the
conundrum that Toyota finds itself in relative to the
unsubstantiated allegations that have been made by Sikes .
It should be noted that Sikes has not demonstrated the truthfulness
of his allegations beyond a reasonable doubt .
Contrary to what the
media would have us believe , the ball never left his court ...
However , this whole matter of so called " unintentional acceleration "
if anything , is a matter of technical competance .
Only after that
would come possible considerations of " innocence . "

A big part of the reason consumer goods are so cheap in the U.S. is because people always know what they ’re paying .
As a consequence , consumers can push prices lower by voting with their feet .
If CVS tries to sell me a toothbrush for $ 4 when the one at Rite Aid goes for $ 3 , I will shop at Rite Aid and CVS will learn its lesson .
This dynamic almost entirely accounts for the success of Wal - Mart .
Yes , Wal - Mart has more efficient ( and therefore cheaper ) distribution than almost any other company on Earth , but the whole reason Wal - Mart is going for cheap in the first place is because there are hundreds of millions of Americans who demand it — a demand that is listened to because people are able to make well - informed decisions about when to walk away .
Lately I ’ve been wondering if we might not be wise to unleash such price - crazed consumerism on the field of health care .
The great health care debate has two prongs .
I do n’t know the best way to expand coverage to the uninsured .
But I do have an idea about how to drive down the eye - popping cost of medical treatment : price tags .
I write this as a newly price - conscious consumer of health care .
At the beginning of the year , Time Warner changed my health insurance — which , for the record , I am grateful to have .
I used to be charged co-pays .
About $ 25 a pop for office visits .
Now I am under a system of co-insurance .
After my yearly deductible , I pay 10 % of all my health care costs , up to an annual out - of - pocket maximum .
This has immediately changed my behavior .
I hurt my ankle a while back , but how I did that and what is ultimately causing the pain is a mystery .
My first foot doctor was stumped .
I went to see another one a few weeks ago and when I checked in , I asked how much the office visit would cost .
The desk clerk told me I did n’t have to worry about it since I had insurance .
I explained that insurance did n’t cover everything .
She came back with “ about $ 700 . ”
That would mean $ 70 directly from my pocket .
I was floored , but I had no way of knowing if I was overpaying .
Who could possibly know that ?
Then one of the technicians fetched me for an X -ray .
I asked how much the X - ray would cost .
He said he did n’t know , but he could try to find out … or would I just like to wait and see the doctor first ?
I said I ’d wait .
The doctor came in and asked me a few questions .
I explained that I ’d been to another doctor .
I repeated what that doctor had told me about the X - ray I ’d had at his office .
My new doctor examined me and told me that another X - ray would n’t tell him what he needed to know .
And that was how I prevented my very first unnecessary medical test .
I still do n’t know how much that X - ray would have cost , but I do know neither I nor my insurance company had to pay for it .
My colleague Kate Pickert tells me that some 30 % of health - care costs are attributable to waste .
I am happy to know I am now doing my part to cut down on that .
Well , not happy exactly .
Under this new system of co-insurance , I pay a lot more .
Nonetheless , I am an immediate fan .
I wish everyone in America could instantaneously have insurance set up this way .
I wish that every time any person went to the doctor , he asked :
How much does this cost ?
How much does that cost ?
Is there a less - expensive way to do this ?
Naturally , people with high deductibles are already incentivized to do this .
So are people without insurance .
But I want to go even further .
I want everyone to have easy access to price information , even those people who do n’t think — or want — to ask .
When I go to a hotel , there is sign on the back of the door that tells me the most the room can cost .
When I go to a car dealership , there are sticker prices on every windshield .
When I go to Wal - Mart , there are price tags on the shelves .
And that is what I want for doctors ’ offices and hospitals , too : price tags .
I want a little sign on my doctor ’s front desk that tells me that office visits cost $ 700 .
I want a placard on every MRI machine in the nation that tells me that an ankle scan costs $ 1,050 .
I want the consumer marketplace to be flooded with information about how much health care costs .
And then I want tech entrepreneurs to create web sites and iPhone apps to help people comparison shop medical services .
I ’m hardly the first to argue we need more consumer skin in the game .
Back in the late ’ 70s and early ’ 80s , the landmark Rand Health Insurance Experiment found that when consumers have to help pay for medical care they use less of it .
The study found that consumers gave up both appropriate and inappropriate care , which might seem worrisome — you do n’t want people not going to the doctor at all until they ’re in such bad shape that they go to the ER .
But the study also found little impact on people ’s health .
The widely adopted innovation in the years that followed the Rand study was the co-pay .
I think it ’s safe to say that mechanism is no longer working .
I have long been fairly quiet about health - care policy because I feel I do n’t know enough about the intricacies of the debate .
But one thing I do know about is the price - setting power of the enlightened consumer .
I know about the effects of price transparency , and I know about what happens when you give Americans the tools to hunt for deals and value .
Think about Wal - Mart .
Think about going on Expedia to comparison shop airline tickets .
Think about the first question you ask when you are considering buying a particular house .
Now think about health care .
UPDATE : Here is how we can make this happen .
( h/t Heather )
Paul Krugman recently wrote that he thought that Republicans and Democrats no longer occupy the same universe with one another .
Certainly , my understanding of Christianity is n't the same as Glenn Beck's , when he advised his listeners to leave their churches if those churches focus on social justice :
Glenn
Beck set out to convince his audience that " social justice , " the term many Christian churches use to describe their efforts to address poverty and human rights , is a " code word " for communism and Nazism .
Beck urged Christians to discuss the term with their priests and to leave their churches if leaders would not reconsider their emphasis on social justice .
" I 'm begging you , your right to religion and freedom to exercise religion and read all of the passages of the Bible as you want to read them and as your church wants to preach them . . . are going to come under the ropes in the next year .
If it lasts that long it will be the next year .
I beg you , look for the words ' social justice ' or ' economic justice ' on your church Web site .
If you find it , run as fast as you can .
Social justice and economic justice , they are code words .
Now , am I advising people to leave their church ?
Yes ! "
Now , I 'm going to set aside the troubling implicit admission of the selfishness of the Mormon Church by this LDS convert for the moment .
I just have to ask if Beck has read the same Bible as the rest of us :
" Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world :
For I was an hungered , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in : Naked , and ye clothed me : I was sick , and ye visited me : I was in prison , and ye came unto me . "
" Then shall the righteous answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungered , and fed thee ?
or thirsty , and gave thee drink ?
When saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ?
or naked , and clothed thee ?
Or when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ? "
" And the King shall answer and say unto them , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me . "
( Matthew 25:34 - 40 )
Now that seems pretty clear to me that Jesus said that you need to do good works with those less fortunate than you and that he felt it was critical that you show his devotion to Him by doing so .
But maybe Beck missed that sermon .
He then went on to conflate communism and Nazism , saying they both were the ultimate expression of the ( you guessed it ) left , by saying they both focused on the dreaded " social justice " .
Man , teh stoopid , it hurts .
I wish there was a way to just stop this stupid " Nazis were leftists " meme ( Erick Erickson was tweeting that this morning too -- citing Jonah Goldberg as an expert -- bwahahaha ! ) .
But since one must shut down one 's brain to believe that , I think it 's a lost cause .

Dieters are often advised to stop drinking alcohol to avoid the extra calories lurking in a glass of wine or a favorite cocktail .
But new research suggests that women who regularly consume moderate amounts of alcohol are less likely to gain weight than nondrinkers and are at lower risk for obesity .
The findings , reported this week in the Archives of Internal Medicine , are based on a study of 19,220 United States women aged 39 or older who , at the start of the study , fell into the “ normal weight ” category based on their body mass index .
Researchers at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston tracked the women ’s drinking habits over 13 years .
About 60 percent of the women were light or regular drinkers , while about 40 percent reported drinking no alcohol .
Over the course of the study , 41 percent of the women became overweight or obese .
Although alcohol is packed with calories ( about 150 in a six - ounce glass of wine ) , the nondrinkers in the study actually gained more weight over time : nine pounds , on average , compared with an average gain of about three pounds among regular moderate drinkers .
The risk of becoming overweight was almost 30 percent lower for women who consumed one or two alcohol beverages a day , compared with nondrinkers .
The findings are certain to be confusing for women who continue to receive conflicting messages about the health benefits and risks of alcohol .
Although moderate drinking is associated with better heart health , regular drinking also increases breast cancer risk .
The trend toward less weight gain among drinkers does n’t appear to hold true for men .
A 2003 study of British men showed that regular drinkers gained more weight than nondrinkers .
Studies suggest that drinking alcohol has different effects on eating habits among men and women .
Men typically add alcohol to their daily caloric intake , whereas women are more likely to substitute alcohol for food .
In the Archives study , women who drank alcohol reported fewer calories from food sources , particularly carbohydrates .
In addition , there may be differences in how men and women metabolize alcohol .
Metabolic studies show that after men drink alcohol , they experience little if any metabolic change .
But alcohol appears to slightly speed up a woman ’s metabolism .
The link between consumption of red wine and less weight gain was particularly pronounced in the Archives study .
Some studies have suggested that resveratrol , a compound present in grapes and red wine , appears to inhibit the development of fat cells and to have other antiobesity properties .
The findings do n’t mean women should rush to drink alcohol to lose weight .
Other research shows that once a person is already overweight , her alcohol metabolism is more efficient , and so an overweight woman may gain more weight from alcohol than a lean woman .
The data do , however , suggest that for many women facing weight problems , the extra calories are probably not coming from alcoholic beverages .
This is absolutely insane :
A judge in Pennsylvania has denied a request from a 12 - year - old homicide suspect to have his case transferred to juvenile court .
Jordan Brown is facing adult charges in the February 2009 shooting death of his father ’s pregnant girlfriend , and a judge turned down a petition to have the case transferred from criminal to juvenile court .
Police have said the boy , then 11 , shot Kenzie Marie Houk , who was eight months ’ pregnant , once at point - blank range in her farmhouse in western Pennsylvania .
He has been charged with one count each of criminal homicide and homicide of an unborn child in the death of Houk , 26 , Lawrence County District Attorney John Bongivengo said .

Whales store carbon by the tonne A century of whaling may have released more than 100 million tonnes - or a large forest 's worth - of carbon into the atmosphere , scientists say .
Whales store carbon within their huge bodies and when they are killed , much of this carbon can be released .
US scientists revealed their estimate of carbon released by whaling at a major ocean sciences meeting in the US .
Dr Andrew Pershing from the University of Maine described whales as the " forests of the ocean " .
Dr Pershing and his colleagues from the Gulf of Maine Research Institute calculated the annual carbon - storing capacity of whales as they grew .
" Whales , like any animal or plant on the planet , are made out of a lot of carbon , " he said .
" And when you kill and remove a whale from the ocean , that 's removing carbon from this storage system and possibly sending it into the atmosphere . "
He pointed out that , particularly in the early days of whaling , the animals were a source of lamp oil , which was burned , releasing the carbon directly into the air .
" And this marine system is unique because when whales die [ naturally ] , their bodies sink , so they take that carbon down to the bottom of the ocean .
" If they die where it 's deep enough , it will be [ stored ] out of the atmosphere perhaps for hundreds of years . "
Ocean trees
In their initial calculations , the team worked out that 100 years of whaling had released an amount of carbon equivalent to burning 130,000 sq km of temperate forests , or to driving 128,000 Humvees continuously for 100 years .
The idea would be to do a full accounting of how much carbon you could store in a fully populated stock of fish or whales

Guide to the great whales Dr Pershing stressed that this was still a relatively tiny amount when compared to the billions of tonnes produced by human activity every year .
But he said that whales played an important role in storing and transporting carbon in the marine ecosystem .
Simply leaving large groups of whales to grow , he said , could " sequester " the greenhouse gas , in amounts that were comparable to some of the reforestation schemes that earn and sell carbon credits .
He suggested that a similar system of carbon credits could be applied to whales in order to protect and rebuild their stocks .
" The idea would be to do a full accounting of how much carbon you could store in a fully populated stock of fish or whales , and allow countries to sell their fish quota as carbon credits , " he explained .
" You could use those credits as an incentive to reduce the fishing pressure or to promote the conservation of some of these species . "
Is bigger better ?
Other scientists said that he had raised an exciting and interesting problem .
Professor Daniel Costa , a marine animal researcher from the University of California , Santa Cruz , told BBC News : " So many more groups are looking at the importance of these large animals in the carbon cycle .
" And it 's one of those things that , when you look at it , you think : ' This is so obvious , why did n't we think of this before ? '. "
Dr Pershing pointed out that whales , with their huge size , were more efficient than smaller animals at storing carbon .
He used the analogy of a small dog compared to a large dog .
" My wife 's 6 lb ( 2.7 kg ) toy poodle eats one cup of food per day and my dog - a 60 lb standard poodle - eats five cups of food per day , " he said .
" That 's only five times as much food but my dog weighs ten times as much . "
He said that the marine carbon credit idea could be applied to other very large marine animals , including endangered bluefin tuna and white sharks .
Dr Pershing said : " These are huge and they are top predators , so unless they 're fished they would be likely to take their biomass to the bottom of the ocean [ when they die ] . "
The American Geophysical Union 's Ocean Sciences meeting has been taking place this week in Portland , Oregon .

Nelson Elhage wrote a post about Git and usability , in which he discussed one of the reasons why Git seems to be so confusing to users who have come in straight from a Subversion - style workflow .
When discussing this issue offline , one of the things that came up was the fact that , while Subversion imposes a fairly rigid workflow upon its users , Git is flexible enough to do almost any sort of workflow .
This is terrible for a user placed in a shop that uses Git : when they go Google for how to use Git , they 'll get any multitude of tutorials , each of which is for a different workflow .
In this multipart series , I 'd like to discuss several different types of workflows that I 've seen or experienced while using Git .
This first post will look at a very simple example of a Git workflow , namely that of a single user , which will establish some basic idioms of Git that you might see in the other workflows .
A single - user workflow is , well , kind of simple .
At it 's simplest , it 's not much more than a glorified backup system ; you have lots of versions of your code .
You can go back in time .
Since I am assuming a general knowledge of version control systems , I do n't think I need to convince you why this is useful .
This article also assumes that you 're comfortable enough to make commits in a repository ( though we will not assume you know how to use the index ; - a is a wondrous flag ) .
Backups
The very first thing you may notice when you move from a centralized VCS to a decentralized VCS is that your data never leaves your computer unless you explicitly say so .
This is great if you are on an airplane and do n't have Internet access ; you do n't have to pile up a stack of changes without being able to check in to the server .
However , it means that you have to put in a little thought about where you are going to push your changes to .
An easy way to do this is to utilize the multitude free public hosting .
If you have a server that you have SSH access , private offsite backups are also easy : create a bare git repository on another server using git init -- bare and then setup a remote that you can push to ... but I 'm getting ahead of myself !
If you created a Git repository and working copy on your own computer with git init , you 'll now have to wrangle with Git remotes .
I personally find this quite annoying , and thus always arrange to have my bare Git repository ( i.e. the server ) setup before I git clone my working copy ( i.e. the client ) , which sets up the configuration that makes pushing easy .
My steps are then :
# On my server , make a directory ( I like / srv/git / project.git ) and in it run git init -- bare #
On my client , run git clone ssh://servername/srv/git/project.git
If you must setup the remotes on an existing repository , the following commands will do the trick :
git remote add origin $ REPO_URL git config branch .
master .remote origin git config branch .master .merge refs/heads / master
For the curious , the first line adds a remote named " origin " ( which , by convention , is the remote setup from the repository you may have cloned ) associated with $ REPO_URL .
The second and third lines setup default behavior for when you pull changes from the repository , to simulate the configuration that normally gets setup when you do a clone .
( Note : this kind of sucks .
Git 1.7.0 introduces the - - set - upstream flag which fixes these problems . )
From there , all you need to do is make commits with git commit , and then push them to the remote repository with git push .
Topic branches
As a single user , most of your work in your repository will play nicely together ; you do n't have to worry about someone else coming in and trampling on your commits .
However , every once in a while you may find yourself in the midst of a large refactoring , and you find yourself having to leave things off for the day , or take an interrupt to work on a more pressing , albeit smaller , bugfix .
Here , cheap commits and branching make this very simple on Git .
If you think the changes you are currently working on are big but you 'll be able to get back immediately to them , use git stash to temporarily pop your changes into a stash .
You can then perform your minor changes , and once done , use git stash pop to restore your old changes .
Stash works best as a temporary scratch place for you to store changes , and should be immediately emptied out when possible ; you do n't want to be looking at multiple stashed changes and trying to figure out which one contains the ones you care about .
If your changes are a smidge bigger than that , or you think that you 're not going to be able to work on whatever large change you 're making for a while , you can make what 's called a topic branch .
First , change your working copy over to a new branch using git checkout - b new - branch - name ( pick a descriptive name ) .
Then , make a commit to save your changes .
If you pop open gitk , you 'll now notice that you have a commit hanging off of master .
You can checkout master again using git checkout master and work on whatever other changes you need .
When you finally decide that your topic branch is done , you need to stick back into master .
There are two ways to do this :
You can pretend that your topic branch , as a whole , is just a big patch , and as such , this patch should reasonably apply to the most recent version of master .
In that case , running git rebase master while on the topic branch ( you can check with git status ) will take this " patch " and apply it to master .
You can then checkout master and git pull topic - branch to fast - forward master to the topic branch .
Since getting rid of old branches is a good thing , I recommend running git branch -d topic - branch afterwards .
You can take a stance that history is important , and perform a merge .
On the master branch , run git merge topic - branch .
Just as in the first case , you can then cleanup the topic branch with git branch -d topic - branch .
Cleaning up after old topic branches is a good habit to get into , because it means you can use git branch to remind yourself quickly which topic branches might need your attention .
Additionally , if you care about backing up your topic branches , you should run git push origin topic - branch .
You can delete topic branches from your remote using git push origin : topic - branch ( note the colon ) .
Clean history
Many people pay a lot of attention to documentation inside a source file in order to puzzle out what a particular piece of code does .
However , another excellent source of code documentation is looking at the history of a piece of code ; when did a particular snippet get introduced , and what explanation did the author give for it when making that change ?
git blame will give you a blow - by - blow description of when every particular line in a Git file was changed , and git log will show you the conglomeration of changes made to a particular file .
Unfortunately , the usefulness of this mechanism highly depends on the quality of the messages you 're making in your commits , and if you 're using Git properly and committing often , you might have skimped a little on some of the messages .
No worries ; it happens to the best of us .
You just have to remember to clean things up ( i.e. rewrite history ) when you 're done .
In this case , git rebase - i is your friend .
Specify as an argument how far back you want to rewrite history ( HEAD~N where N is a number is probably a good bet ) , and then rewrite history to your hearts content .
You have three primary tools :
edit , and when Git gets to that commit , just run git commit -- amend :
This is fairly simple : you have a self - contained commit that you did n't really write a good commit message for , well amend will let you change that commit message into something that is useful .
, and when Git gets to that commit , just run :
This is fairly simple : you have a self - contained commit that you did n't really write a good commit message for , well amend will let you change that commit message into something that is useful .
squash :
If you made a bunch of very small commits , and now you look at them and decide , no , they really logically go together , you can squash them together .
: If you made a bunch of very small commits , and now you look at them and decide , no , they really logically go together , you can squash them together .
edit with git checkout HEAD~ :
What this will do is give you a working tree with the changes of that commit , but without any of them actually part of a commit .
You can then break a " too big " commit into bite - sized pieces using git add - p ( which will selectively add hunks of your changes to the index ) and then using git commit without the - a flag ) .
This strategy interacts particularly well with topic branches , which lend themselves to the following workflow :
Create the topic branch with git checkout - b topic - name , Hack a lot on the branch , making tiny commits with incomprehensible summaries , Review your changes with git log -u master ..HEAD , Edit your changes with git rebase - i master , Checkout master and git pull topic - name .
And that 's it for part one !
You may have noticed that all of these strategies seem to feed into each other : this unusual integration between all aspects is one of the benefits of Git 's simple internal model .
If people would like to see some examples of these techniques in action , I 'd be more than happy to blog about them some more .
Thanks for reading .
Valve announced today it will bring Steam , Valve 's gaming service , and Source , Valve 's gaming engine , to the Mac. Steam and Valve 's library of games including Left 4 Dead 2 , Team Fortress 2 , Counter - Strike , Portal , and the Half - Life series will be available in April .
" As we transition from entertainment as a product to entertainment as a service , customers and developers need open , high - quality Internet clients , " said Gabe Newell , President of Valve .
" The Mac is a great platform for entertainment services . " " Our Steam partners , who are delivering over a thousand games to 25 million Steam clients , are very excited about adding support for the Mac , " said Jason Holtman , Director of Business Development at Valve .
" Steamworks for the Mac supports all of the Steamworks APIs , and we have added a new feature , called Steam Play , which allows customers who purchase the product for the Mac or Windows to play on the other platform free of charge .
For example , Steam Play , in combination with the Steam Cloud , allows a gamer playing on their work PC to go home and pick up playing the same game at the same point on their home Mac .
We expect most developers and publishers to take advantage of Steam Play .
"
" We looked at a variety of methods to get our games onto the Mac and in the end decided to go with native versions rather than emulation , " said John Cook , Director of Steam Development .
" The inclusion of WebKit into Steam , and of OpenGL into Source gives us a lot of flexibility in how we move these technologies forward .
We are treating the Mac as a tier - 1 platform so all of our future games will release simultaneously on Windows , Mac , and the Xbox 360 .
Updates for the Mac will be available simultaneously with the Windows updates .
Furthermore , Mac and Windows players will be part of the same multiplayer universe , sharing servers , lobbies , and so forth .
We fully support a heterogeneous mix of servers and clients .
The first Mac Steam client will be the new generation currently in beta testing on Windows .
" Portal 2 will be Valve 's first simultaneous release for Mac and Windows .
" Checking in code produces a PC build and Mac build at the same time , automatically , so the two platforms are perfectly in lock - step , " said Josh Weier , Portal 2 Project Lead .
" We 're always playing a native version on the Mac right alongside the PC .
This makes it very easy for us and for anyone using Source to do game development for the Mac .
" Support for the Mac in Source and Steamworks is available to third parties immediately .
Interested developers should contact Jason Holtman at jasonh@valvesoftware.com

Thomas Sowell : Them Pore Ole Bosses Need All the Help They Can Get
In the Matrix reality put before us by the corporatist alliance of big government and big business , and its corporate media mouthpieces , there are several recurring themes .
The economy we have now is the result of “ free choice , ” and all its specific features are the result of the free choices of individuals .
Those who complain of aspects of the existing economy want to use government to restrict freedom of choice .
Big business and big government are mortal enemies , and the main motive force behind government policy is a desire to restrict the freedom of big business and punish the rich .
Thomas Sowell manages so effectively to work all these talking points into a recent slimy little turd of a column , you ’d think he was playing Neocon Talking Points Bingo .
Sowell laments the “ resentment ” toward excessive profits and wealth , and insinuates that it ’s all part of some master plan–an “ agenda ” –by the “ czars , ” “ our betters in Washington , ” and politicians who seek “ dangerous power . ”
The goal is simply to take away “ our freedom to live our lives as we see fit . ”
Free to live as we please , we choose to create a corporate economy like the one we have now , and the only way to change the current corporate setup is by restricting our freedom .
In Sowell ’s morality play , the struggle between big government and big business is a struggle between power and freedom .
Sowell has it exactly backwards .
The struggle between big government and big business is about as authentic as the struggle between a “ good cop ” and “ bad cop ” in a police interrogation room .
Sowell also objects to the terms “ ‘ obscene ’ wealth ” and “ ‘ unconscionable ’ profits , ” asking just what ’s wrong with wealth and profits .
For Sowell , all wealth is by defnition good –it ’s poverty that ’s bad .
But he makes the unwarranted assumption that all wealth is obtained in a positive sum gain .
What if our economy , as it ’s actually set up , is a negative sum game in which most large concentrations of wealth are obtained at the expense of someone ’s poverty ?
It ’s stupid to say , without qualification , that all wealth is good –just as it ’s foolish to say that all property is good .
Sowell should know better than most people that there have been unjust forms of property .
And likewise , there is unjust wealth .
The fact is , big business and the rich are on the same side as those power - seeking politicians .
The dominant corporations and large fortunes of our time result from the use of the state to restrict our freedom of exchange .
Their wealth comes from the ability to restrict –with the help of the state –the terms on which we can buy and sell , and compel us to buy and sell only on terms favorable to them ( if you do n’t believe it , just compare the $ 10 you pay for a CD of Linux or Open Office to the hundreds of dollars charged for Windows or MS office ) .
Their profits–most definitely unconscionable –come from state - enforced privilege , state - enforced artificial scarcity , and state subsidies .
Government redistributes income , all right : but it redistributes it to the rich , not from them .
And our economic freedom is restricted –but to the benefit of big business and the rich , rather than to their detriment .
We have a corporate ruling class that has enriched itself at our expense , by using government to restrict our economic freedom and force us to do business with them on their terms .
And people like Sowell are their shills .
We do n’t need any of them .
Nationwide excitement among college basketball fans builds as the 2010 March Madness tournament is scheduled to begin Thursday , March 18 .
Sixty - four of the best National Collegiate Athletic Association men’s and women ’s basketball teams will compete to make it to the Final Four next month .
Even President Obama has joined the “ madness ” predicting Kansas , Kansas State , Kentucky and Villanova in the finals .
He ’s predicting Connecticut , Notre Dame , Stanford and Tennessee in the women ’s tournament .
There ’s nothing more entertaining than healthy basketball rivalry and cheering for the nation ’s best collegiate teams .
However Derrick Z. Jackson , writing for the Boston Globe , says it ’s disturbing when the graduation success rates of players belonging to the best teams are worsening .
For example , top - power Kentucky made the Division 1 tournament with a graduation success rate of only 18 percent for its black athletes and 31 percent overall .
“ This program single - handedly betrays the NCAA as toothless on the exploitation of athletes , ” Jackson says .
Kentucky ’s graduation rate scorecard for its black players for the last six years is : 18 , 17 , 9 , 17 , 17 , and zero .
Over the last ten years , its black player graduation rate has never risen above 29 percent and its overall graduation rate passed 50 percent only once , in 2001 .
“ Yet , who do we see hawking March Madness on Direct TV ?
Why none other than Kentucky ’s $ 32 million coach , John Calipari . ”
Jackson says the NCAA should ban the likes of Maryland , Texas , Nevada Las Vegas , and Kentucky because the concept of “ student - athlete ” is beyond repair .
“ At these schools , the athletes are semi - pros who should be paid . ”
Maryland is in the tournament with a zero graduation rate for its black athletes , and 8 percent overall .
Texas and Nevada Las Vegas are also in the tournament with both colleges not reaching over 22 percent when it comes to graduation rates among blacks .
The University of California at Berkeley has a campus graduation rate of 85 percent , including 62 percent for black students .
But the graduation success rate for both black and white players is zero , notes Jackson .
“ Until the NCAA demands studies of another sort and starts banning programs that do not heed the demand , March Madness will remain a national indictment of how we let college sports drive us stark riving mad , ” writes Jackson .
Meanwhile an annual report by The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida finds the disparity between graduation rates for white and black players on NCAA tournament - bound men ’s basketball teams grew this year .
The report shows 45 teams graduated 70 percent or more of their white players , and only 20 teams graduated at least 70 percent of their black players .
Players on teams headed to the NCAA women ’s tournament however are graduating at a higher rate than the men .
The graduation gap between white and black players is smaller for women than it is for men .
There were 19 women ’s teams that had a 100 percent graduation rate compared to six men ’s teams .
And 51 women ’s teams graduated at least 70 percent of their players compared to 29 men ’s teams .
The NCAA says 56 percent of black basketball players now graduate from Division 1 teams .
White players have an 81 percent graduation rate .
Critics contend the NCAA is a multi-million dollar industry that can care less about the players or their academic success and instead cares more about the industry ’s increasing monster profits .
Others argue the college players need an association similar to the professional leagues so that their rights are protected on and off the courts , especially when it comes to health care and compensation .

Hey guys …
Today they just announced a new planet that will appear in Star Wars : The Old republic !
This planet is going to be awesome ..
As you will read below , this planet is where many Sith Lords , Mandalorians , and creations of Sith alchemy were sent to be imprisoned during the Great War .
The Imperial forces will give it their all to free them but the Republic is going to do THEIR best to keep the evil forces contained ..
Read on !
Republic knowledge of Belsavis predates the Great Hyperspace War , but for centuries , the planet warranted little attention .
With the exception of some unusual volcanic activity , the planet was deemed , in all ways , unremarkable .
Belsavis was added to the star charts then summarily dismissed as nothing more than another curiosity of the Outer Rim .
Fifty years ago , while investigating the planet ’s tropical rifts that seemed to defy the ice shelves in completely unnatural ways , Republic scientists stumbled upon an ancient prison constructed by the Rakatan Empire .
Behind the force fields and ultra hard metals were the most terrifying prisoners in the galaxy .
Republic efforts to explore and secure the dilapidated network of vaults were impeded by ferocious alien species , and nearly unstoppable droids .
Realizing it was only a matter of time before the vaults and stasis chambers containing the worst of these prisoners failed , the Republic committed a force to maintain the complex , and establish a new Republic prison on Belsavis ’ unused surface .
In secret Strategic Information Service meetings it was decided that this new prison , dubbed “ the Tomb ” , was only to be used in cases where execution was impractical or impossible .
Once the Great War erupted , the Tomb ’s population rapidly increased .
Mandalorians , Sith Lords , and creations of Sith alchemy were sent to Belsavis for containment .
As rumors of the Tomb ’s existence spread , Imperial Intelligence began searching for the legendary super prison .
Despite Republic efforts to keep its location a secret , the Empire learned of the operation on Belsavis and sent strike teams to liberate all the imprisoned Sith .
In the short time since the Imperials arrived , the prison grounds have been transformed into a labyrinth of battle and chaos .
The Empire has discovered that extracting its loyal subjects from among their violent fellow inmates will not be easy , and even though the Republic is rushing to restore order , the threat of the mysterious evil breaking loose from its ancient prison is becoming all too real .

It looks like Bioware are really pushing the boat out with this game with regards to content ( quality and quantity ) compared to other MMO ’s at release .
Fingers crossed for a some space action at some point but I guess the amount of planets and different class storylines will keep me amused for a fair while after release as it is . ” – AidenCast
Russian Teenager Designs Noiseless Electric Rifle
Russia ’s Defense Ministry has shown interest in the new electomechanical rifle the performance of which exceeds that of sniper weapons .
The rifle was invented by a schoolboy in the city of Ufa .
Russian Teenager Designs Noiseless Electric Rifle
Maxim Kotelnikov , an eighth - grader , designed his weapon after he had seen a TV program about the use of similar rifles in the USA and Korea .
It took the boy a year to design the new weapon .
He used his friend ’s broken game rifle as the basis .
The rifle weighs nearly six kilos ; it fires special cartridges that need to be magnetized in advance .
Russia ’s Defense Ministry showed interest in the new weapon and asked the boy ’s permission to test his rifle .
“ This weapon is unique for it fires noiselessly .
There is no shock of discharge and a shot does not produce a flare .
No other sniper rifle can do it .
I designed my own system , which I called the “ Nucleus System , ” the boy said .
The rifle is based on the principle of accelerating coil .
The rifle is powered with electricity only .
A bullet gathers speed immediately , PolitOnline reports with referecne to Life.ru .
Maxim showed his creation to his teacher of physics .
The teacher sent the wunderkind to St. Petersburg , where the boy took part in “ Russia ’s Young Intellectuals ” forum .
The 15 - year - old boy took the first place at the forum and received a special invitation for practice at the defense ministry .
All further tests of Maxim ’s weapon will be conducted under the guidance of ministerial scientists .
The boy will assemble three other rifles in St. Petersburg during one month .
If the tests are successful , it is not ruled out that the electromagnetic sniper rifle will be launched into serial production for the needs of the Russian armed forces .

Gummy bears are small , squishy multi-colored candies that have been a favorite treat of both children and adults for years .
Gummy bears can be eaten either by themselves or used as part of a dessert .
They are a popular topping for ice cream and melted gummy bears can be baked into cookies and cakes or poured over a dessert .
Melted down gummy bears can add a fun and unique touch to a dessert or celebration .
Determine how many gummy bears you want to melt .
If you are following a recipe , the amount should be listed , otherwise , you can estimate .
Find a large , microwave safe bowl or container that will hold all the gummy bears easily with no risk of spilling .
Note : Gummy bear liquid will re-harden fairly quickly , so for best results you should be prepared to use gummy liquid as soon as it becomes a liquid .
If you need to prepare a dish or dessert for the gummy bears to go on , you should do it prior to or during the melting process .
Place the gummy bears in bowl .
Place bowl in microwave .
Set microwave to half power .
This will help your gummy bears melt evenly .
Turn microwave on for 5 minutes .
Check gummy bears to see how melted they are .
If they have not completely melted , return them to the microwave for another 5 minutes .
Continue doing this until gummy bears have completely melted .
Use melted gummy bears as desired .
Tip
If you do not want all the flavors to mix together or want to maintain a single color for your melted gummy liquid , sort your gummy bears by color prior to melting them .
Do not allow the different colors to melt together if you want your liquid to be a certain color .
The only question that counts is the one that the Chilcot inquiry wo n't address : was the war with Iraq illegal ?
If the answer is yes , everything changes .
The war is no longer a political matter , but a criminal one , and those who commissioned it should be committed for trial for what the Nuremberg tribunal called " the supreme international crime " : the crime of aggression .
But there 's a problem with official inquiries in the United Kingdom : the government appoints their members and sets their terms of reference .
It 's the equivalent of a criminal suspect being allowed to choose what the charges should be , who should judge his case and who should sit on the jury .
As a senior judge told the Guardian in November : " Looking into the legality of the war is the last thing the government wants .
And actually , it 's the last thing the opposition wants either because they voted for the war .
There simply is not the political pressure to explore the question of legality – they have not asked because they do n't want the answer . "
Others have explored it , however .
Two weeks ago a Dutch inquiry , led by a former supreme court judge , found that the invasion had " no sound mandate in international law " .
Last month Lord Steyn , a former law lord , said that " in the absence of a second UN resolution authorising invasion , it was illegal " .
In November Lord Bingham , the former lord chief justice , stated that , without the blessing of the UN , the Iraq war was " a serious violation of international law and the rule of law " .
Under the United Nations charter , two conditions must be met before a war can legally be waged .
The parties to a dispute must first " seek a solution by negotiation " ( article 33 ) .
They can take up arms without an explicit mandate from the UN security council only " if an armed attack occurs against [ them ] " ( article 51 ) .
Neither of these conditions applied .
The US and UK governments rejected Iraq 's attempts to negotiate .
At one point the US state department even announced that it would " go into thwart mode " to prevent the Iraqis from resuming talks on weapons inspection ( all references are on my website ) .
Iraq had launched no armed attack against either nation .
We also know that the UK government was aware that the war it intended to launch was illegal .
In March 2002 , the Cabinet Office explained that " a legal justification for invasion would be needed .
Subject to law officers ' advice , none currently exists . "
In July 2002 , Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general , told the prime minister that there were only " three possible legal bases " for launching a war – " self - defence , ­humanitarian intervention , or UNSC [ security council ] authorisation .
The first and second could not be the base in this case . "
Bush and Blair later failed to obtain security council authorisation .
As the resignation letter on the eve of the war from Elizabeth Wilmshurst , then deputy legal adviser to the ­Foreign Office , revealed , her office had ­" consistently " advised that an ­invasion would be unlawful without a new UN resolution .
She explained that " an unlawful use of force on such a scale amounts to the crime of aggression " .
Both Wilmshurst and her former boss , Sir Michael Wood , will testify before the Chilcot inquiry tomorrow .
Expect fireworks .
Without legal justification , the war with Iraq was an act of mass murder : those who died were unlawfully killed by the people who commissioned it .
Crimes of aggression ( also known as crimes against peace ) are defined by the Nuremberg principles as " planning , preparation , initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties " .
They have been recognised in international law since 1945 .
The Rome statute , which established the international criminal court ( ICC ) and which was ratified by Blair 's government in 2001 , provides for the court to " exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression " , once it has decided how the crime should be defined and prosecuted .
There are two problems .
The first is that neither the government nor the opposition has any interest in pursuing these crimes , for the obvious reason that in doing so they would expose themselves to prosecution .
The second is that the required legal mechanisms do n't yet exist .
The governments that ratified the Rome statute have been filibustering furiously to delay the point at which the crime can be prosecuted by the ICC : after eight years of discussions , the necessary provision still has not been adopted .
Some countries , mostly in eastern Europe and central Asia , have incorporated the crime of aggression into their own laws , though it is not yet clear which of them would be willing to try a foreign national for acts committed abroad .
In the UK , where it remains ­illegal to wear an offensive T - shirt , you cannot yet be prosecuted for mass ­murder commissioned overseas .
All those who believe in justice should campaign for their governments to stop messing about and allow the international criminal court to start prosecuting the crime of aggression .
We should also press for its adoption into national law .
But I believe that the people of this nation , who re-elected a government that had launched an illegal war , have a duty to do more than that .
We must show that we have not , as Blair requested , " moved on " from Iraq , that we are not prepared to allow his crime to remain unpunished , or to allow future leaders to believe that they can safely repeat it .
But how ?
As I found when I tried to apprehend John Bolton , one of the architects of the war in George Bush 's government , at the Hay festival in 2008 , and as Peter Tatchell found when he tried to detain Robert Mugabe , nothing focuses attention on these issues more than an attempted citizen 's arrest .
In October I mooted the idea of a bounty to which the public could contribute , ­payable to anyone who tried to arrest Tony Blair if he became president of the European Union .
He did n't of course , but I asked those who had pledged money whether we should go ahead anyway .
The response was overwhelmingly positive .
So today I am launching a website – www.arrestblair.org – whose purpose is to raise money as a reward for people attempting a peaceful citizen 's arrest of the former prime minister .
I have put up the first £ 100 , and I encourage you to match it .
Anyone meeting the rules I 've laid down will be entitled to one quarter of the total pot : the bounties will remain available until Blair faces a court of law .
The higher the ­reward , the greater the number of ­people who are likely to try .
At this stage the arrests will be largely symbolic , though they are likely to have great political resonance .
But I hope that as pressure builds up and the crime of aggression is adopted by the courts , these attempts will help to press ­governments to prosecute .
There must be no hiding place for those who have committed crimes against peace .
No ­civilised country can allow mass ­murderers to move on .
Organisers had not expected so many people to take part in the shoot
By Nick Bryant
BBC News , Sydney
More than 5,000 people have shed their clothing on the steps of the Sydney Opera House to pose for a photograph by the American artist Spencer Tunick .
The organisers had only expected about half that number to take part .
The installation had been commissioned by the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras , which took place over the weekend .
For once the eye was diverted away from the magnificent white sails of the Sydney Opera House .
It was drawn instead to the tableau of naked flesh assembled on its steps .
" Gay men and women lay naked next to their straight neighbours and this delivered a very strong message to the world that Australians embrace a free and equal society , " Tunick said .
More than 5,000 men and women shed their clothing - people of all ages , shapes and sizes , who were undeterred by the chilly pre-dawn weather on this , the first morning of the southern autumn .
Tunick , famed for his snapshots of mass nudity in public spaces , had been commissioned by the organisers of Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras , which took place over the weekend .
The naked models included a pregnant woman , who went straight to hospital afterwards to give birth , and a television weatherman whose viewers got to see considerably more than his usual Monday morning forecast .

The US has looked to China for help building railroads ever since Chinese laborers laid down the tracks for the Transcontinental Railroad in the 1860s .
Now , California hopes a partnership with the Middle Kingdom can do for 21st Century high - speed rail what that far less pleasant 19th Century " partnership " did for the Transcontinental Railroad .
America 's most populous state and the world 's most populous country have already signed preliminary agreements on the Chinese government building bullet trains on the West Coast , with Governor Schwarzenegger hoping to visit China later this year to further develop the project .

Tonight on FNC ’s Special Report with Bret Baier , President Barack Obama effortlessly rolled through an at times combative interview with Baier , who tried to talk about special deals on the healthcare bill and emails from “ the people ” who oppose healthcare reform , but Obama was more than up to the task as he used Fox News to push his own healthcare reform message .
Here is the video :
Watch the latest news video at video.

Baier came right out the gate with the Fox News anti-healthcare stance by asking about the Slaughter Solution .
Obama answered , “ What I can tell you is that the vote that ’s taken in the House will be a vote for health care reform .
And if people vote yes , whatever form that takes , that is going to be a vote for health care reform .
And I do n’t think we should pretend otherwise .
Bret , let me finish .
If they do n’t , if they vote against , then they ’re going to be voting against health care reform and they ’re going to be voting in favor of the status quo .
So Washington gets very concerned about these procedural issues in Congress .
This is always an issue that ’s — whether Republicans are in charge or Democrats in charge — when Republicans are in charge , Democrats constantly complain that the majority was not giving them an opportunity , et cetera .
What the American people care about is the fact that their premiums are going up 25 , 40 , 60 percent , and I ’m going to do something about it . ”
Baier pressed the president for an answer on the Slaughter Solution , and Obama said , “ What I ’m saying is whatever they end up voting on — and I hope it ’s going to be sometime this week — that it is going to be a vote for or against my health care proposal .
That ’s what matters .
That ’s what ultimately people are going to judge this on .
If people do n’t believe in health care reform — and I think there are definitely a lot of people who are worried about whether or not these changes are , in some fashion , going to affect them adversely .
And I think those are legitimate concerns on the substance — then somebody who votes for this bill , they ’re going to be judged at the polls .
And the same is going to be true if they vote against it . ”
The host then shifted gears and read some anti-healthcare emails from Fox News viewers .
Obama countered with , “ I ’ve got the exact same e-mails , that I could show you , that talk about why have n’t we done something to make sure that I , a small business person , am getting as good a deal as members of Congress are getting , and do n’t have my insurance rates jacked up 40 percent ?
Why is it that I , a mother with a child with a preexisting condition , still ca n’t get insurance ?
So the issue that I ’m concerned about is whether not we ’re fixing a broken system .
Baier later brought up the GOP talking point that Obama is transforming one sixth of the American economy , but the president rebutted this claim , “ Now , you keep on repeating the notion that it ’s one - sixth of the economy .
Yes , it ’s one - sixth of the economy , but we ’re not transforming one - sixth of the economy all in one fell swoop .
What we ’re saying is is that for the vast majority of people who have health care , they ’re going to be able to keep it .
But what we are saying is that we should have some basic protections from insurance company abuses and that in order for us to do that , we are going to have to make some changes in the status quo that we ’ve been debating for a year . ”
It went on and on with the overmatched Fox Newser trying desperately to make Obama look like the dictator / raging socialist that his network portrays him as , while Obama kept chugging along and selling healthcare reform .
Obama excels in these kinds of situations .
Unlike George W. Bush , he thrives off of a hostile audience .
Why have n’t the Republicans realized that they are playing right into President Obama ’s hands ?
Fox News provided Obama with the perfect sounding board to bring healthcare home successfully .
You would think that at some point the GOP and Fox News would realize that they are helping Obama every time that they feebly challenge him .
Sign language : week 92
Another selection of strange signs sent in by readers on their travels .
Google has just announced that they will now begin factoring page speed in their search algorithm rankings .
That means the faster a website loads , the higher up they show up in Google searches .
Sluggish sites on the other hand will be knocked down the search rankings even if they have the most relevant information .
While I believe that Google ’s latest actions are rational and that it serves consumer interests since no one wants a slow results , it does raise an interesting dilemma for “ Network Neutrality ” advocates who propagate the myth that all websites should operate at the same speed .
One of the key principles propagated by Net Neutrality advocates is this idea that all websites should run at the same speed over the Internet .
For example ; Megan Tady of Save The Internet ( Free Press ) wrote :
“ Net Neutrality ” is the basic principle that keeps the Internet free from corporate control .
It means that companies like Comcast , Verizon and AT&T cannot block or control content on the Web , and that all Web sites and applications download and upload at the same speeds .
In other words , any blog , video or Web site that I create will travel at the same speed as something produced by the mammoth media conglomerates . ”
FCC Commissioner Michael Copps echoed similar concerns when he said :
“ Can you tell me that minority and women ’s voices on the Internet are getting through to major audiences — really being heard — like the big corporate sites ? ”
Last week when I appeared on a panel at CommNexus , I posed the question if the small website paying $ 50 / month ( like this website ) should have the same speed and capacity as large mega sites that pay $ 1 million / month for Internet connectivity .
Philip Baker ( who I debated in January and since found to be a very personable nice guy ) responded yes because he feels that small websites should run at the same speed as large websites .
Fellow panelist Jon Healey of the LA Times raised similar sentiments that big Hollywood studios hate Net Neutrality and love prioritized networks because it will shut out the little guy from movie distribution .
While these sentiments of equality are extremely popular and people want them to be true even if they are n’t , we ca n’t base policy on a fantasy world .
Free Press , Baker , and Healey should explain when in the history of the Internet has there ever been a time that the “ little guy ” can have same Internet connectivity as the large corporation ?
Which Internet Service Provider will provide me a $ 50 / month service that gives me the same Internet connectivity as Amazon.com or Facebook.com ?
And if this type of high speed low cost service existed , why would Amazon or Facebook continue to pay hundreds of thousands of times more for Internet connectivity ?
ISPs are not the gatekeepers of visibility and never have been
The reality is that the Internet has been a revolutionary technology that has empowered the little guy , but not for the reasons Free Press and others neutrality advocates think .
The Internet is n’t the great equalizer because it gives equal access to Internet connectivity regardless of the price ; it ’s the great equalizer because it is cheap enough that equality does n’t matter .
We are in an unprecedented era of publishing where $ 50 / month of server hosting allows anyone to publish 20 million page views per month ( assuming 1000 GB usage at 50 KB per page view ) .
Rapidly improving technology and falling prices are the same reason that an $ 800 digital SLR camera can shoot better quality movies than the $ 100,000 camera 10 years ago .
We are in an unprecedented era of video broadcasting when anyone with a $ 200 camera can distribute “ HD ” 1080P video to the entire world for free using services like Google YouTube .
This idea that the little guy is shut out if we permit premium service Internet connectivity ( how it has always been ) is simply nonsense .
$ 50 / month for 20 million page views and free video distribution via YouTube destroys any notion that the Internet Service Providers and network operators are the gatekeepers of the Internet .
Network performance still a small factor in visibility
Search has always been the biggest factor on Internet visibility and it is ironic that Net Neutrality advocates have always conveniently ignored this aspect .
Every webpage owner knows that if their site does n’t show up on the first page of a Google search , they might as well be invisible to most of the world .
Even with Google ’s search rankings based on site speed , network performance still plays a minimum role in visibility on the Internet .
Good servers and good software developers from quality universities ( which Google , Facebook , and Microsoft seem to always have first dibs on ) , both of which cost a lot more than Internet connectivity play a much larger role in the performance of a webpage .
Far more important to search rankings is the quality of the content .
On YouTube where Google pays for the servers and bandwidth , the cost of servers and bandwidth become non-factors .
Having a cute or silly looking animal or being endowed with good humor or good cleavage , or having the ability to pay good writers and good actors plays the most important role in gaining viewers .
The ability to pay an Internet Service Provider is the least significant factor in Internet visibility and it illustrates why the obsession with network equality in Net Neutrality has been a red herring all along .
Habitat for Humanity volunteers spent more than a year building seven homes for disadvantaged families in San Francisco 's Bayview neighborhood .
In one night , a band of thieves managed to deflate their altruistic spirit .
Workers putting the final touches on homes at Whitney Young Circle and Hudson Avenue arrived one morning last week to find that burglars had looted 17 brand - new refrigerators , ovens and dishwashers , worth a total of more than $ 10,000 .
Erin Colton , Habitat 's site manager , has worked on the project since ground was broken in January 2009 .
" When you come that far and put that much work into these homes and into this community , " she said , " it 's heartbreaking .
Defeating .
Demoralizing . "
Heartbreaking because the first homeowners are scheduled to move in next week .
Defeating because this marks the second time thieves have sacked the site , and demoralizing because it 's clear the burglars scouted the location for days , possibly weeks .
" Who steals from Habitat homes ? " Colton asked .
" If they knew what these homes were for and who they served ... "
3,000 volunteers
The nonprofit relies on volunteers and donations to build affordable housing for local residents in an attempt to " break the cycle of poverty through affordable homeownership . "
For the Whitney Young project , more than 3,000 local volunteers logged sweat equity .
Phillip Kilbridge , executive director of the local Habitat chapter , said he was hesitant to ask Whirlpool , which donates appliances to the homes nationwide , to supply replacements .
Site manager Colton said new appliances in boxes were stolen from garages of three of the homes late last year .
Thieves with expertise
This time , all the appliances were installed , but the thieves broke back windows to get inside and expertly detached gas lines to pull out the ranges .
They also removed dishwashers and refrigerators from their kitchen ports , and pulled out washers and dryers .
Police believe the job would have taken several people using a moving truck at least an hour to pull off .
Kilbridge said he 's been keeping an eye on Craigslist for the Energy Star model appliances .
" We 're hopeful they turn up , but we 're not yet optimistic , " he said .
" We 're hoping to find these appliances by the grace of God . "
Habitat has lost other items at the Whitney Young Circle project .
Burglars have plucked copper tubing and electrical lines , and vandals have thrown the occasional rock through windows .
Chasing a robber
Then there was the day volunteers took a lunch break across the street at Hilltop Park and watched a man jump out of a car , run into the tool storage container and run back out with a jackhammer under each arm .
Volunteers dropped their sandwiches and chased the man , retrieving one of the jackhammers , Colton said .
" It 's the worst part of the job , " she said .
" Everything else is great and inspiring . "
Vale Larson , a laid - off architect in training , has spent about 30 hours a week volunteering at the Bayview site while he looks for a new job .
He was covered in specks of paint Tuesday .
" As a volunteer , you have an investment in the home , " he said .
" And you feel sorry for the homeowner and their sense of security in the area . "
Colton suspects someone familiar with the construction business played a role in the heist .
The removal was too quick and clean for amateurs , she said .
She 's not convinced the thieves live in the neighborhood .
" I 'm really taken by how many neighbors drop by to say , ' You 're doing a great job , keep up the great work , ' " Colton said .
" This is their neighborhood .
...
But somebody who 's looking to make a quick buck does n't care who they 're stealing from . "

White explains why UFC ’s production team will run the WEC PPV in Sacramento | Home | Miserable crowds at Rogers Centre for Toronto Blue Jay games gives UFC unique chance to make their case »
By Zach Arnold | April 20 , 2010
I figured I would quote Dave Meltzer here from his radio show today since he tries to give a fair take on what is happening right now and what the company mindset is within Strikeforce .
“ Strikeforce , it was a 1.8 rating … and … it ’s … you know , I mean … it was n’t , you know , after talking to a lot of people today including people there ( at the show ) , it was certainly disappointing .
It was not disastrous .
They have done worse , you know when they did the show from Stockton and it did come back from that …
Will they do it ?
You know …
CBS is going to have to make the call .
I mean there ’s , it ’s not a sure thing either way .
It ’s not like , ‘ Oh my God , they ’re dead for sure ! ’
They have n’t informed , certainly no one in Strikeforce knows that they ’re dead .
And they have n’t been , I mean just based on talking to people and everything like that today , they ’re not acting like it ’s a dead thing .
There are signs that are positive that they ’ll probably do another show in the fall .
You know one of the things that you know was brought up to me was that you know realistically in another day or two , no one ’s going to talk about that brawl again and certainly by Saturday you know it ’ll be a dead subject .
Now the rating , you know , again , the rating was more important thing than the brawl and the rating was n’t good , but it ’s also the learning thing in the sense that we know that with the right match , we can do a good demo play with MMA .
We also now know for sure that with you know that Dan Henderson is not the right and Jake Shields was not the right match and that unless we have the right match , you really do n’t want to do this show .
You ca n’t just do the show and go like , ‘ We got this card with all these guys that are like ranked and this and that or this match is you look on paper and go on paper we got a good show so we ’ll have exciting fights and people will tune in . ’
It ’s not that .
There ’s no , all you got is star power and the problem of course with Strikeforce is there ’s not a lot of that star power there .
I mean , maybe Herschel Walker ?
And that ’s not a lock .
Gina Carano ?
Probably , probably …
Fedor for sure , but God knows what you know …
Fedor and Strikeforce do not have a deal for another fight right now and it ’s you know the situation is what the situation is , it ’s um … it ’s impossible to do deals with those guys you know and so you ’re kind of being held under a barrel by that thing .
Stealing someone from UFC is probably not going to happen , I do n’t see anyone from UFC at this point in time going , “ Yeah , I want to jump on CBS , I want to jump on bandwagon . ”
If anything , people right now would be scared to make that move .
Arlovski’s not the guy , you know , no matter , you know , he ’s just not that guy .
So , um , I suppose they could do a Cyborg / Carano re-match ?
And that actually would work but the problem is there then , you know , you ’re going to have the same massacre more likely than not . ”
' Super - Taser ' shotgun bullet that can knock down criminals from 100ft assessed by Home Office
For the bobby who wants to dish out a little more shock and awe , help could soon be at hand .
A ' super Taser ' with a range five times longer than the conventional version is being considered for police use .
The powerful stun gun fires a 500 - volt projectile into a suspect from up to 100 ft away .
Threatening :
The electronic Taser bullet is fired from a regular shotgun and can incapacitate criminals from 100 feet
[ caption ]
The barbed electrode propelled out of the gun delivers a shock lasting 20 seconds - four times longer than the Tasers currently in use .
The Extended Range Electronic Projectile weapons , which are already used in the US , are being evaluated by the Home Office for British police forces .
Conventional Tasers fire barbs attached by 21ft long wires .
They deliver a shock of 50,000 volts for five seconds , although an officer can hold down the trigger to incapacitate a target for longer .
[ caption ]
But the latest weapon operates more like a conventional shotgun .
It fires wireless rounds which can stop a suspect from 100 ft away .
Barbs hook into the skin or clothing and deliver a 20 - second shock .
The modified shotgun is capable of firing five such ' bullets ' .
If the suspect tries to pull the device off , ' reflex engagement electrodes ' automatically send another shock through the subject 's hand .
Footage of the device being used on volunteers shows them groaning in pain , their muscles in spasms as they slump to the floor .
On the Discovery Channel 's Future Weapons programme , one was asked how the shock had felt .
' Like my toes curled back to touch my behind , ' he said .
' There 's no way I could fight through that . '
But critics fear the ' super Taser ' , could cause serious injuries .
Amnesty International claims 334 people in the US died between 2001 and 2008 after being hit by electroshock weapons .
Spokesman Oliver Sprague said : ' Amnesty would be very alarmed if the Home Office were to consider authorising this weapon to police officers in the UK . '
But its manufacturer , Taser , said there was no evidence linking Tasers to any deaths .
Conventional Tasers have been used in around 6,000 incidents in England and Wales since they were introduced in 2004 .
A Home Office spokesman said : ' The Government and the police have no current plans to introduce XREP Tasers into service .
' The Home Office Scientific Development Branch is considering the XREP as part of its on - going remit to evaluate new technologies . '
In an effort to convince skeptical Europeans to support the NATO - led war effort in Afghanistan , the CIA is calling for the recruitment of Afghan women to act as public relations ambassadors , according to a document leaked Friday .
" Afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing " the mission for European audiences , according to a CIA report posted on whistleblower Web site WikiLeaks .
The report , dated March 11 , suggested that the views of Afghan women , with " their aspirations for the future and fears of a Taliban victory , " would help garner backing for the Afghan war in Europe , particularly in countries like Germany and France where support is waning .
The report cites the recent fall of the Dutch government over its troop commitment as proof of the " fragility " of European support .
" The tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in French or German casualties or in Afghan civilian casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal , " the report said .
Germany and France maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in Afghanistan .
A focus on Germany
Among other things , the document says marketing efforts and media exposure in Germany could emphasize how an international retreat could be damaging to the country 's welfare .
" For example , messages that illustrate how a defeat in Afghanistan could heighten Germany 's exposure to terrorism , opium and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics , " the report said .
The Central Intelligence Agency would n't confirm or deny whether the document was genuine .
The non-profit WikiLeaks , which offers a forum for anonymously posted confidential documents , has in the past been named as a threat to military operations and US security , according to Britain 's Daily Telegraph .

Type -Level Programming Example
On Reddit , someone asked the following question :
Some time ago , Paczesiowa wrote a comment that claimed : you can have a function that accepts only prime number of arguments , that are all strings , but occurences of integers at the indixes that are fibonacci numbers
Type - level programming is something that interests me but so far I have only done it in C ++.
So , here it is in C++ , what does it look like in Haskell ?
Okay , good question .
What does that look like in Haskell ?
The following code is not pretty .
It also gives truly awful error messages .
This is n’t a practical technique ; it ’s just exploring the capabilities of the language for fun .
Edit :
Here ’s a working version , using techniques demonstrated by jputnam on the Reddit thread .
The original code follows .

Much of the problem deals with the number and indices of parameters to a function , so here we deal with that subtlety .
Because of currying , the line between the " parameters " and the " result " types of functions in Haskell are blurred .
We draw that line with a newtype wrapper , Result .
The piece of the function that ought to be viewed as the result type must be enclosed in the Result type wrapper .
-} newtype Result a = Result { unResult :: a } deriving Show type family NumParams f type instance NumParams ( Result a ) = Zero type instance NumParams ( p -> x ) = Succ ( NumParams x ) {-
We now define the concept of a function whose fibonacci - numbered parameters are integers , and whose non-fibonacci - numbered parameters are strings .
In order to make functions of this form definable , we include a general fold for constructing the values .
-} class FibParamed f r where fibfold :: a -> ( String -> a -> a ) -> ( Int -> a -> a ) -> ( a -> r ) -> f instance FibParamed ( Result r ) r where fibfold a fs fz g = Result ( g a ) instance ( FibParamed f r , IsFib ( NumParams f ) ~ HTrue ) => FibParamed ( Int -> f ) r where fibfold a fs fz g z = fibfold ( fz z a ) fs fz g instance ( FibParamed f r , IsFib ( NumParams f ) ~ HFalse ) => FibParamed ( String -> f ) r where fibfold a fs fz g s = fibfold ( fs s a ) fs fz g {-
We now add the condition that the number of parameters is prime , giving us the final type .
-} type WackyType r = ( FibParamed f r , Prime ( NumParams f ) ~ HTrue ) => f
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- {-
Here is the test function , defined in terms of the earlier fold .
-} test :: WackyType String test = fibfold [ ] ( flip ( ++ ) . ( : [ ] ) ) ( flip ( ++ ) . ( : [ ] ) . show ) ( intercalate " , " ) {-
And a main function to test it .
Note that we do need to be explicit about types here .
-} main = do let t1 = unResult ( test ( 5:: Int ) ( 6:: Int ) :: Result String ) let t2 = unResult ( test " hi " ( 6:: Int ) ( 7:: Int ) ( 8:: Int ) ( 9:: Int ) :: Result String ) -- let t3 = unResult ( test ( 5:: Int ) :: Result String ) -- let t4 = unResult ( test " hello " " world " :: Result String ) print t1 print t2 -- print t3 -- print t4
Original post :
It turns out I got most of the way there .
Specifically , I am able to declare a function which :
Accepts only a prime number of arguments .
Accepts integers at argument positions that are fibonacci numbers .
Accepts string or integers at positions that are not fibonacci numbers .
It ’s certain that there is some way to accomplish that , because the type system is , after all , Turing complete .
However , I ’m unable to figure it out at the moment .
Perhaps someone else can step in and help .

To handle the more complex requirements coming up , we really need general type - level arithmetic functions .

Writing the predicate here is unusually tricky for me .
Perhaps because I am missing some basic concept ; but I think it 's because the " or " logical connective is difficult to express in type - level programming .
In any case , I can write a NotFib connective ... which is unusual , but it works .
Even this is ugly : I rely on the property F_n > n , which is true for n > 5 , which means I need to special case lower numbers .

Now for the final goal :
We define ' wackyfunc ' , which is the function we are building .
-} wackyfunc :: WackyFunction f String => f wackyfunc = wackyfold " " ( flip ( ++ ) ) ( flip ( flip ( ++ ) . show ) ) {-
This wrapper around the result prevents some ambiguities that I think are actually problems in the spec itself .
( Specifically , what happens if the result type is itself a function .
If the result type is made explicit , then this could be removed . ) -} newtype Result a = Result { unResult :: a } deriving Show {-
We now build another type function that converts a type - level integer n to an n-ary function time , provided n is prime .
This is the first type class that actually has a member .
The member is just a generic fold , which we can use to implement functions of this type .
-} class WackyFunction f x where wackyfold :: x -> ( x -> String -> x ) -> ( x -> Int -> x ) -> f instance ( Prime ( NumParams f ) , HasFibProp f x ) =>
WackyFunction f x where wackyfold = fibfold {-
Here is our type function to count parameters .
You can clearly see how it would be ambiguous without the Result wrapper .
-} type family NumParams f type instance NumParams ( Result a ) = Zero type instance NumParams ( String -> x ) = Succ ( NumParams x ) type instance NumParams ( Int -> x ) = Succ ( NumParams x ) {-
Finally , here we have the class that actually builds the parameter list .
Again , we provide a generic fold to handle it .
-} class HasFibProp f x where fibfold :: x -> ( x -> String -> x ) -> ( x -> Int -> x ) -> f instance HasFibProp ( Result a ) a where fibfold s f g = Result s instance ( HasFibProp f a , IsFib ( NumParams f ) ) => HasFibProp ( Int -> f ) a where fibfold s f g n = fibfold ( g s n ) f g instance ( HasFibProp f a , NotFib ( NumParams f ) ) => HasFibProp ( String -> f ) a where fibfold s f g t = fibfold ( f s t ) f g
A Facebook game with more than 9 million users has been caught serving ads that try to trick viewers into installing malware .
Hundreds of users of Farm Town have reported seeing the ads , which falsely claim the user 's PC is infected and can only be fixed by buying and running the anti-virus software being advertised , according to this forum .
Farm Town developer SlashKey warned users to ignore the ads but failed to suspend third - party adverts , much to the anger of security experts .
" It may not be Farm Town 's fault that a third - party advertising network is serving up malicious ads , but doing anything less is surely showing a careless disregard for the safety of its players , " wrote Graham Cluley , a senior technology consultant at Sophos .
" Until the makers of Farm Town resolve the problem of malicious adverts , my advice to its fans would be to stop playing the game and ensure that their computer is properly defended with up - to - date security software . "
Rogue AV software like that advertised to Farm Town players has proved to be a bane to computer users .
Such titles generate billions of dollars per year in revenue to fraudsters , while stealing credit card data and often planting backdoors on end - user 's machines .
Over the years , The New York Times , MySpace , and scores of other sites have been caught serving ads that try to trick viewers into believing their machines are infected , often by displaying mock hard drive scans with a list of malicious files detected .
The ads are usually the work of fly - by - night advertisers who trick advertising networks into distributing the sham banner ads .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
In a sign it is concerned about Main Street anger over bankers ’ compensation , Goldman Sachs Group Inc decided to give its CEO Lloyd Blankfein and other top executives lower bonuses than many had expected .
Lloyd Blankfein , Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs , participates in a panel discussion at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York September 23 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Chip East
Goldman , which reported a record profit for 2009 , will pay the executives bonuses in stock worth $ 9 million each , far below what they got in the previous record profit year of 2007 .
Blankfein received $ 67.9 million for that year .
The bonus , which was less than the roughly $ 16 million that rival bank JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was rewarded with earlier in the day , was far below the $ 100 million that at least one British newspaper had predicted .
The decision follows months of criticism of Goldman , partly because of expectations that its soaring profits would lead to massive bonuses just over a year after it was aided by the government through bailout funds and other financial support .
Blankfein ’s bonus is such that he will not even be among the highest paid people at Goldman , the firm he has run since 2006 .
Star traders and bankers within Goldman ’s ranks will almost certainly be receiving more .
“ He is going to have a lot of people two levels below him who are making more than he does , ” said Alan Johnson , a Wall Street Compensation consultant .
Blankfein ’s bonus is an increase from last year , when he did not take one .
He received a base salary of $ 600,000 for 2009 .
The firm made it clear in a statement that external pressures had contributed to the decision .
“ The firm produced very good results for 2009 , but the environment is very difficult and the board was mindful of that difficult environment in making decisions about executive compensation , ” Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag said .
Blankfein , along with President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn and Chief Financial Officer David Viniar , received 58,381 stock units , worth $ 8.99 million based on Friday ’s closing share price .
The units do not convert into shares until 2011 at the earliest , and once converted they cannot be sold or transferred before January 2015 , according to the filing .
It was not immediately clear whether the reserved stock could be used as collateral for loans .
‘ WAY BELOW THE MARKET ’
The smaller than expected pay packages were the latest sign of how Goldman has sought to soften its image after being excoriated by some commentators and politicians for reaping huge profits after benefiting from various forms of government help .
Blankfein , himself , has found himself in the spotlight time and again during the past year , most notably after he told London ’s Sunday Times newspaper in November that banks serve a social purpose and are doing “ God ’s work . ”
The backlash against Goldman has fueled efforts in Washington to enact reforms against the banking industry and to crack down on banker pay .
But Goldman has answered critics in recent months by announcing top managers would be paid no cash , all stock bonuses , and by surprisingly capping its compensation pool at $ 16.2 billion for the year -- well short of the $ 20 billion record set in 2007 .
It has also made larger charitable contributions than in other years .
“ He has quickly gotten religion in terms of being responsive to the ill populist winds that are blowing in his face , ” said David Dietze , chief investment officer at Point View Financial Services , a Goldman Sachs shareholder .
“ The citizenry is just outraged that these companies , which took TARP , so quickly turned around and forgot their humble bailouts and are showering themselves with cash . ”
Goldman received and later repaid a $ 10 billion taxpayer from the U.S. Treasury ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program , but also benefited from the rescue of its counterparts , including American International Group Inc , and through cheap borrowing from the Federal Reserve .
If Goldman has managed its way through a difficult year in terms of public relations , some are convinced that 2009 bonuses will be a mere blip for the firm known for its payouts .
“ They got paid pretty well the past couple of years , so maybe they can just pay themselves less well this year , then maybe it blows over in a year or two and they can start paying themselves pretty handsomely again , ” said Blake Howells , director of equity research at Becker Capital in Portland , Oregon .
He called the pay amount “ small and pretty restrictive . ”
Dimon ’s bonus was in a mixture of restricted shares and options , and he did not take a cash bonus .
Goldman Sachs shares closed up 2.3 percent on Friday at $ 154.16 .

WARNING !!!!
LONG POST AHEAD !!!!
As most of you know , Amelia is the one who does the majority of the posts on our blog .
Well , the time has come for me , Justin , to post once again .
As many of you know , I had the fortunate , life - changing opportunity of going to Haiti recently .
I spent two and a half of the most intense and rewarding weeks of my life there , and I happened to have my camera with me .
The following photos will help tell some of the stories that I wish to share with you .
My love for Haiti goes back to 1996 , when I went there for a couple of years to do missionary work .
Prior to arriving in Haiti for the first time , I knew very little .
I had heard about their vodou , the refugees fleeing to Florida and The Serpent and the Rainbow , but these vague labels tell very little of the Haitian people , the Haitian spirit , or the REAL Haiti that I would soon fall in love with .
Spending those young years of adulthood , in the service of the Haitian people , changed me and left an impression that would prove to last throughout my life .
I fell in love .
I fell in love with HAITI !
I fell in love with the Haitians !
I learned the language , Haitian Creole , and fell in love with their culture , their stories , their proverbs , their laughs , their smiles , their love , and their spirit .
It is a spirit of humility , of giving , of resilience , and of a love for God .
Since '98 when I came back from my missionary work there , I have returned a few times .
As you saw in a few posts back , I was even able to take Amelia there with me for a few weeks , so she could see where my love for Haiti and the amazing Haitians came from .
She now sees what I see , why I call Haiti my second home .
As the world now knows , Haiti experienced a crippling blow on January 12th .
The earth violently shook beneath what was already the poorest country in the western hemisphere , leaving a scar so deep that more than 200,000 people were left dead , a million now homeless , and an estimated 17 Billion dollars worth of damage !
For the first few days after the quake , I was literally glued to the tv in shock as I took in any and all information about the quake that I could find .
I was horrified and felt helpless !
I wanted to be there and I wanted to help .
I needed to be there !
I needed to help !
Long story short , while I was in Park City for Sundance , I found a group called the Utah Hospital Task Force that was planning a trip to Haiti .
They were planning on taking 150 people - 50 Haitian Creole translators , 50 medical professionals and 50 construction professionals .
The only problem was the group was scheduled to leave while I was still at Sundance .
I applied on the outside chance that I would get accepted , and would figure it out from there .
I got accepted , and I had yet to ask Amelia 's permission .
I figured I 'd try my chances at acceptance first , and if that day came I would see what she thought , knowing there would be many willing and ready to take my place were I to decline .
Amelia is the sweetest , most compassionate and supportive wife of all time .
She had the heart and the strength to allow me to go , while she stayed behind with our children , uncertain of what I was about to embark upon .
These photographs tell that story , of the two and a half weeks that I spent in Haiti !
On the flight over there , two of the female translators seated behind me were holding hands .
The girl on the right is Haitian , and the girl on the left is American .
A telling sign of what was to come .
We had 20 Pizza Hut pizzas delivered to us on the runway in Florida by a police escort , which was what the 82nd Airborne wanted in exchange to allow us to camp with them on one of the nicest soccer fields in Haiti !
The power of pizza in a foreign country !
This was taken at 1 am the night we landed on that Sun Country plane in Haiti !
Thank you Sun Country !
This was our campsite .
It was literally one of , if not THE , nicest place we could 've camped in Haiti .
Our group referred to it frequently as the Taj Majal .
The oldest girl in this picture was left to care for her younger siblings while their parents went out for the day to try and work .
I love how content she was at taking on this responsibility .
This photo gets me .
More pictures of the kids .
I LOVE the Haitian children .
They melt my heart .
This was just one of the many " tent cities " that I saw in Haiti .
They were always growing in number as the days went on .
Notice they 're actually not tents , but sheets strung across four branch posts .
These orphan kids seriously made me laugh .
They were so full of life and laughter .
They never complained ever .
In fact no one did .
I wanted to take them all home with me !
This lady found an open spot of ground to lay her mat on for the night .
This was in the courtyard of one of the LDS church buildings there .
What was a parking lot in a church 's courtyard by day , turned in to a camping spot at night .
They had between 200-300 people sleeping in here every night .
With no where else to go , this was their best option .
The man on the right is Steve Studdert !
He was the leader of our group , and one of the men responsible for putting our group together .
He worked some serious magic and was a pleasure to serve under !
Here he is meeting two of the captains of the 82nd Airborne plotting our days treks .
This is what remains of the country 's nursing school !
I helped translate the story of one of the students who was going to school here .
Her teacher did n't show up during an afternoon class period , so she felt prompted to return home .
During her few moments at home , the earthquake struck , killing most of the students and instructors who remained at the school .
Her story was sobering and touching .
There 's something so telling of our time in Haiti in this photo .
This doctor was sitting just inside the operating room at the General Hospital in downtown Port - Au -Prince .
I spent most of my time translating for the doctors and nurses in the hospitals .
This picture was taken inside the pediatric tent at the University of Miami tent hospital that was near the airport .
This kid was so fun to talk to and hang out with .
His spirit was admirable , and you 'd never know that he had a broken leg .
These triplets were born just after the earthquake .
I had to learn how to say triplets , because that is something I never encountered in any of my trips to Haiti .
" Gad Bless You " it says on this cast .
The intention is there ...
I LOVE the look on this girl 's face !
She is soooooo excited to be up on her feet again .
You can only imagine what it must be or feel like to think that you 'll never be on your feet again .
Physical Therapy is something they need way more of in Haiti !
This guy was one of my heroes !!!
He was buried for 2 days after the earthquake .
He was getting ready to go in to surgery here in this picture and was literally telling me that he was n't afraid of anything .
He kept saying , " you can stick me with needles , cut me up , whatever you want .
Nothing can hurt me !
I made it out alive ! "
Once again , never a complaint .
Only words of thanks , gratitude , hope and LIFE !
One of the children in the pediatric tent did n't make it while I was there .
It was a surreal , sad and haunting moment .
Immediately after the residents in the tent caught word of it they instantly took to prayer , praise and thanks !
Not the reaction you would normally expect .
This lady was singing a hymn of praise .
This is the dear father of the girl that did n't make it .
This really affected me , especially since we had to help this man understand what had just happened .
Here he is giving a prayer of thanks to God that his daughter was able to be with him for the time that she was , and asking for her to be taken into His arms .
It was a sobering moment , and made me instantly think of Hudson and Sloan - my own children .
What if I were in his shoes ?
Would I be that strong ?
Would I be able to stand there and give thanks when the Lord hath taken away ???
My heart broke for this man .
These transporters in the hospital took a moment to pray and give thanks .
It was amazing to see their hearts instantly turn to God .
Here is just two of the many people that I saw that had been given some sort of relief .
The lady on the left had received a 100 lb bag of rice that had obviously come from the US , and the lady on the left has a sack full of little bags of water .
Here is Steve , one of our translators , and a local leader as we were heading in to a tent city at a French school that had yet to see any medical help since the earthquake .
At the tent city for thousands of people that I mentioned in the prior photo , these people are all in line in the hopes of receiving a small , 12 oz bag of water .
It was tricky and demanding at times to organize the chaos .
Here is a boy receiving medical attention at the clinic we had set up for the day at the tent city .
I love the look on his face .
It was amazing to see how helpful the Scouts were to us at this tent city !
Here they were living in a tent city , but yet they took care of their uniforms and wore them with pride !
They would literally help us secure perimeters and then go out into the tent city seeking the injured and afflicted and help them come receive help and care !
They definitely gave Scouts a good name .
I 'm proud to be an Eagle Scout !
I love this photo of a grandmother with grandson as he receives care for his painful foot wound .
Justin Bowen , our group photographer from Las Vegas where he currently shoots for the Las Vegas Sun , playing some basketball with locals at the tent city .
It made them so happy to have us there helping them and playing with them .
LOVE the look of these two women in different generations !
The one on the left was on a tap tap ( the public transportation in Haiti ) , and the girl on the right was at one of the largest tent cities up in Petionville .
Steve , Dr. Kirk and Brent analyzing the situation at the adult tent at the University of Miami 's tent hospital .
You 'll notice the civil war like status of the conditions .
The medical volunteers for the University of Miami hospital slept in here .
They would typically be on for 12 hours and then off for 12 hours .
You can only imagine that their conditions back home would seem paradisiacal in comparison .
Talk about selfless , amazing people doing selfless amazing things !!!
Sean Penn and Lt General Keen , a 3 star General .
Sean Penn had been in Haiti since the earthquake with the JPHRO ( Jenkins Penn Haiti Relief Organization ) .
Hats off to him for being there on the ground since the quake doing work !
This is a room in the General Hospital downtown that was no longer safe to be in .
Look at this photo .
Not sure I 'd want to be a patient in there even prior to the earthquake .
To show the spirit and resilience of the Haitian people , this little girl had to have her arm amputated and yet here she is getting water , and doing chores without a single complaint .
She even talked to me while smiling .
This lady was at the General Hospital downtown .
She is 106 years old !!!
This little boy had a smile sooooo contagious that it made everyone that looked at him light up .
His mother is in the foreground of this picture and I 've never seen a kid bring so much joy to a mother .
It was so comforting to see her love and affection for her child keep her mind off of her amputated right arm .
In the foreground is the bandage .
Again , she never complained and was too taken in by the joy of her child !
What remains of the National Palace .
Take a minute just to digest the devastation and destruction in this picture !
It is INSANE !
This was a typical neighborhood in Port - au - Prince .
The imagination and creativity of the Haitian children is inspiring .
Here they are in a tent city , yet they found sticks , string and plastic to make a kite with and they could n't be happier !
I especially love his pink sandals .
He 's just happy to be alive !
This girl 's story will melt your heart and make you mad at the same time !
I became really close with her and her parents .
If you would like to hear her story , make sure you ask me next time you see me .
It is too intense to put up here on the blog .
She had to have both of her feet amputated .
It was hard delivering that message to her and her parents .
Not the expression you 'd expect to see from someone that had just had the surgery performed the day prior .
An impromptu group of people singing hymns of praise while we visited the Presidential Palace which you can see in the background .
I love the juxtaposition of this picture .
An aerial view of the national Palace and the park in front of it that has now become a tent city .
Any open space that people can find has now been turned into a tent city .
Steve Studdert and Captain Reyes on our last night in Haiti .
Captain Reyes and the 82nd Airborne were sad to see us leave .
I will admit , we were all saddened to be leaving them and the Haitians as well .
A self - portrait taken inside the airport .
This was one of the mirrored doors that had shattered .
The airport is unoccupied and all of the operations are being ran outside , which was quite loud to say the least .
Our group saying goodbye to the 82nd Airborne after they dropped us off at the airport .
It was such a blessing and a comfort to be able to stay with them .
Upon arriving in Florida , one of our leaders John Nichols had McDonalds waiting for all of us .
After having a diet of granola bars for breakfast and lunch and MREs for dinner for over two weeks , McDonalds ( which I normally am disgusted by ) had never sounded or tasted so good !
Words will never be able to truly describe the impact this trip has had on me .
It was one of the most intense , emotional , draining , rewarding , tiring and amazing things I have ever done !
I will always remember it and I cannot wait to return .
I have to say a HUGE thank you to everyone that donated to our group and to my trip !
It was seriously life - changing and for this I am grateful .
In the words of Steve Studdert about our group : " we recently formed the largest non-military emergency aid task force to Haiti .
I was privileged to be part of that team of extraordinary human beings who accomplished remarkable feats of heroism and service in Haiti .
Countless were the broken lives blessed by this magnificent team of gifted medical professionals , indispensible Creole - speaking returned missionary translators , and knowledgeable construction specialists .
Our brothers and sisters in Haiti were experiencing incomprehensible suffering in what one U.N. official termed the worst human catastrophe in recorded history .
With determination , compassion , unity , and a respect for the dignity of every Haitian , the team engaged their innovation , skills , and resources to bless those in Haiti who are hurt , homeless , and hungry .
Our ability to serve came , to a great extent , from the freedom we enjoy in North America to make a difference , the freedom to act independently , to make our own decisions as to where and how we give of ourselves and our money .
Our abundance , born of the American can - do spirit in our free society , made it possible .
President Franklin D. Roosevelt once said , ' The test of our progress is not whether we add to the abundance of those who have much .
It is whether we provide enough to those who have little . '
Hopefully we added something to those in Haiti who have so very little . "

Call to improve browser caching
Over Christmas break I wrote Santa my browser wishlist .
There was one item I neglected to ask for : improvements to the browser disk cache .
In 2007 Tenni Theurer and I ran an experiment to measure browser cache stats from the server side .
Tenni ’s write up , Browser Cache Usage – Exposed , is the stuff of legend .
There she reveals that while 80 % of page views were done with a primed cache , 40 - 60 % of unique users hit the site with an empty cache at least once per day .
40 - 60 % seems high , but I ’ve heard similar numbers from respected web devs at other major sites .
Why do so many users have an empty cache at least once per day ?
I ’ve been racking my brain for years trying to answer this question .
Here are some answers I ’ve come up with :
first time users – Yea , but not 40 - 60 % .
– Yea , but not 40 - 60 % .
cleared cache –
It ’s true : more and more people are likely using anti-virus software that clears the cache between browser sessions .
And since we ran that experiment back in 2007 many browsers have added options for clearing the cache frequently ( for example , Firefox ’s privacy.clearOnShutdown.cache option ) .
But again , this does n’t account for the 40 - 60 % number .

But again , this does n’t account for the 40 - 60 % number .
flawed experiment –
It turns out there was a flaw in the experiment ( browsers ignore caching headers when an image is in memory ) , but this would only affect the 80 % number , not the 40 - 60 % number .
And I expect the impact on the 80 % number is small , given the fact that other folks have gotten similar numbers .
( In a future blog post I ’ll share a new experiment design I ’ve been working on . )

( In a future blog post I ’ll share a new experiment design I ’ve been working on . ) resources got evicted – hmmmmm
OK , let ’s talk about eviction for a minute .
The two biggest influencers for a resource getting evicted are the size of the cache and the eviction algorithm .
It turns out , the amount of disk space used for caching has n’t kept pace with the size of people ’s drives and their use of the Web .
Here are the default disk cache sizes for the major browsers :
Internet Explorer : 8-50 MB
Firefox : 50 MB
Safari : everything I found said there is n’t a max size setting ( ???)
Chrome : < 80 MB ( varies depending on available disk space )
Opera : 20 MB
Those defaults are too small .
My disk drive is 150 GB of which 120 GB is free .
I ’d gladly give up 5 GB or more to raise the odds of web pages loading faster .
Even with more disk space , the cache is eventually going to fill up .
When that happens , cached resources need to be evicted to make room for the new ones .
Here ’s where eviction algorithms come into play .
Most eviction algorithms are LRU - based – the resource that was least recently used is evicted .
However , our knowledge of performance pain points has grown dramatically in the last few years .
Translating this knowledge into eviction algorithm improvements makes sense .
For example , we ’re all aware how much costlier it is to download a script than an image .
( Scripts block other downloads and rendering . )
Scripts , therefore , should be given a higher priority when it comes to caching .
It ’s hard to get access to gather browser disk cache stats , so I ’m asking people to discover their own settings and share them via the Browser Disk Cache Survey form .
I included this in my talks at JSConf and jQueryConf .
~ 150 folks at those conferences filled out the form .
The data shows that 55 % of people surveyed have a cache that ’s over 90 % full .
( Caveats : this is a small sample size and the data is self - reported . )
It would be great if you would take time to fill out the form .
I ’ve also started writing instructions for finding your cache settings .
I ’m optimistic about the potential speedup that could result from improving browser caching , and fortunately browser vendors seem receptive ( for example , the recent Mozilla Caching Summit ) .
I expect we ’ll see better default cache sizes and eviction logic in the next major release of each browser .
Until then , jack up your defaults as described in the instructions .
And please add comments for any browsers I left out or got wrong .
Thanks .
This is the end .

Outside the high court science writer Simon Singh criticises libel laws for stifling scientific debate , after winning his case guardian .
co.uk
The science writer Simon Singh has won his court of appeal battle for the right to rely on the defence of fair comment in a libel action .
Singh was accused of libel by the British Chiropractic Association ( BCA ) over an opinion piece he wrote in the Guardian in April 2008 .
He suggested there was a lack of evidence for the claims some chiropractors make on treating certain childhood conditions including colic and asthma .
The BCA alleged that Singh had in effect accused its leaders of knowingly supporting bogus treatments .
In May last year , high court judge Mr Justice Eady , in a preliminary ruling in the dispute , held that Singh 's comments were factual assertions rather than expressions of opinion – which meant he could not use the defence of fair comment .
Today , the lord chief justice , Lord Judge , master of the rolls Lord Neuberger and Lord Justice Sedley allowed Singh 's appeal , ruling that the high court judge had " erred in his approach " .
Singh described the ruling as " brilliant " but added : " It is extraordinary this action has cost £ 200,000 to establish the meaning of a few words . "
The Singh case has become a cause celebre for science journalism and prompted calls for reforms to the defamation law to keep it out of scientific disputes .
After the ruling , Tracey Brown , spokeswoman for the Coalition for Libel Reform , said : " We are delighted with the judges ' ruling but it does not go far enough .
" There is a cardiologist currently being sued by a device manufacturer , we have researchers who have been unable to publish their critique of lie detector technology because of threats of libel action .
" A major science journal is also currently being sued and our academics are being told to pull down blogs .
" We urgently need a public interest defence so that we can all be sure of our rights as publishers , writers , authors and academics . "
The Liberal Democrat MP Dr Evan Harris said : " This sensible judgment is no substitute for fundamental law reform .
It is no kind of justice for a scientist to spend £ 200,000 and two years of his life just to get halfway through a case .
The political parties must now all commit to reform of the law to free scientific speech and responsible journalism from the threat of penury . "
Handing down the unanimous judgment of the court , Lord Judge said Singh 's defence had set out the undisputed fact that the BCA promoted chiropractic as a treatment for infants and young children suffering from colic , sleeping and feeding problems , frequent ear infections , asthma and prolonged crying .
Singh also set out , ailment by ailment and study by study , his reasons for considering that none of the available epidemiological evidence reliably supported the BCA claims .
The BCA contested his view – " again ailment by ailment and study by study " – and asserted that there was some dependable evidence for its claims .
Until Mr Justice
Eady blocked it in the high court , Singh 's primary defence to libel was that his were expressions of opinion and fair comment .
Lord Judge ruled that the high court judge , " notwithstanding his very great experience " , had erred by treating an issue of opinion " as an issue of verifiable fact " .
Singh 's words , " however one represents or paraphrases their meaning , are , in our judgment , expressions of opinion " .
He said : " The opinion may be mistaken , but to allow the party which has been denounced on the basis of it to compel its author to prove in court what he has asserted by way of argument is to invite the court to become an Orwellian ministry of truth . "
Ruling that Mr Justice Eady had erred in his approach , Lord Judge said the court adopted what Judge Easterbrook , now chief judge of the US seventh circuit court of appeals , had said in a 1994 libel action over a scientific controversy .
Easterbrook had declared that those claiming they had been libelled " cannot , by simply filing suit and crying ' character assassination ! ' , silence those who hold divergent views , no matter how adverse those views may be to plaintiffs ' interests .
" Scientific controversies must be settled by the methods of science rather than by the methods of litigation .
More papers , more discussion , better data , and more satisfactory models – not larger awards of damages – mark the path towards superior understanding of the world around us . "
Lord Judge said libel was an area of law sometimes concerned with " conflicting issues of great sensitivity involving both the protection of good reputation and the maintenance of the principles of free expression " .
He said it was " somewhat alarming " to read in the standard textbook , The Law of Libel and Slander , that the defence of fair comment was still " dogged by misleading terminology " .
Calling for changes , Lord Judge said : " We question why this should be so .
The law of defamation surely requires that language should not be used which obscures the true import of a defence to an action for damages . "
Other countries , including New Zealand , Australia and the Republic of Ireland , now described the defence of fair comment as " honest opinion " .
Lord Judge said describing the defence " for what it is would lend greater emphasis to its importance as an essential ingredient of the right to free expression " .
" ' Honest opinion ' better reflects the realities .
This appeal must be allowed . "
QUOTE OF THE DAY ….
ABC ’s “ This Week ” held its usual roundtable discussion this morning , with Elizabeth Vargas hosting a panel of Cokie Roberts , Sam Donaldson , George Will , and Paul Krugman .
The last topic of conversation was introduced by Vargas this way :
“ [ O ] f course , this weekend , we have a brand - new White House social secretary appointed to replace Desiree Rogers , a close friend of the Obamas who is exiting after a bumpy tenure , I would say .
Cokie , you spoke with her .
She — she was highly criticized after the Obamas ’ first state dinner in which she arrived , looking absolutely gorgeous , but in what some people later said was far too fancy a dress , but most importantly , that was the state dinner that was crashed by the Salahis , who walked in without an invitation when the social secretary ’s office did n’t have people manning the security sites . ”
This led to a surprisingly long chat about Desiree Rogers .
Krugman sat silently while the discussion went on ( and on ) , before eventually interjecting :
“ Can I say that 20 million Americans unemployed , the fact that we ’re worrying about the status of the White House social secretary ….
Donaldson responded , “ Paul , welcome to Washington . ”
Look , I realize that not every discussion on a show like this is going to be substantive , sophisticated , and policy focused .
Not every post I write for this site is going to highlight critically important issues , either .
There ’s nothing wrong with including heavier and lighter subjects in the same public affairs forum .
But this panel discussion covered exactly four subjects this morning : health care reform , Charlie Rangel ’s ethics problem , David Paterson ’s latest troubles , and the fate of the former White House social secretary ( and where she ’s from , what her clothes looked like , what her next job is likely to be , etc. ) , which hardly seems relevant to anyone who does n’t actually attend social events at the White House .
In this same discussion , there was nothing about the jobs bill that passed the Senate this week , nothing about the incredibly important Zazi guilty plea this week ( and the fact that it makes Republican talking points look ridiculous ) , nothing about Jim Bunning single - handedly delaying unemployment insurance for those who need it .
I wonder , who was the target audience for the discussion of Desiree Rogers , who most Americans have never heard of , and whose White House position has nothing to do with public policy ?
The general public or the D.C. cocktail circuit crowd ?
Krugman no doubt annoyed the show ’s producers by mentioning the inanity of the subject matter , but he ’s right to remind his colleagues of what matters .
For Donaldson to “ welcome ” him “ to Washington ” was insulting — to Krugman and the rest of us .
After having been very publically ejected from the company late last year , former GM CEO Fritz Henderson has been reinstated with a cushy consulting role less than three months on .
In early December , 2009 Henderson was asked by the then Chairman of the Board , Ed Whitacre , to resign just days before he was to make a keynote address at the Los Angeles Auto Show .
In a regulatory filing submitted by GM this past week , the company has confirmed that Whitacre will now remain as CEO with an annual salary of $ 1.7 million plus more than $ 7 million worth of stock payable over the next couple of years .
Interestingly , this figure is significantly higher than the $ 1.3 million Henderson would have received as CEO , even after GM 's executive pay came under the scrutiny of U.S. pay czar Kenneth Feinberg .
As for Henderson , his new consulting job will see him work just 20 hours per month and require him to meet with GM ’s international president , Tim Lee , to discuss matters on international operations .
For his efforts Henderson will receive $ 59,090 per month , which equates to almost $ 3,000 per hour .

Mozilla has decided to stop development of a version of its Firefox mobile Web browser for phones running Windows Mobile .
Microsoft has closed the door to native applications on smartphones running its new Windows Phone 7 Series software , Stuart Parmenter , director of Mobile Engineering at Mozilla Corporation , wrote in a blog post on Monday .
Mozilla was preparing to develop a version of Firefox for Windows Mobile , and the development work Mozilla has done on Windows CE 6 has left it “ well positioned to have an awesome browser on Windows Phone 7 , ” according to Parmenter .
But the absence of a software development kit for native applications has made it impossible for Mozilla to move forward , he said .
Microsoft will only support development of applications running in the Silverlight runtime environment , or of games in the XNA Game Studio runtime environment , it announced last week at its Mix conference .
It will not allow third party app developers direct access to the phone ’s hardware , where they might be better able to exploit its potential .
Still , Parmenter hopes that Microsoft provide Mozilla with a way to build Firefox for Windows Phone 7 Series .
Mozilla thinks Windows Phone 7 looks interesting and has the potential to do well in the market , according to Parmenter .
Firefox for Android is still only a pre-alpha version , which means it is still in the early stages of development , according to Mozilla .
The pre-alpha version has been optimized for Motorola ’s Droid and Google ’s Nexus One .
Auto Giant Stumbles
The End of the Toyota Legend
Toyota used to be the star of the auto world .
Now its reputation is in tatters after quality problems led to a series of fatal accidents and massive vehicle recalls .
But the problems at the company started a long time ago , when the Japanese carmaker decided to emulate its American rivals .

Last week , we found some great wine deals : a few very tasty whites packaged in boxes instead of bottles .
We love the long shelf life and environmental benefits of the bag - in - box .
They 're lighter to carry than bottles and use fridge space more efficiently .
( We do recommend refrigerating all boxes of wine , even reds , if you 're not going to empty them quickly . )
But how do you choose a good boxed wine ?
Keep an eye out for smaller producers and natural wines .
and natural wines .
Ask advice from the people working in your local wine shop -- they may have had a chance to sample the store 's offerings .

Consider trying a bottle ( if the wine is sold that way ) before springing for the big box .
If you do n't like 750 mL of it , you 're not going to love three liters , but if you 're a fan , you 'll be happy to have it in quantity .
Or stick to our list of recommended reds , after the jump .
Recommended Boxed Red Wines
Cuvée de Peña Vin de Pays 2006 $ 27 to 30 for 3L ( find this wine )
This red blend from southern France is made from 48 % Grenache , 30 % Carignan , and 22 % Syrah .
It has blackberry jam and vanilla on the nose , and it needs a little time ( or a decanter ) to open up .
We tasted cranberries and ripe plums , cinnamon , cedar and black pepper .
It 's understated and drinkable , not a big fruit bomb .
This is a great hamburger and picnic wine , and it's light enough to drink slightly chilled as the weather warms .
From the Tank Red about $ 30 ( find this wine , also here )
This Côtes du Rhone blend of Grenache , Syrah , and Carignan has a jammy scent and concentrated flavor .
We tasted tart blueberries , plums , and red pepper flakes .
Decant this one -- the firm tannins relax a little , though you can still taste leather and smoke on the finish .
Chateau Moulin de la Roquille Côtes de Francs 2007 ( Wineberry ) $ 39 ( find this wine )
This smooth , drinkable Bordeaux blend ( 70 % Merlot , 15 % Cabernet Sauvignon , and 15 % Cabernet Franc ) is deep and inviting , with notes of cassis , vanilla , and ripe blueberries .
There 's also a hint of tar and slate .
We actually preferred this before decanting .
Quelu Cabernet Sauvignon $ 24 to 28 for 3L ( find this wine )
This Chilean Cabernet has some real character and goes nicely with cheeses and dry - cured ham .
It has some earthy green pepper flavors and a bit of briny black olive , as well as notes of sage and red pepper flakes .
Nice acidity and smooth medium body .
Maipe Malbec $ 20 to 27 for 3L ( find this wine )
Dry and structured , with hints of clay , fig , and strawberry , this Argentinian Malbec is a little spicy .
It has leathery tannins and some lavender and mint notes — try it with lamb chops or dry - aged steak ; it should cut through the richness perfectly .
A Few More Drinkable Table Wines
Washington Hills Merlot $ 22 to 26 for 3L ( find this wine )
This mellow table wine -- a blend of Merlot , Sangiovese , and Cabernet Franc — is not terribly complex , but it 's drinkable and rich .
It has notes of cherry pie , dark chocolate , and dried fruit , with noticeable ( but not overwhelming ) oak .
It has just enough acidity to keep it from being too sweet .
Red Truck Mini Barrel $ 24 to 33 for 3L ( find this wine )
While it 's nothing exciting , you could do worse than this red blend .
It 's rich and dusty , with warm berry notes and quite a bit of oak .
Smooth and drinkable ( or fine for cooking ) .
The packaging is cute enough that you could put this out at a party .

If you logged onto Icethetics today hoping for a comprehensive list of new uniforms being prepped for the 2010 - 11 season , then it 's your lucky day .
Straight from Reebok , here 's how next season 's jersey line - up shakes out .
Let 's get this out of the way first .
There are 15 teams that will not be changing their home , road or alternate jerseys in 2010 .
They are : Atlanta , Boston , Carolina , Chicago , Colorado , Edmonton , Florida , Los Angeles , Minnesota , Ottawa , Phoenix , San Jose , St. Louis , Tampa Bay and Vancouver .
In addition , Detroit , Montreal , New Jersey and Washington are the only 4 teams that do not have third jerseys and do not plan on adding or changing anything .
That leaves 11 teams with changes to discuss .
This entry will serve as a reference for the next few months , so I 'm going to keep things simple by going in alphabetical order .
Anaheim Ducks
New alternate jersey According to the information I have from Reebok , the Ducks will be adding an alternate jersey this season .
Their home and road sweaters will remain unchanged .
By the way , the list I have does not detail any design elements so all we'd have is speculation at this point .
And I 'm going to try to avoid a lot of blind guessing in this post .
You guys should feel free to add your speculation in the comments .
Buffalo Sabres
New home , road & alternate jerseys
The Sabres will be undergoing big changes to celebrate their 40th anniversary season .
Their current third jersey — a throwback with some modern updates — will take over as the home jersey , as has long been rumored .
Reebok lists the Sabres ' road sweater as TBD , but it will most likely be a white version of the current alternates .
I also understand they 'll be adding an entirely new third jersey , but I 'm told it may be only for the 40th anniversary season .
Sabres 2010 third jersey conceptIt will be royal blue with BUFFALO in a white script across the front , containing the vintage logo with the player 's number underneath .
The concept here to the right is my own rough rendering of the description I 've been given .
I 've added the traditional striping and colors .
Obviously this jersey design is n't exact .
But based on what I 've been told , it 's probably a good estimation .
We 'll have to wait until this summer to find out for sure .
Calgary Flames
New alternate jersey
As the Flames have already announced , they will be bringing back the red retro jersey that was worn for a handful of games this season .
The major difference is that it will be adapted to the Reebok Edge cut .
The striping will remain as is .
The home and road sweaters will not change .
The rumored black jersey that was previously in the works has likely either been tabled for a few years or scrapped entirely .
We may never know .
Unless Ken King gets chatty .
Columbus Blue Jackets
New alternate jersey
The Blue Jackets have not made an official announcement , but the Columbus Dispatch confirmed earlier this month that a new third jersey is in development and will be used in the 2010 - 11 campaign .
This is corroborated by Reebok .
According to the newspaper , a cannon will be the central feature of the crest on the new uniform .
No other details have been made available at this time .
Dallas Stars
Road & alternate jerseys swapped Reebok confirms that the Stars will officially switch their road and alternate jerseys next season .
Both jerseys are white .
Currently , the third is a white version of the home jersey , which features DALLAS arched above the sweater number .
As of the fall , the white DALLAS jersey will become the primary road sweater .
The one crested with the Stars ' primary logo will become the alternate .
Nashville Predators
New home & road ; no alternate jersey
The indication from Reebok is that the Predators will turn the alternate jersey they launched this season into their new home sweater .
The road sweater is listed as TBD but a safe assumption is that it will be a light version of the new dark jersey .
Because of these major changes , the Preds will not wear an alternate next season .
The new home jersey ( third , currently ) features the same primary logo the team has used since its inception in 1998 but with a simplified color scheme — now navy , steel blue silver and black .
The gold and orange have been removed .
New York Islanders
New road jersey
The Islanders are still a bit of a mystery for 2010 .
Reebok says only the road jersey will be changing .
However , Isles blogger Chris Botta said last year that the current retro thirds would become the new home sweater .
It could be an oversight on Reebok 's part or an indication that the Isles are sticking with their current jersey for home games .
Botta also confirmed that a white version of that retro jersey was in the works .
It 's likely that will be the design of the new road sweater .
All of these questions will likely be answered this summer .
New York Rangers
New alternate jersey Reebok verifies the news we 've all been dying to hear .
The Rangers will wear an alternate jersey next season .
But will it be the Lady Liberty logo make her glorious return ?
Possible Rangers third ?
Reebok does n't specify , however , Rangers blogger Greg Caggiano recently claimed to have the inside track on the new thirds .
He says he 's been told they 'll be nearly identical to the current home jersey with NEW YORK replacing RANGERS across the front .
Caggiano does n't specify a source so it could just be guessing .
I think it would disappoint a lot of Rangers fans and Icethetics readers .
The Rangers arguably had the best third jersey of the '90s with that Statue of Liberty logo emblazoned on the front .
Those navy blue sweaters were so popular that in 1998 the Rangers even added a white version for a short time .
They were used up until 2007 when Reebok took over the league .
The Rangers previously wore a blue jersey with NEW YORK on the front from 1978 to 1987 .
The team 's home and road sweaters will not change next season .
Philadelphia Flyers
New road jersey
The Flyers will don new road threads for the 2010 - 11 campaign .
While Reebok does n't say so specifically , it is widely assumed they will wear the retro white jersey that debuted at the 2010 Winter Classic in Boston .
The Flyers have worn the jersey on at least one occasion in front of the home crowd since the outdoor game at Fenway Park .
Their home and alternate jerseys will remain unchanged .
Pittsburgh Penguins
New alternate jersey
It 's been widely rumored and now Reebok is confirming that the Penguins will ditch their powder blue thirds in favor of a new alternate uniform for 2010 - 11 .
Once again , the manufacturer has n't released any details of the design .
However , Tribune - Review beat writer Rob Rossi said in December that blue would be returning in some fashion to the new third jersey .
It 's probably a safe bet that the Pens will dig into their past once again for this sweater — likely going with one of the darker blue options .
The home and road jerseys will stay the same .
Toronto Maple Leafs
New home & road jerseys
This may be a tad misleading .
Reebok says the Maple Leafs will redesign their home and road sweaters for next year .
Technically , this is accurate , but it wo n't be a major overhaul .
At least not according to Howard Berger .
He claims to have seen all of the 2010 jersey changes and says that the white stripes , once around the base of the team 's jerseys before Reebok got involved , will finally be returning .
He also says the jerseys will have a new shoulder patch , noting that the previous one was a TML logo which debuted in 2000 .
He does n't say what the new one will look like .
The retro alternate jersey will remain intact .
And that 's your JerseyWatch 2010 update .
This post will continue to be updated throughout the summer as new details emerge .
Any thoughts on the changes for the new season ?
SEOUL , South Korea — North Korea 's military warned South Korea and the United States on Friday of " unprecedented nuclear strikes " as it expressed anger over a report the two countries plan to prepare for possible instability in the totalitarian country , a scenario it dismissed as a " pipe dream .
" The North routinely issues such warnings .
Diplomats in South Korea and the US have repeatedly called on Pyongyang to return to international negotiations aimed at ending its nuclear programs .
" Those who seek to bring down the system in the ( North ) , whether they play a main role or a passive role , will fall victim to the unprecedented nuclear strikes of the invincible army , " North Korea 's military said in comments carried by the official Korean Central News Agency .
A former senior MI6 officer has criticised the torture and abuse of terror suspects and says the US response to the threat posed by al - Qaida has been exaggerated and counterproductive .
Stinging criticism of the US is made in the Guardian by Nigel Inkster , assistant chief of MI6 until 2006 .
In the article , which appeared originally in the International Institute for Strategic Studies journal Survival , Inkster and co-author Alexander Nicoll write : " It is surely not inspiring for radicalised people with the potential for violent action to see terrorists tried in ordinary criminal courts and sentenced to long prison terms . "
The authors , both senior IISS members , add : " But it surely is inspiring to them to see terrorists treated as a special class of prisoners to be held by the military , imprisoned without trial and tortured .
This is the kind of treatment that makes jihadists believe that they can indeed be the fighters for a cause that they aspire to be . "
Abandoning " ordinary standards of criminal justice " in terrorism cases can be counterproductive , they say .
" On top of this , there is the argument that democratic values … are the [ west 's ] best advertisement .
Departures from such values have damaged America's … reputation . "
Senior officers in MI6 , and MI5 the domestic security service , at the time privately expressed serious concern about the Bush administration 's " war on terror " and what many of them believed was an unlawful invasion of Iraq .
Two months ago , Eliza Manningham - Buller , the former head of MI5 , disclosed that Britain lodged a protest to the US about the treatment of detainees .
America's " frenzied , alarmist response " to the failed attempt by a Nigerian apparently to blow up a US airliner last Christmas Day " is hardly becoming for the most powerful nation on earth " , Inkster and Nicoll said .
" The lack of any sense of proportion simply serves to enhance the status of a terrorist group which is dispersed , quite small and cannot possibly threaten US sovereignty unless Americans connive in their own defeat . "
The huge expense of Bush 's " global war on terror " , they said , had arguably caused more damage to the world economy than Osama bin Laden could have hoped for .
" Nobody can forget the horror of 9/11 , and it was inevitable that a government faced with such an outrage would respond in extreme fashion .
Hindsight is easy , but if Bush had placed more emphasis on bringing those responsible to justice rather than on declaring an unwinnable ' war ' against an undefined enemy , things might have turned out very differently . "
Although children can be depressed for many reasons , new evidence suggests that there are physiological differences among depressed children based on their experiences of abuse before age 5 .
Early abuse may be especially damaging due to the very young age at which it occurs .
Those are the findings of a new study of low - income children that was conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota and the University of Rochester , Mt. Hope Family Center .
The study appears in the January / February 2010 issue of the journal Child Development .
Children who experience maltreatment , including physical , sexual , and emotional abuse or neglect , grow up with a lot of stress .
Cortisol , termed the " stress hormone , " helps the body regulate stress .
But when stress is chronic and overloads the system , cortisol can soar to very high levels or plummet to lows , which in turn can harm development and health .
The researchers studied more than 500 low - income children ages 7 to 13 , about half of whom had been abused and / or neglected , to find out whether abuse early in life and feelings of depression affected their levels of cortisol .
High levels of depression were more frequent among children who were abused in the first five years of their lives than among maltreated children who were n't abused early in life or children who were n't maltreated at all .
More importantly , only children who were abused before age 5 and depressed had an atypical flattening of cortisol production during the day , whereas other children , whether they were depressed or not , showed an expected daily decline in cortisol from morning to afternoon .
This finding means that the body 's primary system for adapting to stress had become compromised among children who were depressed and abused early in life .
The results suggest that there are different subtypes of depression , with atypical cortisol regulation occurring among children who were abused before age 5 .
The authors suggest that early abuse may be more damaging to developing emotion and stress systems because it happens as the brain is rapidly developing and when children are more dependent on caregivers ' protection .
Moreover , because it 's harder for very young children to discern the clues predicting an abusive attack , they may be chronically stressed and overly vigilant , even when they 're not being abused .
" In the United States , more than 1.5 million children are abused and neglected every year , though it 's estimated that the actual rates are substantially greater , " according to Dante Cicchetti , McKnight Presidential Chair and professor of child development and psychiatry at the University of Minnesota , who led the study .
" The results of this study have significant implications for children in the child welfare population and underscore the importance of providing early preventive interventions to children who have been abused . "

The first ever issue of Macworld is a classic .
Apple co-founder Steve Jobs dressed in a pinstripe suit , standing over one the most revolutionary products in the history of tech – the original Mac .
But as with most things involving Steve Jobs , the story behind the photoshoot is filled with all the requisite drama and expletives you ’d expect from a young Jobs , who was 29 when the above photo was taken .
In an interesting retrospective , Macworld founder David Bunnell recalls some of the saucier details about Steve Jobs and the story behind the iconic magazine cover .
Steve was called in only when everything was perfect .
All we needed was to have him stand in position for 10 minutes and then he could go , just as he had requested .
Of course , with Steve Jobs , you have to anticipate the unexpected .
Steve walked in dressed in a beautiful pinstriped , double - breasted suit with a white shirt and red tie .
Right away , there was a problem–Steve did n’t like the images we had chosen for the Mac screens .
Aware that he might bolt any moment , Andrew and I worked feverishly to fix them–putting up exactly what Steve said he wanted .
Meanwhile he stared at Mosgrove , and said , “ Are you one of those type of photographers who takes dozens of photos hoping one of them will turn out okay ? ”
Will just looked at him and shrugged .
“ Take a picture of this , ” Steve said , holding up his middle finger .
We stared in disbelief .
Someone must have keyed his Mercedes again , I remember thinking .
In a great capper to an already great story , Bunnell writes that Jobs soon called him up and said that he had changed his mind , and that he did n’t want his mug to grace the cover of the magazine .
Bunnell lied to Jobs and told him that it was too late , that the “ cover is already at the printer and we ca n’t change it . ”
In actuality , Bunnell says that only a few pages were at the printer and that there was more than enough time to switch the cover if they truly wanted to .
Looking back , I think he made the right call .
This , though , is n’t the first time we ’ve heard of Jobs giving someone , or something , the one finger salute .
Below , Jobs gives the middle finger to IBM , sometime in the early 80’s .

Cheye Calvo's July 2008 encounter with a Prince George 's County , Maryland , SWAT team is now pretty well - known :
After intercepting a package of marijuana at a delivery service warehouse , police completed the delivery , in disguise , to the address on the package .
That address belonged to Calvo , who also happened to be the mayor of the small Prince George 's town of Berwyn Heights .
When Calvo 's mother - in - law brought the package in from the porch , the SWAT team pounced , forcing their way into Calvo 's home .
By the time the raid was over , Calvo and his mother - in - law had been handcuffed for hours , police realized they 'd made a mistake , and Calvo's two black Labradors lay dead on the floor from gunshot wounds .
As a result of this colossal yet not - unprecedented screw - up , plus Calvo 's notoriety and persistence , last year Maryland became the first state in the country to make every one of its police departments issue a report on how often and for what purpose they use their SWAT teams .
The first reports from the legislation are in , and the results are disturbing .
Over the last six months of 2009 , SWAT teams were deployed 804 times in the state of Maryland , or about 4.5 times per day .
In Prince George 's County alone , with its 850,000 residents , a SWAT team was deployed about once per day .
According to a Baltimore Sun analysis , 94 percent of the state 's SWAT deployments were used to serve search or arrest warrants , leaving just 6 percent in response to the kinds of barricades , bank robberies , hostage takings , and emergency situations for which SWAT teams were originally intended .
Worse even than those dreary numbers is the fact that more than half of the county 's SWAT deployments were for misdemeanors and nonserious felonies .
That means more than 100 times last year Prince George 's County brought state - sanctioned violence to confront people suspected of nonviolent crimes .
And that 's just one county in Maryland .
These outrageous numbers should provide a long - overdue wake - up call to public officials about how far the pendulum has swung toward institutionalized police brutality against its citizenry , usually in the name of the drug war .
But that 's unlikely to happen , at least in Prince George 's County .
To this day , Sheriff Michael Jackson insists his officers did nothing wrong in the Calvo raid — not the killing of the dogs , not neglecting to conduct any corroborating investigation to be sure they had the correct house , not failing to notify the Berwyn Heights police chief of the raid , not the repeated and documented instances of Jackson 's deputies playing fast and loose with the truth .
Jackson , who 's now running for county executive , is incapable of shame .
He has tried to block Calvo 's efforts to access information about the raid at every turn .
Last week , Prince George 's County Circuit Judge Arthur M. Ahalt ruled that Calvo 's civil rights suit against the county can go forward .
But Jackson has been fighting to delay the discovery process in that suit until federal authorities complete their own investigation into the raid .
That would likely ( and conveniently ) prevent Prince George 's County voters from learning any embarrassing details about the raid until after the election .
But there is some good news to report here , too .
The Maryland state law , as noted , is the first of its kind in the country , and will hopefully serve as a model for other states in adding some much - needed transparency to the widespread use and abuse of SWAT teams .
And some Maryland legislators want to go even further .
State Sen. Anthony Muse ( D - Prince George's ) , for example , wants to require a judge 's signature before police can deploy a SWAT team .
Muse has sponsored another bill that would ban the use of SWAT teams for misdemeanor offenses .
The latter seems like a no - brainer , but it 's already facing strong opposition from law enforcement interests .
Police groups opposed the transparency bill , too .
Beyond policy changes , the Calvo raid also seems to have also sparked media and public interest in how SWAT teams are deployed in Maryland .
The use of these paramilitary police units has increased dramatically over the last 30 years , by 1,000 percent or more , resulting in the drastic militarization of police .
It 's a trend that seems to have escaped much media and public notice , let alone informed debate about policies and oversight procedures .
But since the Calvo raid in 2008 , Maryland newspapers , TV news crews , activists , and bloggers have been documenting mistaken , botched , or disproportionately aggressive raids across the state .
Lawmakers tend to be wary of questioning law enforcement officials , particularly when it comes to policing tactics .
They should n't be .
If anything , the public employees who are entrusted with the power to use force , including lethal force , deserve the most scrutiny .
It 's unfortunate that it took a violent raid on a fellow public official for Maryland 's policymakers to finally take notice of tactics that have been used on Maryland citizens for decades now .
But at least these issues are finally on the table .
Lawmakers in other states should take notice .
It 's time to have a national discussion on the wisdom of sending phalanxes of cops dressed like soldiers into private homes in search of nonviolent and consensual crimes .

Somewhere in Port au Prince , Haiti , there are ten white American Evangelical Christians sitting in a jail cell , wondering how they came to this fate .
The American “ Missionaries ” from New Life Children ’s Refuge were charged Thursday with child kidnapping and criminal association for trying to take 33 “ orphans ” across the border into the Dominican Republic ; they ’re also exhibit A in the trial of colonialism , evangelical fervor , and designer adoption chic .
The whole incident becomes even more startling when you consider that the bulk of the group are not seasoned missionaries , but just regular church folks who felt “ called ” to get involved .
These laypersons , who have never gone on a real missions trip and have no formal training , belong to churches affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention whose missionary work in recent years has been suspect .
Their case has taken over news of earthquake relief efforts ; indeed , you can bank on ten white Americans Christians in a Haitian jail receiving more press than the 200,000 estimated dead in Haiti , plus the millions still trying to get fresh water , food , and a roof over their heads .
Even more trying is the fact that after all the media hoopla about violence in Haiti , who ends up in jail ?
Ten white American Christians .
The irony is epic .
Better Yet , Stay Home
The misplaced missionary impulse to save the heathen children and impart “ civilization ” by loading a bunch of Haitian kids in a bus and heading for a resort with a swimming pool , to share the “ good news ” and be adopted , is simply ludicrous .
No reputable missions organization works that way .
Still , despite the group ’s irresponsible and crude behavior , I suspect that many in America thought that the missionaries would be on a transport home by now .
Frankly , if anyone in the group had even bothered to read Haiti ’s Wikipedia page , they might have thought twice about a plan to take black children out of the country without paperwork .
By disregarding even the most basic history of slavery , missions , or colonial activity in Haiti , their missionary impulse failed them miserably .
With all of the missions already on the ground in Haiti , what made them think they could just take children out of the country ?
The ignorance and naïveté of this group is staggering , except when considered from the perspective of the evangelical imperative of Go ye into all the world .
Last time I checked , however , that scripture did not mean take children and make them Christians by spiriting them away to be adopted by other families .
Unfortunately , Missions history shows otherwise .
In the United States , and many other countries , families of non-Christian groups were subjected to Christian missionaries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries who took children away for adoptions or at the very least to attend church schools .
Many were never reunited with their parents , and some came to hate their parents as a result of the indoctrination .
Haitians are well - attuned to missionaries , as several missions ’ organizations have been in the country for more than fifty years .
So before the Haitian government is criticized for arresting the New Life group , remember : they understand what it is like to have the United Nations and many religious relief organizations operating within their country — and they know what ’s legal .
If the New Life Group had really wanted to help these children , they could have done it right there on the spot , rather than going to the remote community of Calebasse and taking children into the Dominican Republic .
Better yet , send money and stay home ; let professionals handle the situation .
It was n’t as though Haiti was bereft of missions groups .
Moreover , the leader of New Life Children ’s rescue , Laura Silsby , has had serious legal problems in the past , most recently losing the house she bought for the ministry to foreclosure at the end of 2009 .
The fact that neither of the churches involved with the missions group vetted her thoroughly before leading a missions trip will open them to lawsuits , above and beyond the legal fees and costs incurred from the current incarceration .
Silby ’s motives are also suspect in part because she seemed to realize what she was doing , stating in an interview on Monday that the group did not intend to offer the children for adoption .
“ We intended to raise those children and be with them their entire lives , if necessary , ” she said .
It also seems that a plan was in place for an orphanage long before the earthquake occurred .
In addition to the missionaries themselves , the Southern Baptist Convention should be held accountable for the colonialist statement put out by Morris H. Chapman , who stated in a press release that “ The Haitian government and the international community immediately interpreted their actions in the worst light possible , alleging that they were trafficking in children .
As the story has unfolded , it has become more and more apparent that these ten individuals were driven by the true selflessness of altruism .
Moved with compassion , they acted . ”
If altruism is an attempt to grab a busload of kids by showing them pictures of a luxury hotel with a pool , I ’ve got some swampland to sell the SBC .
All I have to say to Mr. Chapman is , 19th - century Baptist missionary Lottie Moon would have known better .
She lived among the people she served , and did not offer them hotel and a pool in exchange for Jesus .
The real crux of the issue is this : these ten do - gooders walked into the trap many well - meaning white evangelical Christians fall into : those poor brown / black / yellow / red people need My help .
Jesus wants
Me to help them .
To much of white American Evangelical Christianity , the We often means Me . It ’s what God Called Me to do .
It ’s what God would want Me to do .
The problem with the Me mentality of much of conservative Evangelical Christianity is that they often ca n’t see the We — the people of Haiti — who love their kids so much they ’re willing to let some white people who claim to be “ Christians ” take them away to what they promise will be “ a better life . ”
The focus on Me takes away from the real ways that people in disasters can be helped without the insertion of well - meaning , clueless interlopers into their story .
The New Life group is now finding out what living in an impoverished and earthquake - ravaged country is like .
Perhaps now they will begin to understand what it means to live alongside the poor , as opposed to swooping into a disaster for a quick “ feel - good Christian moment ” designed to make them feel better about themselves .
Hopefully , other groups will rally to do the real work that is still so urgently needed , and make a long - term commitment to bring life and stability to Haiti and its children who are in desperate need of it .
Washington ( CNN ) -- About 1,300 U.S. troops have been stuck at the Manas airfield in Kyrgyzstan because of the civil unrest there .
A U.S. military spokesman , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the security situation , said the troops have been unable to move because of the suspension of U.S. military operations at the airfield .
The airfield in the former Soviet republic has been a transit point for troops and supplies moving in and out of the war zone in Afghanistan .
The spokesman said there are some refueling flights being run out of Manas but said that any decisions on future passenger flights will be made on a case - by - case basis .
The stranded troops include those coming home from Afghanistan and others going into the war zone .
The spokesman said it is not known when the airfield will reopen , and it is not yet certain how the troops will be moved out .
Earlier this week , anti-government riots in Kyrgyzstan killed 76 people and forced the county 's president to flee the capital , Bishkek .
Clinical Psychologists have recently received criticism , not unfairly , for their hyperfocus on pathology .
In other words , we are trained to direct our energy mainly ( sometimes almost solely ) on what is ‘ wrong . ’
Hence the push for the movement of Positive Psychology .
Therapists and practitioners need to help patients identify not just what is wrong with their lives , but also what is right .
What is working for them ?
What are their strengths and potential ?
This mind set can help clients to see their lives in a broader , more balanced perspective .

I get my share of emails asking about happiness .
How do I become happier ?
What ’s the key to having a better life ?
You were so amazing on television , Rob , when can I see you again ?
And the like .
Many of my posts are about happiness in a broad sense , but today I thought I ’d bring on another voice , one not of a colleague ( honestly , do you really want to hear Dr. Pete ’s thoughts on happiness ? ) , but of a younger , well - informed and , most importantly , self - reflective man .
His name is Steven Handel , author of the TheEmotionMachine .
Com spiele kostenlosen ipad .
I ’m very impressed with this young man ’s approach to life .
He reminds me of my writing colleague Ryan Holiday in that they both appear to be well ahead of the curve in terms of insight and wisdom .
Dr. Rob :
You ’ve written multiple articles on happiness and how to obtain it .
Part of the problem I ’ve seen with research on happiness is that not only is it difficult to measure , it ’s even difficult to define .
Therefore we tend to see boatloads of theories and hypotheses about what makes people happy and how they can achieve happiness herunterladen .
What do you see as the best explanations out there regarding the phenomenon of happiness .
Steven H : Well , modern psychology follows a bio - psycho - social model for determining the origins of mental activity .
I tend to agree …our genes and environment can play a big role in our happiness .
But , the most inspiring view of happiness that I have come across is the one proposed by Buddha and many similar philosophers of the East .
And that goes like this : the origins of your suffering are completely psychological , and if anyone can learn how to change the way they feel , think , and view the world – they will find happiness wecker töne kostenlos downloaden .
To me happiness is a lens to look out at the world from , not an outcome .
Dr. Rob : I agree .
I think certain people have purely organic / biological
difficulties that prevent such shifts in cognition , but most are capable of generating that lens you speak of .
That ’s the premise of Cognitive - Behavioral Therapy , and its track record suggests it ’s a viable model .
Some research has suggested that happiness as a function of age looks like an upside - down “ U ” shape ; that is , people tend to be very happy at younger ages with a decrease around age 40 , then a positive climb into old age .
This would suggest that you are a pretty happy guy and I ’m about to step in front of a train carrying dynamite and cyanide .
However , minus a few bouts of moodiness ( nothing that the light box ca n’t handle ) , I see myself as a reasonably happy person diablo 3 free full version german pc .
I ’ve written before that older people tend to be happier because they are wiser .
Do you see these phenomena ( happiness and wisdom ) as causal or could it be argued they are essentially the same thing ?
Steven H : Yes , I definitely believe that wisdom contributes to happiness .
It goes back to what I said about how you view your world , and older people have a much more mature and developed perspective .
But there are also those old people who are always stuck , arrogant and pissed off .
I ’m reminded of the typical old guy sitting on his lawn all day , yelling his brains out at any kid who comes within 6 feet of his precious green grass hoe kan ik gratis publisher downloaden .
So years of unhappiness can also condition you towards more and more unhappiness .
Dr. Rob :
This is exactly why I live in the concrete jungle .
Steven H :
In some ways kids have the very best shot at being happy .
You do n’t need to learn anything to be happy , and that is part of the wisdom of it .
If anything you need to unlearn all your stresses , anxieties , worries , fears , and feelings of hate before you can make room for happiness .
You have to empty your mind to the moment videos via browser .
Kids are great at doing that .
But then we send them to schools and insist they cram all this information in their heads .
Nothing wrong with education , but we put some very unproductive ideas in those little skulls .
There are a lot of things to reprimand our current educational system for ….
Dr. Rob : I ’ve always been a huge advocate of bringing the Cognitive - Behavioral philosophy into the school system .
Not as a treatment model per se , but as a way of life .
When people really come to understand that it ’s not what happens to them , but rather how they view what happens to them that dictates their emotions , the results can be profound and positive linux multimedia studio kostenlosen .
On your site , you ’ve shared your experiences with mood difficulties .
Many of the readers of this site are college - aged people like yourself .
What advice would you give to them regarding their ability to achieve happiness ?
Steven H : Even the feelings of happiness and pleasure are transient .
Emotional maturity is recognizing the impermanence of all mental states .
No matter how down , depressed , and lonely you may become … no matter how stuck you may feel … it wo n’t last netflix downloaden ipad mini .
The same is true for all states .
Acknowledge this and you can live in the moment better .
I even recommend people dive into their depression – really observe it – and you will see that it is always changing .
Sometimes the more aware you are the quicker it purges itself .
So my advice boils down to one piece of advice when dealing with mood : practice watching impermanence .
Things are always changing , always evolving and your depression , sadness , frustration , anger , fear , hate , is all part of that process .
Do n’t latch onto any of them – let them evolve with you .
In many ways , when we are aware , these states change us for the better .
So even chronic depression can be seen as a kind of blessing – a seed for new beginnings .
Dr. Rob :
Many patients hate hearing this because they want the quick - fix , and I certainly appreciate that , but awareness and observation will always serve you better over the long haul .
I had a supervisor in graduate school who said to me that being healthy is n’t about being symptom - free .
It ’s about stepping back and observing your own psychology .
If we ca n’t do that then we are , essentially , acting solely on subconscious or even unconscious impulses .
That ’s not freedom , that ’s being controlled by what we could observe and modify .
Steven , thanks for coming on .
Do yourself a favor and check out his site .
He has some great ideas about psychology , happiness , depression and self - awareness .
And if you are interested in Steven ’s thoughts about impermanence , I would recommend reading the very short but useful book , The Miracle of Mindfulness , by Tich Nat Hahn .
It ’s a great read .

A couple of days ago , I was very glad to receive an email reply from Stephen Worth , director of ASIFA - Hollywood Animation Archive .
He is very generous to allow me to share some of his huge classic cartoons and illustration collection with you .
ASIFA - Hollywood Animation Archive is the place where you can find historical information and resource about any classic cartoon you can imagine through the history of the 2D cartoon production in United States .
In Burbank California , ASIFA - Hollywood Animation Archive ( A - HAA ) has a museum that allows students , researchers , and classic cartoon fans to view the hard work done in the shadow before the final cartoon animation see the light .
In this post , I divided the resources into two sections .
The classic cartoon model sheets and classic illustrations .
But first , I would like to thank and deeply appreciate Stepehen for this permission to show some of his collections here .
Note : Please do not copy or redistribute any of the model sheets and illustration images from this post without prior permission from Stephen Worth .
Classic Cartoon Model Sheets
The cartoon animation production industry includes a large number of stages that start with the characters ’ model sheets , story boarding and end with final production .
Although the new technologies turn the cartoon industry to a new trend , easy process and fast workflow , the cartoon process includes that same concept but with different tools .
Generally , the cartoon production steps include :
Preparation , which includes creating the model sheet and story board of the animation .
Production , which includes creating the animation , backgrounds and sound effects .
Below is a collection of well - known cartoon characters model sheets from different producers such as MGM , United Production , Disney and Tarrytoons .
Classic Illustrations
Illustrations were always there in magazines , posters and comics , here are some examples of the classic illustrations by different artists and styles in both black and white and color drawings .
You may recall that last month an exhibit at a small West Village gallery was shut down by the NYPD because the show featured a nude woman standing in the gallery window .
( She was holding a jar of human testicles , by the way , but more on that later . )
The NYCLU and famed civil rights lawyer Ron Kuby rallied to the gallery 's defense , arguing that a state law on public nudity has an exception for " the breast - feeding of infants or to any person entertaining or performing in a play , exhibition , show or entertainment . "
In a surprise move , the NYPD agreed , and declared that the model , Megan Hanford , is an integral part of the artwork , and there 's nothing lewd or indecent about it .
Emboldened , the gallery is now kicking it up a notch !
Yesterday the artist , Brian Reed , joined Hanford in the window of the Chair and the Maiden gallery .
( The jar of testicles was set aside , since they were no longer necessary to " balance the female energy . " )
Curator David Zell tells us that Reed had been getting a lot of hate mail accusing him of objectifying women , with some critics wondering why he was n't up there exposing himself .
So he decided to do just that ( and he 'll be back next Thursday , in case you missed it ) .
We asked Zell about those who object to the exhibit , particularly families who say they have no warning about what they 're about to walk past , and no choice about keeping it from their children .
He said :
Choice goes both ways .
They have a choice to not walk by and not look in .
I 'm on a small street ; it 's not a main boulevard .
And once could argue that the state of New York is infringing on my choice if we were prohibited from displaying this .
Everyone has to have choice in order for it to be balanced .
And let 's face it , it 's not about children , it 's about their parents .
Why do they want to make a child ashamed of the human body , and suggest that it 's dirty to look at ?
We actually have many families who stop and look and have a conversation about it .
Children should not be ashamed of nudity ; it 's an education issue .
But what about the testicles ?!
Zell says they actually belong to Hanford , who played a significant role in creating the show .
They were once attached to an old roommate who underwent a sex change operation , and he mailed them to her as a gift .
So now you know .
The whole ballsy exhibit ends March 21st , and the live performance will return Thursday and Friday from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. , and Saturday and Sunday from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m .

Paleontologists have stumbled across a scientific first that 's sure to inspire both fascination and disgust : coprolites , or fossilized fecal matter , bearing the distinct impressions of a creature 's teeth .
The coprolites – one chunk of rock is fist - sized , the other is about 30 percent larger – were discovered on a beach along the western shore of Chesapeake Bay , says Stephen Godfrey , a paleontologist at the Calvert Marine Museum in Solomons , Md .
The impressions in the coprolites are as much as 6.5 millimeters ( just over a quarter of an inch ) deep , Godfrey and a colleague report online March 9 in Naturwissenschaften .
A silicone rubber mold of the tooth marks indicates that the biter was most likely a close relative of today ’s tiger shark .
This fossilized poop does n’t include visible bits of bone , feather or fish scales like similar coprolites unearthed from 15 - million - year - old rocks in the nearby cliffs .
But the hunks do have a phosphate - rich composition that hints the fecal matter came from a creature that had fed on bony prey .
This , along with the size of the coprolites , suggests they came from a large animal , possibly a crocodilian , Godfrey says .
Although sharks are known to taste - test possible prey , Godfrey thinks it ’s unlikely that the shark just took a nip of poop floating by to test its palatability .
For one thing , he says , the tooth impressions are much deeper on one side of each coprolite than on the other – a scenario that ’s unlikely if the delicate fecal matter had been free - floating .
Instead , the researchers contend , the disparity in the depth of the impressions probably resulted because the fecal matter was still inside the shark 's prey , or constrained within disemboweled intestines , when bitten .

Documents released at a Senate hearing into Goldman Sachs ’ role in the financial crisis show the firm strategizing on how to bet against its clients ’ investments .
The revelations came during a chaotic hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , which on Tuesday heard from a number of Goldman executives who denied any wrongdoing in its investments ahead of the financial collapse of 2008 .
ADVERTISEMENT
The hearing featured protesters in jail uniforms calling for the arrest of Goldman executives , and was punctuated by a profanity - laced exchange between a Goldman executive and Sen. Carl Levin ( D - MI ) , who used the term “ sh* * ty deal ” 11 times .
But buried in the day ’s events was a report from McClatchy news service that former Goldman trader Joshua Birnbaum told his bosses the financial firm could exploit investors ’ expectations that Goldman is investing in real estate in the long term by betting on a collapse of the housing market in the short term .
Because the “ world would think ” that Goldman expects a strong real estate market , the company would be able to bet against real estate and win big .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We could use that fear [ of a market collapse ] to our advantage if we could flip our risk , ” Birnbaum wrote , as quoted by McClatchy .
That revelation is important because defenders of Goldman Sachs have been arguing that the SEC ’s civil fraud case against the company is weak .
They point to evidence that a Goldman client , ACA Management , knew that Goldman was betting against ACA ’s investments .
If that were the case , it would be very difficult to prove that Goldman Sachs committed fraud .
But the documents from Birnbaum suggest the company expected its clients not to know which way it was investing on real estate , thus strengthening the argument that the investment bank was committing fraud .
ADVERTISEMENT
In Senate testimony Tuesday , Goldman execs categorically denied any wrongdoing .
“ I did not mislead ” investors involved in the SEC ’s case , Goldman employee Fabrice Tourre — the only individual named in the SEC ’s case — told the Senate panel .
“ I deny — categorically — the SEC ’s allegation , ” Tourre said , adding that “ I will defend myself in court against this false claim . ”
“ We did nÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t have a massive short against the housing market and we certainly did not bet against our clients , ” Goldman CEO LLoyd Blankfein said in a prepared statement that was released ahead of his appearance .
“ Rather , we believe that we managed our risk as our shareholders and our regulators would expect . ”

LEVIN ’S ‘SH ** TY ’ DEAL
Sen .
Levin raised eyebrows during Goldman testimony when he repeatedly used the expression “ sh** ty deal ” to describe a failed investment package championed by Goldman Sachs .
The expression had been used by a Goldman operative in an email about the package .
ADVERTISEMENT
Several news sources stated Levin used the term 11 times during the course of a testy exchange with Goldman exec Daniel Sparks over a sub - prime mortgage investment package known as Timberwolf .
CBS reports :
“ Quoting a Goldman e-mail : ‘ boy that Timberwolf was one shitty deal , ’ Levin said .
“ How much of that shitty deal did you sell ? ”
He added : “ You did n’t tell them that you thought this was a shitty deal ? ”
Levin grew increasingly frustrated with what he saw as non-answers from Sparks , a former head of Goldman ’s mortgages department , and vowed to keep Goldman executives there “ as long as it takes to get the answers … to the public . ”
“ You knew it was a shitty deal and that ’s what your e-mails show , ” he said .
“ How much of this shitty deal did you continue to sell to your clients ? ”
He added : “ Should Goldman Sachs be trying to sell the shitty deal , can you answer that one yes or no ? ”
Pat Garofalo at ThinkProgress notes that Timberwolf lost 80 percent of its value within five months of its issuance .

The Washington Post sets the tone for discussing the situation facing working women in South Korea , noting :
In a country where people work more and sleep less than anywhere else in the developed world , women are often elbowed away from rewards in their professional lives .
If they have a job , they make 38 percent less money than men , the largest gender gap in the developed world .
If they become pregnant , they are pressured at work not to take legally guaranteed maternity leave .
Thanks to gender equality in education , the professional skills and career aspirations of women in South Korea have soared over the past two decades .
But those gains are colliding with a corporate culture that often marginalizes mothers at the workplace — or ejects them altogether .

Working mothers like Hwang - who is a high powered executive - face rejection from various aspects of work life after they have children .
One of the largest fault lines for professional women is the issue of maternity leave .
While the government allows women to take up to one year off ( with some compensation ) after childbirth , many companies frown upon employees taking advantage of the policy .
Many workers have reported losing their jobs after being on leave , though this practice is illegal .
Still , the situation is so bad , the statistics speak for themselves :
Only about 35,000 parents in this country of 49 million people took advantage of child - care leave subsidies last year .

Additionally , added societal pressures increase the burdens on working women , who are supposed to still attend every whim of their husband , children , and extended families .
If women do not make time for all the demands , they are labeled irresponsible or " bad women . "
The culture in South Korea has contributed to more and more young women postponing having a family until they are in their late 20s and 30s - but this has provided a new problem for the South Korean government .
Collapsing birthrates are alarming East Asian governments , which in coming years will face a demographic crunch as the proportion of pensioners rises and the number of working - age adults declines .
South Korea , which has projected a population decline beginning in 2018 , is scrambling to encourage childbirth with incentives including low - interest home loans for families with three or more children .
But for South Korean women , choosing to have children usually means falling off the career track .
There is a 30 percent employment gap here between men and women , the fourth - largest gap in the world , after Turkey , Mexico and Greece .
Even if women choose to stay on the job , they have no guarantees of career advancement .

While the government can mandate reform , cultural shifts take years to have an impact .
Unfortunately , for women like Hwang , this shift just is n't happening fast enough .
As the Times reports today , for some South Korean women , the answer is to head into the public sector - thanks to reforms passed to retain more women in the workplace , women are excelling at various levels in government .
( Interestingly , the program to increase the amount of women employees in government offices worked so well that South Korea is debating instituting a similar quota for men . )

As an aside : Just to make things more complicated , Lee sells a fully progressive version of their 3 hole turret press called the Pro 1000 .
It runs $ 65 stripped , and you need to buy a priming system for $ 13 , a shell plate for $ 24 , a case feeder tube for $ 10 , and a tool head for $ 10 .
Or you can buy it complete , with a case feeder , powder measure , priming system , shell plate , tool head , and a single set of dies , for $ 132 .
That 's actually CHEAPER than buying the manual turret press , and the associated gear to do the same thing the progressive does ( and is in fact cheaper than either Lyman or RCBSs turret press alone ) .
The only concern I have with it , is durability .
As I said , the 4 hole design is strong , but I have concerns about its service life ; and I can't really recommend it .
To muddy the waters even further however , Lee makes what is essentially a fully progressive version of their challenger press called the load master ; and selling for $ 215 fully kitted out with powder measure , priming system , case feeder , and die set .
The load masters frame is every bit as strong and tough as a Dillon press ; though the case feeder , powder measure , and priming system wont stand up to as much ...
But honestly , for $ 215 ... thats half the price of a Dillon .
Sure you wont get the speed , or service life , but it's $ 215 ; and the replacement parts are cheap .
I 'm in the market for a Dillon , because I need that additional speed and toughness , most loaders on a budget really do n't .
If you need to load more than 500 rounds a month of a single caliber , then I 'd really recommend going for the LoadMaster .
I 've been writing a lot lately about reloading , and the economics thereof ; but I 've been focused on the higher end .
High volume , high speed , and quite frankly high cost .
But what if you 're not sure you really want to get into it ?
What if you do n't have the budget , or the time , to do much reloading ; but you still want to get into it ?
What if you 're just trying to make as much ammo as you can , as cheaply as possible ?
What do you need ?
Well ( excluding components and a workspace ) at the most basic level you need : 1. A press2 . A set of dies3 .
Some way of measuring powder4 .
Some way of dispensing powder5 .
Some way of seating primers6 .
Some basic case preparation tools ( let 's assume pistol only for this one ) 7 .
Some basic tools for measuring the length of your cases and loaded cartridges8 .
Something to hold the cases while you go through the processes of loading .
9 .
A way of pulling bullets out of cases ( trust me , you need this ) 10 .
A loading book or two ( the internet is not a valid substitute here ) You do n't NEED a dedicated workspace , or even a work bench .
You can very easily bolt your press and powder measure onto a board , and then when you want to load , take a couple of c-clamps or quick clamps and secure the board to the edge of a sturdy table .
Or , if you want to get fancy , to a black and decker workmate , or any other folding workbench contraption .
Those are great if you happen to want to do some reloading in the field , like when you are doing load development and want to vary charges and seating depths as you test for example .... but , unsurprisingly , I digress ... I 've said before , you can do all of this for as little as $ 200 , and get into decent equipment that will last you a good while for under $ 400 .
Well , let 's go through that then : Thankfully , for the reloader on a REALLY tight budget , theres only one manufacturer you need to remember , and that 's Lee .
Lee make good quality products , for great prices ; and they have excellent warranty and customer service .
Their products are for the most part no frills and basic , they may not do everything you might want to do ; but that also means you are n't paying for more than you need .
Lee ( and most other manufacturers in fact ) offers a very basic reloading kit that includes a single stage single station press , and most of the basic tools needed for loading ; called the anniversary kit .
You just need to add a few extras and you 're good to go .
Let 's price things out as we go ( I ’m going to use Midway USA prices here for reference .
You can sometimes get better prices from Cheaper Than Dirt , Natchez , or Midsouth ) : 1 . Lee anniversary reloading kit : $ 69 ( includes ) : *
Lee challenger press *
Lee perfect powder measure *
Lee safety scale * Lee auto prime *
Lee shellholders ( for auto prime ) * basic case prep tools *
Lee powder funnelto that you need to add : 2 . Lee classic 3 die set : $ 21 including shellholder3 .
Case gage for one caliber : $ 54 .
OAL gage for one caliber : $ 55 .
Bullet puller : $ 126 .
loading tray : $ 47 .
Lyman reloading manual : $ 17 That totals out to $ 133 .
Just to indicate the value included in the Lee kit ; the retail price of the ACCESSORIES ( not including the press ) included in the kit totals up to over $ 70 , and the press is $ 40 by itself ; but the kit sells for $ 69 , and thats after a $ 50 discount from MSRP .
One thing though ; I think you need to make a couple of substitutions to have a really functional setup .
You CAN get by with just a case length gage and OAL gage ; and they are useful tools to have around no matter what ; but they are very limiting if they are your only tool for measuring the length of cases and cartridges .
Realistically , you need a set of calipers ; and not a plastic cheapie or a low end digital ( notoriously inaccurate ) .
Get yourself a low end stainless model from a reputable manufacturer .
Lyman makes one that sells for $ 28 ( in fact , its the one I use ) .
Okay , so that 's $ 18 more , for a total of $ 151 .
Really , that 's honestly all it takes to get started .
If you 're loading very low volumes of just one caliber , that 's a great deal .
But ... For not very much more , you can upgrade to a setup that will make you much happier , and use a turret press .
If you have n't read the other articles on reloading , the difference between a single stage press and a turret press , is that with a single stage you have one tool station ( a place where you insert dies ) that is fixed in the press .
With a turret press , you get as few as 3 , or as many as 7 stations ; so you can install all the dies of a die set ( handgun die sets usually have three dies , but may have 4 or even 5 if you include a separate powder die and crimp die ) at once .
The biggest difference is in workflow , and the speed thereof .
With a turret press , you can very easily switch from operation to operation just by turning the turret ( or the shellplate if it uses a fixed head ) .
You can leave your dies set up and adjusted and not worry about switching them out between operations .
Also , if a press has a quick change turret or toolhead , you can buy spare toolheads ( or spare turrets ) and have multiple calibers set up in them ; so you do n't have to worry about changing adjustments when you change between calibers .
Believe me , a turret press cuts your loading time down significantly .
Now , keeping to our limited budget , Lee also offers several turret presses , and press kits .
The Lee 4 hole turret press sells for just $ 64 ; or as a kit for $ 103 .
The Lee Classic 4 hole turret press ; which is one of the strongest turret presses made ; sells for just $ 83 .
Even better , if you load multiple calibers , the spare turret heads for either are just $ 10 .
Now , you could get the 4 hole turret press kit for $ 102 ; but it comes with less stuff than is included with the Anniversary kit ; and honestly I do n't like the auto - disk powder measure they include .
I think their " perfect " powder measure is better and more useful .
Disk or bar measures are notoriously inaccurate ( though consistent from charge to charge ) , and you have to change disks out to change the charge weight .
The " perfect measure " is a screw type measure , which generally work better for everything but really large extruded powders ( which do well in disk or bar types ) and flake powders , which do n't meter well in any measure .
One option would be to buy the Anniversary kit , AND the Turret press .
That 's not as screwy as it sounds , because the kit includes almost all the accessories you need ( as we talked about above ) , for a price below what you can buy them for ... and you 'd have another press thrown in to the bargain ( a $ 40 value ) .
That would total out to $ 196 , or $ 214 with the calipers ( which you really should get ) .
That said , you may not want another press ( though a second single stage press is a surprisingly useful thing to complement a turret press if you have room .
I personally have two turret presses in fact ) .
You may not have the room , or feel like spending the cash .
Going with the Turret Press Kit , your costs would look something like this1 .
Lee turret press kit : $ 102 ( includes ) : * Lee 4 hole turret press *
Lee auto disk measure *
Lee safety scale * basic case prep toolsto that you need to add : 2 . Lee classic 3 die set : $ 21 including shellholder3 .
Lyman calipers : $ 284 .
Bullet puller : $ 125 .
Lee powder funnel : $ 36 .
loading tray : $ 47 .
Lyman reloading manual : $ 17 For a total of $ 187 ( vs $ 214 for the anniversary kit , the turret press , and the other accessories ) .
You 'll not one thing however ; this setup does n't include the Lee Auto Prime .
The press itself has a priming tool ; but I personally prefer ( and recommend to others ) to hand prime using a priming tool .
The Lee auto prime is $ 10 , plus the cost of shellholders ( $ 3 for a single holder , or $ 12 for a set of 11 - yeah , the better deal is obvious ) for an extra $ 13 or $ 22 dollars , brining the grand total up to $ 200 , or $ 209 dollars .
$ 209 vs $ 214 ... for all the same accessories , and you get an extra press and a better powder measure ?
See , I told you buying the anniversary kit just for the accessories was n't crazy .
Now , if you do n't buy any kit at all , and just assemble the component your self , it looks like this : 1 . Lee 4 hole turret press : $ 64 ( or $ 19 more for the stronger 4 hole classic ) 2 .
Lee 3 die set : $ 21 including shellholder3 .
Lee safety scale : $ 19 ( $ 30 more gets you into a pretty decent scale ) 4 .
Lee perfect powder measure : $ 195 .
Lee auto prime : $ 10 plus shellholder $ 3 ( I ’d spend the $ 12 for the 11 holder set ) 6 .
Lyman stainless dial caliper : $ 287 .
Frankford bullet puller : $ 12 ( it ’s exactly the same as the more expensive Hornady ) 8 . lee powder funnel : $ 39 .
Hornady 50rd universal loading tray : $ 4 ( the same as MTM , but cheaper ) That 's $ 192 ( or $ 183 with just one shellholder ) ; saving you $ 22 over buying the anniversary kit and the turret press together ; but the items above do n't include the $ 15 worth of case prep tools ( that you do n't need for pistols , only for rifles ) .
In fact , if you buy the stronger classic turret press ( either are good , but the classic is a bit better ) , it 's only a $ 3 difference , but you still do n't get those $ 15 worth of case prep bits .
Again I say , think about buying the Anniversary kit just for the accessories .
It 's like getting a free single stage press .
Taken independent of the press or any kit , the price for all the other bits and bobs needed to reload comes out to $ 118 , presuming sticking with the basic Lee setup ( 0r $ 133 with the case prep bits , which you do n't need for pistol but do for rifle ) .
Now , let 's talk about why you might not want to buy any of the kits at all : upgrading the components .
The kits are certainly a great value , but they do skimp on the components a bit ; most notably the powder measure , and the scale .
That is n't to say that the " perfect powder measure " and " safety scale " do n't do the job , they work fine ( in fact I have two Lee safety scales on my bench ) ; but they are n't all that great .
Both are slower to work with and less precise than an upgraded piece may be .
Taking these one at a time , let 's start with the safety scale .
The scale retails for $ 19 ; and is the least expensive powder scale you can buy ; but it does a workmanlike job for what it is .
The problem is , the arm is plastic , the scale itself is n't very precise or repeatable , the adjustment mechanism is fiddly and drifts , and the scale only has a 100 gr capacity so you cant use it for weighing most pistol bullets or loaded cartridges .
For $ 25 more , you could upgrade to the Lyman Pro 500 ; for $ 30 more you could go to the Hornady model M scale , or for $ 35 the Lyman pro 1000 ; all much better scales , and all with at least 5 times the capacity of the safety scale .
For $ 40 more you could go to the Lyman Model 500 or RCBS 502 , better still .
These are cast metal based scales , with leveling adjustments , and high precision beams with agate bearings .
That means they 're more accurate , and more precise ( more repeatable ) ; plus they work faster .
Finally , for $ 50 more you could go to the RCBS 505 ; which is the standard by which all other low cost balance beam scales are judged .
It too has the cast metal base , adjustable leveling , metal components in all critical locations , and agate bearings .
It 's also a triple poise beam ( there are three adjsutable weights ) , which gives an easier , more consistent , and more accurate reading ; though honestly there is n't a huge advantage over the $ 10 cheaper 502 .
The next step up in beam scales is into the RCBS 1010 ; which is pretty much the gold standard for manual balance beam scales , and sells in the $ 130 range .
I do n't mean to knock the Lee scale ; it 's great for what it is .
Hell , I 'd guess almost every reloader starts off with one ; but you wont find many serious reloaders , or competitive benchresters ( the second are almost always the first ) with safety scales as their primary scales ( though I think just about everybody has one as a backup ) .
The RCBS 502 and 505 though ; are on a hell of a lot of serious loaders benches ; and if they are n't it 's probably because they 've got a 1010 ( or maybe a Lyman model 500 or model 1000 ) .
The next step up is into electronic scales .
Now , I HIGHLY recommend you buy an electronic scale when you can ; they just make life a lot simpler ; especially when weighing individual charges for rifles .
The decent electronic scales start at about $ 85 with the lowest end PACT model , then progress up to $ 100 for the low end Lyman and RCBS models .
They continue up through to the $ 120 range for the mid grade PACT , RCBS , and Lyman models ; and finish up in the $ 150 range for the PACT precision , Lyman 1500 , or RCBS Charge Master scales , all of which can interface with an electronic powder measure .
So , taking that original $ 118 bits and bobs number ( again this is independent of the press itself ) and knocking it down to $ 99 by deleting the Lee scale ; you can see that a basic scale upgrade to a Hornady M brings you to about $ 150 , going to the Lyman 500 or RCBS 502 brings you to about $ 160 , and going to the 505 brings you to $ 170 ( if you wanted the 1010 , that would be $ 230 ; and I think not worth it at this stage )
On the electronic side , going to the low end PACT brings you up to $ 185 , with the low end Lyman and RCBS at $ 200 ; the midrange for all three at $ 220 , and the high end for all three at about $ 250 .
See , the thing is , I'm of a particular philosophy when it comes to buying durable goods ( and reloading equipment certainly qualifies ) .
I do n't buy the top of the line just to have " the best " , I buy for quality ; and generally speaking I do n't want to spend $ 20 now on a product and then need to spend $ 50 later when I have to upgrade .
I 'd rather just spend the $ 50 now ; than spend $ 70 total to end up with one inferior product , and one superior ... unless I need a spare of something anyway .
The same philosophy applies with powder measures .
The lee perfect measure is fine , but it's not the best built ( it 's a bit plasticky ) .
It 's not terribly durable , nor is it very large , or very smooth .
There are four dominant powder measures out there for benchtop use , and those are the RCBS Uniflow , the Lyman # 55 , the Redding # 3 , and the Hornady Lock 'n 'load .
All but the Lyman use the same metering mechanism , a drum with a piston that screws in and out to vary volume ( the Lyman uses a drum with two bars that move in an out with threaded adjusters at one end of each ) .
The Lee perfect measure uses the same system as the others actually , it just executes it in a much cheaper fashion .
I have both a Lyman # 55 and a Uniflow ; and I much prefer the feel of the Uniflow .
It 's smoother , and has a better " throw action " so to speak , as well as I think better adjustments ( especially if you include the $ 30 micrometer drum ) .
Either sell for about $ 70 , or about $ 50 more than the lee ; and can be mounted on the edge of the bench , or in a spare tools station in your press using a powder die .
Bench stands that mount the measures about a foot off the benchtop are available for about $ 20 more each .
The Hornady measure is supposed to be excellent , and costs $ 10 less than the Lyman or RCBS .
The Redding is used by a LOT of competitive shooters ( though I believe the uniflow is most popular ) , but it 's $ 40 more expensive than the RCBS ( it includes a micrometer adjuster , which is $ 30 extra for the RCBS ) .
Electric automatic units , for use with electric scales , start at about $ 115 for the PACT and go up to about $ 180 for the RCBS .
They 're great for precision loading ; but they can't throw charges nearly as fast as manual measures ( for rifle loading this is n't that big a deal , but for volume pistol loading it is ) .
Actually , given an electronic scale though , they can throw a weighed rifle charge a lot faster ( about 10 seconds ) , than you can throw a charge , weigh it , and trickle it up to the precise weight manually ( about 20 seconds ) .
If you are n't really worried about volume , there 's nothing wrong with the Lee ; but you 're going to want a better measure eventually , and why spend $ 20 now , and $ 70 later for a total of $ 90 ; when you could just spend the $ 70 now ?
Running those same numbers , as before for accessories independent of the press , we get this picture : $ 118 minus $ 19 for deleting the Lee Measure is $ 99 .
Going to the Hornady is $ 60 for about $ 160 .
The RCBS or Lyman bring us up to $ 170 , the Redding to $ 210 ( I do n't think it 's worth the difference ) .
To go to the electrics by themselves , would cost $ 220 for the pact , or $ 280 for the RCBS .
Now , combining the scale upgrade with the powder measure upgrade , we run from $ 150 , $ 160 , and $ 170 for the Hornady M , RCBS 502 , and RCBS 505 respectively ; plus $ 40 over the cost of the Lee for the Hornady , and $ 50 for the RCBS or Lyman measures ( let 's ignore the redding ) .
So keeping it all manual , that 's between $ 190 and $ 210 , independent of the press .
With the 4 hole turret press , thats $ 254 to $ 274 , and with the classic turret it 's $ 274 to $ 294 .
Moving to a manual measure and an electronic scale , we get $ 185 for the low end PACT , $ 200 for the low end RCBS and Lyman , $ 220 for the mid range of all three , and $ 250 for the high end of all three ; plus $ 40 or $ 50 over the Lee for Hornady , RCBS or Lyman measures .
That comes out to $ 225 at the low end , and $ 300 at the high end .
With the Lee 4 hole turret press , that 's $ 289 to $ 364 , and with the Classic Turret it 's $ 309 to $ 384 So , to upgrade your scale and measure ( and you really should do them together if you can ) you are looking at between $ 70 and $ 100 above the Lee for the manual scales ; and between $ 105 and $ 180 above for the electronic scales .
The great thing about these upgrades though , and going against what I said earlier about not wanting to spend the money twice , is that the Lee bits are only $ 20 each .
If you want to start cheap and then go better as your budget allows , you 're only out $ 20 or $ 40 going with Lee to start .
Now , if you 're only going to upgrade to the $ 50 scale and the $ 60 powder measure , it really makes sense to spend the extra $ 70 now ; but if you think you 'll eventually upgrade to an electronic setup , maybe waiting is n't a bad idea .
Here 's the kicker ; and this is why I said you may want to upgrade your powder measure and scale at the same time , leaving everything else the same :
If you want to get an electronic scale , and a manual powder measure , that 's great .
In fact thats what I 'm currently using , and I recommend it highly .
Honestly , for $ 295 with the Lee 4 hole press ; that 's a great loading setup .
You could be happy with it for years ... or forever if you only loaded pistol .
It 's got all the things you need , plus some extras to make your life easier ; and a good press .
But ...... and this is moving back into the higher end of things ...... for $ 220 to $ 260 ; you can buy an electronic powder measure and scale combo from RCBS , Lyman , or PACT ( I prefer the RCBS ) .
That 's $ 75 to $ 115 more than a manual powder measure with electronic scale ; and if you have the money to spend , it 's a great deal .
Of course it 's a big run from $ 40 for the low end Lee powder measure and scale , up to $ 260 .
At that point we 're no longer reloading on that tight budget ; I 'm just illustrating where you can go with it .
Also , I recommend that you have a manual powder measure anyway , for doing high volume pistol reloading ; the electric measures are really for competitive shooters who weigh each charge , or rifle shooters .
For most reloaders , the $ 70 difference between the low end Lee scale and measure , and the Hornady LnL and Model M ; the $ 110 difference for the Uniflow and RCBS 505 ; or the $ 115 to $ 135 difference for a Uniflow and a low end electronic scale ; are very much worth it .
The benefits to both speed and precision are really very significant , and you 're saving time and mony in the long run .
I think most loaders would WANT an automatic powder dispenser system such as mentioned here ( I know I do ) , but they are expensive ; and I think most people might balk at $ 190 to $ 220 more than just the basic Lee setup .
Also as I said , the manual measures deal with rapid reloading from the block better than electronics do .
The final place to look to for upgrades , is the press itself .
This time I 'll make no qualifiers ; I think the Lee classic turret is as strong and well made as any other press out there ... but ...
I do n't think it 's as tough as some , or as well finished etc ... What I mean by saying it's as strong but not as tough , is that I think it will take a hell of a lot of force applied to it ; but I do n't think it will stand up to as much use and abuse over its lifetime as some other designs ; because it 's a bolted together press rather than a cast frame .
Also , the Lees have one major weakness ; they only have 4 stations .
This means you can't have two pistol calibers set up at once ; and if you are using a powder die , you can only use a 3 die set instead of a 4 die set ( 4 die sets use a separate seating and crimping die ; and you generally get better results with them ) .
The Lees do somewhat make up for having only 4 holes by offering very low cost quick change toolheads ( $ 10 for lee , vs $ 35 for Lymans quick change turrets , and RCBS at $ 40 ) , but I like the ability to use more tool stations offered by a six hole turret press like the Lyman or RCBS .
The Lees also share an advantage with RCBS in that they can be used in an auto indexed mode .
This feature allows the presses to operate somewhat like a progressive press , where each pull of the handle rotates the tool head , so four pulls on a case ( decap and size with priming on the up stroke , expand case mouth , dispense powder , seat and crimp ) produces a loaded round .
This seems at first like a big advantage ; but without automatic priming , and automatic case feeding and ejection , it does n't really increase production speed all that much ; and it reduces the durability and increases the mechanical complexity of the press .
If it 's auto - indexed like a progressive , why does n't it increase speed very much ( if at all , over batch processing ) ?
After all , progressives are three to eight times faster than loading on a turret press .
In a progressive press , because there are multiple cartridge stations as well as multiple tool stations ; all four operations are performed simultaneously , and a loaded round is produced with every stroke of the handle .
An auto indexed turret press only has a single cartridge station , and therefore just like a manually indexed press , still takes 4 pulls ( presuming a press mounted powder measure - 3 pulls if you 're charging on the bench not the press ) for every round .
Honestly , the only real time savings is that you do n't have to rotate the turret by hand with each pull ; or if using batch processing , you do n't have to put the cartridge back into the press three times ( in batch processing you do n't use the press ram to dispense powder , you manually charge each case with the powder measure in large batches ) .
Personally , it 's a nice to have feature for some , but I do n't care for it unless it's on a progressive press with a case feeder .
Anyway , let 's leave aside those progressives for a minute .
It may be a combination of personal preference , convenience , and value ; but I just like the Lyman T - Mag .
It sells for just $ 140 ( $ 60 more than the Lee classic or $ 80 more than the 4 hole ) , and I think makes an excellent upgrade .
I have two of them myself , that 's how much I like them .
To go to the T - mag and keep everything else the same as above would run from $ 260 for the full basic Lee outfit , to $ 330 for the upgraded manual powder measure and scale , to $ 390 for the Uniflow and a low end RCBS or Lyman electronic scale .
Lyman also offer the T - Mag II in kit form , for either $ 295 or $ 365 ( the former for mechanical scale , the latter for electronic ) .
This includes :* T - Mag 2 Turret press * Universal Trimmer with Expanded Pilot Multi-pack * Lyman 1000XP
Electronic Scale ( normally $ 100 ) , or Pro 500 scale ( normally $ 45 ) * # 55 Powder Measure * Universal Priming Arm * Primer Tray * Auto Primer Feed * Extra Decapping Pins * 48th Edition Reloading Handbook * Primer Catcher * Deburring Tool* Powder Funnel * Case Lube Kit* Quick Release Turret System * 7/8 ” x 14 Adapter ( mounts # 55 powder measure in press turret )
All you need other than that is a die set and shellholder , for $ 22 total ; and an autoprime with shelholders if you do n’t want to use the presses autopriming tool for another $ 13 or $ 22 ; a bullet puller for $ 12 and a loading tray for $ 4 ; or $ 38 - $ 60 over and above the kit price .
That works out to $ 355 or $ 425 total ( for manual or electric scale ) , and you get a case trimming lathe and bits included with it .
That 's compared $ 275 or $ 295 for the manual scale and Lee 4 hole turret or classic turret ; and $ 310 or $ 330 with the electronic scale .
For $ 60 or $ 80 more , on the manual side ; or $ 95 to $ 115 more for the electronic ; you get a better press , and the same or better kit to go with it .
Plus you 're getting a case trimming lathe and all the accessories ; which is worth ... you guessed , it , about $ 80 ( $ 60 for the trimmer , $ 20 for the bits and collets ) .
If you are just going to reload pistol , you do n't necessarily need the case trimming gear ; but it 's a good thing to have .
RCBS makes a great turret press that sells for $ 175 , and a kit to go with it ; but they want about $ 60 more for it than the Lyman kit ; and the lyman kit has a case trimming lathe ( a very useful thing when you load rifle ) .
On the plus side , the RCBS kit includes the 502 scale , a much better scale than the pro 500 in the Lyman kit ; and it also includes the UniFlow powder measure , a better measure than the Lyman 55 .
Actually , I really wish they'd take the Rockchucker supreme kit ; and substitute the turret press in for the ' chucker and call it a day .
That kit includes the 505 scale , and the RCBS hand priming tool ; both excellent choices .
The Bottom Line : It takes as little as $ 135 ( or really $ 160 ) to get in , but it 's really just over $ 200 for a reasonable setup .
Seems another $ 80 - $ 150 and you 've got some really great gear there ; and for another $ 200 or so over that , and you 're into the luxury zone with electronic automatic stuff .
That 's $ 200 for a basic single stage turret and all accessories ; to $ 300 for a very reasonable , high quality setup with upgraded scale and powder measure ; all the way up to over $ 550 for a top quality press , and electronic powder measure and scale ; with a lot of room for a variety of budgets in between .
Do n't ever say I did n't give you options ... My recommendation for those on the tightest budget ?
Make it stretch to include the 4 hole turret press outfit as listed above ( not the kit ) for $ 192 ( or even better buy the turret press AND the anniversary kit for $ 214 ) .
If you can swing the money to upgrade the scale and powder measure , do the measure first at an additional $ 44 for the Hornady , then for $ 40 more , upgrade your scale to the RCBS 502 .
Thats $ 85 more than the straight low end Lee setup ; or just about $ 275 .
If you are going to load a lot of large or magnum rifle , or you plan on doing any brass forming ( modifying one brass case into another type ) ; upgrade to the classic turret press for another $ 20 or $ 295 total ; or spend the $ 80 over the 4 hole , and go to the Lyman for $ 355 .
Just for comparison purposes , my own personal setup is made up from the pieces I describe above : I 've got two Lyman presses , the RCBS uniflow powder measure and the Lyman # 55 , and pretty much all the other Lee bits except dies ( I'm using Lyman and RCBS dies ) .
When the money allows , I 'll spend the $ 260 on the RCBS automatic powder dispenser and scale ( for now I 'm using a low end electronic scale with a Lee Safety for backup ) .
So yay , for $ 350 - $ 400 you can be just like me ( or at least just like my setup anyway , without the extra turret press and powder measure ) ; or for $ 550 kick my butt with your automatic electronic goodness .
Or if you are doing a lot of volume in a single caliber , you could even go to the Load - Master progressive , with accessories and an electronic scale , for under $ 400 ; and REALLY kick my ass .
Until I get my RL650 that is ... bwahahahahahaha , then I shall take over the WORLD !!!
Oh , did I say that out loud ?
Sorry , disregard immediately .
It 's 2 am , I 've been up since 6:30 after 4 hours of sleep , and I can barely keep my eyes open .
I 'm sure I 've written a bunch of gibberish above , but I 'm too tired to proofread it .
I 'll fix it in the morning when I wake up .

Previously , he served as chief speechwriter for New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and was a columnist and associate editor for The New York Sun .
CNN Independent analyst John Avlon says an escalation of angry rhetoric and actions this week are the results of hate in the service of hyper - partisanship .
By John Avlon , Special to CNN
In the wake of the health care vote , we ’ve seen an escalation of angry rhetoric and actions , fueling this week ’s wingnuts to ugly new heights of incitement .
At least ten members of the House of Representatives received death threats this week while Republican House Leader Eric Cantor reported that bullets had been fired at his district offices in Virginia .
Four local Democratic Party offices and district congressional offices had their windows broken with bricks .
All this follows the online exhortations of militia leader Mike Vanderboegh , who wrote on his blog this past Friday : “ If we break the windows of hundreds , thousands , of Democrat party headquarters across this country , we might just wake up enough of them to make defending ourselves at the muzzle of a rifle unnecessary . ”
I interviewed Vanderboegh at length late last year for my book " Wingnuts . "
He is a self - described “ former leftist ” and SDS member who became a Second Amendment activist and leader in the militia movement during the 1990s .
Last year , he co-founded a loosely - affiliated Hatriot group known as the Three Percenters .
Over the past year , he has detailed his unhinged opposition to the Obama administration : “ You should understand that we are rapidly coming to a point in this country when half of the people are going to become convinced of the illegitimacy of this administration and its designs upon our liberty .
Need I remind you that this side is the one with most of the firearms ? ”
This week he ’s been hitting the radio show circuit to promote his message .
This is n’t just wingnut stuff , it ’s indicative of a new breed of Hatriot militias – those who believe its patriotic to fear the government and hate the president .
It ’s the politics of incitement .
At a time when Sarah Palin posted a Facebook page with gun-scope cross-hairs on the districts of Democratic representatives she is seeking to unseat this fall , the unhinged could be getting further encouragement from the former GOP VP nominee .
In light of the death threats , decency and a modicum of good judgment should inspire Palin to take that map down immediately .
On the left , radio host Mike Malloy is at the ugly rhetoric again , this time targeting conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife Ginni .
Mrs. Thomas formed a group with sympathies for the Tea Party protesters , remarking “ I did not give up my First Amendment rights when my husband became a justice of the Supreme Court . ”
Send in your suggestions for ' Wingnuts of the Week '
Malloy exercised his first amendment rights by launching an ugly attack on Justice Thomas , calling him a “ House Negro ” and in transcripts raising the question of whether the Thomas ’ interracial marriage ( " She ’s a very , very , very , very , very white Omaha , Nebraska woman married to a very , very , very , very black South Georgia man " ) would cause a problem for the Tea Party protesters he reflexively calls racist .
This is an example of race - baiting from the left , wrapped in the arrogance of assumed ideological superiority .
Hate is a cheap and easy recruiting tool in politics – and in talk radio .
But we are starting to see the results of hate in the service of hyper - partisanship .
The extremes encourage and incite each other .
We should n’t have to wait for further escalation to recognize the danger of this dynamic on our domestic politics .

Madrid , Spain ( CNN ) --
Two passengers aboard a cruise ship were killed when 26 - foot waves crashed into the vessel Wednesday off northeast Spain , officials said .
Fourteen others were injured .
The Greece - based Louis Cruise Lines ship was in the Mediterranean north of Barcelona when it was hit by three " abnormal " waves , each about 26 feet ( 9 meters ) high , cruise line spokesman Michael Maratheftis said .
As a result , five windows in public areas -- on the forward part , or bow , of the 14 - deck ship -- were smashed , and two male passengers -- a German and an Italian -- were killed , he said .
Fourteen others were treated aboard the ship for light injuries but were hospitalized as a precaution when the ship returned to Barcelona on Wednesday night , Maratheftis said .
Spain 's state news agency reported that two of the passengers had serious injuries , including a 62 - year - old woman with fractures in both legs .
Maratheftis would not provide specifics , but said there were no life - threatening injuries to the 14 wounded passengers .
The vessel , the Louis Majesty , was sailing under a Maltese flag and traveling from Barcelona , Spain , to Genoa , Italy , the Greek Public Ministry of the Mercantile Marine said .
The incident occurred 24 miles off the coast of Cabo de San Sebastian near the Spanish town of Palafrugell , Maratheftis said
The ship had 1,350 passengers and 580 crew members , the Greek ministry said .
The passengers , including three Americans , were from 27 nations , Maratheftis said in phone interviews from Cyprus .
Buoy data off the French coast indicated that weather was the likely cause of the high waves .
Winds were at 45 mph at that buoy .
All of the passengers were to be flown home on Thursday from Barcelona at the expense of Louis Cruise Lines , Maratheftis said .
" The next cruise has been canceled , " and the Louis Majesty will remain in Barcelona for repairs , Maratheftis said .
The vessel is due to resume cruises on March 14 , he said .

It was , quite literally , a diamond in the rough .
Appraised at $ 17,600 , a 2.6 - carat diamond ring with a platinum band discovered last week among donations at Goodwill ’s distribution center at 627 N. Cameron St. in Harrisburg is the most expensive item ever given to Goodwill Industries Keystone Area , spokeswoman Jennifer Ross said .
It ’s almost scary how easily the precious piece blended in with the no-longer - wanted gaudy gold , rhinestones , and cubic zirconia that flow through Goodwill ’s thrift stores , Ross said .
“ It could have ended up with a price tag of $ 5.99 , ” she said .
“ It makes me think about what treasures might be out there in some of our stores . ”
The box it nested in “ did n’t scream money , ” Ross said .
But the filigree swirls on the band caught Barry Landis ’ eye .
The retired jeweler from Camp Hill , who has sorted through Goodwill ’s jewelry for the last two years , said he trembled while palming the slightly tarnished and dirty yet elegant 2 - carat European diamond surrounded by 14 smaller diamonds .
Landis said 90 percent of the donated jewelry he sorts through is costume jewelry .
Was it an accidental donation ?
A relic of an ended marriage ?
A discarded family heirloom ?
No one called missing a ring , Ross said .
“ We can have fun thinking up stories behind it , but we just have no idea why it was donated , ” Ross said .

( Natural News ) Public health warnings about the skin cancer risks associated with sun exposure have led people to avoid sunlight to such an extent that vitamin D deficiencies have now become widespread , according to a study conducted by researchers from King 's College London .
The body produces vitamin D upon exposure to the ultraviolet radiation from sunlight .
It takes only 15 minutes of sun on the face and hands each day for a fair - skinned person to produce enough vitamin D for their body , although it takes longer for darker - skinned people and those living far from the equator , particularly in the winter .
Nevertheless , vitamin D deficiency appears widespread .
One recent study from University College London estimated that 12 percent of men and 20 percent of women are clinically deficient in the vitamin , while 57 percent of men and nearly 67 percent of women have insufficient levels .
Vitamin D plays a critical role in bone development and health , and is now also believed to help protect against high blood pressure , cancer , autoimmune diseases and asthma .
" There has been so much effort put into telling people about the damaging effects of ultraviolet light from sunshine , many now take extreme measures to ensure they do n't get exposure by wearing moisturizers with factor 15 all year round , " said lead researcher Veronique Bataille , calling for new guidelines on sun exposure .
" We do n't want to say that sunbathing is healthy as there is clearly a risk , but people do need a bit of sunshine to stay healthy .
" Bataille and colleagues measured blood vitamin D levels of 1,414 white women in the United Kingdom and collected information on their skin type , use of tanning beds , and history of foreign holidays and sunburns .
They found that contrary to expectation , the women with the lightest skin actually had the lowest levels of vitamin D .
The researchers concluded that this was likely due to lighter - skinned women avoiding the sun over fear of skin cancer Light - skinned women were also less likely to use tanning beds or take vacations out of Britain .

American author Barbara Ehrenreich has been all over the British media this week as she pays a flying visit to the UK to promote her latest book Smile or Die : How Positive Thinking Fooled America and the World .
And aside from a slight concern about her carbon footprint , I ’m happy that she made it .
My enthusiasm for Ehrenreich ’s attack on positivity might seem odd given nef ’s long - standing interest in well - being , but , in fact , Smile or Die does a lot to illustrate the problems with shallow , individualistic conceptions of happiness .
In her book , Ehrenreich argues that the ideology of positive thinking peddled by self - help gurus like Deepak Chopra or Steven Covey tells people that negative feelings ought to be suppressed and that remaining positive will inevitably bring success .
This she argues , is a pernicious con trick– all our lives include problems and it ’s natural and healthy to respond to these with sadness and anger .
In a lecture at the Royal Society of Arts earlier this week , Ehrenreich went further , looking at the relationship between positive thinking and inequality .
By telling us that success comes from psychological strength , not from privilege , inherited wealth or even pure luck , positive thinking encourages us to blame ourselves , rather than social factors , for the problems that we experience .
By telling us that we all get what we deserve , these ideas serve a profound role in convincing us to accept the huge , destructive inequalities that we see in modern , western societies .
In fact , in nef ’s work to identify what real well - being means , we are keenly aware of the impact of society on individuals .
While the social roots of material factors like the place where you work , to the community where you live , or your physical health are clear , even the more ‘ internal ’ factors , such as resilience and individual aspirations and expectations , which also shape our experience , are ultimately formed by societal factors such as schooling and the influence of media .
Achieving greater well - being for all means creating a society where we all have access to the things we need .
Strong communities , meaningful jobs , freedom from material poverty , a culture which supports genuine psychological health , not empty positivity : these are the factors that build real well - being .
And if we ’re going to achieve these things , negative emotions might be just what we need .
After all , if we really want to build a fairer , better society , free from the spectres of poverty , despair and social isolation , I ca n’t think of a better way to start than getting angry .

The Israeli military had to cancel a planned operation after a soldier posted the details of the upcoming mission on Facebook .
" The soldier also disclosed the name of the combat unit , the place of the operation and the time it will take place , " Haaretz reports .
The soldier actually wrote , " On Wednesday we clean up Qatanah [ a village near Ramallah ] , and on Thursday , god willing , we come home . "

Most college freshmen fill their dorm rooms with clothes , books , and electronics .
Thiago Olson also brought his fusion reactor .
But Vanderbilt University drew the line :
No do - it - yourself reactors in the dorm !
Instead , his device was housed in a nearby laboratory .
Olson ’s project was motivated by the challenge of doing fusion — and by the same promise that has inspired thousands of physicists over the past half century .
Nuclear fusion is the energy source that powers the sun ; if channeled correctly , it could become a major source of clean energy here on Earth .
Fusion occurs when the nuclei of two atoms are forced so close to each other that they bind together , releasing a great deal of energy in the process .
Because positively charged nuclei forcefully repel each other , though , high temperatures are needed to bring about a union .
Most fusion reactors are therefore enormous machines , like the $ 3.5 billion National Ignition Facility that recently opened in California .
Olson and a small cadre of other amateur nuclear engineers have found a simpler way .
They are creating home - grown reactors , welding and wiring the devices in their backyards , garages , and basements ( much to the alarm of neighbors ) .
The hazards to the community are slim , the main ones being heavy use of electricity and short - range radiation that can be of risk to the “ fusioneers ” themselves .
You can find out more about building a fusion reactor at www.fusor.net, an online community of fusioneers who help each other find parts , assemble , and problem solve .
Also , check out a pair of books , Radiation Detection and Measurement by Glenn F. Knoll and Building Scientific Apparatus by John H. Moore .
If you decide to proceed , though , a few cautions : Beware of high - voltage electricity , which can skyrocket to more than 50,000 volts — enough that contact with a loose wire will kill you instantly .
Pressurized flammable gas can also be fatal .
And electrons hitting the stainless steel chamber produce X - rays , so do not look at the little window directly .
Instead use a camera or leaded glass filter .
Contact your state ’s department of health for regulations .
Your reactor will use a lot more energy than it produces .
It is barely capable of achieving a detectable nuclear reaction , so fusion is one of the least hazardous parts of this project .
For those who would like to join in on the fusion fun , DISCOVER offers this guide to the essentials .
With a lot of scrounging for cheap parts online or at scrapyards , plus a lot of elbow grease , it is possible to put together a fusion reactor for as little as $ 1,000 .
If you need fusion right now , though , you can pay retail and get what you need for about $ 20,000 .
RADIATION DETECTION EQUIPMENT
Prove that you really achieved fusion by using a bubble dosimeter , which provides instant visual verification and measurement of neutrons produced by fusion reactions .
If you get bubbles , you did it !
Price : $ 120
VACUUM CHAMBER
Get a stainless steel chamber to seal your fusion particles in and to keep air out .
Olson ’s vacuum is made from an old mass spectrometer he found on eBay .
You will probably need a lot of bolts to get the chamber closed tightly , and possibly a large flange for patching up a gaping hole , which can cost $ 500 .
If you are a student , try asking the manufacturer for a discount .
Price : $ 300 –$ 4,000
DEUTERIUM
The atomic nuclei in the hydrogen plasma are what collide to create fusion inside the chamber .
Deuterium , or heavy hydrogen , is found in seawater , but it is hard to separate from its far more common , lighter cousin .
Its distribution is also tightly regulated due to its close ties to nuclear technology .
Unless you have special connections , a business or university will need to request it on your behalf .
Price : around $ 250 for 50 liters of gas in a lecture bottle
HIGH -VOLTAGE POWER
You will need at least 20,000 volts * and a 10 - milliamp current to create enough heat to crush those hydrogen nuclei together .
Remember that because you are trying to attract positive deuterium ions , you want negative output , so you must ground the positive charge .
Olson uses an X - ray transformer salvaged from an old mammogram machine .
A commercial power supply by Spellman or Glassman is another option , or the intrepid electrician can make one from scratch .
Price : $ 400 – $ 10,000
VACUUM PUMP
Suck all the unwanted particles out of the chamber .
A two - stage roughing pump will get you to a near vacuum .
Then use a turbo or oil diffusion pump to reach a high vacuum .
Price : $ 350 –$ 4,000
GAS REGULATOR
Use this to inject tiny amounts of deuterium into the chamber and to regulate pressure inside your reactor .
Needle valves can fine - tune the amount going in ; capillary tubing ( with an inner diameter as narrow as a pin ) will really slow it down .
If you can afford to , forget those and instead use a mass flow controller , which allows you to delegate the job to your computer .
Price : $ 100 –$ 200

Canadians will likely hear within a year that certain Crown corporations and assets are going up for sale , federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty says .
Flaherty made the revelation in a pre-taped interview with CBC's The House to be broadcast Saturday .
He was asked by host Kathleen Petty about the potential sale of Crown assets as a way to tackle the deficit .
" There are some opportunities there for some privatization of businesses that one questions why the government is in them anymore , " Flaherty said .
" So we 'll look at those and I expect that in the next year we 'll be able to make some announcements . "
The finance minister did n't specify which assets could go on the auction block but indicated it would not be limited to real estate or other tangible assets but include privatizing some services and Crown corporations .
The 2010 federal budget , tabled by Flaherty in the House of Commons on Thursday , includes a $ 53.8 billion deficit in 2009 - 10 and a $ 49.2 billion deficit in 2010 - 11 .
Flaherty 's plan to reduce deficits in subsequent years is built largely on strong economic growth and some $ 17.6 billion worth of savings in government expenditures over the next five years .
Corporate assets under review
The savings , according to the budget , will largely come from streamlining and reducing the operating and administrative costs of government .
The budget identified $ 1.2 billion in projected savings over the next five years from strategic reviews officially announced in the 2009 budget , including a review of corporate assets .
This year 's budget documents do not indicate what conclusions or recommendations have been reached so far , except to describe the process as " continuing . "
Flaherty would not disclose how much money could be generated by such sales but said there were " some substantial opportunities . "
The prospect of selling Crown assets to balance the budget and avoid a deficit was first raised by the minister in 2008 .
In December , the government announced it was selling off the commercial reactor division of Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd , a Crown corporation .
Last summer , the minister said strategic reviews were being conducted on his own portfolio , Finance , as well as Indian and Northern Affairs , Natural Resources and Transport and Infrastructure — as " prudent business management . "
He also said Heritage Canada , the department that oversees the CBC , was not one of the departments being reviewed .
It is one of the most notorious scenes ever filmed – yet Hitchcock and Janet Leigh did n't tell the truth about it .
Will Hodgkinson on a real - life story of body doubles and murder
In the run-up to the release of Psycho in 1960 , Alfred Hitchcock did everything he could to build up the suspense .
" No one will be admitted to the theatre after the start of each performance , " declared the poster , bearing a sulky - looking Hitchcock wagging a finger .
The director bought up all copies of the original novel , which he had optioned for a paltry $ 9,000 , so that hardly anyone would know how the story ended .
He also filmed on a closed set and forced cast and crew to sign an agreement promising not to mention the ending to anyone .
There were no advance screenings .
When the reviews for Psycho , which is rereleased this week , rolled in , they focused on one shocking moment : the shower sequence , in which Janet Leigh is slashed to death .
Comprising over 70 shots , each lasting two or three seconds , it has become one of the most infamous moments in horror movie history .
Mixing fast cutting and Bernard Herrmann 's screeching music , Hitchcock created a brilliant illusion of gore , violence and nudity – while actually showing very little .
The greatest illusion , however , was to give a very clear suggestion that it was Leigh being hacked to death , by Anthony Perkins as a cross - dressing maniac .
Leigh , in her first interview after the film 's release , shared the audience 's horror : " I believed that knife went into me .
It was that real , that horrifying .
I could feel it ! "
In later interviews , Hitchcock and Leigh categorically stated that it was her body in the shower scene – but it was n't .
The body belonged to a model called Marli Renfro .
When you can't see Leigh 's face in the shots , you 're looking at her body double .
A Dallas - born stripper who worked in Las Vegas , Renfro was one of the first Playboy Bunnies .
Apart from Psycho , she only appeared in one other film , Francis Ford Coppola 's 1962 soft - porn comedy - western Tonight for Sure .
Then she disappeared , forgotten – until a news report in 2001 said a 34 - year - old handyman had been sentenced for raping and strangling her , a crime that had occurred in 1988 but had gone unsolved for over a decade .
The US writer Robert Graysmith – author of Zodiac , the classic account of the 1970s San Francisco serial killer – was fascinated .
He had been interested in Renfro and had always thought about writing a book about her .
Now it seemed she had died in a murder that was a gruesome echo of the fictional one she had helped to make so famous .
The original 2001 Associated Press report said Kenneth Dean Hunt , the handyman , had been convicted of " killing two women , including an actress who was a body double for Janet Leigh in the film Psycho " .
This actress was called Myra Davis ; subsequent press reports explained that this was Renfro 's real name .
Graysmith probed deeper into the story , certain that something did n't add up .
In December 2007 , he read an interview with Davis 's granddaughter in which she expressed confusion at the shower connection .
" My grandmother would never have done any nude work , " she said .
Graysmith made two discoveries .
First , that Renfro and Davis were two separate people ; and second , that Renfro was still alive .
The confusion had arisen from the fact that , while Renfro was Leigh 's body double on Psycho , Davis was her stand - in , used to check lighting set - ups .
In his new book , The Girl in Alfred Hitchcock 's Shower , Graysmith suggests that Kenneth Dean Hunt was a Psycho obsessive who wanted to kill Leigh 's body double but got the stand - in by mistake .
" Everyone confused them , " he says , " even a murderer .
I discovered Marli was still alive .
It turns out she 's been so busy fishing in Utah , hiking in Alaska , swimming with dolphins in Florida and generally living life to the full that she had no idea she was meant to be dead . "
Renfro , who now lives in California 's Mojave desert , only found out about her supposed murder when Graysmith told her about it .
" She was n't a vain person , and had no interest in her past career , " he says .
" She did n't read articles about herself ; and , after her first husband made her burn all her old glamour photographs out of jealousy , she did n't keep a scrapbook . "
This might also help explain why she never asked for more than her initial $ 500 for essentially starring in the most famous movie scene in history , in a film that made $ 15 m in its first year alone .
" Janet Leigh went around telling everyone how embarrassed she was filming the shower scene , and Hitchcock backed up the story , " says Graysmith .
" They concocted a lie . "
Tony Curtis , Leigh 's husband at the time , claimed in his autobiography that Psycho 's success , and the fact that all anyone wanted to talk to her about was the shower scene , drove his wife to drink , which eventually led to her breakdown and their divorce .
Had she and Hitchcock been more open about how the shower scene had been achieved , it might not have become the subject of such speculation and obsession .
Fifty years after Psycho's release , Graysmith hopes his book will finally bring this all to an end .
The Girl In Alfred Hitchcock 's Shower , by Robert Graysmith , is published by Titan .
Psycho is rereleased on Friday .

My grocer has a little known secret :
It sells damaged and past - date produce weekly .
To find it , you have to go around the corner of the regular produce aisle , next to where the employees take their breaks , and right in front of where the forklifts go in and out .
It ’s in a wire bin with no special markings or signage .
It ’s our little piece of heaven .
In addition to finding your typical antique bananas and bags of slightly bruised apples , there are other delicious treasures : plastic - wrapped packages of bell peppers , bags of pre-washed organic lettuce hearts , and sacks of hodge - podge items that combine avocados , artichokes , and lemons in the same space .
While not everything here is worth buying , they charge 50 - 99 cents for each package — regardless of what ’s inside or what shape it ’s in .
Because we are not food snobs , and we ’ve learn to adapt our diet to include the parts of produce that others throw away , we love stocking up as much as we can fit into our cart .
Anything that gets home in too bad a shape for us to eat happily goes to our 40 + laying hens for some much needed dietary excitement .
Here are the ways we use up the good stuff , and how we eat well for pennies per pound of produce .
Dehydrate ( drying )
This is perhaps one of the easiest ways to use up food .
Bananas are especially delicious when sliced thinly and placed on the drying racks of our $ 25 food dehydrator .
Other foods we have had fun doing this with include whole chili peppers and apple rings .
You ’ll want to consult the directions that come with your food dehydrator to see if you ’ll need to add citric acid to your produce , but as long as the portions you are drying are not too bruised and are mold - free , you ’ll have a way to keep food for many months or even decorate your kitchen !
( Our dried chili peppers are beautiful on the counter . )
Breads
Sweet breads , muffins , and cakes are very forgiving to the quality of fruit and veggies you can use .
The parts of the bananas that are too mushy or brown to be dried effectively end up in a plastic bag that gets mushed up and made into banana bread .
As long as the fruit has n’t reached the stage of fermentation ( smells like alcohol ) , you ’re usually safe to put past - date fruits of all kinds into your favorite baking recipes .
Do n’t forget that you can do this with some veggies , too !
My favorite carrot cake recipe uses a whopping 3 cups of grated carrots , and this vegetable garden bread puts cabbage and celery to good use !
Soups
While salads are often more about presentation than flavor , soups are the exact opposite .
Traditionally , soup pots have been a final destination for the parts of the veggie that most of us today just chuck into our compost pile .
The skins and rinds of certain produce , however , can contain more than just hearty flavor ; they also house some of the most nutritious portions of the vegetable .
Potatoes , for example , are chock full of vitamins when the skin is left on ( just avoid anything that has already begun to sprout or places where the skin is green — this signifies a high glycoalkaloid content , which is toxic ! )
By using up your slightly wilted celery , less - than - juicy onions , and blemished carrots , you can create delicious soup bases , stocks , and stews for mere pennies .

Note : Please be careful to wash all produce carefully , and be aware that some items will be healthiest when purchased as an organic offering .
Freezing
My favorite way to quickly store the oodles of green , red , and yellow bell peppers that my grocer likes to put on quick sale is to simply rinse each pepper , slice into fourths , remove the seeds , and toss into a freezer bag .
This is a great way to have green peppers on hand for making fajitas , meatloaves , or any other dish that requires cooked bell peppers .
You can also freeze most any fruit or veggie , but blanching and citric acid may be required to maintain quality .
( Dicing up tiny pieces of peppers , celery , and berries and then freezing them in ice cube trays make preparing soups and smoothies a breeze ! )
Jams and Jellies
Much more labor - intensive , but possibly the most long - term of all solutions , making up a batch of strawberry jam or jelly is a tasty way to use up that couple of pints that did n’t look so appealing at the grocery store .
While the process itself takes some mastering , you can enjoy the “ fruits ” of your labor for many months to come !
( Editors Note :
As a few readers have pointed out , some types of overripe fruit may not be suitable for typical jams and jellies , as they will not contain the pectin needed to set well .
Some ideas for long - term storage of fruit concoctions include chutneys , some berry jams that are stored in the fridge , and using overripe fruit as an addition to a basic jelly / jam or in homemade applesauce .
Thanks to our many jam and jelly experts for helping us finetune this article ! )
Juice
Have one of those expensive juicers at home just taking up space ?
Maybe you do n’t use it more because you hate cleaning it after every use .
Or you just figured out how darned expensive it is to feed your juicing habit .
Enter the miracle that is discounted produce :
Use those bruised apples , bumpy carrots , and overripe berries to fuel you up before you leave for work .
Feel good and save money !
Yes !
My absolutely most frugal tip of this article is for the tiniest of foodies .
Avoid buying premade baby food if you can make it yourself — for far less with reduced price produce !
Whether you enjoy making up tiny portions of applesauce ( crockpots work nicely for this ) , or you want to give a steamed , mashed broccoli mix a try , any edible , thoroughly washed , and properly cooked fruit or veggie can be blended into a beautiful and affordable puree for baby .
Freeze or refrigerate for weeks ’ worth of snacks and meals !
Before you turn up your nose at the “ Manager ’s Special ” offered in your grocer ’s produce aisle , consider how much money you could save by buying their unwanted fruits and vegetables .
Then look at the typical amount of fresh food wasted by the average American family .
Buying slightly damaged produce is n’t disgusting — throwing away your money on overpriced food that you ’ll eventually let rot in the bottom of your crisper drawer , in my opinion , most certainly is .

WASHINGTON —
In breaking publicly with Roman Catholic bishops over the health care bill , a group of nuns has once again exposed the long - running rift between liberal and conservative theology in the Catholic Church .
The issue dividing them is whether the Senate version of the legislation goes far enough in limiting the use of federal subsidies paid for insurance policies that cover abortion .
Progressive Catholics , including the group of more than 50 nuns representing thousands more from various religious orders , said this week that they would support the Senate bill .
The traditionalists , like the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , said they would oppose it .
Although both the nuns and the bishops firmly oppose abortion , they have reached different conclusions about the bill , a divide that is also playing out more broadly among other groups that oppose abortion .
These include Democrats in the Senate like Bob Casey of Pennsylvania who are comfortable with the restrictions in the Senate health care bill and Democrats in the House like Bart Stupak of Michigan who are fighting for tighter restrictions .
That divide is proving central to the outcome of the health care debate — Mr. Stupak and his allies were continuing to fight Friday night — as Democratic leaders scrambled to come up with the votes to pass the legislation .

An heir to the Seagram ’s liquor fortune was sentenced Wednesday to an 81 - month prison term and immediately thrown behind bars for her role as an unwavering benefactor of Keith Raniere , the disgraced self - improvement guru convicted of turning women into sex slaves who were branded with his initials .
U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis gave Clare Bronfman the harsh sentence at a hearing lasting more than three hours and featuring emotional statements from several victims gathered in a courtroom under strict coronavirus safety protocols .
The judge repeatedly scolded Clare Bronfman for standing by Raniere and his upstate New York organization , even after the evidence made clear she eventually became aware of his sex - trafficking scheme .
Pope Benedict had talks with German Bishop Robert Zollitsch on Friday
Pope Benedict once unwittingly approved housing for a priest accused of child sex abuse , his former diocese has said .
The episode dates back to 1980 when he was archbishop of Germany 's Munich and Freising diocese and known as Joseph Ratzinger .
However , a former deputy said he - not the future pope - made the decision to rehouse the priest , who later abused other children and was convicted .
Roman Catholic clergy have recently been linked to paedophilia scandals .
German Bishop Robert Zollitsch has apologised to victims of abuse .
At a meeting with the German - born Pope on Friday he discussed accusations made in some 170 cases .
The Pope himself has defended celibacy among priests , saying it is a sign of " full devotion " to the Catholic Church .
' A bad mistake ' Following a report in the Munich - based newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung , the diocese of Munich and Freising confirmed that Archbishop Ratzinger had let the priest , known only as H , stay at a vicarage in Munich for " therapy " .
The repeated employment of H in priestly spiritual duties was a bad mistake
Gerhard Gruber , former vicar - general in Munich and Freising H had been suspected of forcing an 11 - year - old boy to perform a sex act upon him in the northern city of Essen .
While he was in Munich , between February 1980 and August 1982 , no wrongdoing was reported .
He was then transferred to the town of Grafing , where he was relieved of his duties in 1985 after allegations of child sex abuse , the diocese said .
In 1986 , he was given an 18 - month suspended jail sentence and a fine for sexually abusing minors , details of which were not given by the diocese .
Archbishop Ratzinger 's former deputy , Gerhard Gruber , stressed that the man who now heads the Catholic Church was not made aware of H's alleged abuse history .
" The repeated employment of H in priestly spiritual duties was a bad mistake , " Gerhard Gruber said in a statement .
" I assume all responsibility . "
Speaking to the Associated Press , he added : " You have to know that we had some 1,000 priests in the diocese at the time .
" The cardinal [ Joseph Ratzinger ] could not deal with everything , he had to rely on his vicar - general [ deputy ] . "
Vatican conference Pope Benedict made his remarks about celibacy at a theological conference in the Vatican before meeting Bishop Zollitsch .
I felt I was in a dark place , in solitary confinement
Norbert Denef
A childhood of abuse
He defended " the value of sacred celibacy , which in the Latin Church is ... required for ordination and is held in great regard by Eastern Churches " .
Austrian Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn had called for an examination of priestly training , saying that the issue of celibacy needed to be looked at with " a great deal of honesty , both on the part of the Church and of society as a whole " .
He later clarified his comments saying it would be wrong to say that celibacy was a prime cause of sexual abuse .
" If celibacy is the problem , then without celibacy there should be no sexual abuse but unfortunately this is not the case , " he said .
" It has to be seen as a question of personal maturity , how someone relates to his personal development . "
What are your views on celibacy within the Roman Catholic priesthood ?
Do you think the Church should be more open about issues such as celibacy , priest training and changing social attitudes to sex ?

Hundreds of Somalis have marched through the streets of Mogadishu , protesting against al - Shabab militants .
The protesters , mostly women and children and wearing traditional white clothes , chanted slogans denouncing the al - Qaeda - inspired group .
The BBC's Mohammed Olad Hassan says this is only the second public demonstration against al - Shabab , which controls much of southern Somalia .
The protesters shouted their support for the UN - backed government .
Mohyadin Hassan Afrah , who helped organise the protest in one of Mogadishu 's few government - controlled districts , says people were upset at a move by al - Shabab to destroy the tombs of revered Sufi clerics .
Al - Shabab follows the strict Saudi Arabian - inspired Wahhabi interpretation of Islam , rather than the Sufi Islam of many Somalis .
" We call for a holy war against them , " said Sheikh Somow , from the Sufi Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama group , which recently stuck a deal with the government .
Mr Afrah also said he was marching to protest at al - Shabab 's use of foreign fighters .
Our reporter says fighters from Pakistan , Yemen and North Africa have travelled to Somalia to join al - Shabab .
Dozens of government troops watched the march and fired shots into the sky .
Some of the demonstrators carried posters with slogan such as " Down with al - Shabab " and carried " Support Peace and Government " .
" We have been forced out of our houses because of the violence instigated by al - Shabab .
We are here to support the government and make our voices against them heard , " said one of the marchers , Hawo Abdulle Aden .
About half of Mogadishu 's population have fled their homes .
The country has been torn by conflict since 1991 .
This time of year brings an entirely new audience to Nashville Predators hockey , the casual fan who may not be very familiar with the game .
In the interest of public service , then , I 'd like to offer up this primer as to exactly why the Stanley Cup Playoffs are the most thrilling , captivating event in professional sports .
Get ready to wear your Preds gear to work on game days , change that desktop image on your PC , and follow after the jump for 5 great things about playoff hockey ...
Doing Whatever It Takes For the Team
Unlike the old days when the overwhelming majority ( 16 of 21 ) teams made the playoffs every year , it 's a tougher task in today 's NHL to qualify for the post - season .
Once you 're there , it takes four grueling , best - of - seven series filled with high - intensity , physical hockey played every other day to capture the Stanley Cup , and players will do anything and everything to make the most of that opportunity .
It 's simply astounding to read about some of the injuries that guys play through in order to take their shot at playoff glory .
Perhaps the standard was set by Bobby Baun back in 1964 , scoring a game - winning goal on a broken leg for the Toronto Maple Leafs
That spirit is very much alive today .
Take , for example , defenseman Darryl Sydor - with the Dallas Stars back in the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals against New Jersey , he injures his knee in a collision along the boards , and since play continues on , drags himself to the front of the net in a desperate attempt to help his team and block a shooting lane :
Sudden - Death Overtime
Unlike the regular season , when a shootout can decide a game after 5 minutes of overtime , the NHL playoff features unlimited , sudden - death overtime .
If the game is tied after regulation time , they simply take a break to clean the ice , put 20:00 up on the clock , and go at it until someone scores .
If they 're still tied , just rinse and repeat .
The Predators have yet to score an overtime game - winning goal in the playoffs , but you can bet that the first guy to do so will forever earn his place in the hearts of Nashville fans .
The great thing about playoff overtime is that since the TV timeouts have already been taken , the pace of the game picks up considerably , and each dash up and down the ice brings with it danger or opportunity .
When a puck finally goes in , the entire momentum of a playoff series , and a season , turns in an instant .
Ask any hardcore hockey fan about memorable playoff moments , and OT winners come rolling off the tongue - Petr Klima in 1990 , Steve Yzerman in 1996 , and of course Nashville 's captain , Jason Arnott , back when he was with the New Jersey Devils in 2000 :
Playoff Beards
Perhaps the most recognizable aspect of playoff competition is the beard - that grand tradition wherein hockey players refuse to shave as long as they 're still playing .
By the end of the long march to the Stanley Cup Finals , the participants look as if they 've fought their way through a barren wasteland just to show up , and that 's because they pretty much have done exactly that .
For a peek at how the Preds might look as this month proceeds , you can see just how hirsute they got during their " Movember " charity drive earlier this season .
I 'm going with Steve Sullivan and J.P. Dumont as the heavy favorites here .
Granted , some of the younger players might have trouble with this tradition , as noted by rookie Colin Wilson in this recent interview with WKRN's Cory Curtis :
Bitter Rivalries
During the long 82 - game regular season , there 's not much history carried over from one contest to the next .
In fact , coaches often talk about the benefit of taking things " one day at a time " and looking at each game with a fresh perspective .
In the playoffs , however , that changes quite a bit .
By facing a single opponent for up to two weeks , the Predators will focus much more on individual matchups , and you can expect that even though there has n't been much animosity between Nashville and Chicago in years past , the seeds of a genuine rivalry are getting planted right now .
Just as the Preds have a chance to become heroes , the Blackhawks will be stacked with villains .
Ask any Nashville fan , and they 'll tell you that the Detroit Red Wings and San Jose Sharks ( who have each defeated the Predators twice in playoffs past ) are right at the top of their most - hated list in the NHL .
When the Stanley Cup is on the horizon , whichever team stands in your way becomes an easy bunch to hate .
It 's on , Chicago !
Viewing Parties
It 's one thing to enjoy the phenomenal atmosphere at Bridgestone Arena during a playoff game , but another way to capture the spirit is to join your fellow Preds fans for a viewing party when the team is on the road .
Games 1 & 2 will be in Chicago on Friday and Sunday evening ( 7:30 p.m. Central start ) , making it easy to plan your weekend .
104.5 " The Zone " is organizing one such party Friday night at Blackstone Restaurant and Brewery ( 1918 West End Ave. ) , which will feature ticket giveaways for Game 3 , merchandise prizes , and food & drink specials .
The rowdies from Section303.com are also involved , and will have details for further viewing parties on their site later today .
With any luck , you 'll be able to enjoy great moments like this with 100 or so of your new - found closest friends :

TrekToday.com ( via The News Tribune ) is reporting that 2010 is the last year to see Star Trek ’s Leonard Nimoy at a convention .
“ I think this is the last year I will do this , ” he said .
“ It ’s exciting , but I think I ’ve done enough of it .
I ’m looking forward to concentrating on my personal life . ”
He apparently has 10 conventions scheduled for the year , one of which is Creation ’s big Las Vegas convention ( Shatner will be there as well , by the way ) .
And now that the news is out about Nimoy , you can bet that con is going to sell out even faster than normal .
Gold Packages are already gone .
This is n’t all that surprising really , given that Nimoy is quickly approaching 80 years old .
It ’s also why I splurged for the special photo with him and Bill Shatner at Dragon * con last year .
I think one of the reasons why Dragon * con got so mobbed by people in 2009 , was that many realized the convention was probably going to be their last opportunity to see either one of these Star Trek icons .
A feud over how Ontario ’s proposed new sex education curriculum will be taught in Catholic schools could reignite public debate over whether the schools should be taxpayer - funded , Progressive Conservatives said Wednesday .
“ I think the public is quite shocked to learn … there was going to be a separate curriculum rolled out for the Catholic system , ” Conservative education critic Elizabeth Witmer told reporters , slamming “ secret negotiations ” between government and Catholic officials .
“ If this does become an issue they would have no one to blame but themselves based on how they ’ve handled this situation . ”
The comments came after Premier Dalton McGuinty insisted Catholic and public schools must teach the same basic material , but in an apparent contradiction , Education Minister Leona Dombrowsky said it ’s fine for Catholic schools to continue teaching “ from a faith perspective . ”
She confirmed ministry officials were working with the Institute for Catholic Education and church officials on their own version of the controversial curriculum that McGuinty pulled back for a “ re- think ” last week .
It included a more frank discussion of sexual topics such as naming of body parts in Grade 1 , a mention of homosexuality in Grade 3 and oral and anal sex and vaginal intercourse in Grade 7 in broader health contexts .
“ They may not learn the same way , ” Dombrowsky , a former separate school board chair , said of Catholic students .
“ They learn the same thing , perhaps in a different way . ”
She walked away after being asked about the funding issue .
Sister Joan Cronin , executive director of the Institute for Catholic Education , said earlier this week that mentioning homosexuality in Grade 3 was not acceptable and would be put off to Grades 7 and 8 .
“ God love Sister Joan … it wo n’t be an issue , ” McGuinty said Wednesday .
“ We have a single curriculum when it comes to mathematics , when it comes to history , when it comes to world studies and when it comes to sexual education .
And we ’ll find a way to make sure that it suits all our children . ”
Concerned by the day ’s developments , the government relayed on Wednesday night a statement from Catholic schools and bishops pledging to “ work co-operatively ” on the curriculum review and affirming it will be taught under “ Catholic principles . ”
McGuinty could n’t say for certain Wednesday when he had first read the sex ed curriculum , which became a hot potato when it was flagged by Christian groups April 20 .
At first he told reporters : “ I have n’t read it . ”
Minutes later , he added : “ I do n’t know .
A few days ago . ”
Later , an aide said he had n’t read it until last Thursday morning , when he announced after defending it for two days and hours that the policy was going back to the drawing board .
During the 2007 election campaign , McGuinty , a Catholic whose wife is a Catholic teacher , slammed the Conservatives for a plan to expand taxpayer funding to other religious schools , saying it would undermine social cohesion and lead to an “ extended , divisive , controversial debate . ”

Witmer said that message rings hollow for the Liberals now .
“ I guess we ’re not all ( as ) equal as they tried to point out last time — that all people should attend the public school boards and there should be no special treatment for anyone . ”

( CNN ) -- What do President Barack Obama , New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have in common ?
They all have been the subject of a snide " prayer " circulating that seemingly calls for their deaths .
A recently created Facebook page reads , " Dear Lord , this year you took my favorite actor , Patrick Swayzie ( sic ) .
You took my favorite actress , Farah ( sic ) Fawcett .
You took my favorite singer , Michael Jackson .
I just wanted to let you know , my favorite president is Barack Obama .
Amen . "
The page has received more than 600,000 " thumbs - up " messages of approval since it was posted April 10 .
But its owner , who does not disclose his or her identity on the popular social media site , wrote , " We are not really praying for the death of Obama .
It is just some humor to show our disapproval of our current president . "
Similar imprecations were circulating online last year .
But Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said that " while it may be considered distasteful and objectionable to some , " the page does n't violate the company 's content policies .
" We 're sensitive to content that includes pornography , bullying , hate speech , and actionable threats of violence , and we react quickly to remove content that violates our policies when it is reported to us , " Noyes said in a written statement .
" Facebook is highly self - regulating and leverages its more than 400 million users to keep an eye out for offensive content , " he added .
" We encourage users to report such content , and we have a large team of professional reviewers who evaluate these reports and take action per our policies . "
Variations on the jab have circulated in New Jersey , where teacher 's union officials apologized for a nearly identical memo that substituted Gov. Chris Christie for Obama earlier this month .
Christie is locked in a bitter struggle with the New Jersey Education Association over funding for state schools , but union President Barbara Keshishian said , " Language such as that has no place in civil discourse . "
And in January , hackers posted a similar message on Ahmadinejad 's Web site .
" Dear God , In 2009 you took my favorite singer -- Michael Jackson , my favorite actress -- Farrah Fawcett , my favorite actor -- Patrick Swayze , my favorite voice -- Neda , " the hackers wrote , the last entry a reference to a young Iranian woman shot and killed during protests over last June 's disputed presidential election .
" Please , please , do n't forget my favorite politician -- Ahmadinejad -- and my favorite dictator -- Khamenei -- in the year 2010 . "
" I cannot imagine a cheese consumer who would not love Beaufort . "
Beaufort is a remarkable cheese , one of the noble Alpine cheeses .
It 's produced exclusively from unpasteurized cow 's milk in the French Alps of the Haute - Savoie , from the milk of cows that , in the best examples of the cheese , graze on sustainable mountain pastures , imparting unique grassy , flowery aromas to the meaty cheeses , which have a firm yet buttery taste which melts easily in the mouth .
It 's a behemoth of a cheese , with wheels weighing up to 130 pounds .
Beaufort is without doubt one of the finest hard cheeses produced in the world today , and , if my experience behind the cheese counter is any guide , it 's mostly unknown in this country .
Alpine Cheeses
Even if you do n't know it , I 'm certain you 've tried an Alpine - style cheese at least once .
Gruyere , according to cheese expert Max McCalman is a general term that encompasses all of them , but the best known are probably Swiss Gruyere or Emmental .
In France Comté , also known as Gruyere de Comté , is a celebrity , commanding huge prices for wheels judged exceptional by the country 's exceedingly knowledgeable affineurs , or professional cheese agers .
All alpine cheeses are remarkable : they are some of the biggest cheeses in the world , with wheels of Comté topping out at an eye - popping ( and back - straining ) 110 pounds .
Many of them are brine - washed , encouraging the same bacteria that give Epoisses its stink , but with different results : over long - aging , these bacteria give the cheeses a distinct , pleasant , meaty depth .
Beaufort Is Special
Beaufort , however , has a special place in my heart .
Its characteristic shape — a large , thick wheel with concave sides — gives rise to a charming origin story .
Apparently it allowed farmers to easily transport them down the mountains by winding ropes around the wheels , so as to lash them to a donkey .
It has a much subtler taste than Swiss Gruyere or Comté because its curd is cooked at a much lower temperature , which also leads to a slightly more giving , creamy paste .
Beaufort also has strict AOC labeling requirements , especially for the most prized types , which I recommend you seek out .
Beaufort alpage must be made in a mountain chalet , during the summer months , from a single herd of cattle grazing in the mountain pastures .
This Beaufort , on top of the meaty , caramel , and buttery flavors common to all the cheeses , has floral and herbal notes from the grazing ground that are distinct from any other herd 's cheese .
How cool is that ?
The Hard Sell
For most cheeses , I 'm quite willing to imagine that there are people for whom that cheese is not their cup of tea .
But , and this is as strong a recommendation as I can think of , I cannot imagine a cheese consumer who would not love Beaufort .
I have made myself sick on at least one occasion by eating it .
That 's how good it is .
To buy it in the United States , make sure you check for the AOC label , which will guarantee a certain level of quality .
If at all possible , find the Beaufort alpage ; nothing else is quite as good .
As an interesting alternative , I suggest the fantastic Pleasant Ridge Reserve , made in Wisconsin with a Beaufort recipe ( although , sadly , not to the gigantic wheel specification of real Beaufort ) .
And , should I somehow have steered you wrong with my forceful recommendation , and you find that you cannot stand the Beaufort you have just purchased , please let me know so that I can take it off your hands .

House Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) upset a group of central Florida Republicans on Thursday night when he crashed their meeting and confronted them about an allegation that they had spied on a Democratic campaign group .
According to the Orlando Sentinel , Grayson arrived at a Perkins restaurant where some 30 Orange County Republicans were meeting .
Amid loud catcalls , he read from a flier that accused the Republicans of infiltrating Organizing for America , President Barack Obama ’s campaign organization , and promised more details to come on the allegation .

“ I want you to know , this is how low you ’ve all sunk to — to the point you ’re spying on people , ” Grayson told the angry crowd .
Cell phone video footage of the incident shows a number of meeting attendees demanding that Grayson apologize for crashing the meeting .
“ Show some class , Grayson , apologize , ” a voice can be heard saying on the video .
Reporting on the fracas , the Tea Party Patriots Live blog throws the spying accusation back at Grayson , asking : “ How did Alan Grayson know about this meeting ?
Who informed him ?
Was this staged ? ”
Grayson has some stake in ensuring that Organizing for America is n’t infiltrated by his political opponents .
According to the St. Petersurg Times , Organizing for America is helping Grayson run for re-election this year , as part of a campaign to help all US House members who voted in favor of the health care overhaul .
In March , the group started running a 30 - second TV spot thanking Grayson for his vote .

Live reports that Grayson had a 10 - minute discussion with one of its radio show hosts , Tom Tillson .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I let him know that heÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a congressman and he needs to act like one , ” Tillson said afterward .
“ I reminded him that these are his constituents .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
In a statement released Friday , mayoral candidate Falconer said that “ Grayson pledged to use his own personal funds to defeat me in my race for Orange County Mayor ( supporting his Democratic friend Bill Segal ) .
He then told me to get my ‘a** out of his face . ’

“ I am in awe of the lack of respect he showed for the customers of this restaurant and his constituents , ” Falconer wrote .

Senate sets new clash on Wall Street rules
President Barack Obama ’s Democratic allies in the Senate set a new vote Tuesday on a sweeping bill to rein in Wall Street , looking to heap pressure on Republicans blocking the popular measure .
Lawmakers were to vote on whether to formally start debate on the most ambitious regulatory overhaul of its kind since the Great Depression of the 1930s — the same proposal they narrowly defeated late Monday .
ADVERTISEMENT
Polls show the legislation enjoyed support of nearly two - thirds of the US public , amid still - smoldering anger at big banks blamed for the 2008 collapse that was expected to shape the November mid-term elections .
The move came as a key Senate committee grilled top Goldman Sachs executives Tuesday about the embattled Wall Street investment giant ’s controversial actions in the run up to the worldwide meltdown .
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , wielding parliamentary rules , set up a 4:30 pm ( 2030 GMT ) vote on the issue , amid no signs that back - room talks had moved much closer to a compromise bill Republicans would accept .
Reid denounced the “ absurd , stunning , unheard of ” Republican resistance to starting debate on the measure until a middle - ground version has been worked out and accused the minority of siding with Wall Street over US families .
“ Senate Republicans are claiming we ’re moving too fast , ” he said .
“ The American people undeniably demand we protect them from Wall Street , which has run wild . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Reid claimed that Republicans were too afraid to discuss the issue out in the open .
President Kennedy once said , ‘ Let us not be afraid of debate or discussion Ã¢â‚¬â€œ let us encourage it . ’
I ask my Republican colleagues , What are you so afraid of ?
As I have said before , the right response to disagreement is not dismissal ; it is discussion .
For far too long there has been too much secrecy and too little transparency on Wall Street .
The American people have paid the price with their jobs and their life savings , and they demand we fix what Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s broken .
As long as Republicans insist on secrecy and resist transparency here in the Senate Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ and if they donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t let us address the problems we were sent here to solve Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ we will never fully recover .
Democrats and the White House have been eager to portray Republicans as in the pocket of Wall Street , while Republicans say they want tough new rules but that the bill as currently crafted is not ready and must be changed .

“ Last night , the Democrat majority forced a vote on a bill that was n’t ready for prime - time , ” said Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , who highlighted media accounts of worries about the measure among businesses including iconic motorcycle maker Harley Davidson and candy maker Mars .
“ Does anyone really believe that the people who make Harley Davidsons and Snickers bars are responsible for the financial crisis ? ” he said .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Unfortunately , the Democrat majority seems less interested in fixing this bill than in some political win they think they ’re scoring by not fixing the bill , ” said McConnell .
“ It ’s a total waste of the people ’s time . ”
The US Senate voted 57 - 41 late Monday to open debate , falling short of the 60 needed under parliamentary rules to move ahead with Obama ’s top domestic goal , and drawing a swift rebuke from the president .
“ I am deeply disappointed that Senate Republicans voted in a block against allowing a public debate on Wall Street reform to begin , ” Obama said in a statement .

Republicans “ may believe that this obstruction is a good political strategy , and others may see delay as an opportunity to take this debate behind closed doors , where financial industry lobbyists can water down reform or kill it altogether , ” said Obama .
Democratic Senator Ben Nelson joined 39 Republicans in voting against the motion , while two Republicans did not vote .
Reid voted no for procedural reasons — it enabled him to bring up the bill again at a moment ’s notice .
The bill aims to usher in sweeping new regulations on Wall Street a decade after Democrats and Republicans together stripped the system of rules enacted after the Great Depression .

The measure , championed by US Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd , a Democrat , would erect a mechanism for dissolving rather than bailing out financial institutions whose collapse could risk crippling the US economy .
The legislation — which would need to be merged with the bill the House of Representatives passed in 2009 — would also establish a new agency to protect consumers from risky lending practices and products .
The legislation also aims to tighten regulations on the giant market in derivatives — complex , privately traded instruments tied to the underlying value of a commodity and seen as vehicles for dangerous speculation .
Reid ’s full statement follows :
####
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The American people undeniably demand that we protect them from a Wall Street run wild .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Two - thirds of Americans support us cracking down on big bankersÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ reckless risk - taking .
And a majority supports us asking banks to pay for their own funerals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the fund financed by the big financial firms to cover the cost of their liquidation .
Not to bail out banks that threaten the larger economy , as some have mischaracterized it , but to shut them down for good .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ The American people also demand that their leaders discuss these details and improve on these ideas .
They have two simple requests :
One , that their leaders look out for their economic security ; and two , that their legislators legislate .
In other words , they want us to look out for their jobs and they want us to do our own .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Right now , Senate Republicans are refusing to do either .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Yesterday they stood together , en bloc , to block us from moving this bill to the floor .
They did nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t even want the Senate to talk about legislation as part of the normal legislative process .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ More than two years after the financial collapse that sparked a worldwide recession , Senate Republicans are claiming weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re moving too fast .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ They are claiming that only a fully negotiated and agreed - upon bill can come up for debate .
They want all the details to be worked out beforehand , behind closed doors and out of view from the public .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ That is unprecedented in the 220 years of the United States Senate .
As we all learned in civics class , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not how the legislative process works .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We want to bring our bill to the floor so we can discuss it , debate it , amend it and improve it .
We want to do it out in the open .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ After all , if we are not debating Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if Senators refuse to let the Senate do its job Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what are we doing here ?
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ What purpose does the Senate serve ?
Why do we have rules for debate and the opportunity to offer amendments ?
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ President Kennedy once said , Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœLet us not be afraid of debate or discussion Ã¢â‚¬â€œ let us encourage it .
Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ I ask my Republican colleagues , What are you so afraid of ?
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ As I have said before , the right response to disagreement is not dismissal ; it is discussion .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ For far too long there has been too much secrecy and too little transparency on Wall Street .
The American people have paid the price with their jobs and their life savings , and they demand we fix what Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s broken .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ As long as Republicans insist on secrecy and resist transparency here in the Senate Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and if they donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t let us address the problems we were sent here to solve Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ we will never fully recover .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 

There will now be only 12 teams on the F1 grid in 2010 Formula 1 hopefuls Stefan GP have had their bid to race in 2010 rejected .
The Serbian team had hoped to race in place of another new team , US F1 , which has withdrawn after failing to fulfil its obligations for the new season .
Governing body the FIA said in a statement : " It is not possible for a replacement team to be entered for the championship at this late stage . "
The decision means 12 teams will be on the grid when the season starts in Bahrain on 14 March .
Stefan had been campaigning vigorously to be given a place on the grid , and had been given the support of F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone .
The team , run by Serbian businessman Zoran Stefanovich , had obtained the cars that were designed and built by the Toyota team before the Japanese manufacturer quit the sport at the end of last season .
Stefan had stepped up its campaign in recent weeks as it became clear that US F1 would not make the grid .
The FIA said in a statement that US F1 had " indicated that they will not be in a position to participate in the 2010 FIA Formula 1 World Championship .
" Having considered the various options , the FIA confirms that it is not possible for a replacement team to be entered for the Championship at this late stage . "

Several years ago I came across a fascinating application of graph theory to architecture .
It is in the 1983 book Incidence and symmetry in design and architecture , by Jenny A. Baglivo and Jack E. Graver .
I do n’t know if it is well known among experts in the field , but I ’ve never seen it elsewhere .
So I thought I ’d share it with all of you .
Here ’s the simplest version of the problem .
Suppose you have an grid of beams .
The beams are steel and ca n’t stretch , compress , or bend , but they are attached together by pin-joints .
In other words , the joints provide no rigidity in the structure .
To make the structure rigid you are allowed to add steel cross - beams ( which would force a rhombus to be square ) .
Question .
Where should you place the cross - beams , and what is the fewest number needed to stabilize the structure ?
For example , consider the structures below .
They both have nine cross -beams .
Is either one rigid ?
It turns out that the one on the left is rigid .
In fact , it is over - braced ; it can be braced with only eight cross - beams ( we can remove the dotted beam shown in the figure below ) .
The one on the right is not rigid , as can be seen below .
I encourage you to read the discussion by Baglivo and Graver , as they do a beautiful job of walking the reader through the problem .
Here is a sketch of the argument .
1 . In any bracing configuration ( rigid or not ) all of the vertical bars in a given row are parallel and all of the horizontal bars in a given column are parallel .
You can see that in the deformed example on the right .
2 . A cross -beam forces a parallelogram to be a square .
By ( 1 ) , if the square is in the ith row and jth column , then all of the vertical bars in the ith row are perpendicular to all of the horizontal bars in the jth column .
3 . To have a rigid structure it suffices to show that the vertical bars in any row are perpendicular to the horizontal bars in any column .
4 . We can construct a bipartite graph from any bracing structure .
In particular , we have vertices representing row numbers and vertices representing column numbers .
We draw an edge from the vertex for the ith row to the vertex for the jth column if there is a cross - beam in the ith row and jth column .
The graphs for our two structures are shown below .
5 . Using property ( 2 ) repeatedly we find that if there is a path in the graph from the ith row to the jth column , then the vertical bars in the ith row are perpendicular to the horizontal bars in the jth column .
6 . We conclude that property ( 3 ) holds ( i.e. , the structure is rigid ) if and only if the bipartite graph is connected .
7 . The smallest connected graph is a tree , and the the largest tree in the bipartite graph with vertices has edges .
Thus we have the following theorem .
Theorem .
A bracing of an grid is rigid iff the corresponding bipartite graph is connected .
Moreover , the rigid bracing has the fewest possible cross - beams iff the bipartite graph is a tree .
In this case it has cross -beams .
Returning to our examples , we see that the graph on the left is connected , so that structure is rigid .
In fact , we can remove one edge to obtain a tree , so the structure is over - braced .
The graph on the right is not connected , so it is not rigid .
However , we could add one more bracing to make it rigid ( where ? ) .
Again , I encourage you to check out the original source .
They go on to discuss the following two related problems , both of which have graph theoretical solutions .
Question .
What if we want the structure to be double - braced ?
That is , we want it to be rigid even if one of the cross - beams happens to fail ( they allow cross - beams to form X’s in a square ) .
[ You may not be surprised to learn that a tree in the bipartite graph is not sufficient — you need cycles . ]
Question .
What if the cross - beams are replaced by wires ?
The wires are not rigid ( they can collapse ) , but they can not stretch .
How do you cross - brace your structure so that it is rigid ?
[ In this case you need to look at directed graphs . ]

The world ’s oldest story is on a collision course with cutting - edge Hollywood technology .
I ’m told that Paramount Pictures and former Walden Media co-founder Cary Granat producing with Reel Fx are mounting In The Beginning , a 3D telling of the creation story .
The film is using The Book of Genesis as its primary resource .
A script has been written by John Fusco ( Hidalgo ) , and directing will be TV vet David Cunningham .
This pair had teamed with Granat on a Walden film that never happened , Rebels : The Green Mountain Boys .
Reel
Fx is spearheading the visuals and will soon turn over test footage the filmmakers hope will prompt a green light .
Paramount will co-finance and distribute .
I ’m told the $ 30 million film will use 3 - D visuals to transform the oft - told tale into a spectacle that the filmmakers hope will attract family - and faith - based audiences that flocked to The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe , that first Chronicles of Narnia installment made on Granat ’s Walden watch .
I hear Granat pitched the film by claiming that the Adam And Eve story has never really been told by a feature film .
( At least not since John Huston . )
The Genesis tale of creation took a week that began with God creating light , culminating with Adam and Eve on Day Six , and a day of rest on Day Seven .
But I can guarantee you this film is going to take more than a week to make .
Where ’s Cecil B DeMille when Hollywood needs him .
Police in Ypsilanti Township , MI are looking for a burgundy vehicle in connection with a hit - and - run accident that critically injured an 11 year - old boy .
This is n't the type of news we typically publish here at Autoblog , but the cops in Ypsi could use some help identifying the one piece of evidence they do have .
Above is an image of fragments of a driver - side headlight cover that was left at the scene of the accident by a mid-size burgundy - colored vehicle .
Try as we might to come up with the vehicle that produced such a thing , we 've come up decidedly short .
Good thing we know a few million of the most knowledgeable enthusiasts on the planet ( that 's you ) to help us come up with the vehicle that matches the evidence .
We know it 's a long - shot , but if you have a good idea of what vehicle this headlight cover comes from , hit the jump and give us your hypothesis in the comments .
Make sure to provide some explanation as to why the headlamp cover might match the vehicle .

Below is the clip from this afternoon ’s edition of the Dylan Ratigan Show on MSNBC .
Before anyone comments , yes I am well aware that the host — who was clearly favorable to NORML ’s position — did not give us equal time .
Then again , former General McCaffrey is a regular consultant to MSNBC ( and a guest ) so the deference was to be expected .
That said , Ratigan , to his credit , did allow me the first and the last word on the subject .
Anyone who wants to read all of what I would have liked to have said , given the proper time , can see my recent commentary — Are U.S. Pot Laws the Root Cause of Mexican Drug Violence ? — from last week ’s online edition of The Hill , or you can listen to my recent appearance on FoxNews.com .

Professor Dawkins said the UK should not pay for the Pope 's visit Leading atheist Richard Dawkins has backed a campaign to have the Pope arrested for " crimes against humanity " when he visits the UK later this year .
Professor Dawkins said he " whole - heartedly " backed the initiative led by atheist Christopher Hitchens .
UK human rights lawyers are preparing a case to charge Pope Benedict XVI over his alleged cover - up of sexual abuse in the Catholic church .
Dr William Oddie , former editor of The Catholic Herald , labelled it " lunatic " .
Campaigners hope to cast a shadow over the Pope 's planned visit to the UK in September - the first visit by a Pope since 1982 .
Prof Dawkins wrote on his blog : " I am optimistic that we shall raise public consciousness to the point where the British government will find it very awkward indeed to go ahead with the Pope 's visit . "
And writing in the Guardian on Tuesday , columnist George Monbiot wrote : " Picture the pope awaiting trial in British prison , and you begin to grasp the implications of the radical idea that has never been applied : equality before the law . "
The BBC 's religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott said the anti-Pope campaign could be seen as a mischievous attempt to create an " air of criminality " around the Pope .
" The controversy over alleged Papal involvement in the cover - up of child sex abuse is providing atheists with a stick with which to beat religion , " he said .
The Pope 's visit was announced shortly before allegations surfaced that he had signed a letter which delayed the punishment of a paedophile priest in the US .
Legal state ?
This followed a series of child abuse scandals involving the Catholic church in the US , the Irish Republic , Germany and Norway .
The Vatican has defended the Pope , saying the Pope is willing to meet more victims of clerical abuse , while the Church has published an internet guide as to how bishops deal with accusations of sexual abuse .
The Vatican said the Pope would not resign over the scandal Barrister Geoffrey Robertson and solicitor Mark Stephens are considering whether they could either ask the Crown Prosecution Service to initiate criminal proceedings against the Pope ; launch their own civil action or refer his case to the International Criminal Court .
Author Christopher
Hitchens said he does not believe the Vatican to be a legal state which raises questions as to whether the Pope , as head of state , could claim diplomatic immunity .
He said : " The UN at its inception refused membership to the Vatican but has allowed it a unique " observer status " , permitting it to become signatory to treaties such as the Law of the Sea and ( ironically ) the Convention on the Rights of the Child , and to speak and vote at UN conferences where it promotes its controversial dogmas on abortion , contraception and homosexuality . "
The group have cited as precedent the recent case of Israel 's former foreign minister Tzipi Livni , who cancelled a visit to London after a British judge issued an arrest warrant over her alleged involvement with the conflict in Gaza .
But Dr Oddie , former editor of The Catholic Herald , said the campaign demonstrated how " wonderfully lunatic " both Christopher Hitchens and Professor Dawkins were .
" What 's lawful is what is lawfully agreed by lawful authorities , in this case Italian law - the government of Italy - and secondly , international law , determined by the United Nations .
Both legal authorities accept the Vatican is a legal state .
" Christopher Hitchens is entitled to say it should n't be one , but he can't say it is n't one - it 's like people in a lunatic society saying they are Napoleon , " he said .
The Vatican has ruled out any possibility of a papal resignation over the scandal .

( CNN ) --
A federal judge on Thursday struck down the federal statute that established the National Day of Prayer , ruling that it violates the constitutional ban on government - backed religion .
" [ I ]ts sole purpose is to encourage all citizens to engage in prayer , an inherently religious exercise that serves no secular function , " a Wisconsin judge wrote in the ruling , referring to the 1952 law that created the National Day of Prayer .
" In this instance , the government has taken sides on a matter that must be left to individual conscience , " wrote the judge , Barbara B. Crabb .
The injunction against the National Day of Prayer will not take effect until the defendants in the case , President Obama and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs , have exhausted their appeals , the decision said .
The Obama administration said in a Twitter message on Thursday that Obama intends to recognize this year 's National Day of Prayer , which is May 6 .
The White House press office referred a question about whether the administration would appeal the ruling to the Justice Department , where a press officer was unavailable for comment .
Conservative religious groups called on the White House to appeal the decision .
" The National Day of Prayer provides an opportunity for all Americans to pray voluntarily according to their own faith and does not promote any particular religion or form of religious observance , " said Joel Oster , senior legal counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund .
Church - state separation groups , meanwhile , applauded the ruling .
" This decision is a tremendous victory for religious liberty , " said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn , executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State .
" Congress has no business telling Americans when or how to pray . "
The Interfaith Alliance also welcomed the ruling .
" Maintaining clear boundaries between religion and government only serves to strengthen both , " said the group 's president , the Rev. Welton Gaddy .
One constitutional scholar doubted the case would survive an appeal to a federal circuit court .
" Judges have never been absolutists in these establishment clause cases , " said Douglas Laycock , a University of Michigan Law School professor specializing in religious liberties issues .
" If they were they would to tell the president to stop issuing Thanksgiving proclamations and tell the Treasury Department to take ' In God We Trust ' off our money . "
The lawsuit against the Obama administration was brought by the Freedom From Religion Foundation , a group based in Madison , Wisconsin .
The statute that established the National Day of Prayer calls on the president to annually designate one day , other than a Sunday , " on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches , in groups and as individuals . "
The law was amended in 1988 to designate the first Thursday in May as the annual National Day of Prayer .
The event has been celebrated more ostentatiously by Republican than Democratic White Houses , partly because it has become aligned with religious conservatives .
Since 1991 , the National Day of Prayer Task Force has been led by Shirley Dobson , wife of conservative evangelical broadcaster and activist James Dobson .
Shirley Dobson criticized the Obama administration last year for forgoing the White House celebrations that marked the National Day of Prayer under President George W. Bush .
But Obama did issue an official proclamation designating a National Day of Prayer .
" Throughout our nation 's history , " Obama 's proclamation read , " Americans have come together in moments of great challenge and uncertainty to humble themselves in prayer . "
The British coalminers ’ strike of 1984 - 5 , which ended 25 years ago on March 3 , was a turning point in British politics .
In this article , Terry Conway discusses the impact of Women Against Pit Closures and its legacy .
* * *
March 3 , 2010 -- Socialist Resistance --
Since her election as prime minister in 1979 , Margaret Thatcher had wasted little time in attacking working people in every way she could .
The massive program of coal pit closures was critical for her government .
The strike was to be “ the ” central issue of British politics .
The stakes were understood by the majority of members of the National Union of Mineworkers ( NUM ) , who saw that what was at stake was the loss of the thousands upon thousands of jobs and the devastation of entire communities in the many areas where the coal pit was the centre of local life .
The formation of women ’s support groups happened soon after the start of the strike on March 9 , 1984 .
Women were angry at the way the media depicted them as being opposed to the action -- supposedly victims of the irresponsible behaviour of the NUM in taking strike action .
The press played on the fact that support for the strike was weak in the Nottinghamshire area , and managed to identify women there who were urging their husbands to go to work .
With this ammunition they ran headlines on this issue on the third day of the dispute -- implying that all women wanted the strike called off .
This so enraged a group of five women in Barnsley , Yorkshire , that they wrote a letter to the local paper :
We realise that miners and their families will endure hardships during the strike and that no - one relishes the prospect of mounting bills .
However those same sacrifices were made by our forefathers who gave their lives to the industry and struggled to protect jobs and improve conditions .
Let us take their example and stand firmly together to ensure the future of our community
We wish to object to the assumption made in some sections of the press that all miners ’ wives oppose the decision to strike .
The letter was printed in the paper by a sympathetic reporter -- with an invitation for those who agreed with its views to get in touch .
Within two weeks the group had mushroomed to two dozen , within a few more weeks hundreds of women had made contact .
Similar patterns were being played out across the different coalfields .
As well as writing to the press , the groups were kept busy .
Many set up emergency advice centres to help miners ’ wives and children claim welfare benefits if they were not working , as the strikers themselves were not eligible .
Then there was fundraising , organising meetings and demonstrations , speaking at meetings -- and of course picketing .
One of the focal points for many was the organisation of a village soup kitchen .
The need for such activity was highly practical -- the desperate shortage of funds to sustain a long fight .
In many areas there was overwhelming support for the strike , not only from trade unionists but from local shopkeepers and some factory owners who understood that without the industry their own livelihoods were threatened -- and who may have had relatives on strike .
The kitchens became a hive of activity not only for cooking and eating but for discussing how the strike could be furthered .
While it was assumed that the cooking was women ’s responsibility , being part of a large group catering for hundreds of meals a day was very different from providing a meal in the isolation of your own kitchen for " your " man .
And you did n’t have to worry how you were going to pay for the ingredients !
Women were able to talk to each other and to the men much more freely than before the dispute .
Roles began to change in other ways too .
Christine from Hoyland explains : “ I ’ve seen older men , not usually bothered with children , actually nurse youngsters while their parents eat their meal in peace . ”
Picketing
At the beginning of the strike , women in most areas did n’t consider becoming involved in picketing .
But as they gained in confidence , through the other support group activities , they decided to try .
One Barnsley woman explained :
At first we were a little nervous at the prospect of standing face to face with thousands of police , and we were unsure of the response we would receive from the men .
However , we were welcomed at every pit we visited , and quite soon we were joined by women from all over .
Two months into the strike , the bitterness generated by scabs was reaching fever pitch .
Because the police and the scabs had responded a little more tolerantly to the presence of women on the picket line , the idea of a women ’s mass picket was born .
The miners were certainly enthusiastic to see their unexpected visitors .
“ You can do things we can ’t , they wo n’t `get ' you , because you ’re women " , they said .
How wrong they were .
That day , 14 women were arrested at two Nottinghamshire pits , including Anne Scargill , wife of NUM President Arthur Scargill .
One of the enduring images of the strike was the image of a young woman being brutally batoned by a heavily armoured police on horseback at the " Battle of Orgreave " , one of the most bitter battles between the strikers and their supporters and the police .
These different activities had a profound impact on the women involved .
Some women in the more isolated coalfields might never have left their village before the strike , but during it they travelled to meetings in different parts of the country and spoke in front of audiences of strangers .
A large proportion of the women involved were not involved in paid work and had taken total responsibility for the home and children .
Now they were travelling to meetings or pickets , the men had to take their share of responsibility at home .
The effect of these changes was varied -- some relationships changed for the better , and others buckled under the strain .
One of the unusual features of the dispute was the development of “ twinning ” -- the linking of a particular pit with either a local area support group or a particular trade union branch .
Thousands of activists , mainly from the large cities , travelled to mining areas , often on a regular basis .
Many became firm friends with people in these areas and there was an exchange of experiences and political ideas that would not normally have taken place .
Women ’s groups made direct links with Women Against Pit Closures groups .
Women Against Pit Closures activists also visited the women ’s peace camp outside the Greenham Common US Air Force Base , which was expected to receive Trident nuclear missiles .
Lesbians and Gay men organised their own groups in support of the strike , as did black people .
On these issues too there was clearly movement in the thinking of at least some of the strikers and their supporters in the mining areas -- a real demonstration of the political ferment the dispute had generated .
The NUM itself was an overwhelmingly male union -- there were no women miners in Britain , only a very small number of women clerical members .
Before the dispute there had been a bitter row between the NUM leadership and feminists outside the union who had criticised The Yorkshire Miner , a union newspaper , for publishing pictures of scantily clad women .
Arthur Scargill and his “ comrades ” in the leadership of the Yorkshire NUM dismissed this criticism out of hand .
But by the end of the strike , the “ Page 3 girl ” had disappeared -- and Women against Pit Closures had been accepted into associate membership of the NUM .
The involvement of women at the centre of the dispute had other ramifications too .
It certainly made it harder for the Thatcherite press to attack the strike as being led by macho men .
The Liverpool dockers ’ strike
The defeat of the miners ' strike in 1985 had profound effects .
It strengthened the Thatcher regime and weakened workers ’ confidence to take action to defend their rights or their jobs .
However when the situation began to shift it was to become clear that at least some of the lessons of the miners ’ strike had been taken to heart elsewhere .
Since 1989 , when the Tories had abolished the national dock labour scheme , there had been mass sackings in most of the other great ports of England .
Liverpool was the last bastion of a once great industry with a proud tradition of union organisation -- it had to be smashed .
Some women had been attending the mass meetings from the beginning of the dispute , obviously anxious to know what was going on .
This fact is presented in most histories of the strike without comment -- but it is certainly unusual in most British strikes for " outsiders " to be present at mass meetings .
This demonstrates the relatively high political and democratic consciousness of the Liverpool dockers .
At one of these early meetings , Doreen McNally got up and started talking about the way that casualisation was destroying her family life .
This was to be the spark that led to the formation of Women On the Waterfront ( WOW ) in the second week of the dispute .
The group was involved in a variety of activities ; fundraising , participating in international and national delegations , picketing at the docks as well as less - conventional activities such as taking actions outside the homes of scabs and senior members of the Mersy Docks and Harbour Company ( MDHC ) .
The dockers themselves , at a theoretical level at least , were supportive of the move to set up a women ’s support group .
“ I already knew about the tremendous role that women had played in the miners ’ strike and other struggles in this country ” , says Jimmy Nolan , secretary of the Shop Stewards Committee .
“ The women have made a tremendous contribution to our struggle . ”
The first WOW meeting was attended by 60 women , who heard two women from Women Against Pit Closures talk about their experiences during the miners ’ strike .
They set up a committee and held weekly meetings as well as running their own office .
Their meetings were attended by a union shop steward who kept them informed of what was going on while a number of them attended the dockers ’ mass meetings which had a standing item of a report back from WOW .
Women ’s activity was seen as an integral part of the strike .
Probably a higher percentage of women involved in WOW had paid jobs than the women involved in the miners strike .
Doreen McNally , often WOW spokesperson , is a nurse .
She explains her own history :
My father was badly injured on the docks and I think that was part of the reason I went into nursing .
At that time there was no union for nurses , only the Royal College of Nurses ( a professional body , hostile to strikes and unions ) which you could join when you qualified .
My father had always been a strong trade unionist and believed everyone should be in a union so he contacted someone in NUPE [ National Union of Public Employees , now part of UNISON ] and we arranged a meeting with some colleagues .
I was one of the first nurses in Liverpool to join a real union .
Nevertheless for all those involved there was a massive change in their horizons , their self - confidence .
Joan says :
If anyone had told me that I would be addressing meetings all over the country I would have said `not me ' but you have so much anger at what they have done that you do n’t think about it .
You want to tell people the truth .
Sue explains what the strike has meant both for her and her relationship with her partner :
The dispute has changed me dramatically …
Before I was content being a mother and a housewife but now I want to go out into the world , I think I ’ve found myself again and when the dispute finishes I want to stay politically active and get a job .
There has also been changes in Colin ’s and my relationship .
Before we were very traditional -- he went to work and earned the money and I took charge of the house and the housekeeping .
Now this has changed .
Colin is much more involved at home -- he has to be because I ’m away so much .
He takes the budget , cooks meals and looks after the house .
Now we share our roles and are both very supportive of each other ’s union , political and outside activities .
Not just at the weekends …
Individual dockers reacted differently .
Billy admits :
Personally at first I was n’t too keen on the idea of there being an active women ’s group but that soon changed .
The women have been vitally important to us .
Prior to the dispute I suppose I would be what you would call an old - fashioned male chauvinist .
I always thought that the place for women was in the home , looking after the kids , which is a hard enough job .
Another striker , Keith , comments :
I ’d never been in the kitchen before …
I can use a tin opener now !
I make the beds and vacuum - clean the carpets during the week , not just at the weekends .
The parallels with many of the comments made and situations described by those involved in the miners ’ strike are clear .
But there are important differences .
Some are clearly a function of the differences between the two disputes .
The dockers ’ dispute was much smaller and more isolated than the miner ’s strike was .
The general level of confrontation between workers , employers and the state was less intense and there was much less generalised support from a range of groups in society .
The dispute was confined to one geographical area , the Port of Liverpool , where the miners ’ strike had a much wider spread .
The financial situation was also been very different .
In Liverpool the men were sacked , so were eligible for welfare benefits much more easily than the striking miners .
In the miners ’ strike the whole union was taking action and financial sources were hugely stretched -- whereas the Liverpool dockers comprised a tiny proportion of the Transport and General Workers Union ( TGWU ) , which did give some financial support , though not official backing .
Much of the focus of the dockers ’ shop stewards throughout the dispute had been on international solidarity -- resulting in some dramatically successful days of action in ports across the globe .
But there was little focus on fighting for action within the TGWU .
All of these features set partial limits on the development of WOW .
There were other differences too .
The British women ’s movement in general was much weaker in 1995 than in 1984 .
There were fewer direct links therefore between WOW and women ’s groups than during the time of the Women Against Pit Closures .
This impacted on the level of political discussion that women involved in the docks dispute had access too .
And while women ’s activity was integrated into the Liverpool dispute , in some ways their profile was not as high as during the miners ’ strike .
So for example on the second anniversary demonstration , Doreen McNally from WOW was the only woman on a platform of over 20 speakers -- and spoke last .
Although WOW was capable of mobilising significant numbers of women for its activities , such as family pickets , the activists who regularly attended the meetings and involved in delegation work represented a minority of the dockers ’ wives , partners and families .
It is only within these , the most involved , that we could expect to see the substantial changes in confidence , attitudes and lives that occurred during and after the miners ’ strike .
Though , of course , the experience and consciousness of women involved in solidarity movements is as complex and varied as that of the strikers themselves .
Despite this unevenness , the involvement of women in the Liverpool dock strike suggests that something significant had changed in British politics .
The Magnet strike
Our final example of a women ’s support group relates to the strike at Magnet .
Three hundred and forty workers were sacked in September 1996 for going on strike for a modest pay rise .
The strikers , mostly men , belonged to a range of different unions which formally supported the dispute but did nothing effective to help win it .
According to Ian Crammond , secretary of the strike committee , a women ’s support group was quickly set up , based on groups like WOW and WAPC .
Women were involved in a whole range of activities -- picketing , speaking at meetings , fundraising and organising leafleting of Magnet showrooms to persuade people not to buy the shoddy goods now being produced by scab labour , rather than those previously by skilled craftspeople .
Like the Liverpool women , a favourite occupation has been high - profile actions against leading shareholders -- in this case Bersfords , the parent company of Magnet .
While there was a caravan provided by one of the unions , which provided food for the regular pickets and staffed by men , this was not sufficient on mass picket days .
Then the women ’s support group produced additional hot food -- to the great delight of everyone standing freezing by the gates .
Lynne Fawcett from the Women ’s support Group explained some of the things that motivated her and others to get involved :
I have three children of my own in their 20s and I ’m extremely lucky they are all working .
What Magnet have done -- I ’m terrified the same thing could be done to them …
When you take men ’s jobs away their whole self - esteem and self - worth collapses .
The motivation goes out of your family life ; you lose your security ; and the knock - on effect for the whole town is less money , less prospects and more poverty .
There ’s enough poverty in Darlington already -- we do n’t need any more …
We ’re not going to take much more of this …
Like in the other disputes we have looked at , the involvement of women in the dispute at Magnet was often a morale booster for the strikers , with the women ’s determination and sense of humour raising confidence when spirits have been low .
In some families , the women became more involved than the men -- with big implications for the division of labour in the family .
The Magnet dispute continued for 21 months until the strikers accepted a management deal .
The formation of the women ’s support group contributed to the strength of the strike .
If the deal was not the victory hoped for , it certainly was n’t because of any lack of courage and determination of the women involved .
A new tradition
The organised women ’s liberation movement in Britain remains very weak .
But many women who came into contact with this new wave of working - class women ’s organisation since the 1984 - 5 miners ' strike have been inspired by it .
The lie has been given to the idea that many of the ideas of feminism -- for socialisation of the roles of the family and for equal participation in political life for women -- are of no relevance to working - class women .
The chance for the bosses and for governments to use women as ammunition against strikes in male - dominated industries has been seriously weakened .

Mr Singh died in hospital after suffering a head injury in the robbery A shopkeeper has been killed in a robbery by a gang of teenagers at his store in Huddersfield .
Gurmail Singh , 63 , suffered a head injury during the attack at Cowcliffe Convenience Store in Cowcliffe Hill Road , Cowcliffe , on Saturday night .
He died at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary in the early hours of the morning .
Detectives say the robbers , who were aged in their late teens , fled after a struggle with passers - by who had tried to stop them leaving the shop .
" This was a group of six people who heard a commotion at the shop and went to help , " a West Yorkshire Police spokesman said .
" None of them was injured during the incident . " ' Popular businessman '
The offenders , who were wearing dark hooded tops and tracksuit bottoms , escaped with a small amount of cash , cigarettes and confectionery , police said .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
Det Supt David Pervin , who is leading the investigation , said : " Mr Singh was a well - known and popular local businessman who had been in this area many years .
" I appeal for anyone with information to contact us as a matter of urgency . "
Mr Singh was " a family man with two adult sons " , police added .
A post -mortem examination is due to take place on Monday to determine the exact cause of death .
Mehboob Khan , leader of Kirklees Council , said Mr Singh was " extremely hard - working " and " would not hurt a fly " .
" He was very popular in the area , particularly with his elderly customers .
" I remember very recently he went out in the snow to deliver essential groceries to them .
" He was always putting other people first and thinking of his family .
He was a real pillar of the community . "
' A lot bigger ' Neighbour Ian Davison said there had been trouble at Mr Singh 's shop as recently as Thursday when a group of teenagers had attempted to smash open the till .
" Mr Singh was saying that four kids had been causing trouble , " he said .
The robbers escaped after a struggle with passers - by in the shop doorway " He said he did not want to take them on because they were a lot bigger than him . "
Mr Davison said there was a drugs problem in the area that was " getting out of hand " .
Mr Singh 's death had left the local community shocked , he added .
" He was a really popular , lovely bloke , " he said .
" You could n't wish to meet a nicer bloke than Mr Singh .
" Even in the snow he was pulling his sledge up here with his grandson , making sure the papers got delivered . "

Campus shootings generate more comment than comparable mayhem in other workplaces .
When a blue - collar worker goes on a killing rampage , public hunger for an explanation can often be satisfied with the tautological observation that he ( or on occasion she ) was " disgruntled . "
The same short answer wo n't suffice when the perpetrator is a professor .
Academics are theoretically defined by their participation in " the life of the mind , " and therefore we require their motives for murder to be more idea - driven than those of a laid - off postal worker .
In the five days since the serial revelations of the Amy Bishop tragedy began breaking , it 's been fascinating to track the rival and sharply politicized interpretations imposed on her alleged crime , in the media at large and especially in the teeming petri dish of opinion called the Internet .
An assistant professor of biology who had recently lost a protracted battle for tenure at the University of Alabama in Huntsville , the 44 - year - old Bishop had been sitting quietly in a departmental meeting on February 12 when she allegedly brandished a nine - millimeter pistol and began methodically shooting her colleagues ; three were dead and three more wounded before the survivors rushed her as she tried to reload .
It subsequently emerged that Bishop had been involved in the fishy 1986 shooting death of her 18 - year - old brother , Seth , at the family home in Braintree , Massachusetts .
Police dropped their inquiry into the matter after Bishop 's mother , who according to recollections of officers who were on the force at the time , sat on the police personnel board , persuaded their chief that the fatal shotgun blast had been an accident , as Amy asked Seth for help in unloading the gun .
That version of events has since been undermined by Braintree 's current police chief , who told reporters on February 13 that Bishop discharged the shotgun three times , once before and once after killing her brother .
She then reportedly fled to a nearby car dealership , where she held up two employees ( according to one of the unfortunates involved ) and demanded that they give her a getaway car .
Moments later the police arrived and disarmed her at gunpoint .
Apparently , though , the police report on the incident had been missing from the department 's files since at least 1988 .
The story got wilder still when it was reported that Bishop and her husband , James Anderson , had been questioned by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms in 1993 about two dud pipe bombs mailed to one of the evaluators of Bishop 's doctoral dissertation at Harvard .
Since then it has been revealed that Bishop , a mother of four , punched another woman in the head in 2002 in a dispute over the last booster seat at an International House of Pancakes .
But even before these freaky secondary aspects of the case had come to light , the bloggerati ( and answering commentariat ) had begun generating competing narratives to account for the shootings .
One the earliest out of the gate was video blogger Zennie Abraham Jr. , whose work can be found on the Bay Area Examiner site and the San Francisco Chronicle 's City Brights blog network ; he 's also covered electoral politics for the Huffington Post .
Rejecting the current consensus that Bishop was angry at having been denied tenure , Abraham offered a two - sided explanation for her alleged actions :
On one hand , he posited , she " believed that someone in that organization , that university , was trying to steal her idea " for a biotech invention that she and her husband were developing ; on the other , she was unduly stressed by " an environment that is anti-intellectual and perhaps having some problems adjusting to the south . "
Abraham 's first guess sidesteps the fact that UAH , like all comparable research institutions , has a well - defined profit - sharing policy for patents developed on university time .
By his second theory , Abraham seems to have been inferred that Bishop , as a Harvard product , was operating on far higher level than her hick - town colleagues — although the clarity of this argument is blurred by his assertion that the Harvard angle is so irrelevant that it should never have been reported .
At any rate , Abraham 's culture - shock thesis is — as several commenters pointed out — tough to reconcile with the fact that high - end academic credentials are common as kudzu around Huntsville , which is a major hub of aeronautics and engineering R & D .
Conservative construction of the tragedy is summed up by a plethora of blog headlines identifying Bishop as a " socialist professor " or " socialist serial killer , " and much reiteration of the Boston Herald 's anonymously sourced assertion that she is " a far - left political extremist who was ' obsessed ' with President Obama to the point of being off - putting . "
A related strain of commentary construed the shootings as a function of Bishop 's presumed feminism .
Some conservatives proposed the simple equivalence of liberalism / feminism and insanity ; their more restrained fellow travelers allowed that it would be improper to crudely politicize the shootings , though some further postulated , perhaps not without justice , that if Bishop 's politics were remotely conservative , the liberal enemy would be all over it .
Objectors to the " socialist " trope noted that the tag was first put into play by a single comment culled from Bishop 's very mixed student evaluations at RateMyProfessor.com , where , as any academic can attest , anything and everything will eventually be said .
Foes of affirmative action floated two theories , one to the effect that Bishop was hired for her gender and was n't qualified for tenure , the other positing that she was denied tenure because she was white and chose her victims accordingly .
Conservatives were also quick to pounce on the racial dimensions of the shootings , noting that all of the deceased were nonwhites and demanding to know why progressives were n't pillorying Bishop as a racist .
But the racial interpretations are problematized by Professor Joseph Ng 's eyewitness account of the shootings , which stated that Bishop simply " started with the one closest to her and went down the row . "
Still other conservatives predicted that feminists would appropriate Bishop as a symbol of the way that women are marginalized in the fields of science and technology .
To date , I 've only encountered such arguments in the peanut gallery of comments sections ; however , professor Gina Barreca , who blogs about women 's issues for the Chronicle of Higher Education , found another way to cast the alleged shooter as a victim : Bishop , she wrote , " was a different soul , one who apparently howled out her pain and rage 20 years ago , one who might have been rescued or restrained , one who might have been cured or caged or at least taken out of circulation .
But because she was smart and because someone was willing to take care of her , the system forgave her — only to have her attack and allegedly kill those who represented another kind of system , one that did not reward her to her satisfaction , 24 years later .
She thought the world was unfair and she was right . "
Men 's rights activists positioned the story as an equalizing demonstration of the female capacity for violence and pointed to Bishop 's track record of unchecked violence as an example of the " pussy pass " women supposedly enjoy before the law .
A proponent of intelligent design drew links between the slayings and her participation in the Clergy Letter Project , an initiative to evangelize the theory of evolution to ministers .
Anti-Semitic and white supremacist bloggers decided Bishop was Jewish and demonstrating the " entitlement " characteristic of her race .
Critics of the pharmaceutical industry jumped to the conclusion that Bishop had been knocked off her rocker by antidepressants .
Academics expressed their wonder that the tenure process did n't culminate in bloodshed more frequently .
Everywhere and always , the Harvard brand loomed large in commenters ' imaginations , though it meant different things to different observers .
To some it was presumptive proof of Bishop 's insufferable elitism ; to others definitive evidence of her brilliance .
As an Ivy League PhD , I would argue that both presumptions are incautious — the latter perhaps slightly more so than the former .
Also , none of the online commentary I 've seen has registered the sharp status differential between Ivy League undergrads and grad students .
These are different social types entirely , as dissimilar in aspect and lifestyle as the Eloi and the Morlocks in H.G. Wells 's The Time Machine .
Bishop , it 's worth noting , did her undergraduate degree at Northeastern University , a fine enough school I 'm told , but not widely seen as an incubator of the aristocracy .
Presumptions of Bishop 's genius were cast into doubt by California lawyer and blogger Mary Agnes O'Connor , who took a hard look at Bishop 's archived UAH Web pages and found evidence that her tenure portfolio was a house of cards : Bishop 's published research plan remained essentially unchanged between 2003 and 2008 , which suggested that her work on " resistance to nitro- oxidative stress in CNS cells " may have been going nowhere .
O'Connor also discovered that the most recent article on Bishop 's list of scholarly publications was cocredited to three of her children , who are identified as employees of " Cherokee LabSystems " despite the fact that the eldest is 18 , and was published by a journal of last resort whose declared philosophy of peer review " is that any paper that has interest to the readers and is reasonably written will be published .
Thus the Editor is looking for reasons to publish your paper , NOT reject it . "
Ultimately , of course , we 're just going to have to wait for Vanity Fair and / or Law & Order to issue any authoritative verdict on the meaning of the Huntsville tragedy .
In the meantime , our invaluable marketplace of ideas stays open all night .
“ Here we are again . ”
That was Rev. Janie Spahr ’s reaction as the Presbyterian Church ( USA ) lodged new charges against her for performing same - sex marriages .
Spahr has been in this hot seat before .
She ’s been in and out of trouble for presiding over ceremonies for same - sex couples since 2006 .
The worst punishment she has received was a rebuke in 2008 … “ the lightest possible punishment . ”
Church authorities decided that since the marriages were “ not marriages , she did not violate the church ’s constitution . ”
This time , things are a little different .
The 16 same - sex marriages she ’s accused of presiding over in the new charges were legal since they were performed “ during the five - month period in 2008 when same - sex marriage was legal in California . ”
Spahr ’s defender in the case , Scott Clark , said the church is “ trying to sanction a minister for performing legal marriages .
This is unprecedented . ”
JoAn Blackstone , who is the prosecutor , said the distinction is immaterial .
The marriages may well have been legal under state law , she said , but were “ expressly prohibited ” by the same ruling that acquitted Spahr in 2008 .
Blackstone said the case hinges on “ a narrow issue of church law ” and is unrelated to the public debate over same - sex marriage .
Unfortunately for the church , the public debate over same - sex marriage is precisely the issue .
For a clergy person to be forbidden from performing a wedding ceremony that is legal , then to be brought up on charges after performing a legal ceremony is outrageous .
It is another example of the conflict between church and state — and the impossible , and seemingly immoral , positions the church continues to put its clergy into .
While it is true that church law considers marriage as “ a civil contract between a woman and a man , ” at the time Spahr married these 16 couples , the state of California considered marriage a “ civil contract ” between a couple made up of opposite or same genders .
The key here is that marriage is a “ civil contract ” — under the legal auspices of the state and not the church .
For the church to claim they “ have no wiggle room ” on the charges pending against Spahr is disingenuous at best , and sad at worst .
Either the church is , once again , exerting its conservative muscle to make an example of one of its own as a warning to other clergy who may step out of line , or the church is in such a sad state that it feels it has no choice but to defend a law that continues to exclude and harm a segment of God ’s children .
The law Spahr is accused of violating is unjust and as Martin Luther King Jr. once said , “ one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws . ”
To Spahr ’s credit , she has no trouble following that advice , telling the Press Democrat : “ It ’s a real faith issue for me , ” she said .
“ I think I would be in jeopardy if I did n’t do it . ”
Spahr will go on trial sometime in August or September .
In the spirit of Mike Gogulski ’s head turning article “ F–k the Troops “ , I wanted to post a lesser article regarding the pro-State Olympics brainwashing pogrom .
I have no qualms with individuals dedicated to being the best they can be at whatever they do , provided they do not accept stolen money fenced by the State via taxation to subsidize their pursuits .
You want to be the person who can ski and shoot the best ?
Go right ahead .
You want to run the fastest ?
Jump the highest ?
Be the fastest boblsled racer ?
Be my guest !
If you are subsidized by government programs to pursue your craft , do you think it morally right the State confiscates wealth from others and redirects it to you for a pro-State branding campaign ?
Newspaper articles abound with fools painted in national tattoos , chests welled up in false pride , and eyes shiny with tears proclaiming love and homage to artificially drawn political borders over a geographical area secured by violence .
Parasitic politicians come out in droves , slavishly praising their athletes , especially if the athlete comes from their “ home town ” , eagerly lapped up by the salacious sycophantic press .
Why is this ?
Why do people claim the right to feel kinship and pride to this person , when these same people made no contribution to the evolution and outcome of the athlete and sport , just because they are from the same political State or “ hometown ” ?
Why is people , who had their money taxed away from them via State violence to pay for any subsidization of the training of these athletes ?
Why is it a group of people enslaved to the taxation / inflation system of Country A is better or worse than another group of people enslaved to the taxation / inflation system of Country B ?
I remember years ago , in Canada , when Ben Johnson won the 100 m dash in a world record .
Canadians rejoiced in the reflected glory of winning the gold medal and breaking the world record .
Remember , these Canadians contributed nothing to the success or failure of Johnson .
The interesting part was , and I remember this well , was that when he won , it was a “ proud ” day for Canada .
When evidence but not conviction of steroid use became public , newspapers started tacitly ( ok , blatantly ) began referring to him as “ Canadian - Jamaican ” and when he was convicted of steroid use , they again changed their meme to “ Jamaican born Ben Johnson … yada , yada , ” .
LOL !
The Olympics represent a intellectual trap .
If your slaves can be artificially induced to feel pride in their political State , they are less likely to think “ Taxation is theft ! ” and will more likely be induced to excoriate themselves into acquiescing to the State or call for the excoriation of others who do n’t .
Moreover , its an investment by the State in the future of the State .
When parents bring their children to the Olympic Torch parades and encourage them to feel the same bigotry of artificial pride in their own country , it helps prevent the children from questioning the moral legitimacy of government .
These kids will help police others who dissent in the future , inheriting the same pro-State trolling their parents do .
They are basted in the juices of self - immolation delivering themselves into the jaws of the State , beginning the journey from this :
to this ( rumours abound she committed suicide … the military is “ investigating ” ) :
to this :
There is no glory in this .
There is no pride in this .
Would parents consciously put their children in harms way ?
Would parents murder / cannibalize their own children ?
The Olympics is a massive brainwashing pogrom that deflects slaves into believing the looting and pillaging of their political masters are better than the looting and pillaging of other political masters .
Oh sure , we can vote to choose our next master , but we can not vote * NOT * to be a slave .
F–k the Torch .
This week sees the addition of unique challenges to the Slayer Masters of the world .
Players who have successfully completed several assignments for a Slayer Master will occasionally be offered the option of completing a special task in place of a regular assignment , when visiting their favourite Slayer Master .
The tasks on offer differ depending on which of the masters you visit .
They each have their own unique request , ranging from Vannaka ’s dragon hunting to fulfilling Sumona ’s vendetta against the Kalphite Queen , up to running Duradel ’s gauntlet of killing every creature in the Slayer Tower !
These new tasks are optional , and you can decline them in favour of a regular Slayer assignment should you wish to ( with no penalty ) .
If you do choose to take on these special challenges , however , you ’ll be rewarded with additional Slayer experience and , if you ’ve completed the Smoking Kills quest , Slayer points too .

It 's a mystery worthy of Sherlock Holmes :
Who put the veterinary worm medicine in cocaine ?
( And who would know more about cocaine than that connoisseur of the seven - per- cent solution ? )
The story started in April 2008 when the New Mexico Department of Health began investigating a cluster of cases of agranulocytosis in which no known cause was identified .
The only feature these cases had in common was use of cocaine ( powder and crack ) .
But no association between cocaine use and agranulocytosis had ever been described .
Eventually , the department identified 11 cases , including one patient who died of Serratia marcescens sepsis , and had an absolute neutrophil count of zero .
Meanwhile , in Canada , health officials reported detecting levamisole in clinical samples and drug paraphernalia of cocaine users diagnosed with agranulocytosis .
Levamisole , a veterinary antihelminthic drug , is used mostly in animals as a dewormer .
It also is used as adjunctive therapy for certain human malignancies , rheumatoid conditions , and skin diseases , but most significantly , it is known to cause agranulocytosis in a small percentage of patients exposed to it .
While these investigations were proceeding in New Mexico and Canada , 10 cases of agranulocytosis were identified in Washington state .
Again , the only common thread was that all patients reported use of cocaine .
So at that point , 21 otherwise unexplained cases of agranulocytosis were reported in the United States .
But was levamisole the essential link that connected all these cases ?
It is important to understand that in clinical situations , the presence of levamisole is difficult to determine .
Because the half - life of the drug is about five hours , it might not be detected unless specimens are obtained promptly .
Nevertheless , tests were carried out in five of the 21 patients , and four tested positive for levamisole .
Although identified cases of agraunlocytosis associated with cocaine use are still relatively rare , the presence of levamisole in illicit samples is not at all unusual .
In July 2009 , the Drug Enforcement Administration announced that 69 percent of cocaine samples intercepted coming into the United States were adulterated with levamisole , at an average concentration of 10 % .
Although it is not immediately obvious why drug traffickers would cut cocaine with a veterinary worm medicine , there have been some interesting hypotheses .
One case report suggested that it might enhance cocaine - induced euphoria because levamisole increases dopamine levels in the brain 's pleasure centers .
( Ann Intern Med 2009 ; 150 [ 4 ] : 287 . )
A more detailed theory was posited by Raymon and Isenschmid in the Journal of Analytical Toxicology ( 2009;33[9]:620 ) .
They pointed out the levamisole , like many antihelminthics , acts as an agonist at nicotinic receptors .
This nicotinic effect , in fact , is responsible for levamisole 's success as a dewormer .
Just as the nicotinic actions of organophosphate insecticides or nerve agents cause uncontrollable muscle contractions , levamisole produces spastic paralysis in the worm , which releases its grip on the gastrointestinal tract , and is then expelled .
The authors speculate that the nicotine - like effect at ganglia also may release norepinephrine and dopamine , enhancing sympathomimetic activity and elevating mood .
Other neurotransmitters such as GABA , epinephrine , and glutamate may also be involved .
The take - home lesson for clinicians :
If a patient comes in with otherwise unexplained neutropenia or agranulocytosis , take a careful history of possible illicit drug use .
Anthrax in Heroin
And as if it were n't enough to have to ask why a dewormer is in cocaine , recent events also force us to ask :
How did anthrax show up in heroin ?
Last December , health officials in Scotland reported that two , possible three , heroin users had died in the hospital of disseminated anthrax infection .
By January , six anthrax deaths had been reported , with additional patients ill from the infection .
This had happened before .
In 2000 , a team from Oslo , Norway , published a case report describing a 49 - year - old heroin skin - popper who was seen in the clinic for an infection in his right buttock .
( Lancet 2000;356[9241] :1574 . )
He was afebrile , and had no detectable pus on incision .
He was started on outpatient treatment with dicloxacillin .
Four days later he was brought to the emergency department , comatose and in shock .
A spinal tap revealed hemorrhagic meningitis .
He was started on treatment with high - dose penicillin , chloramphenicol , and dexamethasone .
Surgical exploration found massive edema of the right buttock area but no pus or necrosis .
CSF and wound cultures grew Bacillus anthracis .
Despite therapy , the patient died on about the third hospital day .
The authors hypothesized that he might have contracted anthrax from contaminated heroin , and pointed out that most of Europe 's heroin supply originated in Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Iran , where anthrax spores are commonly found .
Was the contamination of heroin with B. anthracis inadvertent ?
It 's possible , but with this recent cluster of cases , some health officials have suggested another explanation .
Heroin is commonly cut with a variety of substances , either to increase bulk or to enhance the pharmacokinetics or effects of the drug .
( See table . )
Some have speculated that the heroin could have been adulterated with bone meal , an animal product that very well could contain anthrax spores .
In any event , it is important for clinicians to remember that it is never safe to assume that a skin infection in a drug user is just cellulitis or an uncomplicated abscess .
Aside from the possibility that a drug user 's immune system might be compromised , cases of wound botulism among black tar heroin users ( Washington , 2003 ) and tetanus among injecting drug users ( California , 1997 ) have been well documented .
Gangrene is always a possibility , too .
Now we can add injectional anthrax to the list of complications to consider in these patients .

Ethics from the Barrel of a Gun :
What Bearing Weapons Teaches About the Good Life
Translations : Spanish
The bearing of arms is the essential medium through which the individual asserts both his social power and his participation in politics as a responsible moral being ... ( Historian J.G.A. Pocock , describing the beliefs of the founders of the U.S. )
There is nothing like having your finger on the trigger of a gun to reveal who you really are .
Life or death in one twitch — ultimate decision , with the ultimate price for carelessness or bad choices .
It is a kind of acid test , an initiation , to know that there is lethal force in your hand and all the complexities and ambiguities of moral choice have fined down to a single action : fire or not ?
In truth , we are called upon to make life - or - death choices more often than we generally realize .
Every political choice ultimately reduces to a choice about when and how to use lethal force , because the threat of lethal force is what makes politics and law more than a game out of which anyone could opt at any time .
But most of our life - and - death choices are abstract ; their costs are diffused and distant .
We are insulated from those costs by layers of institutions we have created to specialize in controlled violence ( police , prisons , armies ) and to direct that violence ( legislatures , courts ) .
As such , the lessons those choices teach seldom become personal to most of us .
Nothing most of us will ever do combines the moral weight of life - or - death choice with the concrete immediacy of the moment as thoroughly as the conscious handling of instruments deliberately designed to kill .
As such , there are lessons both merciless and priceless to be learned from bearing arms — lessons which are not merely instructive to the intellect but transformative of one 's whole emotional , reflexive , and moral character .
The first and most important of these lessons is this : it all comes down to you .
No one 's finger is on the trigger but your own .
All the talk - talk in your head , all the emotions in your heart , all the experiences of your past — these things may inform your choice , but they can't move your finger .
All the socialization and rationalization and justification in the world , all the approval or disapproval of your neighbors — none of these things can pull the trigger either .
They can change how you feel about the choice , but only you can actually make the choice .
Only you .
Only here .
Only now .
Fire , or not ?
A second is this : never count on being able to undo your choices .
If you shoot someone through the heart , dead is dead .
You can't take it back .
There are no do - overs .
Real choice is like that ; you make it , you live with it — or die with it .
A third lesson is this : the universe does n't care about motives .
If your gun has an accidental discharge while pointed an unsafe direction , the bullet will kill just as dead as if you had been aiming the shot .
I did n't mean to may persuade others that you are less likely to repeat a behavior , but it wo n't bring a corpse back to life .
These are hard lessons , but necessary ones .
Stated , in print , they may seem trivial or obvious .
But ethical maturity consists , in significant part , of knowing these things — not merely at the level of intellect but at the level of emotion , experience and reflex .
And nothing teaches these things like repeated confrontation with life - or - death choices in grave knowledge of the consequences of failure .
This psychological insight both illuminates and is reinforced by one central fact of U.S. history that is usually considered purely political , and even ( wrongly ) thought to be of interest only to Americans .
The Founding Fathers of the United States believed , and wrote , that the bearing of arms was essential to the character and dignity of a free people .
For this reason , they wrote a Second Amendment in the Bill Of Rights which reads the right to bear arms shall not be infringed .
Whether one agrees or disagrees with it , the Second Amendment is usually interpreted in these latter days as an axiom of and about political character — an expression of republican political thought , a prescription for a equilibrium of power in which the armed people are at least equal in might to the organized forces of government .
It is all these things .
But it is something more , because the Founders regarded political character and individual ethical character as inseparable .
They had a clear notion of the individual virtues necessary collectively to a free people .
They did not merely regard the habit of bearing arms as a political virtue , but as a direct promoter of personal virtue .
The Founders had been successful armed revolutionaries .
Every one of them had had repeated confrontation with life - or - death choices , in grave knowledge of the consequences of failure .
They desired that the people of their infant nation should always cultivate that kind of ethical maturity , the keen sense of individual moral responsibility that they had personally learned from using lethal force in defense of their liberty .
Accordingly , firearms were prohibited only to those intended to be kept powerless and infantilized .
American gun prohibitions have their origins in racist legislation designed to disarm slaves and black freedmen .
The wording of that legislation repays study ; it was designed not merely to deny blacks the political power of arms but to prevent them from aspiring to the dignity of free men .
The dignity of free men ( and , as we would properly add today , free women ) .
That is a phrase that bears thinking on .
As the twentieth century draws to a close , it sounds archaic .
Our discourse has nearly lost the concept that the health of the res publica is founded on private virtue .
Too many of us contemplate a president who preaches family values and responsibility to the nation while committing adultery and perjury , and do n't see a contradiction .
But Thomas Jefferson 's question , posed in his inaugural address of 1801 , still stings .
If a man can not be trusted with the government of himself , how can he be trusted with the government of others ?
And this is where history and politics circle back to ethics and psychology : because the dignity of a free ( wo ) man consists in being competent to govern one 's self , and in knowing , down to the core of one 's self , that one is so competent .
And that is where ethics and psychology bring us back to the bearing of arms .
For causality runs both ways here ; the dignity of a free man is what makes one ethically competent to bear arms , and the act of bearing arms promotes ( by teaching its hard and subtle lessons ) the inner qualities that compose the dignity of a free man .
It is not always so , of course .
There is a 3 % or so of psychotics , drug addicts , and criminal deviants who are incapable of the dignity of free men .
Arms in the hands of such as these do not promote virtue , but are merely instruments of tragedy and destruction .
But so , too , are cars .
And kitchen knives .
And bricks .
The ethically incompetent readily ( and effectively ) find other means to destroy and terrorize when denied arms .
And when civilian arms are banned , they more readily find helpless victims .
But for the other 97 % , the bearing of arms functions not merely as an assertion of power but as a fierce and redemptive discipline .
When sudden death hangs inches from your right hand , you become much more careful , more mindful , and much more peaceful in your heart — because you know that if you are thoughtless or sloppy in your actions or succumb to bad temper , people will die .
Too many of us have come to believe ourselves incapable of this discipline .
We fall prey to the sick belief that we are all psychopaths or incompetents under the skin .
We have been taught to imagine ourselves armed only as villains , doomed to succumb to our own worst nature and kill a loved one in a moment of carelessness or rage .
Or to end our days holed up in a mall listening to police bullhorns as some SWAT sniper draws a bead ...
But it 's not so .
To believe this is to ignore the actual statistics and generative patterns of weapons crimes .
Virtually never , writes criminologist Don B. Kates , are murderers the ordinary , law - abiding people against whom gun bans are aimed .
Almost without exception , murderers are extreme aberrants with lifelong histories of crime , substance abuse , psychopathology , mental retardation and / or irrational violence against those around them , as well as other hazardous behavior , e.g. , automobile and gun accidents .
To believe one is incompetent to bear arms is , therefore , to live in corroding and almost always needless fear of the self — in fact , to affirm oneself a moral coward .
A state further from the dignity of a free man would be rather hard to imagine .
It is as a way of exorcising this demon , of reclaiming for ourselves the dignity and courage and ethical self - confidence of free ( wo ) men that the bearing of personal arms , is , ultimately , most important .
This is the final ethical lesson of bearing arms : that right choices are possible , and the ordinary judgement of ordinary ( wo ) men is sufficient to make them .
We can , truly , embrace our power and our responsibility to make life - or - death decisions , rather than fearing both .
We can accept our ultimate responsibility for our own actions .
We can know ( not just intellectually , but in the sinew of experience ) that we are fit to choose .
And not only can we — we must .
The Founding Fathers of the United States understood why .
If we fail this test , we fail not only in private virtue but consequently in our capacity to make public choices .
Rudderless , lacking an earned and grounded faith in ourselves , we can only drift — increasingly helpless to summon even the will to resist predators and tyrants ( let alone the capability to do so ) .
Joel Barlow , a political theorist of Jefferson 's time , wrote tellingly : [ The disarming of citizens has ] a double effect , it palsies the hand and brutalizes the mind : a habitual disuse of physical forces totally destroys the moral [ force ] ; and men lose at once the power of protecting themselves , and of discerning the cause of their oppression .
We live with a recent history of massacres by governments that have dwarfed in scope and cruelty anything Barlow or Jefferson could have imagined .
The Turkish massacre of the Armenians , the Nazi final solution , the Soviet purges , the killing fields of Cambodia , the Hutu - Tutsi massacres in Rwanda ; each and every one of these vast and hideous slaughters was preceded by and relied upon the disarmament of the victims .
It is more important than ever , today after a century of blood , that we retain the power both to protect ourselves and to discern the cause of such oppressions .
That cause has never been in civilian arms borne by free people , but in their opposite and enemy — the organized and conscienceless brutality of cancerous states .
It is time to recognize that we , as individuals and as citizens of our neighborhoods and our nations and our planet , have gone too far down a road that leads only to disintegration of both society and self — a future of atomized and alienated sheep , terrified by the reflection in each others ' eyes of the phantoms in their own souls , easy prey for demagogues and dictators .
It is time for each of us to rediscover the dignity of free men ( and women ) in the only way possible ; by proving it in the crucible of daily decision , even on ultimate matters of life and death .
It is time for us to embrace bearing arms again — not merely as a deterrent against criminals and tyrants , but as a gift and sacrament and affirmation to ourselves .

Thanks to all of you who tuned in for our Dinner and A Movie Dicks - travaganza this past weekend .
The next Dinner and a Movie will be on Wednesday , September 30 , not September 29 as we previously said .
The first of the 2020 presidential debates falls on the 29th , and we want to encourage those of
ACCRA , Ghana —
Quenching your thirst costs a few cents in Ghana ’s capital city , where street vendors sell purified water in clear plastic bags .
But environmental and public health costs are much higher .
Empty sachets are tossed to the ground because there ’s no comprehensive recycling program and few trash cans .
The bags clog storm drains , which leads to flooding and increased risk of diseases like malaria .
One solution is to turn the trash into totes — and purses , and sports bags .
That ’s the idea behind Trashy Bags , an NGO that retrieves water and ice cream sachets from the streets , scrubs them clean and sews them into usable items .
“ For most people who come as a tourist , the amount of waste on the street here , we ’re just not used to it , so it ’s shocking , ” said Carma Lovely , a Colorado native living in Accra .
“ I do n’t think that in this culture they know the long - term effect of it . ”
British - born Stuart Gold was working on a global warming project when he and his former business partner , a Ghanaian , came up with the idea .
It ’s been a hit , especially with environmentally conscious expatriates .
Trashy Bags has removed more than 10 million sachets from the streets in its more than two years of operation .
“ What we collect now is minimal compared to what needs to be picked up , ” Gold said .
“ We get many , many thousands of sachets a month .
It ’s a small , small dent in the problem . ”
Indeed , there ’s no shortage .
Water sachets are available on every corner , and hawkers weave through traffic to deliver them to motorists .
Accra officials estimate the sachets compose 85 percent of all waste generated by the city ’s 3 million residents .
Less than 5 percent is recycled .
Also popular are Fan Milk products , which include ice cream , frozen yogurt and citrus drinks .
Fan Milk ’s colorful packaging injects some flair into the Trashy Bags products .
In his second - floor showroom above the washing and sewing stations , Gold points to the bag he hopes will fuel a major expansion .
It ’s called the “ Smart Bag , ” a fold - up grocery bag sewn from the plastic of 50 sachets .
It sells locally for about $ 12 .
He hopes to export them to the United States and distribute them through upscale chains like Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s .
“ That ’s the link .
We have to create that market .
That would really make a big impact on the environment here , because if we could ship a million of those a year , say , then that means we get 50 million of the sachets off the streets every year , ” he said .
There are 60 employees , excluding the dozens of people who are paid small fees for collecting the bags .
If the Smart Bag plan succeeds , Gold says he ’ll expand production by enlisting people outside Accra to collect , clean and sew the bags in their villages .
“ We ca n’t do it cheaply enough in Accra .
Our overhead is too high , ” said Gold , who declined to discuss sales figures .
“ It ’s hard to get to the point where we ’re covering our costs .
We ’re not even breaking even . ”
Educating the public about the dangers of plastic waste is another goal .
Trashy Bags worked with the French Embassy in Accra two years ago to persuade shoppers at six supermarkets to use less plastic .
More recently , they ’ve asked the supermarkets to charge a small fee for each plastic bag .
Under the plan , the fees would go into a nongovernmental fund allocating grants for environmental projects .
They ’re awaiting an answer from the city ’s biggest supermarket .
Production manager Elvis Aboluah said his fellow Ghanaians are still learning that plastic waste is harmful to the environment .
“ We need to educate people to let them understand that , look , the plastic that you have thrown away 50 or 60 years ago is hidden somewhere and causing destruction , ” he said .
“ It ’s a major , major problem .
Plastic does n’t biodegrade like leaves and other things . ”
African governments have struggled with the plastic waste problem — more focused on plastic bags than sachets .
Eritrea , Rwanda and Tanzania have banned plastic bags while South Africa , Uganda and Kenya have set restrictions on their production and use .
Last year , Ghana 's Vice President John Dramani Mahama said at an environmental conference that the administration would support a ban on plastic bags if the problem were not solved .
As for sachets , Ghana plans to impose a 20 percent tax on sales of water in plastic bottles and sachets , to raise money for cleanup efforts .
Lovely , the American , has visited the showroom many times and now brings friends .
In the past she has bought children ’s backpacks as well as computer bags for friends .
“ That was just for fun , ” she said .
“ I do n’t know that you ’d walk into Price Waterhouse with one ... but you should . ”
It 's not possible for Katie Jackson to be any more clear about what she wants for Christmas .
It 's ...
It 's becoming increasingly clear that Disney 's March 5 release of " Alice in Wonderland " may have helped trigger a dramatic tipping point in film history .
The movie 's 3 - D ticket sales have been astounding , which has helped spur even more momentum for Hollywood 's rush to turn nearly every movie imaginable into a 3 - D release .
The film provided a much - needed hit for Disney , even though the executives who put it into production -- Dick Cook and Oren Aviv - - were n't around to enjoy its success , having lost their jobs long before the film arrived in theaters .
But here 's what will reserve " Alice " a place in the movie history books :
It finally put the nail in the coffin of movie theater owners ' mindlessly stubborn resistance to shorter DVD windows .
For years , exhibitors have loudly complained that a shorter time frame between a film 's release date and its arrival on DVD would basically be the end of the world as we know it , somehow encouraging untold millions of moviegoers to stay at home and wait for the DVD .
Though it was by accident , not design , " Alice " was the perfect test case to prove exhibitors wrong .
After Disney announced it would bring the movie out on DVD within three months of its theatrical release ( instead of the customary four - month window ) , exhibitors all across Europe threatened to keep the picture off their screens .
U.S. exhibitors were equally unhappy , muttering darkly that the shortened window would put a crimp in the film 's grosses .
Disney and the European exhibitors finally worked out a deal , preventing a boycott , but not until the controversy had received saturation media coverage around the globe , alerting even the most casual moviegoer that " Alice " would be arriving on DVD a month earlier than usual .
The result ?
" Alice " had the biggest non-sequel opening weekend of all time , grossing $ 116.1 million in the U.S. , with its worldwide box office now standing at an impressive $ 366.2 million .
So even though everyone in the world knew it was coming out 12 or so weeks later on DVD , they went to the theater anyway .
As one studio chief said to me the other day , barely suppressing a chortle : " Case closed . "
In truth , the case is n't exactly closed .
But the weight of anecdotal evidence now clearly supports the studio's case .
If a movie is good enough , people will come see it , no matter when it 's due out on DVD .
The bigger question is :
What will the studios do next ?
From the studio point of view , it simply does n't make sense to wait 16 weeks or more to release a film on DVD when the average film does 80 % of its business in its first three weeks in the theaters .
Except for a phenomenon like " Avatar " or a mega - crowd pleaser like " The Hangover , " most studio films have completely played out in six , or at most eight , weeks .
So why not take better advantage of the millions of marketing dollars you 've spent raising audience awareness in a film by moving up the DVD release far enough to essentially sell two tickets on the same ad campaign -- one for the theatrical release and one for the DVD ?
Despite an obvious consumer appetite to see movies at home sooner , we 're still a long way away from the brave new world anticipated by digital idealists in which films would appear simultaneously in theaters as well as on video on demand ( VOD ) , pay TV and DVD .
So far , only Mark Cuban -- who often bankrolls his own films and has a theater chain and HDTV network to play them - - has tried anything resembling such a radical experiment .
It had decidedly mixed results , since " Bubble , " the highest - profile film to be released day and date , was n't exactly the kind of movie that anyone but a few pencil - neck cinema geeks would bother to watch anyway .
It 's telling that Disney was the studio that has most aggressively pursued the DVD window issue .
Unlike the other major studios , which are still helmed by executives with a background in movies , Disney is run by Bob Iger and Rich Ross , whose formative years were spent in TV .
Being TV guys , they are used to expecting quick results and are unaccustomed to the glacial pace of moviedom .
They also have few emotional ties to the film business , so as they go about reinventing Disney as a media brand assembly line , they see their movies as media events , not just theatrical product , making them more likely to experiment with different release windows .
Disney 's lack of loyalty to exhibitors has its price .
With 3 - D screens still in short supply , Disney is going to lose a lot of " Alice " playdates this weekend with the arrival of DreamWorks '
" How to Train Your Dragon , " even though " Alice " is still the top - grossing movie in the country .
But figuring that " Dragon " audiences will fill up their 3 - D screens , exhibitors can stick it to Disney for shortening their window on " Alice " by giving over a host of screens to " Dragon . "
In other words , despite the kick - start from " Alice , " the process of change in DVD windows is going to look a lot more like an evolution than a revolution .
Disney 's " Alice " move was a baby step , not a radical leap into the unknown , largely because the executives who run studios are still cautiously feeling their way forward , especially knowing that they are still beholden to theater owners who remain resistant to change .
Digital technology , for example , has been around for years , but only now -- with moviegoers happily paying a $ 3 premium to buy 3 - D movie tickets -- have exhibitors begun a speedy transition from 1940s - era film projection to video projection .
Hollywood is not a hotbed of idealism .
Change is almost always spurred by economic incentives .
In other words , money talks .
Studios are only going to experiment with shorter DVD windows because they can get more bang for their marketing bucks and stave off piracy , since the longer you wait to put out a film on DVD , the more of its core audience will be watching unauthorized copies of it on the Web .
It 's pretty easy to visualize the kind of bold experiment that should have happened by now .
If you 're releasing a film that 's just a routine programmer , one that is n't reliant on special effects for its appeal ( which people would feel the need to see on a big screen ) , why not try a day - and - date release , taking advantage of the millions of movie lovers who 've put some big dough into their home entertainment centers .
If you have a film like " Shutter Island , " " Cop Out " or " The Bounty Hunter , " that could just as easily be enjoyed at home as in the theaters , why not charge fans a premium -- say $ 22.95 -- to see it at home on VOD at the same time as it plays in the theaters ?
It makes total economic sense , instantly providing two different revenue streams that can take advantage of the same marketing campaign , while attracting a scrum of fans who would n't have gone to the trouble to see the film in a theater , but would be willing to pay a premium to see it in the comfort of their living rooms .
This parallel form of movie distribution would 've happened already if it was n't for the resistance of exhibitors , who have long said they 'd refuse to book any movie that is available anywhere else while it 's opening in theaters .
( That 's why Summit could barely do a theatrical re-release of its Oscar - winning " The Hurt Locker " -- theater owners would n't book a movie that had already been out on DVD . )
So why not make the exhibitors partners ?
If they are willing to risk a box - office shortfall , then promise them a cut of the VOD revenue .
Or a better split from the theatrical take .
After all , DreamWorks has already made Wal - Mart its merchandising partner for the release of " How to Train Your Dragon , " giving Wal - Mart the exclusive on nearly all licensed " Dragon " products in return for the giant retailer making a huge promotional commitment to the film .
Why could n't studios create a similar partnership with a theater chain , giving them an incentive to see if a day - and - date experiment could build a bigger audience for a new film without cannibalizing the theater 's audience ?
It 's something consumers would enthusiastically embrace , since they are already in the habit of consuming most of their favorite music and TV shows on a variety of media platforms .
There 's a lesson here , one that the movie business should have already learned from the collapse of the record industry .
If you let your business model lag too far behind the habits of your most loyal consumers , you 'll soon discover that you do n't have a business anymore .

It was a big day for Napalm Death .
John Peel 's producer , John Walters , had called drummer Mick Harris at his parents ' house in Birmingham to ask the question every up and coming band wanted to hear : whether the band could come down to London to do a session .
They knew that Peel had been going crazy for their debut album Scum , and holding the DJ in no little reverence , they agreed .
Too excited to be nervous they looked forward to a Sunday afternoon in the BBC's Maida Vale studio , and the prospect of a free meal .
The teenage band - as ever - had to converge on Birmingham from disparate points : bassist Shane Embury came from home in Ironbridge near Telford , Shropshire and stayed overnight at Harris 's house .
Bill Steer 's parents dropped him off in the morning ( they still would n't let the guitarist travel on his own by train from the Wirral ) .
They piled into the rented van and picked up vocalist Lee Dorrian in Coventry , before heading towards their destiny .
Long - suffering Peel Sessions producer Dale Griffin was aghast .
Harris had gamely presented him with the 12 song setlist that the band wanted to perform in their twenty minutes in studio 3 , beaming from ear to ear , the hyperactive little shite as ever .
But this was not the way things ran , Griffin explained : bands had twenty minutes divided into four slots : A , B , C and D . Yes , a band could get away with five , maybe six songs if they squeezed two into one slot , but twelve was out of the question .
Harris had to repeat to yet another sound engineer how Napalm worked : that it would only take a few minutes : their songs did n't last long .
Griffin was perplexed as much as exasperated , but soon relented and stood open mouthed as the band blazed through their set in one take .
Music had taken some very strange paths since he had co-founded Mott the Hoople in 1969 , but this was something else .
Dorrian and Harris took their positions to overlay the vocals , credited on Scum for " lead growls " and " caveman screams and growls " respectively .
Once they started Griffin had to be fast to stop them in their tracks , half - laughing and half - crying he ran out and brought back avant garde punk vocalist Danielle Dax who had been recording in the adjacent studio .
They started again , before Dax exclaimed , " You ca n't sing like that !
You 'll damage your vocal chords , boys ! "
Napalm Death 's first Peel session , recorded on 13th September 1987 , is the most extreme recording by one of the most extreme bands Britain has ever produced .
Because it was for Peel , they made it special .
The shock - and - awe ferocity of its execution is remarkable even now , when hundreds and hundreds of bands since have tried to supplant them .
It 's at once a terrifying , hilarious and totally life - affirming encapsulation of their determination to push and push and push the boundaries of rock music ; its sheer physicality and visceral , shit - kicking energy attests to a sort of human triumph .
Precision and control , calamity and chaos are poised on a knife edge .
Napalm Death arrived that day with a bass guitar , a pair of drumsticks and Mick Harris 's trusted Pearl drum pedal ( used since his first gig on drums with a band called Martian Brain Squeeze ) which he regarded superstitiously as the only one capable of letting him unleash the supersonic beats which made Napalm Death legend .
Force of a hurricane , fast as lightning : the art of ' blasting ' .
The first three - track section of the session holds within it all of Napalm 's mercurial madness .
' The Kill ' starts straightforwardly enough with a searing guitar tone and a three note up - and - down riff before the snare fill kicks it into warp speed : a white noise , sheet metal firestorm overlaid with screaming , syncopated vocal ravages .
It lasts less than twenty seconds : musical conventions of rhythm and melody are seemingly destroyed .
' Prison Without Walls ' is slightly slower , which by any other standard is very fast , but without being flat - out it lurches drunkenly around the beat , Dorrian sounding like he 's sending himself up .
But the wayward delivery is abruptly counter - punched by ' Dead ' ( here , sardonically , ‘ Dead , pt. 1 ’ ) , two seconds that razes the opening section to the ground .
Throughout the session , the traditional order of instrumental prominence is upended : the drums dominate , given space to reverberate in the mix .
Napalm ’s signature blast beats – Harris 's super - tensed peppering of the ride cymbal and alternate striking of the crash – solidify to a terrifying wall of noise .
' Lucid Fairytale ' even unveils the bass , hardly discernable as anything but buzzing , the distortion more prominent and potent than the melody it adorns ; a subsonic abrasiveness that led Harris to dub this new musical form grindcore .
The session goes on in squalls and flurries , violently probing the boundaries of what constitutes the acceptable .
And then there 's ' You Suffer ' : notorious for being barely over a second long , here ( concluding their little joke ) ' You Suffer Pt. 2 ' .
Like a stinging blow it comes and passes , and the shock sinks in as it echoes out in the mix .
It ’s as if one of the denizens of the cave has broken his shackles and dares to look out at the outside world which has hitherto only been reflected on the wall by firelight , and seeing the horror turns and barks one of the most vital questions of the Twentieth Century : ' You suffer ... But Why ?'
Napalm Death 's ferocious new form of music developed within a fecund ecosystem of tape - trading and one - upmanship within the punk and metal scenes of the mid-to - late eighties .
Its DNA was threaded together by a small , close - knit community that crossed the Atlantic and had roots in Scandinavia .
Napalm 's debut album , Scum , captured a sound stretched in one direction by the velocity of punk and in another by the down - tuned heaviness of metal ; it was the culmination of an arms race in which speed was the most sought - after weapon .
But grindcore 's visceral intensity is also a product of its era : the years of Thatcherism which presented non-negotiable tenets of governance as opposed to a coherent ideology , pitting working men and women against each other in confrontations which scarred the country forever .
Napalm Death is the sound of political thought disengaging from itself , and dissolving into nihilism .
Mick ‘ human tornado ’
Harris played his first gig on drums for Napalm Death on 18th January 1986 , supporting anarchist ' crust punk ' stalwarts Amebix .
Joining vocalist and bassist Nik Bullen and guitarist Justin Broadrick , the floorboards of the Mermaid pub vibrated , bowing under the pressure of the blasts which were met with bemusement and derision .
The pub in Birmingham 's Stretford Road , in the poor Sparkhill area of the city , was the furnace of the hardcore punk scene in the Midlands .
Harris used to come and watch Napalm as part of hardcore all - dayers held from midday until late at weekends , convened by promoter Daz Russell .
First witnessing the band in the summer of 1985 he saw a group in thrall to the fast , politicized hardcore punk of Chaos UK , Disorder and Discharge ( harder , heavier and faster than the likes of the Sex Pistols , The Clash and The Buzzcocks ) but also heavily inspired by the desolate , melodic coldness of Joy Division .
That would change .
This little guy with the psychobilly haircut intrigued Bullen and Broadrick so much with his velocity that he replaced drummer and founder member Miles ' Rat ' Ratledge in November 1985 .
In his bedroom at his parents ' house Harris holed up with Broadrick , his Premier drum kit and a small amplifier , and began a process of pushing Napalm to its limits which lasted for the best part of five years .
Harris loved to play fast and craved more speed , more energy , needing to stress the tensile limits of musicality .
At the Mermaid he got locked into a week - by - week showdown with the drummer of Nottingham band ( and fellow Peel favourites )
Heresy : Steve Charlesworth similarly felt the need for speed , but who was soon outgunned by Harris .
Two bands could be heard looming large in Napalm 's new sound : Boston 's Siege , whose 6 song demo recording and 3 contributions to a classic 1985 hardcore compilation called Cleanse The Bacteria ( re- released together in 1994 under the title Drop Dead ) was thrashy and unwieldy hardcore , and the early crossover of Flint , Michigan 's raw - throated Repulsion , whose January 1986 demo The Stench Of Burning Death ( recorded as Genocide ) roared and grooved and blasted in tight arrangements rarely lasting longer than two minutes .
The demo set the tape - trading underground alight , and Napalm soon lifted the opening riff of the title track to play as an introduction to the live and session versions of Scum 's ' Deceiver ' .
In a one - bedroom flat further east in the midlands , in Nottingham , Digby Pearson had dropped out of studying medicine to focus on putting out bands that attacked and inflicted noise on the society around them .
He called his label Earache Records .
Slightly older than the teenage Napalm , in his early twenties , Pearson is a pivotal and controversial figure in the grindcore story .
He saw his role as friend first , facilitator second and then as obsessive evangelist for the nascent hardcore punk and extreme metal scenes , pushing tapes of anarcho - punk bands at metal gigs and vice - versa .
He also exploited Thatcher 's desire for a vibrant enterprise culture within a free market Britain .
He raised £ 1000 ( mainly selling off his own record collection ) so he could be entitled to take advantage of the Enterprise Allowance Scheme .
Unemployment had peaked at 3.2 million in 1985 ; once the government grew sick of counting the growing cost of benefits it made it less easy to qualify for unemployment benefit and then cooked the unemployment statistics , counting only those defined as ' unemployed and claiming benefit ' .
Unemployment promptly fell below 3 million in June 1987 , and the allowance of £ 40 a week that Pearson collected was another way for the government to claim that more people were in work and self - employed .
In fact Pearson did nothing with the money he was given and it was only the imminent end of the scheme after one year that galvanized him to start putting records out .
And Harris kept telling him to come and see Napalm play : " I 'll be even faster next time , Dig ... "
Napalm Death recorded the first twelve tracks of Scum in August 1986 , using Rich Bitch studios in Birmingham , whilst taking advantage of its 12 - 8 am ' evening rate ' of half price .
The recording cost a total of £ 120 .
The songs buzz with Broadrick 's razor - sharp guitar tone , overdriven with an MXR distortion pedal provided by local thrash band Sacrilege .
The opening of the album tingles and rings not unlike the opening of Robin Trower 's ' Bridge of Sighs ' before Bullen roars into the vortex : " Multinational corporations / Genocide of the starving nations . "
It 's at once mantra , decree , and condemnation .
He rails against the " Forms of escapism / And entertainment " that " disable thought " ( ‘ Caught . . . In A Dream ’ ) , fed through a television screen , the ' Siege Of Power ' within the land and its inhabitants ' minds , rendering them helpless ; the " fascist control " that has made its way into everyone ’s heads .
The sentiments are typical of the anarchist punk mindset : rebels in search of a cause , railing against the system to satisfy their need to lash out against something , anything even .
The songs shift gears from urgent mid-tempo , up to fast , and up again almost impossibly further , to very , very fast .
Harris unleashes hell during ' Polluted Minds ' ( which even crams in a rare , dive - bombing guitar solo ) and ' Sacrificed ' .
Somehow the songs become more agonized – ' Born On Your Knees ' , ' Human Garbage ' – before one of the shortest songs ever written , ' You Suffer ' , completes the set .
Increasingly from the start it feels like there is an overpowering force at work , a chaos which threatens to spill out and destroy the musical order .
But this first half of the album is still recognisably hardcore , albeit bolstered with moments of incandescent speed and fury .
The recording was given to Pearson but even at that early stage he knew he would n't be able to successfully put it out with twenty minutes of music alone .
But the emerging sound could n't tolerate any impediment to its progress .
It seemed to have taken on a life of its own : a wild animal straining at its leash and then dispatching any unwilling handlers .
Broadrick was tempted away from the Napalm guitar position to play drums with fast - rising and frequently touring group Head of David in October 1986 .
According to Harris , Bullen began to arrive to rehearsals extremely drunk , which for the largely sober drummer was simply not good enough .
It was a manifestation of a deepening lack of interest in what Bullen perceived as Napalm ’s use of speed for speed ’s sake .
He had been worn down and made way for new blood in March 1987 .
Harris ’s message to them both in the sleeve of the finished album is plain : ' Keep Your Heads Together ' .
What became side two of Scum was recorded in May 1987 , on a primitive 8 - track , all the instruments miked up live in the studio .
Under the aegis of Pearson , Harris had recruited Bill Steer on guitar .
Steer had just left school .
His main concern was the pioneering death metal band Carcass , formed with childhood friend and drummer Ken Owen and bassist / vocalist Jeff Walker .
Their early lyrics dealt entirely with the destruction of the human body , wryly subverting the cartoon - like blood & guts imagery of the genre by rendering it in medicalized minutiae , making it more real than reality .
They spawned their own subgenre : goregrind ( or even better , hardgore ) .
Steer always perceived his role in Napalm as a hired gun .
Harris speaks highly of him today as the " permanent stand - in " who was at the heart of the band .
Harris excitedly showed
Steer the new riffs he had been coming up with on the two string guitar he had tuned so he could play bar chords with one finger : condensed , simple , the bare components of music .
Steer was a flair player , a devotee of classic rock who adhered to groove , but in Napalm he played it straight and took instruction .
His dirty , muffled guitar churns up the bedrock of the second half of Scum , which begins with a song - as - question , ' Life ? ' , and blizzards throughout , restless and insatiable .
New lyricist and bassist Jim Whiteley bluntly interrogates everything around him : " Where is your success gained from ? / What of the lives you 've shat upon ? " ( ' Success ? ' ) , " When will you see ?
We 'll never be free " ( ' Parasites ' ) , " Not your problem / Why should you care ? " ( ' Stigmatized ' ) , " Is this the price we 're gonna pay ? " ( ' M.A.D. ' ) .
Rather than aim its sights at amorphous international corporations , it sarcastically baits those who would unquestioningly accept the status quo ( " Uniformity / Conformity / How long can you hide the truth ? " - ' Pseudo Youth ' ) in a world where the fate of humanity itself is sealed and atomic genocide is assured .
One question remains at the end of the record : will you " accept the end ? "
However , the lyrical content of Napalm Death is problematic , because language itself is destroyed in new vocalist Lee Dorrian 's delivery of the songs .
He was so fresh to the material he had one rehearsal the night before to learn it and went into the studio carrying sheets of newly scrawled lyrics he ’d worked on with Whiteley .
He even had to be cued in during the recording , which contributed to its abrupt , ragged , near inhuman vocal emissions .
If the symbolic order of the world is preserved by language , here it dissolves into incomprehensibility .
When he was nominated for the Turner Prize in 2006 artist Mark Titchner cited Napalm Death 's creation of " a language that ceases to function and ceases to be able to communicate in a normal way " .
For him the album passes from having meaning and a message in the first half to something deeper that functions on a primal level : an emotional engagement that obviates clamouring systems of belief and operates by a new , indefinable set of rules .
On the second half of Scum , the incomprehensible rushes in : a nuclear wind of the guttural and the unutterable .
Scum was released in July 1987 , a month after the Conservatives were re-elected with a majority of 102 .
The socialist and anarchist agenda of hardcore punk was wiped clean by Napalm Death 's grindcore .
In its sarcastic rebuttals to music and order itself ( the second Peel session of March 1988 starts with a version of ' Multinational Corporations ' so over - the - top it seems to mock the song ’s strident lyrical assurance ) it behaves similarly to that other wild animal : free market capitalism .
It held a mirror up to Thatcher 's stance against state interference in favour of individual freedom .
Napalm Death 's debut emerged after some of the most pivotal years in recent British political and social history .
The miner 's strike , and particularly the Battle at Orgreave coking plant near Rotherham on 18th June 1984 , had pitted two titans against one another .
On one side , the President of the National Union of Mineworkers , Arthur Scargill , a radical Marxist who believed that capitalism produced contradictions only resolvable by a change in society : " I hope that people do regard me as a dangerous man , in the respect of changing society .
I 'm certainly a danger and a threat to those who support the capitalist system .
And I 'm very proud to be a threat to the capitalist system and I hope - by being a threat - we 're able to bring about a fundamental change in society and create a new order . "
The Marxist view of Thatcherism was that it was an ideological campaign , tailored for and by the rich and powerful capitalists , to lord itself over the wretched and underprivileged working man .
On the other side was Thatcher , a Prime Minister who perceived the Marxists ’ belief in state ownership to be a form of enslavement : " the corrosive and corrupting effects of socialism " .
The victim of this clash of ideals was the working class , divided between the police and miners at flashpoints such as Orgreave – torn apart from within .
Napalm Death blazed through this harrying of the British social and political landscape .
Their sonic assault whipped up the ashes in its wake .

I wanted to write a blog about life changing things , like voluntary simplicity or changing the way we think about the big issues in life such as , but not only , famine , global warming , or the threat of terror .
But there are many blogs and web sites doing a better job than I could do , with more intelligent arguments .
So I decided to comment on what knowledge I have managed to pick up in my life .
BOURNE END screenwriter Simon Monjack said he is leaving Hollywood because it is “ too painful ” to live with the death of his actress wife Brittany Murphy .
The 40 - year - old spoke to The Bucks Free Press following Miss Murphy 's full autopsy report , which he said ' I wish I had n't read ' .
The former Royal Grammar School pupil said : “ The coroner warned me not to read the report and he was right – I could n't cope with it . ”
“ It described her organs and made it clear they had been removed from her body – it just brought home the fact my wife had died . ”
The report said severe anaemia left Miss Murphy weakened and vulnerable to pneumonia and the prescription medications she was using to treat it .
It found no evidence Miss Murphy had abused drugs and Mr Monjack hopes this will put an end to speculation over the Clueless and Sin City star 's sudden death .
A previous report had found ' multiple drug intoxication ' was a secondary factor for her death .
Mr Monjack , whose mother Linda still lives in Bourne End ( see link below ) , went to the Oscars on Sunday , when his wife featured in the " in memoriam " segment of the ceremony .
He is struggling to come to terms with his wife 's death and said things are “ only getting harder ” .
He is planning to move to New York and added : “ It 's too painful to live in this town - I see my wife on every corner . ”
Miss Murphy collapsed in the bathroom of the couple 's Beverley Hills home on December 20 .
Mr Monjack said : “ The first I knew was that my mother - in - law was screaming from the bathroom .
I ran in and Brittany had collapsed but she was still vaguely conscious .
“ I put her under the cold shower and did CPR on her while my mother - in - law called the ambulance - I never saw Brittany again after that .
“ I remember being quite calm , but I did n't think she was dying .
She had been ill but I had no idea she had pneumonia . ”
Though he has been as a screenwriter and producer for films such as Factory Girl and Two Days , Nine Lives , Mr Monjack said he would now go back to working as a fashion photographer .
The nation 's battle over immigration reform this week landed squarely on Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer 's office steps .
And with four days left to decide what she 'll do about one of the state 's most divisive issues in the midst of an election year , the pressure is mounting .
The Arizona Senate on Monday approved Senate Bill 1070 , a wide - ranging illegal - immigration measure that , among other things , makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally and requires local law enforcement to determine an individual 's legal status if there is reasonable suspicion that he or she is in the U.S. illegally .
Brewer has until the end of the day Saturday to sign it , veto it or do nothing and allow it to become law .
While everyone awaits her decision , the stakes continue to rise .
On Tuesday , police arrested nine college students after they chained themselves to the old Capitol - building doors in protest .
More than 100 bill opponents spent the day praying and rallying .
Some plan to stay round - the - clock until Brewer makes a decision .
Hundreds of phone calls and e-mails are pouring in from both sides .
Brewer 's Republican gubernatorial opponents are pushing for support of the bill , while some city leaders are trying to find ways around it .
Brewer 's plans
The governor has been mum on whether she will sign the measure .
Her advisers say she worries about the impact of this action , and she generally seeks counsel from her close circle of friends and advisers when faced with significant decisions .
At day 's end , they say , she 's not afraid to make an unpopular choice in an important matter .
" She agonizes over these things , " said Doug Cole , Brewer 's campaign spokesman .
Brewer spokesman Paul Senseman said she would consider legalities , residents ' sentiment and the impacts on the state , law enforcement and businesses , among other things , in making her decision .
As of Monday , the Governor 's Office had received 1,356 calls , e-mails and faxes in favor of SB 1070 and 11,931 against the bill .
In remarks made to Tucson television station KVOA on Tuesday , Brewer acknowledged the intense interest in the bill and said she will weigh her decision carefully .
" Everyone has an opinion on it , and everybody wants to make sure we have the very best laws in the state of Arizona , " she said .
Brewer 's staff says she is well - equipped to deal with the intense pressure and national attention , given that she already has made a multitude of unpopular decisions , including approving billions of dollars in cuts to service programs to balance the state 's budget and supporting a temporary 1 - cent - per - dollar sales - tax increase that goes to voters in May .
The bill 's sponsor , Sen. Russell Pearce , R - Mesa , said he has no more insight than anyone else as to when Brewer will decide .
" I wish I knew , " he said .
Pearce said he has had several meetings with Governor 's Office staff over the past weeks to go over the bill line by line and is " confident she is comfortable with the bill . "
He said he also believes Arizona residents are comfortable with it , saying he has received hundreds of e-mails in support of the bill and a few against it .
Political pull
Somos Republicans , a grass - roots group working to register more Latino Republicans , sent an e-mail to Brewer on Monday , telling her that if she supports the bill , they will request that she " leave the Republican Party . "
Her would - be gubernatorial challengers have become increasingly vocal about the bill .
Presumptive Democratic nominee Terry Goddard says he is against it , while GOP gubernatorial hopefuls Owen " Buz " Mills , state Treasurer Dean Martin and former Board of Regents President John Munger said they favor it .
When Brewer spoke Saturday night at the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce 's Black and White ball , chamber President Armando Contreras asked her to veto SB 1070 " in the name of fairness , humanitarianism , and for the sake of our state 's future economic prosperity and its diverse and growing community . "
The governor told the audience of about 1,100 people that she would do what is right for the state .
Official responses
Levi Bolton , legislative lobbyist for the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association , which represents more than 2,500 Phoenix police officers , said his group hand - delivered a letter encouraging Brewer to sign the bill .
Phoenix Vice Mayor Michael Nowakowski sent a letter to City Manager David Cavazos , suggesting that if the bill becomes law , police should request citizenship proof from everyone they stop in order to avoid charges of racial profiling .
The bill states that an Arizona driver 's license is sufficient to prove citizenship .
Nowakowski argued that licenses from other states , however , may not be sufficient because some states do not require proof of citizenship to get a license , as Arizona does .
" That means that anyone who drives in the city of Phoenix and gets pulled over better have a passport or a visa , " he said .
Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox spoke in front of the Capitol on Tuesday .
She said the bill " is literally designed to terrorize undocumented immigrants . "
" It will be proved unconstitutional , " Wilcox said .
" Why have Arizona pay the cost of having to go through the courts ? "
Pearce said he would n't be surprised if local politicians and police chiefs try to avoid enforcing the measure when it becomes law .
That 's why it includes the clause that allows any Arizonan to file a lawsuit if they do n't believe the law is being followed , he said .
Rallies of protest
The nine students arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct Tuesday were part of a small group of about a dozen mostly college - age protesters holding signs , chanting loudly and banging drums in front of the Capitol while police watched .
" It was a symbolic gesture to block out the hatred and bigotry that has emanated from the passage of this bill to keep it from entering the executive branch , " said attorney Antonio Bustamente , who represented one of the students .
A few yards away , a much larger group had gathered .
They took boxes containing 83,000 signatures to the Governor 's Office .
The documents asked Brewer to veto the bill .
Pastor Warren Stewart of the First Institutional Baptist Church called upon the group to pray that God " will perform a miracle " and move Brewer to veto the bill .
Jim Wallis , CEO of the Washington - based Christian social - justice group Sojourners , said this immigration fight is not just about Arizona .
" This is about the entire country , " he said .
" We want to be a nation of laws , but enforcement without reform is cruel .
We will not comply . "
Norma Price , 68 , of Tucson , said growing up in Mississippi she was ashamed of how minorities were treated .
Now , she 's ashamed of her new home state .
She joined Tuesday 's protest .
" When I moved here 12 years ago , I was so pleased to see the diversity , " she said .
" Now , we 're becoming more divided . "
There were no visible groups supporting the bill at the Capitol on Tuesday .
Pearce called Tuesday 's protesters " anarchists . "
He said he has not heard of any planned rallies in favor of the bill but said that is because supporters trust their state leaders .
" They are working jobs and raising families and expect us to do the right thing , " he said .
More opposition rallies are planned .
For electronics engineers who want to make faster chips , heat is a big hurdle .
More calculations mean more electrons moving through semiconductor material , which generates more heat .
Too much heat makes a chip unstable .
So manufacturers use heat sinks or coolers and fans to keep chips at safe operating temperatures .
But what if water or other liquid could be circulated on the silicon itself ?
That might make for better cooling , and faster chips .
That ’s an eventual goal of research by Chunlei Guo and Anatoliy Vorobyev at the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester .
Using a short - pulse , high - intensity laser , they have created tiny grooves in silicon that exhibit strong capillary action — they quickly wick water along , even against gravity .
Image Researchers at the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester have tested a strategy for moving water and coolants on silicon chips .

The laser technique , described in the journal Optics Express , was originally used on metals , Dr. Guo said .
“ We realized what we did was dramatically changing the surface properties , ” he said .
“ The metal became very hydrophilic . ”
They reasoned that they might be able to do the same with silicon , which is normally hydrophobic — water beads up on it .
Yup .
Twenty demands by Republicans at yesterday ’s bipartisan Health Care Summit to scrap all existing legislative efforts and start anew .
And there were only ten of them there .
Sheesh .
Pat Oliphant nailed it :
My name is Eclectablog and I am a politaholic .
I actually took a vacation day yesterday to watch all seven hours of President Obama ’s bipartisan Health Care Summit so that I could live - blog it .
In the course of the day , I made a drinking game out of it where everytime a GOPosaur demanded , in one fashion or another , that the President and Democrats start over and scrap all of the work that has been done in the past year to assemble a health insurance reform package to pass out of Congress for the president ’s signature .
Sometimes it was an overt request to “ scrap the bill ” .
Other times they used code words like “ go step - by - step ” or handle it “ a piece at a time ” .
But , no matter how they phrased it , the aim was clear .
Obstruct and delay but starting the entire icky process all over again .
They are shameless .
One other fun thing to watch was their absolute terror at the prospect of the Democrats using reconciliation ( SCARY ! )
The are so afraid of this that they have taken to refering to it as “ the nuclear option ” , a phrase once reserved for eliminating the filibuster ( sorry , Rachel , “ The Tarantino ” is n’t working for me . )
The fact that Lamar Alexander hit it hard in his opening statement , that Mitch McConnell brought it up again in his opening remarks and that John Boehner finished the day talking about it in his closing remarks should tell Democrats all they need to know : move forward on reconciliation .
The GOPosaurs know there ’s not a damn thing they can do to stop you if you do .
I ’m pretty sure they collectively crapped their drawers when , in his closing remarks , President Obama basically told them that if they could n’t manage to come to the table with any good ideas for improving the current bills so that they could find in themselves to vote for it , reconciliation would be their only recourse .
Somehow , I find the thought of John Boehner ( R - Tanfast ) and Mitch McConnell sitting in their chairs in Blair House with their BVDs full oddly comforting .
Twenty times .
What a bunch of morans .
I ’m just sayin ’ …

Digg it , man !
We 've definitely entered an era of experiment when it comes to online content , as a number of publications with a tradition in the print world are testing out approaches like building paywalls , mixing free and paid content , and limiting the amount of content that 's indexed by search engines .
But Japan 's Nikkei newspaper has taken its attempts to control access to an entirely different level : it now requires a formal request for any inbound links to its site .
The New York Times , which reported on the new policy on Thursday , notes that the newspaper market in Japan is radically different from that in the US .
Although some smaller outlets are experimenting with new ways of reaching readers , most papers require subscriptions to access online content , and the barriers have kept circulation of print editions quite high compared to the US .
Nikkei management appears worried that links could provide secret passages to content that should be safely behind the paywall , and this fear has led to the new approval policy .
So far , the rules have n't made it to the default site that 's accessible from the US , but they do appear to have made it to the European version .
Given the newsworthiness of the policy , it seems safe to risk the Nikkei 's aggressive copyright stance by quoting them in full :
Please send an e-mail to e-media@eur.nikkei.com with information about your web site , web site address , aims of the link , your name and contact details etc prior to adding a link taken from our website .
Generally , links from one 's own website to the front page of our website are acceptable , though we retain the right to reject links to websites and links themselves of which we do not approve .
That text comes from this page .
Obviously , we can't guarantee that the link will actually work , since it would be easy for Nikkei to determine that Ars Technica is referring readers to the page , compare our URL to the list of approved linkers , and block access to the content accordingly .
Also , for added irritation , Nikkei has disabled the right - click context menu so that copying links is more difficult .
The context blocking takes place , at the moment , only on the Japanese language site ; the English site appears unaffected .
Here are a couple of unrelated stories , one on Harry Markopolos , the man who on 4 occasions tried to convince the SEC of Bernie Madoff 's Ponzi scheme , the second on how Geithner used a fictitious " Trust " to accomplish an illegal takeover of AIG .
Inuring minds are reading a post on the Sense on ¢ents blog by Larry Doyle called Harry Markopolos : “ Do n’t Trust Your Government ”
In an interview on the Today show this morning ( video clip after the fold ) , Harry Markopolos dropped a few bombshells .
Harry ’s statement that he had purchased a gun and mentally prepared himself to kill Bernie Madoff in self - defense if need be will likely grab the most attention .
It should n’t .
Markopolos ’ biggest bombshell this morning is his warning to America , “ do n’t trust your government . ”
No surprise that Today host Matt Lauer did not probe deeper .
I am not confident that other outlets will delve deeper into Harry ’s statement , either .
I wonder why Harry himself is reticent to specifically point out the individuals and the instances which lead him to make that statement .
Recall that a year ago Harry defined the SEC as merely incompetent while simultaneously defining FINRA ( Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ) as ‘ in bed with the industry ’ that is Wall Street .
Well , it does not take an advanced degree to connect Harry ’s grenade toss into FINRA ’s backyard a year ago with his volley this morning .

Secretary Geithner 's Got Some Explaining to Do
While everyone , including Congress , the media , and the public , have focused on AIG's $ 100 - million bonus payments to key employees , and most recently on AIG 's stealth payments to counterparties like Chase and the French giant Société Générale -- the latter made worse by the fact that it was the Federal Reserve ( FED ) that wanted to keep these payments hidden from public view -- the problem with the AIG bailout is much deeper and more fundamental .
Just about everyone has had something to say about this bailout -- mostly that it was an ugly but necessary step to stave off a domino effect that would have brought the world 's financial system to its knees .
But what we have not yet heard is just how Treasury Secretary Geithner , as then - head of the NY FED , got away with taking ownership of 77.9 % of AIG 's equity and voting rights in clear violation of the law .
The question we are left with is : Why ?
What motivated this illegal grab of AIG 's equity and voting rights ?
Was it desperation in the face of the largest potential collapse in the history of modern finance ?
Was it unbridled power combined with supreme hubris ?
Or was it just criminal ?
The answer to this query resides in the as - yet - hidden files of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , now subject to a subpoena issued by my office in the federal lawsuit Murray v. Geithner , pending in the Eastern District of Michigan .
In the course of discovery , resisted by the government at every turn , we have learned that the deal Geithner put together as the NY Fed 's president was illegal on its face .
The Deal
Specifically , the deal Geithner put together in September 2008 was for the NY FED to pour up to $ 85 billion of debt funding into AIG to solve its liquidity crisis as the Credit Default Swap counterparties , the banks which had insured themselves against the sub - prime mortgage meltdown , demanded payments under their AIG insurance policies .
AIG ended up drawing down $ 60 billion almost overnight .
But Geithner was not content with a straight debt deal where AIG promised to pay back principal and interest and handed over almost all of its assets as collateral .
Geithner wanted real ownership and control ( 77.9 % , to be exact ) of AIG 's equity and the voting rights to go along with that .
The problem Geithner knew he had to confront , however , was that the FED was not authorized to take ownership in AIG or any other financial institution .
The law authorized the FED only to loan money and take collateral .
While the FED might end up with ownership after a default and foreclosure on the collateral , the Federal Reserve Act does not authorize the NY Fed to structure the debt deal with an equity piece .
The Criminal Artifice
So what did Geithner do ?
He took equity , but he used a fictitious " Trust " to accomplish that which he could not do legally .
The AIG Credit Facility Trust has three so - called independent , non-governmental trustees owning the 77.9 % of the legal interests of AIG , and the Trust agreement assigns the U.S. Treasury the beneficial interests in the 77.9 % .
The highly - touted " independence " of the trustees is quite obviously critical to save the Trust from the claim that it is merely a ruse for FED ownership and control .
But there is only one problem with this Trust structure :
It is invalid and illegal for two important reasons , not the least of which is that its independence is nonexistent .
Geithner 's deal was all about acquiring not just voting rights , but super - majority control .
Unfortunately , there was no legal authority at the time to do so .
The brute fact that now standing exposed before us is the use of an invalid Trust structure to conceal the unlawful ownership and control over 77.9 % of AIG 's equity and voting rights by the FED .
If Geithner knew he was breaking the law , then this just happens to be the definition of criminal money - laundering under Title 18 , Section 1956 .
Secretary Geithner has some explaining to do to AIG 's public shareholders .
We suggest that he seek legal advice first -- but this time , from lawyers who actually know what they are doing .

The period since the end of the last ice age provided the large - scale stability in which human civilisation emerged .
Climatic stability provided the opportunity for diverse human settlements to ' bed ' down over generations .
This formed the basis upon which knowledge , cultures , institutions , and infrastructures could build complexity and capability over generations without , by and large , having it shattered by extreme drought or flooding outside their capacity to adapt .
Recently , a 55 page paper called Tipping Point : Near - Term Implications of a Peak in Global Oil Production ( PDF warning ) was published as the joint effort of two organizations : Feasta and The Risk / Resilience Network , with lead author David Korowicz .
We have recently published two excerpts from that paper , which can be found at this link .
This is a third excerpt .
Within this macro-climatic stability , is the medium - term stability that we referred to above , the period of globalising economic growth over the last century and a half .
We tend to see the growth of this economy in terms of change .
We can observe it through increasing energy and resource flows , population , material wealth , and as a general proxy , GWP [ Gross World Product ] .
We could view this from another angle .
We could say that the globalizing growth economy for the last one hundred and fifty years has been remarkably stable .
It could have grown linearly by any percentage rate , declined exponentially , oscillated periodically , or swung chaotically , for example .
What we see is a tendency to compound growth of a few percent per annum .
And at this growth rate the system could evolve , unsurprisingly , at a rate we could adapt to .
This does not mean that there is not unpredictable fluctuations in the economy .
However , the fluctuations are around a small additional percentage on the previous year 's gross output .
By magnitude we are roughly referring to |∆GWP / GWP |. Angus Maddison has estimated that GWP grew 0.32 % per annum between 1500 and 1820 ; 0.94 % ( 1820 - 1870 ) ; 2.12 % ( 1870 - 1913 ) ; 1.82 % ( 1913-1950 ) ; 4.9 % ( 1950 - 1973 ) ; 3.17 % ( 1973-2003 ) , and 2.25 % ( 1820-2003 ) [ i ] .
Even through two world wars and the Great Depression in the most economically developed countries ( 1913 - 1950 ) growth remained positive and in a relatively narrow band .
Figure 4 shows growth rates of the global economy in frequency bands over the last four decades , again the narrow band indicates system stability .
Of course small differences in aggregate exponential growth can have major effects over time , but here we are concentrating upon the stability issue only .
Figure 4 : Real GWP percentage change year on year 1961 - 2008 .
Source : Based upon World Bank data .
Governments and populations are highly sensitive to even minor negative changes in growth .
The constraints felt by governments and society in general arising from only a very small change in GDP growth should emphasize to us that our systems have adapted to this narrow range of stability , and the impact of moving outside it can provoke major stresses .
4.2 Tipping Points in Complex Systems
Despite the diversity of complex systems , from markets to ecosystems to crowd behavior - there are remarkable similarities .
For most of the time such systems are stable .
However , many complex systems have critical thresholds , called tipping points , when the system shifts abruptly from one state to another .
This has been studied in many systems including market crashes , abrupt climate change , fisheries collapse , and asthma attacks .
Despite the complexity and number of parameters within such systems , the meta - state of the system may often be dependent on just one or two key state variables [ ii ] .
Recent research has indicated that as systems approach a tipping point they begin to share common behavioral features , irrespective of the particular type of system [ iii ] .
This unity between the dynamics of disparate systems gives us a formalism through which to describe the dynamical state of globalised civilisation , via its proxy measure of GWP , and its major state variable , energy flow .
We are particularly interested in the class of transitions called catastrophic bifurcations where once the tipping point has been passed , a series of positive feedbacks drive the system to a contrasting state .
Such ideas have become popularised in discussions of climate change .
For example , as the climate warms it drives up emissions of methane from the arctic tundra , which drives further climate change , which leads to further exponential growth in emissions .
This could trigger other tipping points such as a die - off in the Amazon , itself driving further emissions .
Such positive feedbacks could mean that whatever humanity does would no longer matter as its impact would be swamped by the acceleration of much larger scale processes .
Figure 5 shows how the system state responds to a change in conditions .
The state of a system could represent the size of a fish population , or the level of biodiversity in a forest , while the conditions could represent nutrient loading or temperature ( both effectively energy vectors ) .
The continuous line represents a stable equilibrium , the dotted one an unstable one .
In a stable equilibrium , the state of the system can be maintained once the condition is maintained .
In Figures a ) and b ) we see two different responses of a stable system under changing conditions .
In the first , a given change in conditions has a proportional effect on the system state ; in the latter , the state is highly sensitive to a change in conditions .
In c ) and d ) the system is said to be close to a catastrophic bifurcation .
In both of these cases there is an unstable region , where there is a range of system states that can not be maintained .
If a system state is in an unstable regime , it is dynamically driven to another available stable state .
If one is close to a tipping point at a catastrophic bifurcation , the slightest change in the condition can cause a collapse to a new state as in c ) , or a small perturbation can drive the system over the boundary as in d ) .
Figure 5 : The state of a system responds to a change in conditions .
The continuous line represents a stable equilibria .
In a ) a change in conditions drives an approximately linear response in the systems state , unlike b ) where a threshold is crossed and the relationship becomes very sensitive .
The fold bifurcation ( c , d ) has three equliibra for the same condition , but one represented by the dotted line is unstable .
That means that there is a range of system states which are dynamically unstable to any condition [ iv ]
5. Three Peak Energy - Economy Models
5.1 Introduction
While discussions of peak oil have begun to enter the policy arena , and while it is generally acknowledged that it would have a major impact upon the economy , the discussion is often fragmented and lacking in a broad system synthesis .
In general , discussion tends to focus on the direct uses of oil , and sometimes its effect on a country 's balance of payments .
Where economic impact studies of peak oil have been done , they are based upon the direct decline curve assumption such as the 4see model by Arup for the UK Peak Oil Task Force Report[v ] .
Nel and Cooper have used the decline curve assumption and accounted for EROI and peak coal and gas to look at the economic implications [ vi ] .
The latter authors show a smooth decline in GDP but acknowledge that their modelling assumptions include that the financial markets must remain functional , state legitimacy remains intact , and international law prevails .
In most cases there is an intuitive assumption or mental model of what the effects of peaking oil production will mean economically and socially .
In order to clarify our discussion , and introduce some working concepts , we will look at three models .
These should not be considered in isolation .
In a very broad and general fashion we might consider that the linear decline model is valid for small energy constraints that have a very small effect on the overall magnitude of real GWP and level of complexity .
This merges into a oscillating decline phase which cause larger perturbations in GWP / Complexity level .
Finally , tipping points are crossed that rapidly cause a severe collapse in GWP / Complexity .
Finally , we note that what we are trying to do is clarify peak energy - civilisation dynamics and identify the major structural drivers in the process .
The real world is more unknowable than can ever be engaged with here .
5.2 Linear Decline
Intuitively we tend to assume that most phenomena respond proportionately to some causation .
This is mostly true .
A change in price proportionately changes demand ; an increase in population proportionately increases food demand ; and increase in cars leads to a proportional increase in emissions .
Most commonly , there are two associated assumptions relating to the energy - economy relationship post - peak .
The first is the Decline Curve Assumption .
Thus oil production is withdrawn from the economy at between 2 and 3 % p.a .
The second element is that there is an approximately linear relationship between the oil production decline and economic decline .
The combination of these assumptions is that the global economy declines in the form of the slope of the downward projection curve .
Thus we see the price of oil rise as oil becomes scarcer .
Having less energy constrains economic activity .
Bit by bit we become poorer ; there is less and less discretionary consumption .
The rising prices force more localized production and consumption , and there is growing de-globalisation .
Jobs lost in the areas serving today 's discretionary needs are over time deployed in food and agriculture , producing with more direct human effort and skill many of the essentials of life .
In such a case a longish period of adaptation is assumed in which gradually declining oil production and resulting oil price increases cause recession , hardship and cause some shocks , but also initiate a major move into renewable energy , efficiency investments , and societal adaptation .
New energy production that was once too expensive becomes viable .
The general operability of familiar systems and institutions is assumed , or they change slowly .
Even where the linear decline model is valid , it would be difficult to adapt .
Consider a country 's budget in energy terms , with some amount for health , business operations , agriculture , operations , education , and investment .
As total energy available declined , less and less energy would be available in each sector .
Because we discount the future ( we favour short - term benefits ) , and the discount rate rises in economic stress , the ability to maintain investment in renewable energy would become increasingly difficult .
In essence , there would be a choice between keeping some functionality in a crumbling health service , and stalling rising employment a little ; or accepting job losses and a health crisis in return for a small energy return per annum in the future .
5.3 Oscillating Decline
In this model , constrained or declining oil production leads to an escalation in oil ( plus other energy and food ) prices .
But economies cannot pay this price for a number of reasons .
Firstly , it adds to energy and food price inflation , which are the most non-discretionary purchases .
This means discretionary spending declines , from which follows job losses , business closures , and reduced purchasing power .
The decline in economic activity leads to a fall in energy demand and a fall in its price .
Secondly , for a country that is a net importer of energy , the money sent abroad to pay for energy is lost to the economy , unless that country exports goods of equivalent value .
This will drive deflation , cut production , and reduce energy demand and prices .
Thirdly , it would increase the trade deficits of a country already struggling with growing indebtedness , and add to the cost of new debt and debt servicing .
Falling and volatile energy prices mean new production is harder to bring on stream , while the marginal cost of new energy rises and credit financing becomes more difficult .
It would also mean that the cost of maintaining existing energy infrastructure ( gas pipelines , refineries etc ) would be higher , thus laying the foundations for further reductions in production capability .
In such an energy constrained environment , one would also expect a rise in geo-political risks to supply .
This could be bi-lateral arrangements between countries to secure oil ( or food ) .
Such agreements would tend to reduce the amount of oil available on the open market .
Energy constraints would also increase the inherent vulnerability to highly asymmetric price / supply shocks from state / non - state military action , extreme weather events , or other so - called black swan events .
When oil prices fall below what can be supplied above the marginal cost of production and delivery , and oil price is what can be afforded in the context of decreased purchasing power , then energy for growth is again available .
Of course local and national differences ( for example energy import dependence , export of key production such as food ) can be expected to shift how regions fare in the recession and in their general ability to pick up again .
Growth then might be assumed to kick off again , focusing maybe on more ‘ sustainable ’ production and consumption .
However , as growth returns , the purchasing power of the economy will not be able to return to where it was before .
Oil production will be limited by natural decline and lack of investment , and entropic decay of infrastructure will reduce the supply - demand price point further .
Again higher oil , food and energy prices would then drive another recession .
In the oscillating decline model : economic activity increases→energy prices rise →a recession occurs→energy prices fall →economic activity picks up again but to a lower bound set by declining oil production .
In this model the economy oscillates to a lower and lower level of activity .
From our discussion about the origins of the current recession , we see this process has already begun .
5.4 Systemic Collapse
This model draws on ideas from the general dynamics of complex systems and networks , and tends to see our civilisation as a single complex adaptive system by virtue of its connectedness and integration .
Indeed the concept of globalization is about integration with a common singular network .
We associate systemic collapse of civilisation with a catastrophic bifurcation .
The state of civilisation at a time is by necessity dependent upon the state of the globalised economy .
The state of the global economy is dependent on the infrastructure that integrates the operational fabric .
The state of the globalised economy may be parameterized by GWP , which implies a level of complexity .
And GWP ( and complexity ) is absolutely dependent upon energy flows .
To argue that civilisation is on the cusp of a collapse , we need to be able to show that there are tipping points that , once passed , drive the system rapidly towards another contrasting state through a process of positive feedback that may in turn drive other feedback processes .
We need to also demonstrate that it is a catastrophic bifurcation in which the state of the globalised economy is driven through an unstable regime where the strength of the feedback processes is greater than any stabilizing process .
It acknowledges that there may be an early period of oscillating decline , but that once major structural components ( international finance , techno - sphere ) drop or ‘ freeze ’ out , irreversible collapse must occur .
In the new post - collapse equilibrium state we would expect a collapse in material wealth and productivity , enforced localization / de-globalisation , and collapse in the complexity as compared with before , as an expression of the reduced energy flows .
The collapses in the Roman Empire occurred over centuries ; collapse of the Greenland Viking settlements in decades .
We suggest a hypothesis here that the speed of collapse is a function of the level of integration , coupling , and the key operational speeds of the systems that support the stability of the pre-collapse state .
For us , that includes the behavioral change in financial markets , food flow rates , and replacement lifetime of key components in infrastructure .
In discussing the feedback processes in the next chapter we will see processes are indeed fast .

Sarah Palin has long sold herself as a fiscal conservative , arguing against the Democrats ’ health overhaul on the grounds that the nation simply can’t afford it .
But when the former vice presidential candidate resigned as governor of Alaska in the summer of 2009 , she left the state with a 70 percent debt - to - GDP ratio — the highest state debt burden in the United States .
ADVERTISEMENT
That ’s according to data compiled by the Washington Independent ’s Megan Carpentier , who notes that Alaska has a debt burden similar to “ that of Jordan and PalinÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s favorite health care resource , Canada , and a higher ratio than Ghana , Cote dÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢Ivoire , India , the Philippines or Uruguay . ”
By comparison , crisis - stricken California has a debt ratio of less than 40 percent .
All the more confounding about Alaska ’s debt is the fact that it is an oil - producing region with a small population to share in that wealth .
Oil -rich Alberta , Canada , for example , collects no sales tax and still managed to retire its debt entirely in 2004 .
While Alaska ’s massive debt burden ca n’t be blamed entirely on Palin ’s two - and - a - half - year stint as governor , she did face similar debt problems while mayor of Wasilla , and those appear to be of her own making .
Wasilla ’s municipal debt went from around $ 1 million when she came in to office , to around $ 22 million when she left , mostly as a result of the construction of a sports arena and public works projects championed by Palin .
While Alaska ’s debt load is high by the standards of US states , it ’s worth noting some nations have considerably higher debt loads .
Japan , for example , is carrying a debt load of more than 190 percent of GDP ; Greece , recently hit by a debt crisis , has a 108 percent debt - to - GDP ratio .
ADVERTISEMENT
The debt load for the US federal government clocked in at around 53 percent in 2009 ; the debt is expected to increase to 68.5 percent by 2014 .

Just before dawn on Thursday morning , Richard Code disappeared into the darkness and lit out for the Ontario wilderness , bringing little more than a few supplies and the skills he had learned from watching Survivorman , a reality show about subsisting in the bush .
The 41 - year - old left behind a note , asking his landlady to call police if he failed to return by Sunday night .
On Monday , she reported him missing and on Wednesday afternoon , Code ’s body was found in a marshy , snowed - in area just north of Huntsville .
Police say Code ’s death is not considered suspicious at this time and his brother Stephen Code said OPP have informed him that the cause of death was hypothermia .
It remains unclear if Code has ever received formal wilderness training but relatives say much of his knowledge came from watching Survivorman .
The Discovery Channel program featured survival expert Les Stroud living in the wilderness without food , shelter or equipment and Code would often attempt similar trips , venturing into the Muskoka backwoods without food or tents .
For some outdoor education experts , “ survivalist ” reality shows have skewed the public ’s perception of how dangerous it really is to live off the land , prompting inexperienced campers to venture into the woods with a bolstered sense of confidence .
For survival instructor Gino Ferri , shows like Survivorman make for excellent entertainment but should never substitute real - world training .
“ TV abstracts the real ugliness of survival , ” said Ferri , who runs a school called Survival in the Bush and trained Stroud back in the day .
“ They make the wilderness look like it ’s a romantic place .
Well , it ’s romantic , as long as you have all your gear and you ’re camping and enjoying it .
In a survival situation , it ’s a nightmare . ”
Stephen Code , who lives in Kitchener , said his brother was passionate about survival trips but as far as he knew , he also lacked any formal training .
“ I understand that Richard has done some self - teaching , training , through the video work this gentleman ’s ( Stroud ) done , ” Code said .
He said he and his father would worry about Richard ’s trips and often warned him of the risks .
“ My father had conversations with him in the past about the dangers of camping with little gear , ” he said .
Code ’s landlady Barbara Ellis said her tenant frequently read books about wilderness survival and would regale her with tales of his adventures .
She said Code could “ whittle ” and rip bark from trees , twisting the pieces into makeshift ropes .
“ He would tell me how he would cut down boughs to make a shelter , ” she recalled .
“ He would fish for food and he said there were certain trees that he could eat the bark . ”
Ellis said she met her tenant through church and Code moved into her Scarborough home about two years ago .
The 86 - year - old described Code as pleasant and mild - mannered , who made a living by helping her do errands around the house .
She said Code did three survivor trips last year but most were during the summer months .
He only attempted one wintertime trip last November but fell sick and lasted just one day , she added .
Ellis said she had a bad feeling last week as Code prepared for this latest trip .
“ I just said , ‘ I do n’t like this one , ’ ” she said .
“ He just laughed a little bit … I sort of dread these trips but I know they ’re so very important to him . ”
Code left home at around 4 a.m. and , as he often does , left a note with Ellis telling her when he would be back .
He included a map with his GPS coordinates as well as a checklist of what materials he brought , which included a multi-tool , an axe , matches , a lighter , an emergency blanket , fishing tools , a compass , a survival book , maps and some cash .
He did not use a cellphone .
Ellis called police when Code failed to return by Monday morning and police began conducting aerial searches of the area where Code indicated he was going , near Burks Falls .
Code was known to hitchhike to his camping destinations and according to his brother , police received a tip early Wednesday indicating that Richard had been picked up in Aurora and dropped off at a truck stop near Bradford .
Early Wednesday afternoon , Code was still hopeful his brother might turn up safe , but a few hours later provincial police announced they had found his brother ’s body , just between Horn and Bear Lakes .

Toronto police say a post - mortem will take place , likely Friday .
OPP said Code was found by helicopter in an area that was no longer accessible by foot , thanks to heavy snowfalls in the area and surrounding marshes .
Police were tight - lipped about further details including what he was wearing , but Code was last seen wearing beige cargo pants , a dark jacket , hiking boots and a black “ Yukon ” - style hat .
Det. Const . Jeff Emms said Code was no “ rookie ” when it came to outdoor adventuring and clearly prepared for his trip .
But at the same time , such survivor excursions have officers like him “ scratching our heads . ”
“ I would never do it , ” he said .
“ These TV shows that are on , right , Survivorman and all these kinds of shows , would put these kinds of thoughts in someone ’s head to do it . ”
When reached in Madagascar where he is filming a new television series , Stroud said he always stressed proper training on his show , as well as in his book .
“ You need that time in the bush and there is no replacement , ” Stroud said , speaking to the Star before Code ’s body was located .
“ I would n’t attempt to solo until I ’d done at least half a dozen or 10 courses . . . in the bush with people that knew what they were doing . ”
For Stroud , his show is a “ documentary ” program and not a “ reality - based ” show , which he says portray wilderness survival in a flashy manner that gets people “ all riled up . ”
He defended Survivorman as being an educational show that conveyed just how miserable it truly is to subsist in the wilderness .
He noted that he ca n’t control how viewers interpret his show , adding that people have credited his teachings in the past for saving their lives in survival situations .
But for Ferri , he worries about the effects of such survival reality shows and has noticed a spike in interest towards wilderness survival .
Students tend to also bring an inflated sense of confidence into his classrooms now , he said .
“ Do n’t think that you can learn things like survival by simply watching a show , ” he said .
“ I mean , how often have we said that ? ”
For Stephen Code , he has never watched Survivorman but said he does n’t oppose such reality programming , as long as the shows couch their entertainment value in safety information .
But for Code , he also recognizes the potential dangers of such shows , perhaps now better than anyone .
“ I think as laypeople , we ’re always concerned about risky endeavours getting publicized on TV sets and society picking up these things and trying to execute them in the real world , ” he said .
“ It ’s disconcerting . ”
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Widely used anticonvulsant drugs , including Pfizer ’s Neurontin and Novartis ’ Trileptal , may increase the risk of suicide , attempted suicide and violent death in patients taking them for the first time , U.S. researchers said on Tuesday .
Compared with Johnson & Johnson ’s generic epilepsy drug topiramate or Topamax , the team found an increased risk for suicide in new users of Neurontin , sold generically as gabapentin , GlaxoSmithKline ’s Lamictal or lamotrigine , Novartis ’ Trileptal or oxcarbazepine and Cephalon ’s Gabitril or tiagabine .
In one analysis , the team also found an increased risk of suicide with the drug valproate sold by Sanofi - Aventis as Epilim and as Depakine in the United States by Abbott Laboratories Inc .
In 2008 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required that all drugs in the anticonvulsant class carry a warning that they double the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors , based on a so - called meta- analysis of nearly 200 clinical trials .
But the analysis was not large enough to show which drugs in the class were risky .
And they are prescribed for a range of conditions .
“ We all know the range of uses of these medications is very , very wide , ” said Dr. Elisabetta Patorno of Brigham and Women ’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston , whose study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
Anticonvulsant drugs are chiefly used for patients with epilepsy , but the drugs have been aggressively promoted , in some cases for conditions they are not approved to treat , such as bipolar disorder , pain and migraine headaches .
While doctors are free to prescribe medicines as they see fit , drugmakers are only allowed to promote them for uses approved by the FDA .
RISK PRECEDES BENEFIT
Last month , a Boston jury found Pfizer guilty of improperly marketing Neurontin .
And in January , Novartis said it would plead guilty to violating U.S. laws relating to potential off - label marketing and promotion of Trileptal .
To study the risks of suicidal thoughts and acts , Patorno and colleagues analyzed prescription and clinical data on nearly 300,000 patients 15 and older who had been given an anticonvulsant drug for the first time between July 2001 and December 2006 .
“ We found increased risk for suicidal acts beginning within the first 14 days after treatment initiation , opening the possibility that anticonvulsant medications could induce behavioral effects prior to the achievement of their full therapeutic effectiveness , ” Patorno and colleagues wrote .
The study identified 827 suicidal acts , including 801 attempted suicides and 26 completed suicides .
They also found an additional 41 violent deaths .
They said compared with topiramate , the risk of suicidal acts was higher in those who took gabapentin , lamotrigine , oxcarbazepine , tiagabine and valproate .
Among these , the risks were “ pretty much even , ” Patorno said in a telephone interview .
“ It ’s not easy to draw conclusions about which one is the most risky , ” she said .
Patorno said patients should continue taking their medications , but the findings do suggest that patients need to be watched carefully , and doctors need to consider whether the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks , particularly when given for an unapproved use .
A SUNSHINE Coast councillor told an anti-desalination meeting last night that the carrying capacity of the land had been reached when we had to manufacture water to support further population growth .
Council major portfolio head Debbie Blumel said the time had come to respect the regional landscape rather than accept planning driven by the development industry .
Organised by Communities Against Desalination the meeting at Marcoola surf club , which attracted more than 200 people , was the final public gathering in opposition to planning for a desalination pipeline that would pump water from about 1.5 km seaward of Marcoola to a treatment plant next to Sunshine Coast Airport .
“ Let 's talk about how we can have more population growth when there is insufficient water for the population we already have , '' Ms Blumel said .
“ Let me be absolutely clear about this .
SEQ is unable to provide water for the future population unless we manufacture it using desalination . ”
Queensland Water Commission executive director Dan Spiller said it would explore all options before committing to a model to deliver water to the south - east corner 's growing population .
He said the community could , by limiting use , stall the need for a new supply source .
Mr Spiller said the commission had to undertake planning and be ready to act to meet demand .
That could be as early as 2017 , which would require the construction of a supply source by 2014 , or as late as 2032 .
Mr Spiller said he believed that the 230 litre a person each day assumption that informed the commission 's demand projections could be improved to 200 but that it required community feedback on what it wanted .
However , if desalination is determined to be needed to augment the water grid , it appears that Marcoola is shaping as the preferred option over Lytton because of the already degraded state of Moreton Bay .
Member for Maroochydore Fiona Simpson said if the government was serious about demand management it should re-introduce the rebate scheme for tanks and water efficient devices and assist with the plumbing of tanks to existing homes .
She called on the government to work cooperatively with the community to reduce demand .
Environmental scientist Justin Holbrook outlined plans for a water harvesting scheme at Coolum Ridges which he said offered a model for all new subdivisions .

SETI ’s Best Chance : Find the Beacon
If we ’re going to get lucky with SETI , it ’s probably going to be through the reception of an interstellar beacon rather than the chance detection of an electronic emission from space .
Sure , chance catches are possible , and for all we know odd receptions like the WOW !
signal of 1977 might be cases in point .
But we ca n’t confirm such signals because they ’re one - shot affairs , whereas a beacon , designed to be received over interstellar distances , just might give us other options .
Understanding the Interstellar Beacon
So what can we say about beacons ?
In a guest editorial for the SETI League , former NASA SETI signal detection analyst Bob Krekorian takes a shot at the problem .
Krekorian assumes a space - faring species will put its transmitter inside the habitable zone , designed to exist as close to the parent star as feasible to take advantage of the huge amounts of energy available there .
If we were building such a beacon , we might decide to place it between the orbits of Earth and Venus , for energy reasons and efficient servicing .
Image : Looking toward galactic center in the infrared .
Finding an extraterrestrial beacon may mean re-examining the assumptions that drive the search .
Credit : Suzan Stolovy ( SSC / Caltech ) et al. , JPL - Caltech , NASA .
In any case , imagine a beacon that rotates synchronously as it orbits its star .
Rather than sending out a beam in all directions , it operates so that , in Krekorian ’s words , “ a strip of declination is illuminated at its orbital opposition and conjunction modes . ”
The advantages of this more targeted method seem considerable , as the author goes on to explain :
For potential contactees , the result is a gain of two orders of magnitude in received power over an omni-directional antenna and elimination of the Doppler drift accelerations from both planetary rotation and orbital motion .
Assuming a continuous wave or a pulse signal , the signal types expected , detection is a much easier proposition , since the signal trajectory does not cut across detection channels in the time - frequency plane during the observation period .
All of which has further implications for how we proceed :
When the assumption is made that the signal remains stationary in a channel , coherent detection ( match filtering ) methods can be used to significantly improve detection sensitivity .
Finally , one of the biggest challenges facing potential SETI recipients like us or anybody is the monumental real time signal processing ( computer operations per second ) effort that is required , if all possible signal drift paths resulting from planetary rotation are considered .
A Galactic Test for Membership ?
The problems in finding such a signal are , of course , enormous , and it ’s interesting to speculate , as Krekorian goes on to do , about ways to increase the information rate in a communications channel .
The Shannon - Hartley theorem shows us the connection between channel capacity ( bits per second ) , bandwidth and signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) .
The interplay of these factors is intriguing because it sets up a potential test ( what Krekorian calls ‘ an entrance fee ’ ) for joining any organization of communicating civilizations .
You would think , for example , that increasing bandwidth is always a preferable option , for it allows you to pump more bits per second into your signal .
But this added channel capacity also adds more noise into the system , which means your signal - to - noise ratio becomes problematic .
Having found a signal , here ’s how we could cope with this at our end :
SNR is directly proportional to telescope collecting area , so once we find the signal , larger collecting areas can be built to recover SNR and take advantage of the high data rates .
This puts some of the burden of maximizing channel capacity on the receiving party , maybe the entrance fee required to join the galactic telecommunication federation .
To Find an Interstellar Roadmap
Intriguing stuff , and it ’s important to note Krekorian ’s point here , which is that as SETI was formerly practiced at NASA , it proceeded in two ways .
A targeted search looked at a single star for 1000 seconds , and an all - sky survey looked briefly throughout the celestial sphere .
Both of these strategies would fail if we assume that a stellar orbital beacon of the kind Krekorian outlines is broadcasting .
Let ’s assume that any civilization smart enough to build such a beacon and powerful enough to keep it in operation would know the pitfalls emerging civilizations like ours would encounter .
In that case , what would they do to make it obvious ?
Is there , then , an interstellar roadmap that is , in Krekorian ’s words , “ obvious to every emerging civilization like us based on the fundamentals of physics , astrophysics and mathematics , especially number theory , to connect one to the broadcast ” ?
Perhaps , as Krekorian muses in an earlier SETI League editorial , the acquisition signal will be in the form of a pointer that directs us to the primary communications channel .
In any case , we would expect that extraterrestrials choosing to make themselves known would make the problem of detecting their signal as straightforward as possible .
In the absence of government funding , we now rely on the private sector to uncover possible strategies .
Kepler is going to give us a better idea of how likely we are to find such a beacon .
If terrestrial worlds in the habitable zones of their stars turn out to be relatively common , we ’ll be spurred to ask why we have yet to receive a signal and ponder whether SETI ’s methods are not , as Krekorian implies , severely behind the times .
If terrestrial worlds are found to be scarce , the problem is magnified by the potential distance between us and possible senders .
SETI will continue in either case , but so must the relentless effort to discover what methods would most reliably result in a signal , assuming there is one out there to be had .

Scientists from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Arizona State University conducted the comparison as a test of the potential for treating disease in developing nations with the significantly less expensive plant - based production technique .
The results are reported online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Antibodies , which are part of the immune system , bind to foreign invaders to disable them and label them for destruction .
Because of their finely tuned targeting capabilities , scientists have developed ways to mass - produce a particular antibody .
They have used such monoclonal antibodies in a variety of contexts .
For example , a monoclonal antibody against West Nile virus , originally developed at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis , is in clinical trials by a company that licensed the antibody from Washington University .
Monoclonal antibodies are also in development for a variety of other diseases , but the expense of manufacturing such antibodies makes it economically infeasible to use them to treat disease in the developing world .
So researchers at Washington University and Arizona State University decided to see if they could adapt the West Nile virus monoclonal antibody for production in a much less expensive factory : genetically modified plants .
Plants normally do not make antibodies , but in 1989 scientists developed a technique to genetically alter a tobacco plant so it would produce monoclonal antibodies .
Proponents of the new technique noted that it had the potential to make antibodies much more affordable .
In addition , plants do not carry viruses that can infect humans .

Researchers had to adjust the West Nile virus antibody to adapt it for production in Nicotiana benthamiana , a relative of tobacco .
" We altered the genetic coding of the antibody slightly , not changing its parts but using alternate forms of the coding for those parts to maximize the plant 's ability to produce it , " says co-senior author Qiang Chen , Ph.D. , of Arizona State .
" We also stabilized the antibody , preventing copies of it from being degraded inside the plant cells .
Together , those two techniques increased our average antibody yield by 60 percent above any previous efforts . "
Scientists then tested regular and plant - produced monoclonal antibodies in mice both as preventatives against West Nile infection and as treatments for animals already infected with the virus .
They found the antibodies from plants were equally effective at preventing infection and fighting existing infections .
Researchers at Macrogenics Inc. , the company that licensed the antibody from Washington University , analyzed the plant - produced antibody 's ability to bind to West Nile virus particles .
They found that one important receptor was binding appropriately , but the strength of a second receptor 's bond was lowered .
" This results from the fact that plants combine their proteins with slightly different sugars than mammals , " says co-senior author Michael Diamond , M.D. , Ph.D. , professor of medicine , of molecular microbiology and of pathology and immunology at Washington University .
" We 're already working on genetically modifying the plants to humanize the sugars the plants combine with the antibody 's proteins . "
Diamond stresses that the study was not designed to make a case for using plant - produced antibodies to treat West Nile virus infections , which continue to occur throughout the United States .
" That 's a decision for manufacturers and governmental regulators to make , " he says .
" Our hope is that once this technology is proven and widely available , it will be taken up by innovative , technology - savvy nations like India and Brazil where the need for more affordable solutions for endemic diseases is much greater . "
Funding from the National Institutes of Health and the Midwest Regional Center of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research supported this research .
Mr Bakiyev has been trying to rally support in his home city Kyrgyzstan 's ousted President Kurmanbek Bakiyev has said he will be willing to step down in return for security guarantees for him and his family .
Mr Bakiyev fled to the south of the country following last week 's uprising .
The interim government has yet to give a response to his offer .
Its leaders held a late - night meeting in Bishkek , the capital , but made no announcement .
Meanwhile Russian President Dmitry Medvedev warned the country faced civil war if political uncertainty continued .
In a speech in Washington , he said : " Some political leaders will have to make a decision about their fate . "
He did not elaborate , but correspondents say the Kremlin has been quick to offer assistance to Mr Bakiyev 's rival , Roza Otunbayeva , since she became interim leader .
Arrest warning
The interim leaders have lifted Mr Bakiyev 's immunity and say they will arrest him if he refuses to surrender .
ANALYSIS Rayhan Demytrie , BBC News Bishkek
The opposition interim government has not made up its mind whether to accept the conditions Mr Bakiyev placed on his resignation .
The international community , represented in talks in Bishkek by the OSCE envoy , the UN and the EU special representatives , are trying to convince the interim government to hold talks .
Kyrgyz society , it seems , is also divided .
On one hand , we are hearing from the relatives of the victims of the 7 April riots that they want to bring Mr Bakiyev to justice .
On the other hand , many feel that the president 's resignation would help solve the crisis in the country .
What is interesting is that state channels in Kyrgyzstan are not broadcasting news from the south , where thousands of Mr Bakiyev 's supporters have gathered to express their loyalty to him .
He has been questioning this , asking : " Where is the democracy and free speech promised by those who seized power ? "
Economic woes worsen
Mr Bakiyev previously insisted he remained the legitimate president of Kyrgyzstan .
But at a news conference in his home village of Teyit in Jalalabad , he laid out the conditions under which he would stand down .
He said he wanted " a guarantee that the roaming of these armed people ends in Kyrgyzstan , that this redistribution of property and this armed free - for - all stops " , and a guarantee of personal security for himself and his family and relatives .
Mr Bakiyev said the interim government had to " start preparing a snap presidential election to be held within two or three months " .
He said he would be prepared to hold talks with Ms Otunbayeva if she travelled to the south to see him .
It was unsafe for him to go to the capital for talks as the administration could not guarantee his security , he said .
Nepotism accusation Some 5,000 of Mr Bakiyev 's supporters , many of them waving banners , gathered in the town in Jalalabad , to hear him speak .
TIMELINE : KYRGYZSTAN UNREST
March 2005 : Protests over disputed election , dubbed the Tulip Revolution , lead to fall of President Askar Akayev July 2005 : Kurmanbek Bakiyev elected president by a landslide October 2007 : Referendum approves constitutional changes , which the opposition present as a step towards authoritarianism December 2007 : Bakiyev 's Ak Zhol party wins parliamentary poll ; opposition left with no seats July 2009 : Bakiyev re-elected in vote criticised by monitors 7 April 2010 : Bakiyev ousted in violent protests ; interim government takes over 13 April 2010 : Interim government removes Bakiyev 's immunity from prosecution
Q&A : Kyrgyz unrest
In pictures : Kyrgyz mourning
The ousted leader also repeated his call for an international investigation to be held into the violent demonstrations last Wednesday , which left more than 80 people dead .
The interim government held a late - night meeting in Bishkek on Tuesday , but did not respond .
However , in an earlier interview Ms Otunbayeva said she was prepared to offer security guarantees to Mr Bakiyev if he resigned and left the country , but would not offer such immunity to his family .
" We will provide security guarantees which he 's entitled to under the constitution , " she told the Associated Press .
But she warned her patience with Mr Bakiyev was running out .
" His stay in Kyrgyzstan is posing a problem for the nation 's future .
It 's becoming increasingly difficult to guarantee his security as people are demanding to bring him to justice . "
The ousted leader 's critics have accused him of nepotism for installing his brother and son , among other relatives , in key government posts .
Court dissolved Earlier , Azimbek Beknazarov , a minister in charge of security , said a criminal investigation had been opened against Mr Bakiyev , and that he had until the afternoon to hand himself in to the authorities .
" We can see that the president does not want to step down voluntarily and instead is issuing calls for actions against the people , " he said .
The interim government also announced on Tuesday that it had dissolved the country 's constitutional court .
Last week 's violence was the culmination of weeks of discontent over rising prices and allegations of corruption in Kyrgyzstan .
The interim government has pledged to hold elections in six months ' time and says the security forces are under its command .

Thorium has somehow survived its early demise …
Now it stands poised to fuel a limitless Future if we can change the course of history !
The nuclear debate continues to put forward large scale alternatives to fossil - fueled Society , but has never included a much better option , when it comes to managing the waste and risks .
This tragedy is essentially the result of politics , not science , since there likely is n’t a more misunderstood and overlooked element on the Periodic Table than Thorium .
Despite its enormous potential to safely power both the developing world and our modern societies through the self - regulating energy production of the little known “ Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor ” ( LFTR ) .
This long - mothballed reactor design is gaining great new attention in other parts of the world because it produces only small amounts radioactive waste ( which fully decay in a few hundred years , rather than many thousands ) , offers no realistic potential for easy weaponization , and in fact enables the destruction of weapons grade materials .
Thorium astoundingly still remains an elemental mystery to most people to this very day however .
Mainly because it ’s early and successful development in the U.S. was nixxed in favor of the Uranium - based weapons programs in the 50’s and 60’s .
Where does History stop , and the Future begin ?
While we continue to poison our world with fossil - fuel derived energy while awaiting the development of truly sustainable ( and enormous ) baseload power requirements via renewable options , this ecological paradox begs us to question why !
Apparently , this tragic situation still exists primarily because since the “ Atomic Age ” the Public has been collectively coerced by the historical circumstances around nuclear power , our fears of unknown “ nuke ” threats , and our general ignorance that surrounds the deep complexities and risks of nuclear energy production .
These powerful factors in forming public opinion have certainly also been advantaged to serve the agendas of special interest groups , and possibly even the powerfully subtle PR machines of fossil fuel interests – in order to blindly associate ANY atomic power with the risks of weaponization , and toxic nuclear waste .
Yet Thorium has been typecast in the same rigid roles that are filled by the prevalent Uranium - based designs .
Like most of the other great advances in in science and technology , Thorium ’s fate also rested in the hands of those who directed funding for military , political , and national defense objectives .
So it was all - too susceptible to the the various tipping points in history where nuclear deterence was far more critical to survival than nuclear energy .
As we begin to re-examine lost opportunities from the Past , and re-ignite them as options for a brighter Future , perhaps you ’re wondering Why …
Why take a risk on a nuclear renaissance ?
.
Are you curious about how the entire course of human history has been altered by pursuing Uranium - based nuclear energy ?
How Thorium could still in fact serve to change the Future course of that history ?
.
In 1964 , Eugene Weinberg and his team built a working version of the molten - salt reactor ( MSR ) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) which operated until 1975 , and which suspended the byproducts of thorium in a molten salt bath that allowed the reaction to be self - regulating ( ie. the hotter it got the slower it reacted ) , and which did n’t require costly and dangerous pressurization chambers to contain coolants and gases .
Weinberg spent the rest of his 18 - year tenure trying to instill thorium at the heart of the nation ’s atomic energy programs .
Obviously and unfortunately he failed in the face of prevailing interests .
Uranium reactors had already been well established according to the work of Enrico Fermi and others , and Hyman Rickover , the head of the US nuclear program , needed the plutonium from uranium - powered nuclear plants to make atomic bombs .
Increasingly shunted aside , Weinberg was finally forced out entirely in 1973 .
1973 proved to be “ the most pivotal year in energy history , ” according to the US Energy Information Administration .
It was that year when the Arab states cut off oil supplies to the West , setting in motion the first national ‘ Energy Crisis ’ and subsequently all the petroleum - fueled conflicts that still threaten the world to this very day .
That same year , the US nuclear industry signed contracts to build a record 41 nuclear plants , which would all use uranium .
Weinberg was fired by the Nixon Administration from ORNL in 1973 after 18 years as the lab ’s director because he continued to advocate increased nuclear safety and Molten Salt Reactors ( MSR’s ) against the Republican Party ’s selected Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor ( LMFBR ) .
Thus , 1973 was effectively the year that thorium R&D faded away to relative obscurity .
“ Before it was born , thorium was killed by the sins of uranium . ”
– Ben Buchwalter
Weinberg ’s firing effectively halted development of the MSR , as its technology was virtually unknown by other nuclear labs and specialists , and to this day most nuclear physicists receive very little if any exposure to MSR concepts and principals while being trained .
The Oak Ridges Lab ( ORNL ) had also done the majority of research on thorium as a nuclear fuel , therefore its potential use as a nuclear fuel was also greatly diminished .
In fact if it were n’t for strong backing by ORNL ’s ORSORT ( Oak Ridge School Of Reactor Technology ) sponsor , Admiral Rickover , along with his nuclear core designer Dr. Alvin Radkowsky who successfully operated the USA ’s first Thorium fueled commercial power plant at Shippingport , Pennsylvania using a Light Water Breeder Reactor ( LWBR ) , thorium as a reactor fuel might have vanished entirely .
In this case military interests have actually served to preserve at least the roots of Thorium based energy via their use of LWBR technology to destroy plutonium in proliferation resistant reactors in Russia with the U.S. Department of Energy ’s program funding for Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention , and through technical assistance from Brookhaven National Laboratory ( BNL ) and Thorium Power , Inc .
So in an ironic twist of fate , the need to destroy weapons grade plutonium , has created an opportunity for Thorium based reactors to still exist today , albeit as a little - known nuclear non-proliferation program .
As such Thorium has survived its military and political death , and continued to exist on the fringes of Nuclear Science long enough to meet the challenges of a post - ColdWar world that is now facing the dangers of Ecological disaster .
Relying on its core strengths as a clean , proliferation resistant nuclear fuel , Thorium is offering a way to burn off our existing stockpiles of nuclear energy and weapons waste , while promising a magical silver - bullet to solve the social ills and ecological nightmares that have resulted from an entire species becoming addicted to cheap and abundant fossil fuels .

Hou is the creator of the popular long - running webcomic , Alien Loves Predator .
First things first , I 'm not a professional game reviewer , and ComicsAlliance did n't ask me to do a proper review , so I wo n't be giving you the kind of in - depth analysis of every part of this game that you 'd get at one of the dozens of game review sites out there .
And the screenshots you see here may differ , however slightly , from the actual game ( at least as of this writing ) .
That said , as a rabid fan of the Alien and Predator franchises and changing my underwear , I can't get enough of Sega / Rebellion 's new " Aliens vs. Predator " game ( PS3 , Xbox 360 , PC ) .
If you 're looking for old school first - person shooter action with the delicious twist of playing as the two baddest killer space monsters in the galaxy , " AvP " is the game for you .
" Old school " here , as always , is both good and bad .
There 's an overall lack of depth throughout the whole experience ... but hot damn , it 's great fun .
It 's like Kool & the Gang .
I do n't know if my life is particularly enriched by it , but I do know that after it 's done I 've had a blast and I 'm a big sweaty mess .
The game has basically one main attraction -- being able to play as the 3 different species ( Alien , Predator , Colonial Marine ) -- and it trumps everything else .
All 3 species are diverse from one another , fun , and impressively well - balanced .
If that makes you moist , then you 'll have a great time .
On the other hand , if you 're looking for a squad - based , tactical - like , vehicle - havin ' , cover - oriented , objective - laden , strategical - ish shooter , you should probably be playing " Call of MAG : Brothers in Dutyfield " or whatever it 's called .
THE MARINE
The Marine is obviously the most traditional character to play , and there 's nothing unique about the gameplay mechanic here .
What makes him a blast , though , is the simple fact that he's in the " AvP " world .
You 're tiptoeing through dark hallways , desperately waving your flashlight at every dark corner because they 'll be COMIN ' OUTTA THE GODDAMN WALLS and then unloading your pulse rifle ( which sounds just like a real pulse rifle ) at those dark shapes crawling at you on the ceiling only to realize they 're just the dead pixels on your screen .
That feeling of being in the movie " Aliens " is most effectively evoked in the Marine 's single - player campaign , which , while not particularly creative in terms of level design , transcends that with lighting , mood , and overall crapyourpantsery .
It 's a lot like " Doom 3 " , which is a very good thing , because I still remember that as one of the most visceral shooters I 've ever played .
Only this has ALIENS .
" Doom 3 " with Aliens !
I 'm in heaven .
Or hell , more suitably , but in a good way .
THE PREDATOR
The key to playing the Predator is to do what the dude did in the first movie : stay invisible , only move when you have to , leap from tree branch to tree branch , and rain shit down on everybody .
I think Rebellion really nailed what it 's like being a Predator .
4 out of 5 Predators surveyed agree .
I 've seen some complaints that the Predator feels " underpowered " , and that too often you feel like " prey " , ironically .
But let 's be honest ... the Predator we know from the movies is kind of a big pussy .
REAL warriors do n't hide behind all that technology , turn invisible and run away all the time .
I mean if you 're gonna be a badass monster , be a badass monster am I right ?
Last I checked , the Hulk is n't going around yelling HULK HIDE .
And it 's never CLOAKIN ' TIME for the Thing .
So the sooner you can accept that the Predator is n't the super - stud you think he is , the sooner you can get to enjoying his unique and satisfying combination of stealth , speed , power and gadgets .
And screaming like a little bitch whenever you heal yourself ... way to give up your position girly !
THE ALIEN
Man , you know what I could go for right now ?
Chomping on a Marine 's head .
I dunno why I just came up with that , it 's not like I actually eat humans .
But I just feel like doing it .
I dunno .
Is that wrong ?
Hey look , I see a glowing outline of a Marine through that wall .
That 's weird , I did n't know I had x-ray vision .
Let 's see if I can actually walk through that wall ... okay ... here we g--........
HOLY SHIT I JUST WALKED UP THIS F-- KING WALL .
Just like that .
Lookit me everyone , I 'm like SPIDER - MAN .
I 'm like , conflicted about my powers and everything .
Wait , I 'm confused already ... is that thing over there the floor , or the ceiling ?
How the hell do I keep this straight ?
There 's this weird arrow - looking thing in the middle of my vision that spun around when I walked up this wall , but damn if I can remember which direction it 's supposed to be pointing .
Hold on , the drool coming out of my mouth is " falling " that way , so that 's the floor ... and this --.......
F--K ME I'M STANDING ON THE CEILING .
I'm STANDING .
On the CEILING .
I am now the MAYOR .
Of this CEILING .
Now let 's get me some MARINE HEAD .
I mean ... you know what I mean .
Chomp chomp chomp .
Where 'd that guy go ?
Oh , there he is .
His glowing outline 's upside down now , which is , you know , weird , but I 'll get used to it .
I hope .
Whooooa , I can move FAST !
I 'm FLYIN ' across this ceiling .
Or wall .
That guy 's outline 's sideways now so I guess that means I 'm on the wall .
WHATEVER DUDE .
I'LL GET USED TO IT .
There he is .
And ... he 's running away !
How'd he know I was here ?
Are you gonna make me chase you , son ?
Are you gonna --
HHOOOOLLLLLYY WOOOOW what 's going on ??
I'm RUNNING !!
You mean THAT , BEFORE , was me WALKING ?
HAHAHAHA !
Are you KIDDING ME .
I 'm going so fast I 'm getting wind burn on my testicles .
Or whatever , where my testicles would be .
You 're not gettin ' away now , puny Marine !
I 'm gonna grab ya !
I 'm gonna grab ya !
Grab grab grab grab grab .
GOTCHA , MOTHERF --KER .
Stop struggling , there 's no way you 're gettin ' outta this .
Your head 's gettin ' chomped one way or another .
Now stay still while I open WIIIIIiimmmhhrmpttHH -- oh GROSS , WHOSE MOUTH DO I HAVE INSIDE MY MOUTH
MULTIPLAYER
Despite my half - assed joke earlier dismissing the glut of modern online military shooters , I actually play and enjoy all those games .
I love the teamwork , strategy , and achievement - unlocking .
Yeah " AvP " 's got none of that .
You do play on teams , but there are n't complex objectives that require coordination .
And there 's almost literally no point in gaining XP besides some new skins you can collect , which amounts to choosing between different shades of black if you 're an Alien .
( Was that racist ? )
But I like the change of pace .
Sometimes I just wanna shut off my brain and have a good ol ' sci - fi monster mash , y'know ?
And once again the varied mix of species inherently gives the whole experience a flavor you wo n't get anywhere else .
Whichever race you happen to be playing , you 're faced with at least 2 kinds of enemies that are so distinct from each other , yet so well - balanced , that it 's hard to get bored .
There 's plenty of satisfying game types , Deathmatch , Species Team Deathmatch , Mixed Species Team Deathmatch ... and a few unique ones like Infestation , which starts off with one Alien versus a group of Marines , and then each Marine that dies joins the Alien team , creating an inescapable nightmare for the dwindling survivors .
That one 's a favorite for a lot of people , but I still do n't get the ultimate point ; it seems to me like you 're just shooting the deck chairs on the Titanic .
The biggest gripes I have about the multiplayer have been well - documented in other reviews : the matchmaking is heinous , and if the host of your match quits , the game ends and you lose all the kills and XP you gained in it .
But I 'm hopeful they 'll fix that all up in future patches , or at least that 's what I tell myself to help me put up with it .
IN CONCLUSION
" Aliens vs. Predator " 's not going to be winning any awards .
It 's a decidedly unambitious entry in a crowded genre which seems to spit out a new Game of the Year every 2 months .
But if you 're an Alien and / or Predator fan , or if you 're looking for a break from the usual everyday run n' gun , then pick this game up .
Despite its lack of complexity and some technical issues , it 's a real hoot .
OH , that 's MY MOUTH , whoaaa .
It 's like I got RUSSIAN NESTING MOUTHS .
VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - Gay groups and politicians condemned Pope Benedict ’s number two on Wednesday for calling homosexuality a “ pathology ” and linking it directly to sexual abuse of children .

The comments made by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone during a visit to Chile , and the controversy they caused , were splashed on mainstream Italian newspapers on Wednesday .
The French foreign ministry and some Catholic blogs that support the pope also condemned the cardinal ’s remarks .
As the scandal over sexual abuse of children by priests has spread , some in the Catholic Church have called for a review of the Church ’s rule that prohibits priests from marrying , saying marriage would allow priests to enjoy a healthy sex life .
Bertone , the Vatican secretary of state , who is sometimes called the “ deputy pope , ” told a news conference in Santiago on Monday :
“ Many psychologists and psychiatrists have shown that there is no link between celibacy and pedophilia , but many others have shown , I have recently been told , that there is a relationship between homosexuality and pedophilia . ”
“ This pathology is one that touches all categories of people , and priests to a lesser degree in percentage terms , ” he said .
“ The behavior of the priests in this case , the negative behavior , is very serious , is scandalous . ”
Gay rights activists reacted with derision and outrage .
“ This is a scientific absurdity .
The World Health Organization calls homosexuality a variation of human behavior .
It is pedophilia that is a pathology , a crime , not homosexuality , ” said Franco Grillini , a former parliamentarian who was at the vanguard of Italy ’s gay rights movement .
“ Because they have their own problems with the abuse crisis and do n’t know how to handle it , they are trying to pass their ‘ cross ’ from their shoulders on to ours , ” Grillini told Reuters .
CATHOLIC BLOG CRITICISES
The French foreign ministry called it an “ unacceptable linkage that we condemn . ”
Some pro-Vatican Catholic blogs said more controversy was the last thing the Vatican needed .
“ Pedophilia and homosexuality : Bertone trips up -- again -- on gays , ” read a post in the Italian - language “ Blog of the Friends of Pope Ratzinger . ”
It said the pope might now have to “ clean up the mess made by his right - hand man . ”
Vatican spokesman Rev. Federico Lombardi issued a statement in which he tried to douse the fire caused by the latest mishap .
He said Church leaders were not trying to make “ general affirmations of a specific psychological nature ” and offered Church statistics that showed that two - thirds of incidents of abuse of adolescents by priests involved homosexual priests .
A front - page editorial in Rome ’s left - leaning La Repubblica newspaper titled “ The Confusion in the Church ” said Bertone ’s comments would end up causing the Church more “ harm to itself , not homosexuals . ”
Bertone was also criticized by Alessandra Mussolini , a right - wing parliamentarian whose grandfather , wartime Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini , sent gays into internal exile .
“ You ca n’t link sexual orientation to pedophilia ... this link risks becoming dangerously misleading for the protection of children , ” Mussolini said .
ArciLesbica , Italy ’s main lesbian rights group , accused the Vatican of using “ violent and deceptive statements ” to divert attention from its abuse scandal and said Italian parents should consider removing their children from Church - run institutions .
The pope did not make any direct reference to the crisis facing the Church during his weekly general audience .
He may address the issue when he visits Malta this weekend .
Ten Maltese men who are suing three priests for alleged child abuse have requested a private meeting with the pope .

The Millions recently posted the very Shteyngart -y opening passage of Gary Shteyngart ’s forthcoming novel ,
.
“ Today I ’ve made a major decision : I am never going to die .
Others will die around me .
They will be nullified .
Nothing of their personality will remain .
The light switch will be turned off . ”
It got us thinking about our own favorite beginnings , both recent and classic .
Below are some favorites from our bookshelf .
Feel free to add your own picks in the comments section .
1. by Paul Beatty
Best commentary on “ post - blackness ” considering Obama was n’t even president when the book was written :
“ You would think they ’d be used to me by now .
I mean do n’t they know that after fourteen hundred years the charade of blackness is over ?
That we blacks , the once eternally hip , the people who were as right now as Greenwich Mean Time , are , as of today , as yesterday as stone tools , the velocipede , and the paper straw all rolled into one ?
The Negro is now officially human .
Everyone , even the British , says so . ”
2. “ Me and Miss Mandible ” by Donald Barthelme ( from )
Best opening to a story about sexual tension between a schoolteacher and her student who the teacher thinks is a little kid , but is actually an adult who , for some bizarre reason , has been re-assigned to elementary school .
“ Miss Mandible wants to make love to me but she hesitates because I am officially a child . ”
3. “ Sororally ” by Gary Lutz ( from )
Most depressing opening to an equally depressing story from an equally depressing book , whose bleak worldview is made palatable only by its triumphantly unique and beautiful sentences :
“ What could be worse than having to be seen resorting to your own life . ”
4. by Sam Lipsyte
Best opening passage that ’s been excerpted in a zillion places over the past few weeks because the book ’s just out ( and amazing ! ) but what the hell , let ’s hear it one more time , it ’s that good :
“ America , said Horace , the office temp , was a run-down and demented pimp .
Our republic ’s whoremaster days were through .
Whither that frost - nerved , diamond - fanged hustler who ’d stormed Normandy , dick - smacked the Soviets , turned out such firm emerging market flesh ?
Now our nation slumped in the corner of the pool hall , some gummy coot with a pint of mad dog and soggy yellow eyes , just another mark for the juvenile wolves . ”
5 . “ Old Souls ” by Sam Lipsyte ( from )
Best ( and only ) opening of same author ’s first book , a story collection , the first story of which begins in a strip club , and ends with the narrator committing quasi - sexual acts on his coma ’d sister before grabbing a beer with his bud and a crack - whore , no big deal :
“ You could touch for a couple of bucks .
The window of the booth went up and you stuck out the bills .
They might tell you not to pinch , but I was a stroke type anyway .
Some guys , I guess they want to leave a mark .
Me , I just like the feel . ”
6. “ You Drive ” by Christine Schutt ( from )
Best opening sentence about incest that does n’t explicitly mention incest , but is , like , totally about incest :
“ She brought him what she had promised and they did it in his car , on the top floor of the car park , looking down onto the black flat roofs of buildings , and she said , or she thought she said , ‘ I like your skin , ’ when what she really liked was the color of her father ’s skin , the mottled white of his arms , and the clay color at the roots of the hairs along his arms . ”
7. by J.D. Salinger
Best opening to a Salinger book that is n’t the one you ’d expect , but is a pretty excellent — if a bit snotty — description of snotty rich college kids :
“ Though brilliantly sunny , Saturday morning was overcoat weather again , not just topcoat weather , as it had been all week and as everyone hoped it would stay for the big weekend — the weekend of the Yale game .
Of the twenty - some young men who were waiting at the station for their dates to arrive on the ten - fifty - two , no more than six or seven were out on the cold , open platform .
The rest were standing around in hatless , smoky little groups of twos and threes and fours inside the heated waiting room , talking in voices that , almost without exception , sounded collegiately dogmatic , as though each young man , in his strident , conversational turn , was clearing up , once and for all , some highly controversial issue , one that the outside , non-matriculating world had been bungling , provocatively or not , for centuries . ”
8. by Gabriel Garcia Marquez
Best idea for a birthday gift :
“ The year I turned ninety , I wanted to give myself the gift of a night of wild love with an adolescent virgin . ”
9. by Samuel Beckett
Most Beckettian opening to a Beckett novel :
“ The sun shone , having no alternative , on the nothing new . ”
10 . by Joshua Ferris
Best opening written in the first - person plural other than The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie by Muriel Spark , which we can’t find our copy of , but which we remember as having a pretty great opening :
“ We were fractious and overpaid .
Our mornings lacked promise .
At least those of us who smoked had something to look forward to at ten - fifteen . ”
11 . by Darcey Steinke
Most impressive use of labia in a simile :
“ Was it the bourbon or the dye fumes that made the pink walls quiver like vaginal lips ? ”
12 . by Mark Twain
( This edition has a rad introduction by George Saunders . )
Most post - modern opening before the coining of the term “ post- modern ” :
“ You do n’t know about me , without you have read a book by the name of ‘ The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , ’ but that ai n’t no matter .
That book was made by a Mr. Mark Twain , and he told the truth , mainly . ”

Best opening sentence that references Drew Barrymore :
“ As a girl , Becca had n’t resembled Drew Barrymore at all .
But now , at twenty - five , especially after gaining a few pounds , she had grown used to comments from bartenders and store clerks , and the half - startled looks from passerby . ”

Best ultimatum as opening sentence :
“ Either forswear fucking others or the affair is over . ”
15 . by Leo Tolstoy
Best opening sentence that ’s been basically stripped of meaning by everyone always quoting it , mangling it , using variations on it as voice - over intros to their indie films , but is still pretty great , you ’ve got to admit ( note : this translation is from a really old Penguin edition ) :
“ All happy families are alike but an unhappy family is unhappy after its own fashion . ”
16 . by Jay McInerney
Best opening to a book written in the second person :
“ You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning . ”
17 . by Patrick Dewitt
Best opening to a book written in the second person that ’s not by Jay McInerney , and that , even if it ’s not the best , is still great , and you should read it because this book only came out last year , and no one paid attention to it to the point that you can buy it for like three bucks on Amazon :
“ Discuss the regulars .
They sit in a line like ugly , huddled birds , eyes wet with alcohol . ”
18 . by Albert Camus
Most exciting first sentence for twelfth grade existentialists , pissed off at those jerks in gym class , or the cute boy who wo n’t look at her , but at least there ’s solace to be found in the writings of dead Frenchmen ( and French Algerians ) :
“ Mother died today . ”
19 . by Michel Houellebecq
Best variation on Camus ’ opening line :
“ Father died last year .
I do n’t subscribe to the theory by which we only become truly adult when our parents die ; we never become truly adult . ”
20 . by Saul Bellow
Best opening to an epistolary novel :
“ If I am out of my mind , it ’s alright with me , thought Moses Herzog . ”
21 . by Joe Wenderoth
Best opening to an epistolary novel that ’s not Herzog :
“ July 1 , 1996
I had such a wonderful meal in every sense of the word .
I especially liked the ordering of the food .
IT asserts an altogether proper dominance .
And how do you manage to hire such attractive people !!
Often I visit Wendy ’s just to take a gander at your employees .
Thank you !
( for being there ) ”
22 . by Jonathan Lethem
Best opening narration by a character with Tourette ’s syndrome :
“ Context is everything .
Dress me up and see .
I ’m a carnival barker , an auctioneer , a downtown performance artist , a speaker in tongues , a senator drunk on filibuster .
I ’ve got Tourette’s .
My mouth wo n’t quit , though mostly I whisper or subvocalize like I ’m reading aloud , my Adam ’s apple bobbing , jaw muscle beating like a miniature heart under my cheek , the noise suppressed , the words escaping silently , mere ghosts of themselves , husks of empty breath and tone . ”
23 . by Mary Robison
Least annoying / best dream sequence opening :
“ I have a dream of working a combination lock that is engraved on its back with the combination .
Left 85 , right 12 , left 66 .
“ Well shit , man , ” I say in the dream . ”
24 . by Hunter S. Thompson
Best opening description of a drug experience :
We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert , when the drugs began to take hold .
I remember saying something like “ I feel a bit lightheaded ; maybe you should drive … . ”
And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats , all swooping and screeching and diving around the car , which was going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas .
And a voice was screaming : “ Holy Jesus !
What are these goddamn animals ? ”
25 . “ Wants ” by Grace Paley ( from )
Most perfectly economical first lines of a perfectly economical short story :
“ I saw my ex-husband in the street .
I was sitting on the steps of the new library .
Hello , my life , I said .
We had once been married for twenty - seven years , so I felt justified .
He said , What ?
What life ?
No life of mine . ”
26 . by Jonathan Ames
Most TMI opening to a non-fiction book because we see the author wandering around Brooklyn all the time , and have to fight the urge to ask about the late ascension of his left ball :
“ I started puberty very late .
I was nearly sixteen .
And for complicated reasons this late arrival of my puberty caused me to stop playing competitive tennis .
But before my puberty problem , I had trouble with my lower back and with my left testicle . ”
27 . by Thomas Pynchon
Best one sentence description of the beginning of blitz bomb apocalypse :
“ A screaming comes across the sky . ”
28 . by Herman Melville
Opening sentence that could be a stray piece of dialogue from a disturbingly Iraq War - themed porn film :
“ Call me Ishmael . ”
29 . by Vladimir Nabakov
Best opening that everyone knows is the best opening , so much so that it ’s basically become a cliché to put it in a list of best openings , but so what , because it ’s actually the best , and we dare you to come up with a better one :
“ Lolita , light of my life , fire of my loins .
My sin , my soul .
Lo - lee - ta : the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palette to tap , at three , the teeth .
Lo. Lee Ta .
She was Lo , plain Lo , in the morning , standing four feet ten in one sock .
She was Lola in slacks .
She was Dolly at school .
She was Dolores on the dotted line .
But in my arms she was always Lolita . ”

Personal favorite :
“ I am an American , Chicago born — Chicago , that somber city — and go at things as I have taught myself , free - style , and will make the record my own way : first to knock , first admitted ; sometimes an innocent knock , sometimes a not so innocent . ”
Here is something to ruin your day .
DC Comics announced that Judd Winick has been promoted to Editor - in - Chief .
You may recall that back in February Dan DiDio was promoted to Co-Publisher of DC Comics .
Well , this left an opening in the Editor - in - Chief position .
Here is the announcement from the DC Universe : The Source blog :
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE : DC ENTERTAINMENT
NAMES EDITOR-IN -CHIEF
Judd Winick to Serve as Editor - in - Chief of DC Comics ( New York , NY and Burbank , CA ) DC Entertainment , founded in September 2009 to unleash the power of the DC Comics library of characters across all media platforms , has named the final member of the newly - established executive team .
Judd Winick , who has been named Editor - in - Chief of DC Comics , joins Jim Lee and Dan DiDio , Co-Publishers of DC Comics , and Geoff Johns , Chief Creative Officer of DC Entertainment .
Diane Nelson , President , DC Entertainment , made the announcement .
“ With the addition of Judd Winick , DC Entertainment ’s new creative ‘ dream team ’ is complete , ” said Nelson .
“ This announcement continues and underscores DC ’s legacy as the ultimate destination for creators .
We ’ll benefit enormously from the experience Judd brings to the table , while re-energizing the direction and focus of the company .
I ’m excited and honored to have Judd , along with the rest of the executive team , with me at the helm of DC Entertainment . ”
Judd Winick is a comic book and comic strip writer / artist known for his work on such comic books as Green Lantern , Green Arrow , Outsiders , and Pedro and Me , as well as his 1994 stint on MTV’s The Real World : San Francisco .
Winick ’s most recent writing credits include : Batman , Titans , The Trials of Shazam , as well as upcoming issues of Power Girl and Justice League : Generation Lost .
The article continues including quotes from Dan DiDio , Geoff Johns , and Jim Lee .
Lee also did the quick sketch below ( poking some fun at Judd ’s The Real World days ) to commemorate the new appointment .
Apparently this announcement was timed to coincide with the release of Blackest Night # 8 , and therefore kick - off DC ’s Brightest Day campaign .
Are they out of their friggin’ minds ?!?!?
Judd Winick as Editor - in - Chief is anything but the beginning of DC ’s Brightest Day in my opinion .
For me he ruined the Green Arrow monthly title ( and nearly Black Canary with it ) , almost killed the Titans franchise , and brought back a character that should have remained dead forever ( Jason Todd ) .
I was depressed enough that he ’ll soon be writing Power Girl and the JLI .
Now he ’s got creative control over all of DC ’s characters .
So DC is giving Winick the keys to the kingdom .
I ’ve always felt that Winick ’s writing was as predictable as the rising sun .
As Editor - in - Chief , does this mean he ’ll encourage his writers to include the same played - out story tropes he always includes ?
Maybe we should expect to see more of :
the same social issues repeated over and over ( suddenly characters reveal they ’re gay and / or someone contracts AIDS ) ;
characters on a team all sounding and behaving exactly alike ;
and reusing other people ’s plots .
( i.e . In Batman : Hush , Jeph Loeb brilliantly fooled us into believing Jason Todd was back from the dead in one of the most shocking cliffhanger endings ever .
Two years later Judd Winick uses the same shocking plot device and brings back Jason Todd for real . )
I can just imagine Judd reaching back to his TV roots and giving us a new “ reality show ” comic :
Find out what happens … when superheroes stop being polite … and start getting real .
The Real World : Justice League .
Yuck !
** UPDATE **
Judd Winick ’s appointment has the fan community buzzing .
Here are a few places discussing the issue :
I will not serve that in which I no longer believe , whether it call itself my home , my fatherland , or my church : and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can , using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use — silence exile and cunning . ~
Yesterday , Lane Bryant posted a lingerie commercial it said had been rejected or partially censored by ABC and Fox .
Now they 've taken it down .
What 's going on ?

The commercial is for Lane Bryant 's Cacique lingerie line , and its content of a woman in lingerie preparing to meet her date was in no way edgier than anything else we 've seen on TV .
This is what Lane Bryant said on its blog yesterday :
ABC restricted our airtime and refused to show the commercial during " Dancing with the Stars . "
Fox demanded excessive re-edits and rebuffed it three times before relenting to air it during the final 10 minutes of " American Idol , " but only after we threatened to pull the ad buy .
Yes , these are the same networks that have scantily - clad housewives so desperate they seduce every man on the block , and do n't forget Bart Simpson , who has shown us the moon more often than NASA , all in what they call " family hour . "

But shortly after we posted the video last night , it was taken down from YouTube and the blog post disappeared , although the commercial is now being promoted as appearing during American Idol on particular dates .
We 're in touch with Lane Bryant 's press rep and will let you know when we hear something definitive .

The spokeswoman tells us , " Lane Bryant realized there was a legal trademark issue which required them to change out the spot .
In order to do this they needed to take the spot down prior to reposting the new version .
This change has nothing to do with the content of the spots and the new version will be up shortly . "

The video is back up on the site .

Update : It ’s One Million Children in the U.S. Alone , 30 MILLION Worldwide
Via : CNN :
Rotarix , made by GlaxoSmithKline , was approved by the FDA in 2008 .
The contaminant material is DNA from porcine circovirus 1 , a virus from pigs that is not known to cause disease in humans or animals , Hamburg said .
About 1 million children in the United States and about 30 million worldwide have gotten Rotarix vaccine , she said .
— End Update —
One million children have been injected with a vaccine that contains a pig virus that was n’t supposed to be in the vaccine .
According to Fierce Pharma Manufacturing , Rotarix has been “ contaminated ” since its early stages of development :
Researchers stumbled on DNA from porcine circovirus type 1 –believed nonthreatening to humans –while using new molecular detection techniques .
More work is being done to determine whether the whole virus or just DNA pieces are present .
Additional testing has confirmed presence of the matter in the cell bank and seed from which the vaccine is derived , in addition to the vaccine itself .
So the vaccine has been contaminated since its early stages of development .
Via : Los Angeles Times :
The Food and Drug Administration on Monday warned doctors and parents against using the Rotarix rotavirus vaccine until further testing can confirm that it is safe .
The warning follows an academic research group ’s discovery — subsequently confirmed by the FDA and Rotarix manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline — that the vaccine contains a pig virus called porcine circovirus 1 , or PCV1 .
The virus is not known to cause illness in humans , and no adverse effects have been observed in children vaccinated with Rotarix , but the agency decided to err on the side of caution with the warning until more information can be obtained .
For the time being , the agency recommends that pediatricians use a competing vaccine , RotaTeq , manufactured by Merck .
Preliminary tests have found no traces of PCV1 in this vaccine .
Rotavirus causes severe diarrhea and dehydration and is thought to cause more than 500,000 deaths in infants worldwide each year , primarily in low - and middle - income countries .
Before the introduction of RotaTeq in the U.S. in 2006 , the disease caused an estimated 50,000 hospitalizations and several dozen deaths each year .
Rotarix was introduced in 2008 .
Most U.S. children who have been vaccinated against rotavirus as part of their normal vaccinations have received RotaTeq , the FDA said .
About 1 million have received Rotarix .
The agency is now attempting to determine whether the vaccine contains intact PCV1 or simply viral fragments , as well as how it got into the vaccine .
The agency said it will convene an expert advisory panel in four to six weeks to make further recommendations .
The World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency are not expected to change current guidelines for using the drug , arguing that the benefit from the vaccine far outweighs any potential risk , according to a statement by GlaxoSmithKline .
An estimated 69 million doses of the vaccine have been administered globally .
Worldwide sales of the vaccine in 2009 were $ 425 million , the company said , with $ 115 million in the U.S .
Many pediatricians have switched to Rotarix because it requires only two oral doses , compared with three for RotaTeq .

DALLAS ( AP ) —
If you want a pillow and blanket in coach on American Airlines , it 's going to cost you .
The airline will charge $ 8 for a pillow and blanket in coach class for domestic trips and some international flights longer than two hours , beginning May 1 .
The international flights are to and from Canada , Mexico , Hawaii , the Caribbean and Central America .
Spokeswoman Andrea Huguely said Monday it was an economic decision .
" American evaluates all aspects of the business to ensure that economic decisions are prudent and strategic for the long - term success of the company , " she said .
Huguely said blankets will remain complimentary in premium - class cabins and in all cabins for other international flights .
The airline will sell a blue fleece blanket with an inflatable neck pillow in a clear zippered pouch , and will throw in coupon for $ 10 off a $ 30 purchase at Bed , Bath and Beyond , Huguely said .
JetBlue and US Airways charge $ 7 for a blanket - and - pillow set , with US Airways adding eye shades and earplugs .
Airlines have steadily added and increased fees for other services such as checking luggage and buying tickets from a reservation agent since 2008 , first to help cover jet fuel costs , then to offset large losses .
American parent AMR Corp. lost $ 1.47 billion last year — and $ 3.59 billion in the past two years — as traffic fell during the recession and competition limited American 's ability to raise fares .
This time , curiosity killed the camera : A lion mangled the remote - controlled BeetleCam — after taking a few pictures of African wilderness .
The Romans carried horseradish to Europe as a medicinal herb and as a flavoring .
It was cultivated in Egypt before the exodus of the Hebrew slaves around 1500 B.C. , and is often the symbolic bitter herb at the Passover Seder .
By the 16th century , the pungent root was spreading throughout England .
“ The Herbal or General History of Plants , ” by John Gerard , first published in 1597 , describes its many uses , including as an aphrodisiac , a treatment for tuberculosis , a mustard plaster and a dewormer .
Pliny the Elder wrote about horseradish in his “ Natural History , ” an epic work of 37 volumes completed in A.D. 77 , in which he observed that it healed sores , mange and ulcers .
The common name , according to Mr. Tucker and Mr. DeBaggio , probably evolved from the German “ meerrettich , ” which means sea-radish ( the plant grows wild in coastal areas ) , which was misunderstood by the English , who associated “ meer ” with “ mahre , ” an old horse .
People have n’t changed : they just do n’t pay attention .
Anyway , here ’s what Rock and I have learned so far by growing this amazing root .
Last April , Rock prepared the bed carefully , digging in plenty of compost and wood ash about a foot deep into the soil .
Wood ash is rich in potassium and helps bring up the pH of our acidic soil to a more neutral 7 , which is ideal for horseradish .
( Horseradish will tolerate a pH range of 6 to 8 , according to Johnny ’s Selected Seeds , our mail - order supplier . )
If you do n’t have wood ash , you could use greensand , which is also rich in potassium , or lime .
After preparing the soil , Rock made a furrow with his hoe about six inches deep , and laid the root cuttings about 18 inches apart on a 45 - degree slant in the soil .
When they arrive from a supplier , cuttings have a thick , flat end that signifies the top of the mother root and a narrow end , cut on a slant , that indicates the bottom of the root .
So if you set the thicker , flat end pointing up , you are mimicking the position of the original root .
Image Credit ... Mertz Library at the New York Botanical Garden
Cover the root with about three inches of soil , pat it down and water well .
That ’s about it , except for keeping the weeds out and watering if it does n’t rain .
Rock mulched with clean straw to keep the weeds down and the moisture in .
AFTER three seasons , “ Mad Men , ” the television series about advertising in the 1960s , has attained a level of popular - culture cachet .
There have been magazine cover articles , calendars and an episode of “ The Oprah Winfrey Show ” all devoted to it , spoofs on “ The Simpsons ” and “ Saturday Night Live , ” and even a “ Mad Men ” category on “ Jeopardy . ”
Soon , the show will enter a realm of the pop-culture pantheon that its creator , Matthew Weiner , says has surprised even him : Mattel plans to bring out versions of Barbie and Ken styled after four “ Mad Men ” characters .
The dolls are part of a premium - price collectors ’ series for adults that Mattel calls the Barbie Fashion Model Collection .
Although there have been Barbies and Kens based on other TV series , among them “ I Love Lucy ” and “ The X - Files , ” the dolls will be the first licensed line for that collection , Mattel says , with a suggested retail price of $ 74.95 each .
Mattel is licensing rights to the characters from Lionsgate , the studio that produces “ Mad Men ” for the AMC cable channel .
There will be 7,000 to 10,000 copies of each doll , to be sold in specialty stores and on two Web sites , amctv.com and barbiecollector.com .
The government spends billions of dollars more on it every year , and per person costs are increasing even faster .
The results are mixed , but there 's no slowing down .
No , it 's not health care or social security .
It 's defense .
The White House has requested $ 708 billion for fiscal year 2011 and defense spending is scheduled to increase each year , even as wars in Iraq in Afghanistan deescalate .
Of course , bravely serving in the military or working under the Department of Defense is n't a handout , but it 's another massive sector of the economy that 's keeping tons of folks employed who might otherwise be home looking for work .
The shocking truth about a fundamental right being denied to 55 % of citizens
There is a fundamental right being denied 55 % of all Americans .
This denial costs over 16,000 lives per year , meaning more than 44 of our fellow Americans will die every day that we delay .
What should be done in light of these shocking figures ?
Using the example set by President Obama and the Congressional Democrats , there is only one answer : Universal Gun Care for every American .
Surely a right outlined in the Bill of Rights ( 2d Amendment ) is just as important as a right NOT found the Constitution ( Health Care ) .
Bonus , it should be easier to implement .
After all , gun dealers and manufacturers are ready and willing to help solve the problem .
Unlike the evil insurance companies , gun dealers do n't want to take your weapon away from you when you most need it .
Nor will they deny selling you a weapon simply because you have n't purchased one in the past ( i.e. a pre-existing condition ) .
• Conventional estimates state that 45 % of all US households own a firearm .
This leaves at least 55 % of all Americans " uncovered . "
• In 2008 there were 16,272 murders in the USA .
How many of those could have been prevented if the victims had been able to protect themselves ?
My proposal is a modest one : • Mandate for every American to purchase a gun or be provided one by their employer ( children under the age of 26 can share a weapon with their parents )
• Tax credits to offset the cost of purchase ( for those making less than $ 250,000 per year and everyone in Nebraska )
• For those that can't afford it , a grant or subsidy to purchase a weapon ( union members can get two weapons subsidized before 2018 )
• Funding for a series of community based gun dealers / clinics and firing ranges ( especially in under - served urban and rural areas )
• Monthly ammunition benefit so that no one has to choose between feeding their kids , paying the rent , or buying a box of .38 special cartridges Contact your representative today .
The time to act is now .
M Allen Fritsch is an entrepreneur and business owner .
He is a graduate of the United States Military Academy and a former Army officer .
His household is one of the 45 % .
Nein , Fitnessgeräte für zuhause sind nicht alle gleich .
Viele sind qualitativ minderwertig , bieten keine optimalen Trainingsmöglichkeiten und werden in Wohnungen zudem als Fremdkörper wahrgenommen .

Two weeks ago , on February 3rd , 2010 , one woman , named Coral Anne , set out on a mission to create a Facebook fan page with more fans than Nickelback .
At the time , we highlighted the page as part of an ongoing Facebook phenomenon .
Diving deep into her psyche , she determined that what better way to upstage and simultaneously embarass Nickelback than to base her movement on an otherwise nondescript pickle .
A few days ago , the mission proved successful .
On February 19 , 2010 , she accomplished her goal and her fan page entitled “ Can this pickle get more fans than Nickleback ? ” exceeded Nickelback ’s fan page ’s 1.4 million fans .
This prompted a possibly - fake Chad Kroeger , lead vocalist for Nickelback , to demand it be put down , with the proof shown below in the image .
Doubters will of course wonder whether a multi-Platinum rock star lead singer would come after this Facebook group , but Chad Kroeger has been known to lash back before .
Famously , in responses to general criticism about his band , he stated :
“ ( Millions ) around the world will disagree with anybody who says that , ” he said .
“ Nickelback does not suck – if you do n’t like Nickelback , you do n’t like Nickelback – ( but ) Nickelback does not suck . ”
Certainly , having to explain the only reason you do n’t suck is by counting your record sales is a questionable strategy to deflect criticsm , but in any case , Chad is the type to fight back .
Finally , the fan page has prompted an official page , entitled Pickleback , and as the site and Fan page ’s popularity grows , the page will certainly continue its meteoric rise , probably based on the hilarity of the word Pickleback alone .
Coral
Anne stated a few important notes as well , that do highlight interesting facets of Facebook Pages : 1 . I am fully aware that I misspelled Nickelback as “ Nickleback ” in the name of the page .
This is because Facebook does n’t allow you to put the word Nickelback in the name of a page because I guess if someone did it would be copyright infringement .
2 . Yes , this page was inspired by “ Can this onion ring get more fans than Justin Bieber ? ” before anyone tells me that I copied the guy who made that .
I know I have but I thought his idea was so hilarious that I just had to do something in its likeness .
So I was inspired , more or less !
Below is the full list of every character on the poster .
It is grouped by the four areas above : top left , top right , bottom left , bottom right .
Currently the characters are not listed in any sensible order ( actually it's the order I drew the hotspots on the image map ) , but you can have fun trying to match them all - I 'll get round to ordering them eventually !
This is as good a place as any to say huge thanks to the members of the wonderful No Homers Club forum , who helped naming the last few people I did n't know - particularly Jamie , Cash Kerouac , Mr Johannson , and headintheclouds 87 .
Also thanks to Charlie / TSR123 on The Dead Homer Society who named the final character we could n't get .

There 's plenty to mull over in Joe Hagan 's excellent profile of Liz Cheney featured over the weekend in New York magazine .
There 's focus on her role as her father 's bulldog , her own political future ( dare we whisper , " President Cheney ? " ) , her willingness to aggressively deny reality in defense of her father , Michael Goldfarb 's admission that he has " a little crush on her . "
( " It 's hard not to ! " he gushes . )
But perhaps the most disturbing bits are not about Cheney at all , but rather about the current state of the Village , and the press that waits upon m'lords and ladies .
First , here 's what she 's up to , and here 's her mission :
She has spent nearly every day since her father ’s departure from the White House attempting to extricate him from the jaws of infamy by turning current events into a referendum on his policies .
Casting herself as his defense lawyer , she has appeared on television 40 - odd times in the last year .
And she ’s conducting the research for a Dick Cheney memoir , a book she persuaded her father to write .
Forty - odd times on TV .
Interesting , that .
But not nearly as interesting as this part :
When her father has something to say about Obama , the former vice - president takes a break from the book to prepare a political attack , feeding statements to his preferred media conduit , Politico.com .
Yeah , you bet your sweet ass that 's emphasis added .
There 's something that should go on the masthead : " Politico : Dick Cheney 's preferred media conduit when launching political attacks against President Obama . "
Truth in advertising and all that .
Still , while Politico's the most obvious go - to outlet for the Cheney Dynasty , it 's clear from reading the article that there 's enough nudge nudge palling around in The Village to make a mockery of the traditional media 's claim to professional objectivity .
Politico's not the only oh - so - cozy Cheney pet ( it 's just the favorite ! ) .
Consider this :
Fox is a regular pulpit , of course , but Liz is also all over NBC , where she happens to be social friends with Meet the Press host David Gregory ( whose wife worked with Liz ’s husband at the law firm Latham & Watkins ) , family friends with Justice Department reporter Pete Williams ( Dick Cheney ’s press aide when he was secretary of Defense ) , and neighborhood friends with Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski , daughter of Carter - administration national - security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski .
When Mika criticized Dick Cheney on her show last year , the former vice - president sent her a box of chocolate cupcakes .
Lawrence O’Donnell , an MSNBC pundit who engaged in a particularly testy shouting match on Good Morning America with Liz Cheney over waterboarding , says the networks have allowed her a high degree of control over her appearances .
“ She had up to that point been completely accustomed to having interviews go her way and ceded on her terms , ” he observes .
“ She has been careful to make sure that the interviews worked that way . ”
Or this :
Liz ’s friends say she sets the bar for all - American normality :
She watches Mad Men and 24 on TV , drives an SUV , attends Girl Scout meetings , and is frequently spotted on the sidelines of soccer fields , trading gossip with people like Terry McAuliffe , Washington Post reporter Glenn Kessler , and other power players whose kids go to the Country Day School or the Potomac School .
" That 's the bar for " all - American normality ? "
Palling around with the former head of the DNC and Post reporters between appearances on ( 40 - odd ) talk shows that are " ceded " on her own terms ?
This idea that the national press corps can cozy up to sources or people in power they cover during afternoon soccer games or over Saturday night dinners , then turn around and hold their feet to the fire is ridiculous .
You know it .
I know it .
Everyone outside of Beltway zip codes knows that .
Hell , anyone who 's ever tried to challenge a neighbor at a local meeting knows it .
But the Village ?
Meh .
They have their own rules .
And cupcakes .
Beremiz is an integrated development environment for machine automation .
It is Free Software , conforming to IEC - 61131 among other standards .
It relies on open standards to be independent of the targeted device , and let you turn any processor into a PLC .
Beremiz includes tools to create HMI , and to connect your PLC programs to existing supervisions , databases , or fieldbuses .
With Beremiz , you conform to standards , avoid vendor lock , and contribute to the better future of Automation .
Motivations
Despite of open standards such as IEC 61131 , PLCOpen and CanOpen , control engineers cannot deploy results of their engineering effort in an heterogeneous environment .
It is usually required to rewrite your PLC program for each particular PLC brand .
The reason for this is that proprietary solutions providers do not fully conform to standards , thus preventing interoperability , harmful to their business model .
Furthermore , standards specification are necessarily non exhaustive and leave some " manufacturer specific " freedom to the implementer .
Solution providers make great benefits out of those manufacturer specific details , at the expense of the freedom of the end user .
The Beremiz Project fills the gap between those independent standards specifications , by providing an integrated reference implementation of them .
The most important thing to understand about Final Fantasy XIII , the latest in the world 's most popular line of role - playing games , is that it is n't a role - playing game .
You do n't have to take my word for it .
Just ask its creators :
In a recent interview , the director of this PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 game ( available March 9 ) said the changes he made to this installment were so dramatic that it constituted a " new genre " outside the " RPG template . "
Various Final Fantasy directors have been making big tweaks to the series ' gameplay ever since it began in 1987 , and it's not as if there is some untouchable canon the series can never violate .
In fact , coming up with fresh ideas is how Final Fantasy has stayed afloat in a stagnating Japanese RPG market .
This version 's gimmick is that it pares down the gameplay to a few basic elements :
Turn - based battles against mobs of fantastic creatures and elaborate , movielike story sequences .
But this time , Square Enix finally threw the baby out with the bathwater :
The things that make RPGs feel so different from other games – the sense of a grand , nonlinear adventure and the rising and falling action of an open - ended world – are gone .
Final Fantasy XIII is n't an RPG ; it 's something less .
( Note : This review is based on 45 hours of play with the Japanese - language PlayStation 3 version of Final Fantasy XIII .
I played the first hour of the English - language PS3 version , but was not able to try the Xbox 360 version . )
In large part , Final Fantasy fans play the games for the stories .
These generally revolve around a ragtag group of misfits , living on the outskirts of an oppressive society , who level up until they are powerful enough to kill God – and usually have to before the end credits will roll .
XIII 's take on the formula is a story of two worlds : Cocoon and Pulse .
Cocoon is where all the good people live ;
Pulse is the freaky
Other world that everyone would rather not think about .
XIII 's story is good – a little more human and less esoteric than in previous games – but it's no Heavy Rain .
It 's still over - the - top and cartoony , more like an anime box set than a feature film .
The pleasure still comes largely from the design of the characters , the world and the legions of grotesque creatures that inhabit it .
It bursts with color and variety , taking you from gorgeous natural environments to futuristic cities .
The music , which has been a hallmark of the series since Day 1 , also excels .
Longtime composer Nobuo Uematsu may be long gone , but in his stead Masashi Hamauzu ( Unlimited SaGa ) turns in a score with catchy hooks and blood - pumping battle melodies .
Through a series of hilarious misunderstandings and machinations by Cocoon 's transparently evil theocracy , our six heroes all get marked as servants of Pulse .
Everybody on Cocoon freaks out , and the heroic half - dozen are branded enemies of the state , which means that they 're constantly fighting things everywhere they go .
And I mean everywhere .
Final Fantasy XIII is an almost entirely unbroken string of battles against mobs of monsters .
One of the reasons this is n't an RPG is that role - playing games have some degree of variety .
Previous games in the series , for all their differences , have been set in large , open - ended worlds that players can explore leisurely .
You could find new towns and locations on the map , talk to people , buy new equipment and spend time hanging around the town fighting low - level monsters to raise your stats before tackling the next big dungeon .
In contrast , XIII is all big dungeons .
The exit of each one is stitched directly onto the entrance of the next .
You can never slow down and take the game at your own pace ; it 's a constant rush forward , with no time to deliberate or relax .
This is the big mark in the loss column for Final Fantasy XIII , because the sense of rising and falling action , tension and release , is what made previous games in the genre uniquely enjoyable .
That 's why RPGs feel like epic journeys and not just really long videogames .
With the game design thus stripped down to a series of battles , the moment - to - moment action of the battle system – being the only meaningful interaction between the player and this game – must carry the player 's enjoyment all on its own .
And although it has some appealing features , on balance , it did n't do this for me .
Battles in Final Fantasy games are about picking actions off a menu and watching your characters execute them .
In XIII , you only directly control one character ; the others are run by the computer .
Besides this , the game begins no differently :
You select " Fight " from the menu and watch everybody go to town , using potions as necessary to bump your hit points back up .
But as the game goes on , it trickles new features in , slowly raising the complexity .
Soon , it 's not enough to merely reduce the enemy 's hit points ; you have to build up another , separate gauge and get the enemy into the " Stagger " state , where he lurches around and becomes especially vulnerable to attacks .
Once you 're comfortable with that , your characters can be assigned roles , which specialize in certain types of actions :
The medic can use healing magic , the saboteur can weaken the enemy 's defenses , etc .
It 's run -of - the - mill stuff for the series , but here 's the twist :
You can set up to six different combinations of roles before each battle , and in battle you switch between these combinations , which are called Paradigms .
Final Fantasy XIII 's battles are about considering not just the six individual roles , but the many different combinations of roles that you can assign to your three characters , and how they work together during battle .
You 'll take down a wide variety of crazy monsters on the surface of Gran Pulse .

Once the game gets to this fully operational status , the battles become much more interesting .
But it takes around 20 hours , prior to which the game is boring as hell .
Final Fantasy XIII ramps up achingly slowly , only giving you two characters at first , and limiting the roles and characters you can use .
For much of the time , you 're just watching the game play itself .
For the first half of the game , using the roles that you 've been given to obliterate anything that comes your way requires less strategy than beating a toddler at Connect Four .
This problem is exacerbated by the fact that Final Fantasy XIII is relentlessly linear .
I 've said this before , but it bears repeating : Many other RPGs are linear in the metaphorical sense , but the vast majority of this game is literally a straight line .
Like the internet , it is a series of tubes in which you run forward , forward , ever forward , fighting battle after battle , breaking only to watch the lavish story sequences .
There 's a single exception .
At about the 25 - hour mark , you finally descend into the world of Pulse .
Gran Pulse is a large open hub that breaks off into ... well , more tubes , little winding capillaries that spider out from the heart .
But the appeal of this area is less about the geography and more about what it represents – you can take a break from the story and undertake missions , which all involve killing some monster or another .
These let you build up your stats , encounter side stories and generally avoid having to push forward .
This area came just at the right time , because I was sick of being in the tube .
This was the most fun I had with XIII .
But it 's too little and comes way too late :
There 's not that much to do , because the missions just make you run back and forth across the plains killing monsters , and having to put up with all that bad level design just to get a little taste of ( relative ) freedom is the very definition of unbalanced .
Then , once you 're done having fun , it 's back in the tube till the end of the game .
In a way , Pulse feels vestigial , the remnant of an old game design that the XIII team wanted to ditch but could n't entirely .
For all the sacred cows that this game slaughters , it still clings to tons of almost - useless features .
You can ride Chocobos ( in one area , for a moment ) , you can use potions in battle ( though you never need to ) , there are shops ( that sell nothing essential ) , etc .
Taken together , these little bits of window dressing seem to be an apologetic gesture to series fans , little functionless adornments that remind one that this is still a Final Fantasy game .
But it 's missing the big stuff , and that 's more important : I do n't need Chocobos to be happy , but I do need more than this .
Japanese RPGs , on the whole , have significantly lost their shine over the last few years .
For all its flaws , Final Fantasy XIII has a certain level of polish that makes it more engaging than its peers , even if they hew closer to the old formula .
The fact that Final Fantasy designers are so willing to experiment is a good thing , because it'll keep the genre from dying off .
But Final Fantasy XIII should be considered a failed experiment .
We can only hope it's a stumble on the path to a brighter RPG future .
WIRED Beautiful graphics and music , lavish movie sequences , unique battle system .
TIRED
Takes way too long to ramp up , boring level design , monotonous pacing .

Jerusalem ( CNN ) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set up a team to investigate why officials announced new settlement construction in disputed territory while U.S. Vice President Joe Biden was visiting the country .
Netanyahu announced the probe Sunday after a meeting with ministers the day before .
" There was an unfortunate incident that was unintentional , and it was hurtful and surely should not have occurred , " Netanyahu said Sunday morning .
" We appointed a team that will find the chain of events in order to ensure procedures that make sure incidents like this do not happen in the future . "
The Israeli announcement of construction in East Jerusalem came during Biden 's visit last week .
It complicated U.S. efforts to set up so - called proximity talks between the Israelis and Palestinians , the latest attempt to nudge the two sides back toward talking directly .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the timing of the announcement " insulting " to the United States .
The construction , announced Tuesday , will be in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood , located in largely Arab East Jerusalem .
Planning of the building project has taken several years and final approval wo n't come for more than a year , Netanyahu 's office said , and actual construction is likely to take several more years .
U.S. President Barack Obama 's top adviser echoed Clinton 's comments on the issue , calling the Israeli move an " affront " and an " insult . "
" What it did was it made more difficult a very difficult process , " David Axelrod told ABC's " This Week . "
" We 've just gotten proximity , so - called proximity talks , going between the Palestinians and the Israelis , and this seemed calculated to undermine that . "
Axelrod said Israel is a " strong and special ally " and for that reason , " this was not the right way to behave . "
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs called Netanyahu 's expression of regret " a good start " in resolving the issue .
" I think what would be an even better start is coming to the table with constructive ideas for constructive and trustful dialogue about moving the peace process forward , " Gibbs told " Fox News Sunday . "
Gibbs added , " There 's no doubt that that was not a bright spot for the Israeli government . "
Biden arrived in Israel on Monday , meeting first with Israeli President Shimon Peres at his official residence in Jerusalem and then with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
Biden emphasized the close relationship between the United States and Israel as he met with Israeli leaders Tuesday , a visit that also touched on relations with the Palestinians and Iran .
However , later Tuesday , after getting word of the settlement announcement , Biden said the United States condemned Israel 's decision to build the 1,600 housing units in the Jerusalem neighborhood , calling it " a step that undermines the trust we need right now . "
The Israeli Interior Ministry said the construction plan was approved by a district committee , and the public can express objections to it over the next 60 days .
" I mean it was just really a very unfortunate and difficult moment for everyone -- the United States , our vice president who had gone to reassert our strong support for Israeli security -- and I regret deeply that that occurred and made that known , " Clinton said Friday .
Clinton added that she has no reason to believe that Netanyahu knew about the announcement during Biden 's visit , but added , " He is the prime minister .
Like the president or secretary of state ... ultimately , you are responsible . "
The controversy over Israel 's announcement came just a day after George Mitchell , the Obama administration 's special envoy for Middle East peace , announced that Israeli and Palestinian leaders had accepted indirect talks .
Mitchell said Monday that the two sides , with him acting as intermediary , had begun to discuss the " structure and scope " of the talks .
" I will return to the region next week to continue our discussions , " Mitchell said .
" As we 've said many times , we hope that these will lead to direct negotiations as soon as possible . "
Negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis have been stalled for more than a year , despite the Obama administration 's attempt to move toward a resolution of the decades - old Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Under current agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority , Israel maintains full control over the West Bank and its borders , while the Palestinian government oversees administration of major population centers .
CNN 's Shira Medding contributed to this report .
It can also be disclosed that the commissioner has held a series of private meetings with the Treasury and has agreed for much of the paperwork to remain hidden from the public .
The Treasury was allowed to review the decision notice when it was in draft form – and may have been permitted to make numerous changes .

Advertisement The Egyptian " boy king " Tutankhamun may well have died of malaria after the disease ravaged a body crippled by a rare bone disorder , experts say .
The findings could lay to rest conspiracy theories of murder .
The scientists in Egypt spent the last two years scrutinising the mummified remains of the 19 - year old pharaoh to extract his blood and DNA .
This revealed traces of the malaria parasite in his blood , the Journal of the American Medical Association says .
Shrouded in mystery Ever since Howard Carter 's discovery of Tutankhamun 's intact tomb in the Valley of the Kings in 1922 , scholars have speculated over why the 19 - year old ' boy king ' died so young .
Some believe he was killed by a fall from his chariot .
Others suspect foul play .
A sudden leg fracture possibly introduced by a fall might have resulted in a life - threatening condition when a malaria infection occurred
Dr Hawass
Because he died so young , and left no heirs , scholars have speculated that , instead , he may have suffered from a disease that ran in his family .
Artifacts have shown the royalty of that era as having a somewhat curvaceous and rather feminine appearance , which some say would be typical of inherited conditions like Marfan syndrome .
But Egypt 's chief archaeologist Dr Zahi Hawass rejects these explanations .
He and his team have painstakingly picked over the remains of Tutankhamun and 10 other royal mummies from his family - two of which they have now confirmed using genetic fingerprinting to be the young king 's grandmother and most probably his father .
They say there is no compelling evidence to suggest King
Tut or indeed any of his royal ancestors had Marfan 's - the voluptuous artefacts , they believe , are a red herring and merely reflect the fashion of the time .
But they did confirm that the king may have had some form of inherited disease , a rare bone disorder affecting the foot called Kohler disease II , as well as a club foot and a curvature of the spine .
Scientific ' proof '
Although this was not his ultimate downfall , it would explain why among his possessions there were sticks and staves that could have been used as walking canes , say the researchers .
Not long before his death , the king fractured his leg , and the scientists think this was important .
The bone did not heal properly and began to die .
This would have left the young king frail and susceptible to infection .
What finished him off , they believe , was a bout of malaria on top of his general ill health .
His is not a beautifully preserved mummy .
It 's a charred wreck .
Hawass and his team have been incredibly clever and lucky to do this
Dr Bob Connolly , who has studied King Tut 's remains
The scientists found traces of the malaria parasite in the pharaoh 's blood - the oldest mummified genetic proof for malaria in ancient populations that we have .
Dr Hawass and his team say : " A sudden leg fracture possibly introduced by a fall might have resulted in a life - threatening condition when a malaria infection occurred .
" Seeds , fruits and leaves found in the tomb , and possibly used as medical treatment , support this diagnosis . "
Dr Bob Connolly , a senior lecturer in physical anthropology at Liverpool University , has examined Tutankhamun himself .
He said the researchers had been incredibly lucky to be able to extract the DNA for study .
" His is not a beautifully preserved mummy .
It 's a charred wreck .
Hawass and his team have been incredibly clever and lucky to do this . "
He said it was possible that the king died from malaria , but he personally doubted it .
" Just because he had the parasite in his blood does not necessarily mean he suffered from malaria or died from it .
It may not have caused him any trouble . "
" I still think he died from a fall from his chariot .
His chest cavity was also caved in and he had broken ribs . "

[ N] obody lasts in office forever , no congressional majority lasts forever , and no party controls the White House forever .
But the measure of a political coalition is n’t how long it lasted , but what it achieved .
From the tone of a lot of present - day political commentary you ’d think that the big mistake Lyndon Johnson made during his tenure in the White House was that by passing the Civil Rights
Act he wound up damaging the Democratic Party politically by opening the South up to the GOP .
Back on planet normal , that ’s the crowning achievement of his presidency .
Green Roof Design |
While the practice of building green roofs is centuries old , it has experienced a renaissance as the structural philosophy of the future .
A living green roof reduces the costs of heating and cooling , encourages the local wildlife and naturally filters the rain water it receives .
Here , we celebrate the work of some of today ’s most talented , most progressive architects , who have adopted green roof design techniques to yield beautiful , sustainable works of architecture .
Villa Bio by Enric Ruiz - Geli
The green roof design of Villa Bio stands out amongst a community of cookie - cutter , Mediterranean - style homes in Llers , Spain .
While it was first met with controversy , the completed Villa Bio reflects the nature of the local landscape much more intimately than its neighbors .
That nature does not end at the corner of its plot , but continues on to the home ’s hydroponic garden that snakes along its green roof .
Architect Enric Ruiz - Geli has masterfully designed a home with a seamless connection with the Mediterranean environment , an organically - inspired structure with a lush , productive green roof .

Mill Valley Residence by McGlashan Architecture
This terraced , multi-family home in Mill Valley , California is as hilly and green as the environment around it .
The Mill Valley Residence by McGlashan Architecture includes three sections , each with its own green roof , built into the hill of the lot .
The green roof design of the Mill Valley Residence may not produce vegetation of the garden variety , but plants that hail from the home ’s local flora .
The result is a stunning home with a green roof that reduces heating and cooling costs and stimulates the habitat of local Mill Valley wildlife .

Mountain Dwellings by BIG Architects
The Mountain Dwellings by BIG Architects features a green roof design on a grand scale .
The Mountain Dwellings comprise 80 single - family units , each with its own private “ back yard ” , a green roof over the unit below .
Due to the sloping nature of the structure , each green roof deck is out of view of the unit below and above it , with privacy fences separating the units side - by - side .
The Mountain Dwellings of Copenhagen provide city living and the back yard feel of suburban life , thanks to a brilliant green design by BIG Architects .
[ we first featured the Mountain Dwellings in our feature on Housing Design , one you should definitely check out ]

Paraty House by Marcio Kogan Architects
It is no coincidence that one of TheCoolist ’s favorite works of architecture features a green roof as its crown .
The Paraty House by Marcio Kogan Architects is a sprawling tropical retreat , fully immersed in the vibrant nature of island life .
Once its occupants arrive by boat , taking frequent trips back for groceries is n’t on the menu .
Instead , its inhabitants tend to a large , well - stocked vegetable garden over its top floor .
This green roof provides the herbs and veggies needed to compliment the freshly caught seafood just steps away from Paraty House ’s magnificent deck .

Green Technology Showroom by Vector Architects
The benefits of green roof design and other green technologies are not always apparent .
To help communicate their values to the public , the Green Technology Showroom by Vector Architects is an example in eco success .
The Green Technology Showroom in Beijing , China is blanketed in thick , climate - controlling grasses attached to an inner steel skeleton .
It now stands in a residential development , a temporary symbol of sustainable design .

California Academy of Sciences by Renzo Piano
The California Academy of Sciences by Renzo Piano is a stunning achievement in green roof design .
Such structures are no stranger to Italian architect Renzo Piano , who designed a long time favorite of TheCoolist , the Vulcano Buono in Nola , Italy .
The CAS building in San Francisco , California features a 2.5 acre green roof that is blanketed by local plants , acting as a habitat for bay area wildlife .
Within , the CAS features a planetarium , an aquarium and a man -made rain forest , all three of which rest right under the dome sections of this amazing green roof .

OS House by NOLASTER Architects
The harsh coastal winds of Santander , Spain can make enjoying this rocky shore quite difficult .
Where most houses in this stretch focus back inland , the OS House by NOLASTER Architects is centered around the water below .
It is built in a low - profile fashion that merges with the plot ’s topography , as well as continuing the foliage around it with a full - size green roof .
Unlike many others on this list , the green roof design of OS House is habitable , a soft , grassy bed on which to enjoy the coastal nature of Spain ’s north shore .

Historial de la Vendée by PLAN01
When it comes to blending in with the landscape , few buildings are a greater success than Historial de la Vendée by PLAN01 Architects .
PLAN01 has created a geometric , softly - pitched structure lined with a lush green roof .
From a distance , this green roof looks nearly indistinguishable from the land around it , just a collection of hills in a field in France .
A closer inspection reveals a truly stunning building , one of the most visually natural green roof designs today .

OUTrial House by KWK Promes
The plot for this amazing green roof home called for a rather specific characteristic– a field clearing within a forest .
The OUTrial House by KWK Promes appears to have been excavated right out of the rolling Polish countryside , then covered over with the very grass it broke to be constructed .
The smooth curves and shaggy grass roof give this home a dreamy appeal , as if it were inspired only by childhood wonder and imagination .

The public is angry .
Why should the public pay for the bankers mistakes .
Iceland blogger Halldor Sigurdsson
Who cleans up the mess when ignorant , greedy bankers rack up massive debt then go broke ?
The people of Iceland made a strong statement Saturday .
The sins of big bankers and government regulators should n't fall on the citizens .
By a 93 % to 2 % margin , they voted down a proposal requiring them to cover bad debt incurred by one of the nation ’s oldest and largest banks .
Covering the debt would have cost Iceland 's 317,000 citizens around $ 17,000 each .
Iceland 's national referendum was the first opportunity for the people of any nation to vote directly on who pays when the financial elite fail .
As citizens voted , Iceland 's Prime Minister was dismissing the importance of the vote and promising to negotiate a payment scheme obligating citizen subsidies for bad debt created by Iceland 's beyond - bad bankers .
Icelanders are struggling with a collapsed economy .
Businesses are failing at a startling rate , unemployment is soaring , and the prospects for the future are simply not there .
Yet the British and Dutch governments demand that their swindled citizens receive compensation from beleaguered Icelanders .
Where were the British and Dutch central banks and politicians while their citizens were being fleeced ?
Are n't the rulers of these countries aware that the failed Icelandic bank was owned by wealth investors , not the citizens ?
Iceland 's size and the very dire circumstances offer a focused preview for citizens around the world .
The banks make bad deal after bad deal .
When they 're about to fail , the government steps in with a taxpayer bailout .
It does n't matter which faction of the narrow political spectrum is in charge .
The message is starkly clear -- when the banks fail , you pay .
The solution is presented to citizens as a fait accompli , a mandatory submission to indefinite financial slavery for the benefit of the failed financial elite .
The will of the people does n't matter even when there 's a direct vote .
The failed financial enterprises that control global commerce are opening their new show on the road in Iceland .
Greek citizens are next in line for indentured servitude , thanks to their lying leaders and Wall Street 's Goldman Sachs .
Citizens in the United States remain overwhelmingly opposed to bailouts for Wall Street and big banks .
Like Iceland 's Prime Minister , members of Congress and the president do n’t care .
Big banks have now received at least $ 12 trillion in credit and cash from the US Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank .
The 17 million citizens out of work , their families , and the eight million forced to work reduced hours are barely mentioned and get just a pittance compared to the ultra wealthy bankers .
How did the financial elite and their political minions do it in Iceland ?
The lesson is instructive .
Tiny Iceland 's Bankers Fool British and Dutch Regulators
Iceland 's second largest bank wanted some new customers .
In 2006 , the bank created the Icesave banking service .
For the British market , Icesave pushed high fixed interest rates and easy access to online banking .
The Netherlands sales pitch was based on banking transparency , seeing how the bank functioned online , with a 5 % interest rate on deposits .
British regulators voiced no major problem with Icesave 's policies until the bank collapsed in October 2008 .
The Netherlands central bank ( just now in a liquidity crisis ) gave its stamp of approval to Icesave even though there were substantial warning signs that the bank was in trouble .
By the time Icesave was insolvent , its 300,000 British depositors and over 100,000 in the Netherlands saw their money vanish .
The finger pointing began .
The Dutch central bank claimed Iceland 's regulators lied to them .
British regulators were shocked at the disarray of Iceland 's banking system .
Dutch and British regulators failed to mention that they 'd outsourced regulation for their citizens to tiny Iceland 's central bank .
These financially savvy nations could n't be bothered with their own people until the Icesave scheme did its damage .
Dutch and British political leaders somehow forgot to mention that Sweden and Norway insured the deposits of their citizens when another Icelandic bank failed in those countries .
Icelanders Stuck with the Bill
Icesave 's failed business tactics , negligent regulation by Iceland 's government , and indifferent British and Dutch authorities created the problem .
But citizens are taking the fall .
The usual suspect , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , offered up billions in cash in return for covering the lost deposits for British and Dutch citizens .
IMF backed off of this position as it became clear that Icelanders would reject the March 6 referendum .

Ultimately , the financial machinations by international bankers and G - 20 leaders do n't matter .
The people of Iceland are in no position to pay the bill .
Pretending otherwise only prolongs the charade of some order for the comatose global financial system .
Who benefits ?
The financial elite who continue to accumulate more and more money as though it 's actually worth something .
Furious Citizens - Bloggers Wo n't Give Up
Icelanders take their voting seriously .
Turnout is usually above 80 % .
But the turnout for this referendum was 57 % , the lowest figure in years .
The very good news is that Icelanders are providing real analysis and hitting the streets on a regular basis to protest the big con pulled by their leaders and financial elite .
This is a sample of the vibrant dialog of the people who choose to fight back .
Independent Icelandic News - The Icesave Fraud Case
" The public was deliberately lied to and the deception was complete .
The banks fell , the Brits and Dutch , and Germans too are pissed off and we Icelanders have to loose our savings , our homes , our jobs , our dignity .
We also have to pay for the Germans , the Dutch and the Brits .
" We are only starting to ' feel the cold dead hand of the neoconservatist financial free market monster ' that tore through the world and is still squeezing the Icelandic nation , even after its death .
We do n’t get a recession , we get a complete collapse . "

Economic Disaster Area - Arrogant , Humiliating , Short Sighted , and Stupid
" Right now the nation is numb .
Everyone is waiting for something while trying to stay afloat .
Businesses and individuals who have been watching their cash fly out the window atop exorbitant interest rates for years are experiencing a drowning feeling .
It seems like many are just shutting their eyes and resigning their fate to fate itself while still waiting for rescue to appear somewhere on the horizon .
" Most people agree that something must be done .
They just cannot agree on what exactly . "

The Iceland Weather Report - Johanna ( Iceland 's Prime Minister ) sends a clear message
" As if the government was n’t in enough trouble with public opinion here at home , Prime Minister Johanna Sigurðardóttir has publicly announced that she plans to shun the referendum tomorrow .
' To me it is pointless and I find it is very sad that the first referendum since the founding of the republic revolves around legislation that is already obsolete .
Consequently I see no point in taking part in this referendum , ' ( said Iceland 's Prime Minister ) .

" According to numbers , 1.5 % percent have said yes to the agreement to pay Icesave , but 93.6 say not to that .
But this does not change anything .
The Prime minister and finance minister say that there is a new deal on the table .
Iceland 's President says that a Referendum makes the democracy stronger .
The outcome of the referendum does not have any affect on the government in Iceland . "

Economic Disaster Area - National Referendum - A Sad Day for Democracy in Iceland
" Tomorrow is the first national referendum Icelandic citizens have been allowed to participate in by the political elite since the conception of the republic in 1944 .
By all measures , this should be a happy day for democracy in Iceland .
" But instead it is not a cause for celebration but a large milestone in the farcical power play which has taken place between the four largest political movements in Iceland since 1944 .
" Yes , a farce .
’Is n‘t that what this whole thing really is ' , asked a Dutch journalist yesterday after surveying the scene ?
It is a sad day . '

The Agonist
New Yorkers are rightly alarmed at the ease with which an inspector who was licensed to test buildings and construction sites for lead or asbestos risks got away with filing hundreds of false reports for at least a decade .
The Bloomberg administration says reforms that were already in progress when the deception was uncovered will make it less likely to happen in the future .
But the jaw - dropping scope of the fraud carried out by just one inspector raises legitimate concerns about city oversight .
It also raises the possibility of collusion between builders and property owners and the inspectors they hire to perform legally required safety tests .
The inspector , Saverio Todaro , who was at one point certified by city , state and federal agencies , operated a company through which he claimed to perform environmental inspection and testing services , including lead clearance testing , asbestos air monitoring and asbestos inspection in the New York City area .
Favorable reports allow property owners to certify that their apartments presented no lead risks to young children or that proposed demolition projects would be asbestos - free .
That means they do not require special filings with the city or costly abatement efforts .
As William K. Rashbaum reported in The Times on Tuesday , Mr. Todaro submitted results for more than 200 buildings and apartments , including some renovated for the city ’s affordable housing initiative , without performing a single test .
DUBAI , United Arab Emirates - A Saudi woman who filed harassment claims in Saudi Arabia without being accompanied by a male relative has been sentenced to 300 lashes and 18 months in jail , Human Rights Watch said .
Sawsan Salim lodged a series of complaints in 2007 at government offices and in court in the northern region of Qasim in which she accused local officials of harassment , the rights group based in New York said .
She was sentenced in January on charges of making “ spurious complaints ’’ against government officials and appearing without a male guardian , the group said in an e-mailed statement received yesterday .
“ In Saudi Arabia , being a woman going about her legitimate business without a man ’s protection is apparently a crime , ’’ Nadya Khalife , women ’s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch , said in the statement .
“ The government needs to free Sawsan Salim and keep its promise to end this discriminatory system . ’’
Saudi Arabia , which maintains a code of Islamic morals , said in June at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva that it would end the male - guardianship rule , said Human Rights Watch .
The system requires women to get permission from a male relative to go to classes , work , travel , open a bank account , or receive non-emergency medical care .

BUKAVU , Democratic Republic of Congo ( WOMENSENEWS )
–The streets here are usually a drab combination of dust and mud .
But on International Women ’s Day , which took place March 8 , they were awash in color as thousands of women , dressed in their finest , came to celebrate .
Although this place is often associated with the world ’s worst rape crisis , women throughout the east , especially in Bukavu and Goma–the provincial capitals of South and North Kivu–use the occasion to show they refuse to let victimization define them .
" I think there is great progress because women have proved that after so often being a victim , she can fight , " said Justine Masika Bihumba , coordinator of Synergy of Women Against Sexual Violence , a network of 35 women ’s organizations in North Kivu .
" She ’s found she can speak out against what ’s happened to her . "
On March 8 , the day started under a bright , hot sun as thousands of women converged on downtown Bukavu to celebrate International Women ’s Day , which marked its 100th anniversary of declaration this year .
Each group of women dressed in coordinated outfits of swirling , patterned purples , rose - pinks , burnt oranges , cabernet reds and cool shades of blue .
The women of the QG 10th military regimen of the Congolese army led the parade , still in their olive green uniforms .
Despite their uniforms , they sang and danced with the same spirit as the rest .
" We ’re soldiers , but we ’re women , " said Lt. Faida Katete .
" We are ready to gather strength with other women for the development and protection of women . "
Participants came from local organizations –including those representing soldier ’s wives , pygmies and advocates for rape victims –international nongovernmental groups and U.N. divisions .
They marched for peace , equality and an end to the rampant violence against women that has come to define the verdant eastern corner of this vast central African nation .
All the groups held signs bearing their names , some signs including anti-rape and anti-violence slogans .
Other women explained in interviews with Women ’s eNews their reasons for marching .
Marching in the Rain
Clouds formed several hours after the parade began , growing darker .
The rain poured down in a torrent , but most women continued to march , moving en masse down a street that became a milk - chocolate river .
They continued to keep pace with the steady beat of a horn orchestra .
After about an hour of unrelenting rain , the crowds began to disperse .
The event concluded by 3 p.m .
Christine Karumba , Congo country director for Washington , D.C. - based Women for Women International , said she prefers an event with specific outcomes .
This year , her organization met with Rwandan women in Goma , on the border between Rwanda and Congo , to stand together as examples of how women cross divides to end violence and encourage peace .
Congo and Rwanda were once at war .
Similar demonstrations of solidarity were held around the world , under the " Join me on the Bridge " campaign , organized by Women for Women .
Bukavu ’s women will gather again in October when the city hosts the culmination of the World March of Women .
Created in 2000 by women from Quebec , Canada , the event occurs every five years , said Josee Kusinza Nyenyezi , secretary for the coordination of the World March of Women for South Kivu .
The World March , whose secretariat is based in Sao Paolo , Brazil , was established to combat violence against women and the feminization of poverty , Nyenyezi said .
Nyenyezi believes it ’s good for women to take one day to exult .
" 8 March must also be an opportunity for people who cried much to rejoice , " she said .
Victims With Strength
Through roughly 14 years of brutal conflict in Congo , more than 5 million people have died and hundreds of thousands of women have been raped .
The United Nations Population Fund says more than 15,000 rapes were reported in 2009 , including 9,045 in the war - torn east .
Such statistics do not mean women here are disempowered , though , said Marianne Mollmann , women ’s rights advocacy director for Human Rights Watch , in a recent e-mail to Women ’s eNews .
" They are victims of horrible crimes , but not because they are weak , " she said .
" There are a myriad of reasons that compound each other that have to do with lack of infrastructure and support , impunity , myths about sexual violence as somehow giving the combatants more strength [ and ] sexual violence as a tool for submission of a population that is not , as a starting point , submissive . "
Banza Mbuyu , 27 , a former member of the Rally for Congolese Democracy , a Rwandan - and Ugandan - backed rebel group , marched with other female ex-combatants .
It was the first time such a group had joined the parade , said a staff member of CARITAS , a confederation of anti-poverty Catholic organizations that sponsored the group .
Mbuyu readily acknowledged that many Congolese women have suffered at the hands of armed militias .
" It is true what happened to them , " Mbuyu said .
" We have to apologize to them and then ask them not to stop struggling .
But now we have to struggle together . "
Parade organizers could not provide an estimate of the number of marchers , but it was a typically strong showing for a city with numerous local women ’s groups and a tradition of strong civil society .
Several activists said the number of activist groups in the city easily numbers in the hundreds .
More Women Speaking Out
Josephine Kavira Malimukono , coordinator of the League for Congolese Solidarity , a Goma - based group that fights for women ’s rights , said more and more women have spoken out against violations of their rights as the country ’s crisis climaxed in the last 10 years .
She also said women ’s groups are increasingly working together .
She cited in particular the Collective of Women ’s Associations for Development , a group of 23 organizations , including her own , that meets monthly in Goma .
Annie Bukaraba is Congo coordinator in the Great Lakes Program of International Alert , a London - based peace advocacy group that supports women ’s political participation .
The women ’s movement in South Kivu is one of her areas of expertise .
" The women are strong , they have power .
The law on gender parity in the constitution comes from their struggle , " she said of Amendment 14 , which requires that women have 50 percent representation in public institutions .
" They had men as allies , but the initiative came from women . "
The country , however , has no mechanism to implement the amendment and only 8 percent of the National Assembly is female .
Bukaraba said the election law is discriminatory for not requiring political parties to submit candidate lists that are 50 percent female , though they are supposed to .
Mathilde Muhindo Mwamini , president of the director ’s committee for the Caucus of Women for Peace in South Kivu , a group that supports women ’s political participation , said , however , that once women are elected or appointed ( as with most provincial political posts , since there have not yet been local elections ) they often represent the interests of their political party more than those of women at the grassroots .
" We still have to work hard for political cohesion , " she said .

At least 13 people were killed Saturday , some of them beheaded , around the popular beach resort of Acapulco , just as foreign visitors have begun arriving for spring break .
Elsewhere in the Guerrero state where Acapulco is located , 11 other people , including soldiers and suspected traffickers , were killed , authorities said .
The dead in Acapulco included five police officers , authorities said , who were ambushed while on patrol on the city ’s outskirts about 2 a.m .
Over the next four hours , the bullet - riddled bodies of eight men were discovered in three locations , police said .
Four had been beheaded , in the style typical of drug traffickers who have been at war with one another and with government forces for three years .

The government is especially sensitive to reports of drug - war violence in tourist destinations such as Acapulco and Cancun .
But no region is immune .
Guerrero state is one of Mexico ’s most violent :
Its position on the Pacific coast makes it a prime transit route for smuggling narcotics to the U.S. and coveted turf for warring cartels .
In June , as Acapulco was putting its hopes on a recovering tourist industry , 18 gunmen and soldiers were killed in battles one weekend in one of the city ’s seaside neighborhoods .
News channels have been showing video of young U.S. , Canadian and European tourists already frolicking on the beaches of Acapulco , as if to say “ maybe this year ” and convey a sense of normality .
And this weekend is a holiday ; thousands of Mexican tourists were headed to Acapulco to take advantage of a three - day weekend marking the birthday of 19th century President Benito Juarez .
Heriberto Salinas
Altes , head of public security for Guerrero , said authorities were expecting an increase in violence because of newly exploded power struggles among drug gangs .

“ We wish to say that security for visitors [ to Acapulco ] as well as for people who live here is guaranteed , ” Salinas told La Jornada newspaper .
More than 18,000 people have been killed in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon deployed the army to battle cartels in December 2006 .

Paper co-authored by E O Wilson calls for thousands of scientists to collect information on 160,000 species deemed representative of life on Earth
An ambitious project to create a " barometer of life " to track the changing fortunes of the natural world will be set out tomorrow by some of the world 's leading ecologists .
The plan is for thousands of scientists to collect information on 160,000 of the world 's nearly 2 million known species - from great mammals , fish and birds to obscure insects and fungi - chosen to be representative of life on Earth .
The index would more than triple the scope of what is alreadythe world 's biggest scheme - the " red list " of extinct and endangered species published by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature 's ( IUCN ) - and would be updated every five years .
The cost of building the database would be about US $ 60 m ( £ 39.3 m ) , but this would be " one of the best investments for the good of humanity , " says the proposal , published in the journal Science and co-authored by the great American ecologist and writer Prof Edward O Wilson at Harvard University .
" The more we learn about indicator species ( which can provide information on the quality of the environment around them ) , the more we know about the status of the living environment that sustains us all , " said Wilson .
" Threatened species , in particular , need to be targeted to enable better conservation and policy decisions . "
The figures could be used to help companies carry out environmental impact assessments , allow national and international organisations to prioritise spending , and draw public attention to problems as a way of building support for policies to protect and improve biodiversity , said Simon Stuart , chair of the IUCN 's species survival commission , and the paper 's lead author .
" Just think of the other uses $ 60 m are put to by the world , and the amount of money spent on wars or banks , or advertising , " Stuart told the Guardian .
" We can put our hands on our hearts and say this would be better for the good of humanity .
First of all it's an indicator of the health of the planet .
Secondly in many parts of the world people depend on biodiversity for food or clean water or living wages .
Thirdly I 'd say because of their intrinsic value : there 's something inspirational about ecosystems and species being in good shape , and the diversity of it . "
The idea – informally titled the " barometer of life " – is supported by the IUCN and nine partner organisations , including Kew Gardens in London , and the Zoological Society of London .
The IUCN 's red list has so far assessed more than 47,000 species , but is heavily biased towards a few groups of animals – mammals , birds and amphibians – and does not adequately represent the whole of life on Earth , says the paper .
Only half of all vertebrates and " an extremely small proportion " of plants , invertebrates , fungi and other groups like seaweeds have been assessed , and species from marine , freshwater and arid environments are also " poorly covered " , said Stuart .
" There are good reasons for believing you are going to get different results in different groups , which is why we have got to extend what we have got already , " he added .
Using the hundreds of experts in the partner groups , and guidelines set down by the IUCN , Stuart estimates the first barometer could be published five years after receiving funding – probably from a private source .
After that it could be updated every five years , for an annual cost of – at a " guess " - $ 5 m , said Stuart , little more than is spent on the red list by global governments .
The headline figure for all life on Earth could be modelled on the IUCN 's extinction risk rating of 0 - 1 , where 0 is all species in the group are extinct , and 1 means there are no threats .
In addition , the index could be broken down by region , species group , and by type of threat , said Stuart .
The 160,000 species proposed is a " provisional " figure , and includes almost all the nearly 65,000 species of vertebrates , and representative samples from the other groups .
The scheme is being proposed to mark the International Year of Biodiversity in 2010 .
Scientists have so far described 1.9 million of the estimated up to 10 million species of vertebrates , invertebrates , plants , fungi and other groups on Earth , and possibly tens of millions more bacteria and archeans .

Die Bürgerrechtsorganisation La Quadrature du
Net hat einen vergleichsweise aktuellen Entwurf des geplanten Anti-Piraterie - Abkommen ACTA im Internet veröffentlicht und damit den Druck auf die Verhandlungspartner erhöht , ihre Geheimniskrämerei aufzugeben und ihrerseits den jüngsten Stand des Texts offiziell herauszugeben .
Der " konsolidierte Text " aus EU - Kreisen vom 18 .
Januar bestätigt zum einen mit seinen 54 Seiten viele Kernpunkte der bereits erfolgten Teilenthüllungen über das Vorhaben .
Zum anderen zeigt er , dass die beteiligten Industrienationen und Schwellenländer offenbar auch nach monatelangen Auseinandersetzungen noch über viele Punkte und Detailformulierungen streiten .
Mit dem Papier werden zunächst die grundsätzlichen Themenbereiche deutlich .
So wird im ersten Teil der generelle Rahmen für die angestrebte Vereinbarung zur besseren Durchsetzung der Rechte an immateriellen Gütern abgesteckt .
Es soll demnach um die gesamte Bandbreite von Schutzrechten gehen , die vom Copyright und verwandten Rechten , über Markenzeichen und Patente bis hin zu Herkunftsangaben , Designmustern oder der speziellen Formgestaltung von Halbleitern reicht .
Die zivilgesellschaftliche Vereinigung Knowledge Ecology International moniert daher bereits den gewählten Titel " Anti Counterfeiting Trade Agreement " , da dieser zunächst nur ein Vorgehen gegen Marken - und Produktpiraterie nahelege .
Dies solle es Politikern offenbar einfacher machen , die Initiative zu verteidigen .
ACTA habe aber angesichts seiner Ausrichtung viel breitere Auswirkungen etwa auf den Zugang zu Wissen , Innovation , Verbraucherrechte oder Datenschutz .
Einzelne Kapitel beziehen sich unter anderem auf " Grenzmaßnahmen " .
Hier gibt es allein vier Versionen für die sogenannte " iPod - Klausel " , die Möglichkeiten der Beschlagnahme und Durchsuchung des Gepäcks von Reisenden regeln soll .
Wie der kanadische Rechtsprofessor Michael Geist herausgearbeitet hat , setzt sich die EU hier für eine vergleichsweise liberale Bestimmung ein .
Demnach sollen die Zöllner von weiteren Maßnahmen absehen , wenn ein Koffer oder eine Tasche Güter " nicht - gewerblicher Natur " im Rahmen der Schranken für den zollfreien Einkauf enthält und es keine Anzeichen dafür gibt , dass diese direkt in den Handel eingespeist werden .
Japan drängt dagegen darauf , nur die Mitnahme " kleiner Mengen " entsprechender Güter zu erlauben .
Die USA , Neuseeland und Kanada bevorzugen die nicht weniger präzise Formulierung " für den persönlichen Gebrauch " bestimmter Waren .
Andere Abschnitte beziehen sich auf ein Kontrollgremium für die Durchführung der Regeln sowie konkrete Strafvorschriften und zivilrechtlichen Möglichkeiten zur Durchsetzung der Rechte an immateriellen Gütern .
Dabei taucht der bereits bekannt gewordene Ansatz aus dem sogenannten Internetkapitel auf , ein " Three Strikes " - Szenario durch die Hintertür einzuführen .
Zugangsanbieter sollen demnach im Kampf gegen illegale Filesharing - Aktivitäten und andere Rechtsverletzungen gewisse Maßnahmen ergreifen , damit sie Haftungsprivilegien genießen .
Als Beispiel werden ausdrücklich Modelle der " abgestuften Erwiderung " bis hin zu Netzsperren aufgeführt .
Generell sollen strafrechtliche Sanktionen bei allen Verstößen gegen Urheberrechte " im gewerblichen Ausmaß " greifen .
Zur Erläuterung heißt es , dass es sich um " bedeutsame , absichtliche " Verletzungen mit oder ohne direkte oder indirekte Gewinnabsicht handeln müsse .
Inwiefern illegale Filesharing - Aktivitäten oder Uploads nutzergenerierter Inhalte auf Web - 2.0 - Plattformen darunter fallen könnten , dürften dann die Gerichte zu klären haben .
La Quadrature du Net hat die EU - Abgeordneten inzwischen aufgefordert , nach ihrer Entschließung zur Einschränkung von ACTA und zur Offenlegung des gegenwärtigen Entwurfs bis zum 12 .
April durch die Unterzeichnung einer gezielten Erklärung noch deutlichere " rote Linien " für die weiteren Verhandlungen aufzuzeigen .
So müsse etwa das Recht auf faire Gerichtsverhandlungen vor Einschnitten in die Internetnutzung bewahrt und eine allgemeine Überwachung des Netzverkehrs verhindert werden .
Zahlreiche Vertreter der US - Unterhaltungsindustrie und von Urheberrechtsvertretungen haben US - Präsident Barack Obama dagegen für seine Unterstützung für das avisierte Abkommen Beifall gespendet , was das Büro des US - Handelsbeauftragten in einem Blogeintrag neben der voraussichtlichen Agenda für die nächste Verhandlungsrunde in Neuseeland dokumentiert hat .

A private company offering military support has expressed interest in working with the Icelandic government .
Many Icelanders are strongly opposed to the idea .
The company in question is known as ECA Program .
They are a private company that works in military training and support for governments around the world , and have most recently worked with India .
Their interest in Iceland is apparently strong enough to warrant the use of images from Keflavík – where the NATO base used to be located until it closed in 2006 – on their website .
They have already asked the Icelandic government if they can utilize the base for their private air force , and are willing to pay 200 billion ISK to do so .
However , the Campaign Against Militarism – in Icelandic group originally founded in opposition to the NATO base – is strongly against the idea .
They point out that the comany ’s background is shrouded in mystery , and that they amount to a mercenary group .
Furthermore , the company was denied operation permission in Canada .
Iceland , although a NATO country , does not have a military of its own .
In fact , the vast majority of Icelanders polled have expressed opposition to supporting military efforts in Iraq ,

Republican Tim James is running for governor of Alabama , and he hates foreign languages .
In this ad , he sneeringly announces , " This is Alabama .
We speak English .
If you want to live here , learn it . "
What a jerk .
Tim 's dad is former Alabama Gov. Fob James .
Yes , Fob .
They probably have no idea why that 's funny , because people who hate foreign languages tend not to have friends with foreign accents , who come from a recently - immigrated families , or are not white .

Without the ingenuity of America ’s brightest minds and the investment of U.S. taxpayer dollars , there would be no Internet , as we now know it today .
Now , the Obama administration has moved quietly to cede control of the Web from the United States to foreign powers .
Some background : The Internet came into being because of the genius work of Americans Dr.Robert E. Kahn and Dr. Vinton G. Cerf .
These men , while working for the Department of Defense in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in the early 1970s , conceived , designed , and implemented the idea of " open-architecture networking . "
This breakthrough in connectivity and networking was the birth of the Internet .
These two gentlemen had the vision and the brainpower to create a worldwide computer Internet communications network that forever changed the world and how we communicate in it .
They discovered that providing a person with a unique identifier ( TCP / IP ) that was able to be recognized and interact through a network of servers would allow users to communicate with others .
The servers woulduse a series of giant receivers to recognize the identifier and connect networks to networks , passing on information from computer to computer in a seamless real - time exchange of information .
This new process of communication became know as the " information super highway , " aka , the Internet .
Now for the bad news :
In an effort to show the world how inclusive , sharing , cooperative , and international America can be , the Obama administration set off on a plan to surrender control and key management of the Internet by the U.S. Department of Commerce and its agents .
The key to the control America has over the Internet is through the management of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) and the giant servers that service the Internet .
Domain names are managed through an entity named IANA , the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority .
The IANA , which operates on behalf of the U.S. Department of Commerce , is responsible for the global coordination of the DNS , IP addressing , and other Internet protocol resources .
In short , without an IP Address or other essential Internet protocols , a person or entity would not have access to the Internet .
For years , the international community has been pressuring the United States
to surrender its control and management of the Internet .
They want an international body such as the United Nations or even the International Telecommunications Union , ( an entity that coordinates international telephone communications ) , to manage all aspects of the Internet in behalf of all nations .
The argument advanced for those seeking international control of the Internet is that the Internet has become such a powerful , pervasive , and a dependent form of international communications , that it would be dangerous and inequitable for any one nation to control and manage it .
Just this past spring , within months of Obama 's taking office , his administration , through the Department of Commerce , agreed to relinquish some control over IANA and their governance .
The Obama administration has agreed to give greater representation to foreign companies and countries on IANA .
This amounts to one small step for internationalism and one giant leap for surrendering America 's control over an invention we have every right and responsibility to control and manage .
It is in America 's economic and national security interests not to relinquish any control .
We are responsible for the control , operation , and functionality of one of the modern world 's greatest inventions and most powerful communications network .
What better country to protect the Internet than the United States ?
We invented it , and we paid for the research and implementation that made it
possible .
We are the freest , most tolerant nation on earth , we believe in the
fundamental right of free speech , and we practice a free market of commerce and ideas .
America has always been against censorship and has shared its invention with the world without fee or unreasonable or arbitrary restriction .
The user fee to operate on the Internet is not one paid to the U.S. government ; a consumer pays it to private Internet companies , who provide access to the Internet through servers for their subscribers .
Look no further than China 's recent move against Google to censor the
Internet , and you can envision what can happen when other nations less free
than the United States seek to control the Internet beyond even their own borders .
America needs to wake up .
If we lose control over the management of the
Internet , we have given away one of our nation 's greatest assets with nothing
in return to show for it .
The Obama administration 's actions will set in motion a slow and complete takeover of the Internet by the United Nations or some other equally U.S. - hostile and unfriendly international body .
And once it is gone , it will be gone forever .
The surrender of the Internet will spell disaster for our nation , financially , as well as for safety , security and our standing as a great power that values freedom and the free exchange of ideas and information .
As far as I am concerned , America is still the last best hope for a more
peaceful and prosperous world and our president should not be looking for
ways to weaken us .
Rather , his job is to work to strengthen us and protect our nation 's greatest asset our people 's creativity and ingenuity .

My local repository of XCVB is in a transient broken state in the beginning of a big refactoring .
I 've decided that it was easier to declare it broken , then take each file one by one in order , update it , add tests to it , and declare it fixed before I get to the next one .
But more interestingly , in my next rewrite of XCVB , I want to make wider use of a functional programming style and functional datastructures .
However , I looked at the state of Common Lisp libraries , and could find precious little in terms of functional datastructures , except for FSet which comes with its own CL dialect which is more than I 'm ready to deal with , yet without the level of control I desire .
And thus I rolled my own implementation of balanced binary trees , and published it as part of lisp - interface - library ( formerly part of fare - utils ) .
Actually , I 'm so proud of the API I designed that I think it 's worth a minor article at a Lisp conference , or at the very least a Lightning talk or two at the Boston Lisp Meeting .
The general idea is to systematically use composable first - class " interface " objects to drive the choice of algorithms .
These interface objects are typically used as first argument to any generic function in the API .
Interfaces can easily share common sub- algorithms with interface inheritance and interface mixins .
Interfaces can have slots that contain other interfaces to which they delegate some subproblems , and functions can build first - class interfaces by composing simpler interfaces into more elaborate ones , yielding parametric polymorphism .
Going from binary - trees to balanced binary - trees is literally one defmethod away , plus a trivial helper and two trivial defclasses .
Very pleasant .
Algorithmic interfaces are decoupled from data structure constructors , and particularly from state management .
Indeed , I 'm mostly using constant algorithmic interfaces and pure functional datastructures .
This is also very pleasant , unlike the horrors of standard OO style that conflate independent concerns of algorithm selection , data - structure and state encapsulation .
A very same datastructure can be viewed in different lights by being passed to the same function with different interfaces , and this makes it very easy to compose interfaces .
For instance , a pure hash table is a balanced tree of buckets , each bucket holding one ( or at most a few ) entries the hash values of which collide .
This is trivially implemented by composing balanced trees and alists , so that the very same node can be viewed either as a hash - table of elements , or a tree of buckets .
Pure hash - table and alist interfaces are each parametrized by the interface that defines hash - function and equality on keys .
With this technique , you can have all the parametric polymorphism that Haskell type classes , ML functors , C++ templates , Java generic interfaces , PLT Scheme units , etc. , provide , except without the aggravation or limitations of any of them , plus it fits nicely into the native Lisp style , and it takes advantage of CLOS expressiveness and optimizations .
While I was at it , I also implemented Big-Endian Patricia Trees aka " fast mergeable integer maps " , with an additional obvious optimization for merging dense maps faster .
All my ventures with that interface passing style of programming were very pleasant .
And I did n't feel like using a monad to pass interfaces around .
For instance , given an interface i that implements some kind of pure functional maps , you can lookup a key k in a map m with ( lookup i m k ) independently from that map being a function , tree , a hash - table , a trie , or whatever clever thing the user came up with .
You can create interfaces from other interfaces , such as ( < alist > eq : < equal > ) which will create an interface for maps as association lists using equal as their equality predicate .
Interfaces can take functions , numbers , etc. , as parameters .
You can implement order domains as parametrized by a string - lessp - like comparison predicate or by a strcmp - like function .
You could have have n , m- Btrees , etc .
Note that " my " idea is not novel at all .
Haskell typically implements type classes exactly this way : see for instance Implementing Type Classes ( 1993 ) by John Peterson and Mark Jones .
Haskell has the advantage that it will automatically infer the type class for you and pass it around as an implicit argument .
In a dynamic language like Common Lisp , you have to explicitly pass the interface around , which on the one hand is cumbersome , but on the other , gives you more control : you can express parametric polymorphism , existential quantification , dependent types , and multiple ways to view a very same data structure as being an instance of the same interface protocol , which is especially great when bootstrapping elaborate versions of a protocol from simpler versions of the same ( as is done with hash - tables ) .
Of course , using Haskell , you could also go from one point of view to the other by wrapping objects inside view - specific constructors ; but then , if your algorithm switches point of view constantly as for a Necker Cube , you may waste a lot of space and possibly leak as you keep creating new wrapped objects ; whereas with a first - class interface separate from the data , you can just switch interface without consing .
You could probably bootstrap a nice object system this way on a language that does n't have objects , but using an existing object system to combine and compose interfaces actually helps a lot .
Note that such interface objects are a great target for partial evaluation , hot spot optimization , etc .
Happily , SBCL seems to be doing just that for you .
It 's amazing the things you can do with proper use of a λ!
DOUBT FORMULA
1 . I have informed myself , without bias or prejudice or rumor , concerning the actual intentions and activities of David Miscavige .
I found his intentions and activities to have resulted in great destruction and harm to the Church of Scientology , its staffs and parishioners , and to the legacy of tech left by LRH .
2 . I have examined the statistics of David Miscavige as Chairman of the Board and found that there are thousands of individuals directly and indirectly personally harmed by his actions of corrupting the Tech .
There are millions of beings on Earth who have had the benefits of LRH
Tech withheld from them as a result of DM ’s actions .
The repute of LRH , his legacy of tech and that of the C of S have been greatly harmed by his actions .
Hundreds of former org staff and SO Members have been driven off by his direct and indirect actions .
All the top leadership in the C of S has been undermined and perverted , they have been completely removed from the sight of Scientologists internationally , some have been physically and mentally harmed personally by dm and his minions .
The sane and workable ethics tech of LRH has been twisted and misused by dm and his minions to the detriment of individuals and their dynamics .
The C of S internationally has been virtually closed down with orgs empty , staff leaving or being kicked out and parishioners unjustly prevented from receiving the benefits of LRH Tech or given altered versions of LRH Tech .
He has diverted the LRH Purpose of Orgs to his personal purpose of making money , by almost any means , withheld funds that would have been used for good purposes , forced in actions on the staff and parishioners to buy huge and expensive real estate that lies empty and unused , causes staff to be grossly underpaid and ruined the financial repute of orgs through massive bills that cannot be paid and left the majority of parishioners in such bad financial shape that they cannot afford to do their Bridge .
He promised , but cannot deliver on , further OT Levels as a ruse to forward his personal agenda and has attempted to set himself up as equal to LRH and set his own policy and tech in the place of that of LRH .
All this has resulted in across the boards downtrending org stats internationally , which he lies about at international events .
One needs to only look to see the lies .
3 . I have decided , based on the above , that David Miscavige and all of his adherents should be removed from any and all positions of management , made to be legally responsible for all laws broken ( I.e. misuse of funds , abuse , human rights violations , etc ) , given a chance to redeem themselves or leave the church completely , as they choose .
4 . Me and my group are those who are loyal to LRH , work honestly and sincerely to keep his Tech pure and applied correctly and to do everything possible to make and keep the door wide open for people to avail themselves of LRH ’s Tech .
We do not want or demand beautiful , wasteful premises , but would follow LRH Financial Policies to build good , strong , viable and productive orgs with happy staff and public that are true Islands of Sanity in a troubled world .
5 . My stats as a Scn and staff member were thousands of public contacted , helped and moved onto service lines ; a disaster averted that would have caused great harm to orgs and public in Italy , created the first on - policy Dept 5 FSO , corrected injustices that resulted in staff and public moving and winning again , correct application of study and ethics tech to juniors that got them winning and productive .
My actions , added to the actions of my group , leads to thriving and productive orgs and staffs , delivering standard LRH Technology , which results in good repute for LRH and C of S. 6 .
I am remaining in the group of Scientologists who are loyal to LRH , who learn and use his Tech correctly , use their positions for the betterment of the group and mankind , not personal gain and who will do everything possible to remove anyone who actively works against LRH and this group .
I do not and will not have anything to do with David Miscavige or any of his personal sycophants and remove my support from any person or part of the C of S that allows him to have any control or power over the Technology of LRH , Scientologists , Sea Org Members or churches of Scientology .
7 . I am suffering up the conditions in the group of those Scientologists and friends who are actively working to shine the light of honesty and truth upon the true motives and products of dm , for the end product of getting him tried and prosecuted for crimes against humanity and violating the laws of the land by fraudulently taking the donations of parishioners for his own benefit .
We do this despite being shunned by family and other Scientologists .
In this way I am announcing that I am an Independent Scientologist removing my support in full from anything connected to David Miscavige and his minions .
Nothing in this can be construed to mean that I have any disagreements with LRH , any true LRH Technology be it Ethics , Tech or Admin .
I am a true friend of LRH , not a friend of dm who has been pretending to be a leader in Scientology when in fact he is a Suppressive Person intent upon destroying Scientology and perverting the writings of LRH .
He and his minions do not deserve my support and so I withdraw it by this announcement .

A memorabilia site says they will also contribute to the costs
Though his best friend Corey Feldman said Corey Haim died with little money to his name , the late actor ’s funeral expenses wo n’t fall to his mother .
Judy Haim , who is suffering from cancer , tells Access Hollywood that the city of Toronto will help her by covering the cost of Haim ’s funeral , which is set for Tuesday .
The late - actor was Canadian .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
In a statement released Sunday , the city of Toronto said it “ does not confirm or comment on any potential , pending or active applications for assistance in such matters .
Therefore , the City will not be commenting further on these reports . ”
Judy also says that Startifacts.com , a celebrity memorabilia site , offered to pay for her son ’s tombstone and other miscellaneous expenses .
It had not yet provided the funds .
A rep for the company said that it would offer $ 20,000 to the Haim family .
Though the actor had done several small film projects in the last year , friend Chance Corbitt , who first met Haim while filming The Lost Boys , said the actor often relied on personal appearances at conventions for income .
“ It was an easy way to pay the bills , ” says Corbitt .
“ He would do one of those conventions every other month . ”

Too much new software is vulnerable to the attack sequences of yesteryear .
This suggests a testing approach : a comprehensive set of known attack pattern sequences can be leveraged for use in targeted fuzzing when testing for exploitable conditions in new applications .
Fuzzdb is a comprehensive set of known attack pattern sequences , predictable locations , and error messages for intelligent brute force testing and exploit condition identification of web applications .
Many mechanisms of attack used to exploit different web server platforms and applications are triggered by particular meta-characters that are observed in more than one product security advisory .
fuzzdb is a database attack patterns known to have caused exploit conditions in the past , categorized by attack type , platform , and application .
Because of the popularity of a small number of server types , platforms , and package formats , resources such as logfiles and administrative directories are typically located in a small number of predictable locations .
A comprehensive database of these , sorted by platform type , makes brute force fuzz testing a scalpel - like approach .
Since system errors contain predictable strings , fuzzdb contains lists of error messages to be pattern matched against server output in order to aid detection software security defects .
Primary sources used for attack pattern research :
researching old web exploits for repeatable attack strings
scraping scanner patterns from http logs
various books , articles , blog posts , mailing list threads
patterns gleaned from other open source fuzzers and pentest tools

Two Buckets on a Mission to Reduce Malnutrition
A University of Utah study into the effects of mobile phone use on people 's driving skills has come to the expected conclusion that using a phone while driving can be highly dangerous .
Or at least that 's the case for most of us .
The study also made the entirely unexpected discovery that for one in 40 of us , there were no signs of impairment whatsoever .
University psychologists Jason Watson and David Strayer tested 200 subjects in two motorway driving simulation tests , one of which also involved having a hands - free mobile phone conversation that required them to memorise words and solve maths equations .
For the vast majority of the test subjects , the researchers recorded an average 20 per cent increase in braking response time , a 30 per cent increase in following distance , an 11 per cent drop in memory performance and a three per cent drop in the ability to do maths problems .
However , the five ' supertaskers ' not only showed no appreciable difference in following distance , braking time and maths ability , but remarkably they actually displayed a three per cent improvement to memory performance .
" According to cognitive theory , these individuals ought not to exist , " Watson says in a statement .
" Yet , clearly they do , so we use the ' supertasker ' term as a convenient way to describe their exceptional multitasking ability . "

Common sand and glass are both made primarily of silicon and oxygen , yet sand is opaque and glass is transparent .
Glass owes its transparency partly to the fact that it is not a typical solid .
On the molecular level , solids usually have a highly regular , three - dimensional crystalline structure ; the regularities distributed throughout the solid act as mirrors that scatter incoming light .
Glass , however , consists of molecules which , though relatively motionless like a typical solid , are not arranged in regular patterns and thus exhibit little scattering ; light passes directly through .
At a specific temperature , called the melting point , the intermolecular forces holding together the components of a typical solid can no longer maintain the regular structure , which then breaks down , and the material undergoes a phase transition from solid to liquid .
The phase transition in glass , however , depends on how quickly the glass is heated ( or how quickly it cools ) , due to its irregular solid structure .

April 22 , 2010 -- The Future on Fire -- A common chant around the world when people take to the streets against the crimes of the global capitalist system is : " This is what democracy looks like ! "
It is a statement that real democracy is on the streets , in the united action of ordinary people .
It is a statement that democracy is more than passive voting once every few years , it is popular power and direct participation .
April 13 , 2002 in Caracas , Venezuela , was the scene of a powerful expression of popular power .
The poor majority and much of the armed forces rose up and overthrew a coup - installed dictatorship that had attempted to remove the country 's elected president Hugo Chavez .
This mass mobilisation restored to Chavez to power .
In Caracas on April 13 , 2010 , a large demonstration occurred that gives further meaning to the slogan .
What occurred on the streets of Caracas that day was indeed what democracy looks like -- a march by tens of thousands of Venezuelan people organised in the Bolivarian militias .
There were battalions of workers , peasants , students , the urban poor organised in social missions -- all organised from the grassroots .
This was a dramatic demonstration of the " people in arms " .
This is a crucial part of democratising a society -- arming the masses and breaking the privileged castes ' hold over the potential for armed violence with their small , highly organised professional bodies , governed with tight discipline from the top down , in the interests of the powerful .
The monopoly over violence by the powerful gives them the permanent potential to terrorise the powerless .
A “ people in arms ” is a people you think twice before fucking with .
A people in arms cannot be easily subdued .
You only need to look at the brutal response by large landowners in Venezuela to the government 's land reform policy to see the significance of this question .
Since 2001 , more than 200 peasant activists have been murdered , without the existing institutions stopping the bloodshed .
No one has been brought to justice for these crimes .
Now , the peasants are being organised into armed detachments -- as peasant organisations themselves have been demanding .
Peasant battalion in the Bolivarian militia , April 13 , 2010 .
Organising the oppressed in such a way is a defensive measure to prevent the sort of coup that occurred in 2002 , in which more than 60 unarmed protesters were murdered on the streets and supporters of Chavez were hunted down .
It is also a preventative measure against a US invasion or a US - sponsored invasion by , for instance , neighbouring Colombia .
When the US imperialists and Chilean capitalists organised a military coup against the elected left - wing Chilean government of Salvador Allende in 1973 , a reign of terror was carried out with thousands slaughtered .
On the back of the mass slaughter of militant workers , vicious neoliberalism was imposed .
This bloody example showed the need to do just what is happening in Venezuela -- the arming of the people .
In Venezuela , there is a popular revolution that is still very much developing and seeking to advance .
Capital still holds much power .
It still controls significant sectors of the economy and has much power within the state .
The pro-poor policies of the Chavez government have helped raise the poor majority up and have begun to create alternative power structures .
But much of capital ’s economic power remains intact .
There are important steps forward in regaining sections of industry .
There are important experiments in popular power and ongoing attempts to strengthen these and create new institutions based directly on the organised people .
The most important are the communal councils and the communes ( based on elected representatives from the communal councils , which are also experimenting with creating a " communal economy " in which the communes take control of production and distribution in their areas ) .
The struggle to implement workers ' control , or other forms of workers ' participation in management , in important state industries is resulting in important steps forward .
This is a struggle to weaken and defeat the corrupt counter - revolutionary bureaucracy that still controls much of the state and sabotages the revolution 's plans .
But it is all partial and still in the realm of experiments to find a way forward .
There are important sectors of the broad - based Bolivarian movement that are hostile to serious attacks on capital and frustrate attempts to develop genuine popular power .
It is not possible to advance decisively without ongoing struggle within the Bolivarian movement .
An important battlefield of this internal class struggle is the United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) – the mass party led by Chavez that was formed in 2007 .
Will it be a revolutionary vehicle that organises the most conscious and militant sectors in the communities and workplaces to push the revolution forward ( as Chavez insists it must be ) ?
Or will it be dominated by more moderate , bureaucratic sectors as a vehicle for their interests , for advancement of individuals and competing power blocs fighting over the spoils of power ( as Chavez ’s old party , the MVR , was ) ?
This fight is occurring now .
The right - wing has a lot of organisational power within the PSUV , but the political initiative lies with Chavez , who pushes leftwards , towards strengthening the revolutionary pole .
At the founding PSUV congress in 2008 , right - wing sectors largely had organisational control .
These forces argued that the provisional PSUV program should limit itself to “ anti-imperialism ” rather than be explicitly anti-capitalist .
Delegates rejected this and adopted a draft program and declaration of principles that calls for a thorough - going socialist revolution – in Venezuela and the world .
The problem facing the Venezuelan revolution do not only come from above , but also from below -- in a related way .
In particular , a major block is the fact that the organised workers ' movement is too weak in Venezuela .
It is divided , organises too few of the working class and the level of political consciousness is too low .
This cannot be overcome by a government decree or a speech by Chavez .
It can only be overcome through the many struggles breaking out to advance the interests of the working class .
This weakness in the revolutionary movement makes it harder to push forward decisively .
Also , it leaves a vacuum within the Chavista movement that is filled by more right - wing and bureaucratic sectors .
But it is a live question , an ongoing struggle .
How can you develop the working class except through the direct involvement of the working class in all aspects of the struggle to transform society ?
This is the significance of the struggle for workers ' control -- and why it is resisted so fiercely by privileged bureaucrats .
It creates a school for workers to develop , learn and transform themselves from a passive and narrowly interested sector into active , organised , revolutionary actors .
The ongoing power of capital and bureaucratic sectors creates deep - going problems , with the government often unable to get its policies implemented .
There is economic sabotage by corrupt state managers and private capitalists .
This poses big struggles in the near future .
The Bolivarian militia is partial itself -- it is uneven .
Some communities and sectors are organised and others are n't .
It is still relatively new .
But the demonstration of April 13 is a very powerful one .
It shows the revolution is strengthening itself from the ground up .
It shows the growing power of the oppressed .
It sends a powerful message :
You do n't fuck with the Venezuelan people .
This is what democracy looks like .

Venezuela :
The people in arms
By Alan Woods , Caracas
April 13 , 2010 -- Eight years ago something occurred that has no precedent in the history of Latin America .
The reactionary coup of 11 April , in which the Venezuelan oligarchy , in collaboration with the US Embassy and the CIA , overthrew the democratically elected government , was defeated by a spontaneous uprising of the masses .
On that day history was made .
Ordinary men and women came onto the streets , risking their lives to defend the Bolivarian Revolution .
With no party , no leadership and no clear perspectives other than to defeat the coup , the workers , peasants , and revolutionary youth , women and men , young and old , marched in their thousands to the gates of the Miraflores Palace to demand the release of President Chávez .
The soldiers went over to the side of the people , and the coup collapsed .
These heroic events can only be compared to Barcelona in July 1936 , when the workers , armed with old hunting rifles , clubs and anything they could lay their hands on , stormed the barracks and smashed the fascist reactionaries .
If anybody doubts that this was a genuine revolution , they have only to study the events of April 2002 .
In past years these events have been turned into a celebration of the Revolution .
The Bolivar Avenue in downtown Caracas was a sea of red shirts and waving banners .
But this year the scene was quite different to what I remember .
Instead of a sea of red , Bolivar Avenue was filled to overflowing with a sea of camouflage green .
This was the Day of the People ’s Militia – a demonstration of the power of a people in arms .
The militias marching , April 13 .
As you walked along the Avenue the files of militiamen and militiawomen ( there were many women also in uniform ) seemed to have no end .
Here once again one could sense the unconquerable power of the masses .
But now there was a different element .
Here were thousands upon thousands of workers from the factories , peasants from the villages , and young kids from the schools and colleges , expressing their willingness to fight , arms in hand , to defend the Revolution against enemies – both external and internal .
Under a blazing sun , the people massed – the usual red shirts of the chavistas alongside the green - clad militia .
Along the Avenue the loudspeakers blared out revolutionary slogans : against imperialism , against the bourgeoisie , for the Revolution , for socialism , and for Chávez : “ The Right is still preparing another 11 April , but now the People have arms !
Long live the Bolivarian Revolution !
Long live the Armed People !
Long live President Chávez ! ”
People climbed trees and lampposts to get a better view and to display placards with militant slogans , while some made a quick profit selling hats , tee - shirts and cold drinks ( which were much in demand ) .
There was a deafening roar of music – Latin American rhythms with revolutionary words , interrupted by chants and slogans .
The militia was organized by groups that showed their origins : young teenagers from the schools and peasants with straw hats and tractors with Belarus written on the side .
To the rear , the militia was unarmed , but as one approached the head of the demonstration , everyone was holding a Russian - made AK - 47 , that most versatile and effective weapon , light and easy to use .
Students from the national armed forces university march with AK - 47s .
In recent years Chávez has bought large quantities of these weapons from Russia .
Washington and its hired media have made a tremendous fuss , alleging that these guns are destined for the FARC guerrillas in Colombia .
Now everyone can see what they are really intended for .
As they wait for the arrival of the President , the militias stand listlessly , or sit on the ground to eat a sandwich .
Some rest on their rifles , and one or two even had the muzzle of their AK - 47s resting on their boot – a somewhat risky practice , one would have thought .
In fact a professional drill sergeant would doubtless have a heart attack , looking at these half - trained civilians with guns .
Militia members relax with their guns .
But this impression would be entirely false .
These militias are the lineal descendants of the Cuban guerrillas , of the militias that fought Franco in the Spanish Civil War , of the workers ´ militias that overthrew the Tsar in Russia in 1917 , and if we go even further back in history , of the armies of the French Revolution and the militias of the American Revolution in the 18th century .
None of these were professional forces and they did not conform to the standards of a professional bourgeois standing army .
But they did not fight any the less well for that , and in more than one case ( Spain comes to mind ) the attempt to force them into the format of a professional army had the most negative effects on their fighting spirit .
Late in the afternoon , a mood of expectancy can be noticed .
The militia begins to form ranks .
The crowd on the pavements pushes forward to catch a glimpse of their hero .
Chávez appears , dressed in army uniform , riding on the back of an open vehicle – an ordinary army truck – saluting and waving to the militia and the crowd .
The militia marches forward towards the tribune where Chávez is to deliver his speech .
His speech was shorter than in the past , but went straight to the point .
Recalling the dramatic events of April 2002 , he pulls out a magnificent sword and shows it to the multitude .
It is the sword of Simon Bolivar – El Libertador ( The Liberator ) .
He tells the people that the liberation of Latin America has not been achieved for 200 years and can only be achieved through socialist revolution .
In the kind of dramatic gesture that is characteristic of him , he makes the people swear a sacred oath : that they will never rest until this task is accomplished .
The militias repeat the words loudly , holding their rifles in the air .
“ The militia is the People , and the People is the militia , ” he proclaims .
Then Chávez recounts the events of April 2002 , from the fascist coup of 11 April to the popular - military uprising of 13 April .
“ I have been thinking a lot about this , ” he says .
“ Ever since the 1970s , some people have been dreaming of a popular - military rebellion .
But it never occurred .
The 1980s was a black period that ended in the Caracazo of 1989 , with a massacre of unarmed civilians . ”
Chávez then recalled how he and a group of progressive army officers tried to stage a rebellion in 1992 : “ We failed because this was a military uprising without the People , ” he concluded .
After a spell in prison , he recalled the formation of a mass movement : the Bolivarian Movement , which swept to power in the 1998 elections .
But the oligarchy lost no time in preparing the coup of 2002 .
Chávez recalled the men and women who died in the coup , and the many more who were wounded .
Contrary to the myth so assiduously spread by the media in the West about the allegedly repressive and dictatorial regime in Venezuela , nobody is in prison for these crimes , and eight years later the judicial investigations are still dragging on : “ Let there be no impunity for this massacre , as there has been impunity for so many other massacres in our history ! ” he said .
He then went on to say that the blood of these martyrs of the Revolution acted as a spur to the Revolution .
“ Immediately after the 11 April there began the arrests and manhunts , the threats on television and the other media .
But this aroused all the latent pent - up power of the masses that had been suppressed for so long , ” he said .
“ This gave rise to the greatest rebellion in our history – the popular uprising we had waited so long to see . ”
“ This was an uprising against the bourgeoisie and imperialism .
But the latter had calculated that such an uprising would be put down in blood by the army , as happened in the Caracazo .
But our soldiers not only refused to fire on the People , but went over to the side of the People .
The bourgeoisie and the imperialists had the surprise of their lives . ”
Chávez pointed out that US imperialism was actively involved in the coup .
US helicopters and spy planes were flying over Venezuelan air space , a US submarine and an aircraft carrier were in Venezuelan waters waiting to intervene .
But the movement of the masses forced them to withdraw .
Ever since then the bourgeois media have tried to wipe that date out of the calendar , but the masses have kept it alive .
“ They cannot wipe April from the calendar , any more than they can wipe out January , February or any other month . ”
Chávez observed that , if they had succeeded in crushing the Venezuelan Revolution , it would have dealt a heavy blow against the revolutionary movement throughout Latin America .
“ On our shoulders a heavy responsibility lies , ” he said .
“ The peoples of Latin America are looking to us for their salvation . ”
Admitting that the Revolution was far from completed and that there was a colossal amount still to be done , he appealed for patience .
“ After its first decade , the Revolution has hardly begun , ” he said .
Chávez then warned that the threat of counterrevolution had not gone away , and that there were conspiracies to assassinate him .
He said that if this occurred : “ Do not lose your heads , keep calm .
You know what you have to do : take the power into your own hands – ALL the power !
Expropriate the banks , the industries , the monopolies that remain in the hands of the bourgeoisie . ”
Turning to the September elections he warned : “ We cannot allow the bourgeoisie to take control of the National Assembly .
If they do , they will use it to destabilize the country and create the conditions for another 11 April .
We must win two thirds of the seats in order to press on with our programme . ”
He warned the bourgeoisie that it was not possible to repeat what happened in April 2002 , because the people were now armed and would crush any counterrevolutionary attempt .
He finished with the words : Long live the National Militia ! ” Long live the People in Arms !
Long Live the Socialist Revolution !

The Charge of the Light Brigade happened during the Crimean War Ukrainian archaeologists say they have identified the remains of HMS Prince , a British naval vessel that sank off Balaclava during the Crimean War .
The sinking , with all 150 men on board , caused outrage not only for the human toll , but because thousands of badly needed winter uniforms were also lost .
The ship had not been found since it sank during a storm in November 1854 .
Other underwater expeditions have found parts of the ship , but it is the first positive identification .
According to Sergei Voronov , of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences , and the leader of the expedition , explorers discovered a plate fragment from the captain 's mess last summer .
After months of meticulous cleaning , the fragment revealed the name of the company which owned the Prince before it was hired by the Royal Navy : the General Screw Steam Shipping Company .
Cold and disease Now Mr Voronov and his colleagues are hoping to attract international interest to explore another ship which also sank during the Crimean War and is mostly intact .
The Prince was lost during a winter storm near the Crimean port city of Balaclava , during the historic siege of Sevastopol , which was part of the Russian Empire but is now located in Ukraine .
Its sinking unleashed an uproar in Britain , as troops were suffering from the extreme cold and widespread disease .
The Crimean War , which lasted from October 1853 to February 1856 , pitted Russia against Britain , France , the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Sardinia .
It was during the Crimean War , at the Battle of Balaclava , that the ill - fated Charge of the Light Brigade took place which led to the deaths of 272 British soldiers .
The Crimean War is sometimes called the first modern war , and was the first to incorporate the tactical use of railways and telegraph , and was captured extensively in photographs .

Mustache has been around for a little while now , but a thought occurred to me today when pengwynn on freenode mentioned it has it's own irc channel #{ .
Programmers are often tasked at explaining to people what they mean in code with their voice .
The normal nomenclature for { and } is " open - brace " , " close - brace " , or " open- curly " , " close - curly " .
From this day forth , I propose a new nomenclature .
From now on , it shall be known as " open- mustache " , " close - mustache . "
Let this day be known as Mustachio day !
Update :
An alternative nomenclature has also been proposed by rikarends on freenode : " openstache " , " closestache " .
This is also acceptable .
Update : I 've created some t- shirts to help spread the word , and help out organizations that do good things for free and open source software .

Violent attacks on election day did n't stop large numbers of Iraqis from successfully casting their votes in key parliamentary elections Sunday .
" Yes , we were scared after we heard these bombings , but we just had to come , " said a woman who identified herself only as Ghisoun .
Her two children were at her side .
" It 's an opportunity we can't miss -- not for us , but for our children , " she said .
Polls in Iraq to elect a 325 - member parliament closed Sunday evening , capping an electoral process in which militants intent on disrupting the vote carried out dozens of attacks that killed 38 people .
Despite the risks , voter turnout could reach 55 percent , a senior U.S. official told CNN .
Another voter , Ali Abdul Hassan , also risked the uncertainty of voting Sunday with his 2 - month - old infant .
" I want my baby to start voting early , " he said .
The general feeling expressed by voters on election day was a longing for change and for a government that will be able to provide basic things such as water , electricity , jobs and security .
A woman in line to vote in Baghdad said her vote was a way of fighting back against acts of terrorism in Iraq .
Preliminary results are expected by Wednesday , the United Nations said .
Results will start emerging for each province as soon as votes are tallied from 30 percent of polling centers in that province .
About 60 security incidents were reported throughout the country Sunday , the senior U.S. official said .
These included fatal mortar and rocket attacks in various Baghdad neighborhoods .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said those reports of mortar attacks in Baghdad had not yet been confirmed .
According to Gates , Gen. Ray Odierno , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , " had expected a significant number of high - profile attacks , both suicide vests and truck and car bombs , but the security situation , the efforts of the Iraqi Security Forces are such that al Qaeda in Iraq was forced to change their tactics . "
Speaking at the White House , President Obama also downplayed Sunday 's violence .
Some violence was expected , Obama said , but " overall , the level of security , and the prevention of destabilizing attacks , speaks to the growing capability and professionalism of Iraqi security forces , which took the lead in providing protection at the polls . "
The success of the vote showed that " the future of Iraq belongs to the people of Iraq , " Obama said .
The United States does not support particular candidates in Iraq , but does support Iraqis ' right to elect their representatives , he said .
" We know there will be very difficult days ahead in Iraq , " Obama said .
" There will probably be more violence .
But , like any sovereign , independent nation , Iraq must be free to chart its own course . "
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised Iraq 's High Electoral Commission and security forces for running and securing the vote .
" I congratulate all the people of Iraq who participated in national elections today and over the past three days , " she said in a statement .
" There is no better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraq 's progress . "
Counting was taking place at the polling stations at the end of voting , under the gaze of observers .
Ballots will be counted twice to ensure accuracy , according to the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq .
The number of ballots cast will be reconciled with the number of ballots issued to each polling station , and in case of a significant discrepancy , the station will be audited , the U.N. said .
Authorities in Baghdad announced a curfew on the capital from 10 p.m. Sunday until 5 a.m. Monday .
In a statement Sunday , Obama said : " I have great respect for the millions of Iraqis who refused to be deterred by acts of violence , and who exercised their right to vote today . "
Referring to the day 's violence , he added : " We mourn the tragic loss of life today , and honor the courage and resilience of the Iraqi people who once again defied threats to advance their democracy . "
It was Iraq 's fifth nationwide vote since 2003 , but only the second for a full four - year - term parliament .
More than 30 mortar rounds hit the capital , with three landing inside the heavily fortified International Zone .
The zone , informally known as the Green Zone , houses the U.S. Embassy and many Iraqi government buildings .
One of the rockets landed in the Ur neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad , killing 12 people .
The capital also experienced a number of deadly roadside bomb attacks .
The last time the country had a national vote was in 2005 , when the Sunni Arab population boycotted the elections and the political process .
A Shiite - led government emerged and the Sunnis , feeling disenfranchised , went on to form the main part of the insurgency .
The U.N. mission in Iraq calls the elections an " important milestone in Iraq 's democratic progress , " serving to strengthen the country 's sovereignty and independence as the United States draws down its military presence there .
Sunday 's elections were originally supposed to happen in January but were delayed because of political disagreements and a delay in passing the election law that paved the way for this vote .
There are 18.9 million eligible voters , casting ballots for 325 seats in the Council of Representatives , Iraq 's parliament .
The seats represent Iraq 's 18 provinces .
The number of seats is increasing from the previous 275 .
Seat allocation was based on 2005 population data from the Ministry of Trade and adjusted for a 2.8 percent annual growth across all governates .
On Friday , voting began for Iraqis abroad in 16 countries -- including the United States , United Kingdom , Turkey , Iran , Canada and others in the Middle East and Europe .
There are no exact figures on those eligible to cast ballots abroad .
Estimates on turnout have ranged anywhere from 300,000 to 3 million .
About 6,200 candidates from more than 80 political entities are vying for seats .
At least a quarter of the positions -- 82 -- are guaranteed to go to women , and eight more have been allocated for minorities .
They include five set aside for Christians and one each for the Shabak , Sabaeans ( Mandaeans ) , and Yazidis .
A number of special measures were put in place for security reasons .
Since Monday , there has been a ban on motorcycles and bicycles in Baghdad until further notice , and on Sunday a two - day ban on any vehicles in cities went into effect .
Provincial borders were ordered sealed , preventing movements between provinces , from Saturday to Monday .
CNN 's Arwa Damon , Jomana Karadsheh , Mohammed Tawfeeq and Zain Verjee contributed to this report .
Ever since Gary Gygax realized that pretending to be a wizard stabbing a troll was a lot more socially acceptable than playing wargames where you pretend to be the Axis power , role - playing has been a thriving and vital subculture of weirdos , nerds , and lonely people .
But some of those are decidedly more lonely than others , as these games show us .
1 .
F.A.T.A.L .
“ It is the goal of Fatal Games to astound and thrill those who seek a role - playing game based on historical and mythological accuracy , realism , and detail . ” – F.A.T.A.L .
What that means is …rape , rape , rape , violence , and rape with a side of sexual assault .
When replying to the review of this game raking them over the coals , the creator responded to accusations of date rape in the game asking where the reviewers saw anything in the game about dating ( REVIEW ) .
But that , dear readers , is only the tip of this iceberg of psychological terror .
F.A.T.A.L. is the RPG for nerds that nerds beat up , the kind of guy who really DOES weigh three hundred pounds , wear nothing but sweatpants , and has a thick , bushy - yet - scraggly neckbeard .
Other nerds look at guys like that , shudder , and think “ At least I moved out of Mom’s ” .
So while those nerds are playing D&D , these guys ?
They ’re playing F.A.T.A.L .
F.A.T.A.L. gets right to it when you ’re rolling up your character .
We could bore you by telling you that the game is ridiculously detailed with the stats , but we ’ll kill two birds with one stone and list off a stat that really get the point across .
You ’re going to roll up , among other things , your anal circumference , depth , and just how much your a*$ can stretch .
Why ?
Because there ’s probably going to be a five - foot penis up in there , and they want you to figure out exactly how much damage you ’re getting from a bunch of orcs pulling a train on you .
Boy , you got a purdy little mouth .
Yep , rape is n’t just the reason this game exists : it ’s a combat mechanic !
You can even summon gay ogres to rape your opponents , which would have vastly improved Final Fantasy .
And did we mention there are complicated equations for all of this , with tables you ’ll have to consult ?
To have sex in this game , you ’d better have high school algebra fresh in your memory : it involves quadratic equations .
There is , believe it or not , 900 pages of this , which reads more like an algebra textbook and the most terrifying fan fiction you can find than a role - playing game .
Needless to say , being a bunch of basement - dwelling losers , the writers of this game also salt in plenty of racism and other idiocy .
For example , there ’s the Armor of Jewy Jewness ( yes , seriously ) , which increases your nose size and reduces your penis size .
Classy !
Unfortunately for F.A.T.A.L.’s authors , nothing on the Internet goes away : you can find the full 900 - page game plus their hilarious attempts to sell it as something other than a desperate nerd ’s bleat for revenge on the Wayback Machine

deadEarth
deadEarth was an attempt to simulate what it would actually be like to survive a nuclear apocalypse and gain superpowers .
Of course , these superpowers tended to be of the ridiculous variety .
Like , say , it burns when you pee , dying when you come into contact with water , or not knowing what sharp things are .
Beyond that and some production problems , it was actually a fairly decent RPG .
But we wonder what the hell they were thinking with those superpowers .
Did somebody lose a bet ?
Were these rules imported from a game where you played a crack squad of Down ’s syndrome sufferers ?
What was the deal ?

Wraeththu
Let ’s say you want to make an RPG based on a popular series of novels .
That ’s a good marketing plan .
But do you pick a series of novels carefully , or do you throw a dart and wind up with the one about hermaphroditic aliens that evolved from humanity after the apocalypse ?
That have penis flowers ?
They not only did exactly that , they expected you to play one of these androgynous penis - flower monsters .
And they thought this was innovative because clearly they ’d never seen , heard of , or understood what “ hentai ” was .
Needless to say , this is off the market , but we ’re surprised those penis flowers are n’t available online .
WASHINGTON — New documents released by a Senate panel show how entrenched Washington Mutual was in fraudulent and risky lending , and highlighted how its top executives received rewards as their institution was hurtling toward disaster .
The problems at WaMu , whose collapse was the largest in American banking history , were well known to company executives , excerpts of e-mail messages and other internal documents show .
The documents were released on Monday by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , which began an inquiry into the financial crisis in November 2008 .
The panel has summoned seven former WaMu executives to testify at a hearing on Tuesday , including the former chief executive Kerry K. Killinger .
The panel called WaMu illustrative of problems in the origination , sale and securitization of high - risk mortgages by any number of financial institutions from 2004 to 2008 .
KABUL , Afghanistan ,  --
In the dusty Afghan village where U.S. troops killed two pregnant women and three other innocent civilians in February , a remarkable scene played out today between an aggrieved father and the most senior special operations officer in the United States military .
Vice Admiral William McRaven -- the commander of Joint Special Operations Command -- showed up with two sheep , and in the cultural understanding of the region , surrendered himself .
He did n't literally surrender .
But he did n't have to .
In the code followed by the southeastern Afghan family so devastated by the February incident , offering two sheep is the equivalent of begging for forgiveness .
And the father -- whose has lost two sons , two daughters and one grandchild -- accepted McRaven 's apology , according to family members and Afghan investigators .
" I am the commander of the soldiers who accidentally killed your loved ones , " McRaven told the family , according to the Times of London , which was present for the meeting .
It was the first time special operations forces acknowledged their participation .
" I came here today to send my condolences to you and to your family and to your friends , " McRaven said .
" I also came today to ask your forgiveness for these terrible tragedies . "
McRaven continued , addressing the father : " Sir , you and I are very different .
You are a family man with many children and many friends .
I am a soldier .
I have spent most of my career overseas away from my family , but I have children as well and my heart grieves for you .
" But we have one thing in common , one very important thing , " McRaven said .
" We have the same god .
He is a god who shows great love and compassion .
I pray for you today , sir , that in your grief he will show you love and compassion and ease your pain .
... I also pray today that he will show mercy on me and my men for this awful tragedy . "
Presenting sheep is such a powerful form of requesting forgiveness that the father is now obligated not to take revenge , even though he has told reporters he wanted to become a suicide bomber .
" We were very happy he came to our house , " said Mohammad Tahir , the brother of the two men and father of the 18 - year - old woman who was killed , referring to McRaven .
" We told him , ' Thank you very much .
We will not keep anything in our heart against you . ' "
The family only asked McRaven to hand over whoever gave him the intelligence that led the joint American and Afghan force to their home on the early morning of Feb. 12 .
" You do n't have to give him to us , " the family told McRaven , Tahir said .
" At least hand him over to the Afghan government . "
The forgiveness will help defuse one of the most troubling cases of troops killing civilians in the eight - and - a - half - year war , one in which the United States has had to backtrack from statements multiple times and is accused of a cover-up .
On Feb .
12 , NATO emailed a statement to reporters with the subject line , " Joint force operating in Gardez makes gruesome discovery . "
" Several insurgents engaged the joint force in a fire fight and were killed , " the statement read .
" When the joint force entered the compound they conducted a thorough search of the area , and found the bodies of three women who had been tied up , gagged and killed .
The bodies had been hidden in an adjacent room . "
A Special Forces Cover Up in Afghanistan ?
When that story was challenged by the family , senior NATO officials vociferously defended the incident , criticizing a reporter who quoted the family in a story and claiming the women had defensive wounds , an implication that they had been killed by their own family .
But family members and now Afghan investigators accuse the American and Afghan special forces unit of trying to cover up the deaths .
" They committed a crime on top of a crime , " says the head of the Afghan team investigating the incident , Gen. Mohammad Mirza Yarmand .
Tahir goes even further , saying he saw American troops extract bullets from the women 's bodies , an explosive charge in a conservative country where American troops are generally told to avoid interacting with women , especially in southern and eastern Afghanistan .
" I saw Americans taking bullets out of the body of my sister - in - law and they were pushing me away from the scene , " Tahir said .
" When I told them , ' Let me take them to hospital , ' they said , ' Do n't worry , the helicopter will be coming and we will take care of them . ' "
Yarmand says the family found one bullet that was left inside one of the women .
A military spokesman denies any cover - up , saying in a statement to ABC News , " We have discovered no evidence that any of our forces did anything to manipulate the evidence or the bodies at the scene , " according to Lt. Col .
Joseph Breasseale , the deputy chief of public affairs for NATO forces in Kabul .
But the incident so inflamed the family , the father initially vowed to take revenge , " even if it breaks me into pieces . "
" I have lost patience .
I am obliged to revenge my martyrs , " he told an ABC News cameraman on March 18 .
" I will destroy everything I have and will launch my own suicide attack .
My heart is burning . "
But today the father forgave , a lesson in the importance of cultural sensitivity , especially in a region dominated by people who follow a strict , centuries - old set of principles known as Pashtunwali .
McRaven asked for that forgiveness -- an act called Nanawati in Pashto -- one day after Afghan investigators presented their findings of the incident to Gen.
Stanley McChrystal , the head of all foreign forces in Afghanistan .
McChrystal ordered McRaven to go for Nanawati , according to a U.S. military official , who said this was not the first time American troops have performed such an act .
McChrystal has made reducing civilian casualties a cornerstone of his policy since arriving in Kabul late last spring , an acknowledgement that perhaps more than any other action , civilian deaths can push Afghans away from the government and toward the insurgency .
To a certain extent , he has been successful .
Last year , according to the United Nations , the number of civilians killed by international troops dropped to 596 from 828 .
In the last month , McChrystal has brought more special forces troops under his control , and he has restricted how special forces can conduct raids at night , demanding that Afghans remain in the lead the entire way , although it 's not clear whether the forces who conducted the raid on Feb. 12 are under his direct control .
" Despite their effectiveness and operational value , night raids come at a steep cost in terms of the perceptions of the Afghan people , " McChrystal wrote in a directive released on March 5 .
" Night raids must be conducted with even greater care , additional constraints , and standardization throughout Afghanistan . "
The apparent lack of care with which the troops conducted the raid on Feb. 12 pushed a family who supported the government away .
It took a visit by a three - star for the family to move on and to forgive , which they apparently have .
And that may help quell the demand for an investigation , limiting the fallout of the incident .
" The good thing is they have accepted their mistake , " Gen .
Yarmand said today .
" That makes all the difference in the case . "
Experts are needed to keep the UK's web space safe and secure A national public competition has begun to find people with a talent for keeping computers and networks secure .
The competition aims to find those with relevant analytical , forensic and programming skills using web - based games and challenges .
Without more computer security experts the UK will not be equipped to handle rising cyber crime , say professionals .
The challenge hopes to encourage many of those that complete the games to take up a career in computer security .
" We are increasingly dependent on networks and computer systems , " said Judy Baker , director of the Cyber Security Challenge ( CSC ) .
" The whole digital economy and society is structured around them . "
A survey conducted by the competition suggests that many security companies are already having problems recruiting enough skilled people to cope with all the potential work .
CSC is backed by the Cabinet Office , the Metropolitan Police , Qinetiq , Royal Holloway college and the Institute of Information Security Professionals , among others .
Ms Baker said the series of challenges and games that would test the talent and skills of people were currently being drawn up .
They will be built around eight key skill areas which include digital forensics , network analysis and logical thinking .
The games aim to find people with the right skills who will then be invited to take part in the second stage of challenge .
This is likely to include face - to - face tests such as the technical assault courses many computer professionals complete .
The challenge officially starts on 27 April and is aimed at those who are aged 16 or over .
Prizes will be given to top performers that will include scholarships , training courses and mentoring to help people hone their skills .
" There 's a real need for people with these skills and they can give great value back to the nation as a whole , " said Ms Baker .

In the wake of new revelations in the drip - drip - drip of scandal slowly drenching Sen .
John Ensign and washing away any vestiges of his credibility or political life , a national reporter asked me a question :
Did I think the latest dollops , spooned out this week by The New York Times and indicating Ensign went out of his way to help his former staffer / former best friend Doug Hampton , whose wife he bedded , might force him to resign ?
My answer :
If someone could have the stupendous arrogance to sleep with his best friend ’s wife while both were on staff , pay them off with $ 96,000 of parental cash , continue to see the wife while twisting arms to get the cuckold a job , all the while harboring presidential aspirations , why would he not have the hubris to try to tough it out ?
Ensign clearly is immune to shame after spending a public career on a moral high horse while horsing around in private .
This is a man who put a false front to the world , the sanctimonious Senate preacher actually living a double life at that Playboy Mansion East on C Street .
And now , with two probes closing in on him like a vise , Ensign , through his spokesman , offers up fodder no nightclub comic could lampoon : “ Sen. Ensign has consistently acted in an ethical manner to avoid even the appearance of impropriety . ”
My God , man .
Or as Hampton put it in an e-mail discovered by the Times : “ Who are you John ? ...
You continue to reveal who you really are ... a self - centered , self consumed person who only cares for their ( sic ) own well being . ”
Indeed , at every drip in this scandal , Ensign ’s self - protection mechanism has trumped all others .
And whether he is ever found to have violated Senate ethics rules , as now seems more likely , or federal law , which is much harder to prove , his moral bankruptcy continues to unfurl itself at every turn .
The e-mails posted on the Times site indicate more strongly than ever that Ensign was so desperate to placate Hampton that he was willing to ask business folks to take on his former best friend — executives who were faced with a choice to do the bidding of a U.S. senator or risk the consequences .
As the Times reported about Bob Andrews , a vice president of a biodiesel company , Ensign brought up the “ idea ” of hiring Hampton at the same time the company was asking for the senator ’s assistance .
From the Times report : “ The senator mentioned ‘ that we might have somebody we should talk to who might be able to provide us with assistance in our biodiesel program , ’ Andrews said , adding , ‘ I took this as a helpful hint . ’ ”
I wonder if Ensign winked at him .
That sure seems as if the senator was — let me recall the phrasing — acting “ in an ethical manner to avoid even the appearance of impropriety . ”
It may be difficult ( or not ) to prove that Ensign was conspiring to help Hampton violate a federal cooling - off period , which could result in an indictment .
But my guess is this case is not an isolated one and that others besides Andrews might have knowledge of Ensign trying to set up Hampton in jobs — unseemly but not necessarily illegal — that may have also involved lobbying , which Hampton was banned from doing .
It is impossible not to note that while Ensign , as has now been further documented , was scurrying around trying to get Hampton work , he also was still carrying on with Cynthia Hampton .
Ensign has said the affair continued until August 2008 ; the meeting with Andrews occurred in May 2008 .
This moral swamp , this unimaginable grotesquerie , this repellent scenario boils down to this :
From the moment the Hamptons were sent packing from Washington in spring 2008 , with that “ gift ” of $ 96,000 from Ensign ’s parents , the payoffs — or attempted payoffs — were just beginning .
As Ensign continued the affair , he was simultaneously trying to buy Hampton ’s silence .
And when , as these e-mails further confirm , Hampton realized the senator would never make him whole , he wrote a letter to Fox News that forced Ensign into that infamous June 16 , 2009 , confessional news conference .
Hampton ’s version of events , from his first appearance a month after Ensign ’s disclosure to various national news reports , has yet to be contradicted .
He surely has led law enforcement and Senate ethics investigators on the scent of more evidence like what the Times reported this week .
Could it finally force Ensign to resign ?
Why should he ?
So far as anyone knows , he has — wait for it — “ consistently acted in an ethical manner to avoid even the appearance of impropriety . ”
You know what , the more we look at this thing , the less crazy we think it is .
While the concept of mousing around your desktop on foot may appear foreign at first , we imagine we can get used to it after a while .
Not that it 's designed for lazybones like us anyway , as the wireless Toe Mouse concept is primarily intended to help out people with upper limb disabilities , who are n't able to navigate in the usual manner .
Just to score some extra flair points , designer Liu Yi also points out it has a " streamline model that symbolizes the motorboat surfing the internet . "
So it 's not just practical , it 's also poetic .

The barbs and low theatre that make up the House of Commons daily question period were put aside Wednesday for some kind words across the aisle and a rare sign of unity .
Almost all members of Parliament from every party wore a teal - and - blue - striped tie or scarf in support of NDP Leader Jack Layton 's fight against prostate cancer .
The Toronto MP is in the middle of a treatment regimen that has seen him lose some weight and occasionally look wan .
Layton , 59 , has rarely missed a session of the Commons since Parliament reconvened March 4 and has vowed to stay on the job until his health is fully restored .
The Tory hue of the ties and scarves of Prostate Cancer Canada prompted additional congratulations from Conservatives on the choice of colour .
" We are delighted to join in solidarity with the leader of the NDP on the issue of prostate cancer , " Prime Minister Stephen Harper told the House .
" We are delighted to see him looking so good and so healthy in this House of Commons , and looking ever better in that blue tie . "
The Conservatives even eschewed their usual partisan jab at Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff in the final member statement before question period to pay tribute to Layton 's medical battle .
" His public gesture of courage showed Canadian men and their families that they are not alone in their daily fight to combat this illness , but more needs to be done , " said Conservative MP Jim Abbott .
" Government members are proud to wear the ties and scarves that are a symbol of Prostate Cancer Canada , to show their support for the member for Toronto - Danforth and all Canadians who have had or are battling this disease . "
Layton was grateful and said he hoped the unified front might be pushed beyond fashion and into the realm of policy .
" A big thanks to all my colleagues here for the consensus on the ties and scarves .
And a big thanks to Prostate Cancer Canada and all the medical staff and volunteers who work on this issue , " he told the House .
" Who knows , maybe we can create some consensus on a few other things here . "

gdata-client-meta-1.0.jar
gdata -core -1.0.jar
gdata-analytics-2.1.jar
gdata-analytics-meta-2.1.jar
google - collect -1.0.jar
After running " lein deps " add them to the lib / subdirectory .
( ns analytics.core ( :use incanter.core ) ( :use incanter.charts ) ( :import ( java.net URL ) ( com.google.gdata.client.analytics AnalyticsService DataQuery ) ) ) ( defn get - class [ class ] ( Class / forName ( str " com.google.gdata.data.analytics . " class ) ) ) ( defn service [ username pass ] ( doto ( AnalyticsService . " Clojure_Incanter_Sample " ) ( .setUserCredentials username pass ) ) )
In order to retrieve data we need a service object which handles all interaction between our application and Analytics Data Export API .
( defn account - feed [ service & args ] ( let [ url ( URL . ( str " https://www.google.com/analytics/ " " feeds/accounts/default?max-results=50 " ) ) feed ( . get Feed service url ( get-class " AccountFeed " ) ) accs ( reduce #( assoc % 1 ( -> %2 .getTitle .getPlainText ) ( -> %2 .getTableId .getValue ) ) {} ( .getEntries feed ) ) ] ( if ( nil ? args ) accs ( accs ( first args ) ) ) ) )
To retrieve data for a profile , we need its table id .
Asking service for an account feed , returns a list of entries containing title , table id and profile id but we are only interested in title and table id .
( defn query [ args ] ( let [ ga - str ( fn [ s ] ( apply str ( interpose " , " ( map #( str " ga " % ) s ) ) ) ) ] ( doto ( DataQuery .
( URL .
" https://www.google.com/analytics/feeds/data " ) ) ( .setStartDate ( first ( : date args ) ) ) ( .setEndDate ( last ( : date args ) ) ) ( .setDimensions ( ga- str ( : dimensions args ) ) ) ( .setMetrics ( ga - str ( : metrics args ) ) ) ( .setSort ( str " - " ( ga - str ( : sort args ) ) ) ) ( .setMaxResults ( : num - result args ) ) ( .set Ids ( : id args ) ) ) ) ) ( defn data - feed [ service & args ] ( let [ args ( apply hash - map args ) feed ( . get Feed service ( . get Url ( query args ) ) ( get-class " DataFeed " ) ) cols ( map #( str " ga " % ) ( concat ( : dimensions args ) ( : metrics args ) ) ) ] ( map ( fn [ e ] ( map #(.stringValueOf e % ) cols ) ) ( .getEntries feed ) ) ) )
As with the account feed , first thing we need to do is build a feed request URL , query function handles that nothing fancy , it just calls a bunch of setters for dimensions , metrics etc .
Querying analytics service with a data feed URL returns a list of entries , data - feed maps over them and returns a sequence containing dimensions and metrics we requested .
Now that we have some data to play with , we can start off by doing fairly standard things , like which pages got the most visits for the past month ,
( def analytics ( service " username " " pass " ) ) ( def acc - nakkaya ( account - feed analytics " nakkaya.com " ) ) ( def acc - feed ( account - feed analytics ) ) ( def pageview ( data - feed analytics : date [ " 2010 -01 - 26 " " 2010-02 - 25 " ] : dimensions [ : pageTitle :pagePath ] : metrics [ : pageviews ] : sort [ : pageviews ] : num - result 10 : id acc - nakkaya ) )
This is where incanter makes things fun , as long as you have a sequence of rows , in this case what data - feed returns you can call view to visualize the data ,
( view pageview ) ( view ( col - names ( to - dataset pageview ) [ : title : path : views ] ) )
or we can filter the data leaving only portions of it which we are interested , such as pages with views more than 200 and lower than 800 ,
( with - data ( col - names ( map ( fn [ [x y z ] ] [x y ( BigInteger . z ) ] ) pageview ) [ : title : path : views ] ) ( view ( $ where { : views { : $ gt 200 : $lt 800}} ) ) )
Alternatively you can filter the data in Clojure , requesting top 10 keywords people used to find your website and filtering the ones that contain " clojure " or " java " in them ,
( def keywords ( data - feed analytics : date [ " 2010 -01 - 26 " " 2010-02 - 25 " ] : dimensions [ : keyword ] : metrics [ : visits ] : sort [ : visits ] : num - result 10 : id acc - nakkaya ) ) ( let [ words [ " clojure " " java " ] ] ( reduce ( fn [ h v ] ( if ( some true ?
( map #(.contains ( first v ) % ) words ) ) ( conj h v ) h ) ) [ ] keywords ) )
analytics.core= > [ ( " clojure xml " " 62 " ) ( " clojure turtle graphics " " 31 " ) ( " clojure opencv " " 26 " ) ( " detect faces from webcam + java " " 26 " ) ]
Besides visualizing stuff using tables , we can plot graphs containing the information we are interested ,
( def browsers ( data - feed analytics : date [ " 2010 -01 - 26 " ] : dimensions [ : browser ] : metrics [ : visits ] : sort [ : visits ] : num - result 10 : id acc - nakkaya ) ) ( view ( bar - chart ( take 4 ( map first browsers ) ) ( take 4 ( map #( BigInteger . ( last % ) ) browsers ) ) : title " Browser / Visits " :x- label " Browsers " :y - label " Visits " ) )
It 's really a tough world around given that more and more competitors is here because of the power of the internet .
The market industry has become increasingly competitive and also you desire to provide the best branding experience for your potential prospects .
Considering that the marketing world is encountering a large amount of changes , it 's up to the customer 's hand to select whichever system they would like to visit ; whether it is in mobile web or social media .
Owing to this you need to find the right http://stealthinteractive.ca/web-design/Edmonton-Web-Design that 's capable of giving your website the makeover it truly needs .
The message should be apparent , concise and efficient .
The question is how can you be satisfied with a company or even a design for your internet site ?
To start with : ponder over it carefully .
You should figure out what you want your website to reach .
Set practical targets and take into consideration how you can achieve them .
Set a time period if it helps .
You can find short - term and long - term goals you could make that can help your website .
It is not adequate that you simply start a website and just let it sit there hanging .
It 's important to understand how you can bring in people and keep them interested .
Begin with creating a specified target audience like e-commerce where you 're providing things such as return on investment , building subscriber base and change of sales .
When you are managing a novice company on the internet , simply think about a good brand awareness campaign .
Have the web design concentrate on giving details about the website combined with services that it offers .
A good website must have good focus and presence .
Clients constantly want to know what they 're in for so make sure that you are direct to the point with how you design your web site .
Of course it 's the design company that does it but they 're your brain on this all just what exactly you come up is essential .
It 's also possible to speak about projects together with the design team to generate creative ideas , respect each other 's views and try to think outside the box .
The next thing on your own plate would be to look for an agency that fits the check .
Apart from finding a appropriate agency you could deal with , it 's also important that you can afford their services .
Make an effort to lookup within the earlier works of the agency .
Likewise try to determine references or inquire further if they can give you something where you can examine their work .
It is necessary because you should be aware of if the style of the company matches with what you are thinking about .
Also look for possible problems they have encountered before and how they are able to supply a remedy .
Much like with any organization , be sure that your web design has a clear cost versus value .
Know what you ought to get and just how much you should pay for it .
It 's a huge question that no - one would certainly dare to inquire about first when it comes down to it .
Be professional about it and talk to your agency regarding it .
Some pay too inexpensively in most cases get a lot lesser than what they hoped for .
The secret is understanding the right price and negotiating for a high - quality .
Be aware that having high - quality is much better than quantity in design .
Standard and Poor 's downgraded Greece 's debt yesterday .
This reflected -- and added to -- perceptions that Europe 's debt difficulties are worsening .
Portugal , Spain and Ireland are now in deeper trouble as a result .
First , one notes that the European Union has made an unbelievable hash of managing this crisis , making the problem worse as much as helping to solve it .
The latest proposal , a 45 billion euro package by Europe and the I.M.F. , has done little to calm the markets , and Germany 's statement this week that it must first see more deficit reduction from Greece before fulfilling its pledge has only increased concerns that Europe is not united behind Greece .
Kenneth Rogoff , a former economist for the I.M.F. who has studied sovereign defaults , calls the latest assistance package puzzling .
" They put their wad on the table , but they could have gone further , " he said of the international plan .
" I never thought Europe could take the lead on this . "
No indeed .
But the role of the ratings agencies also needs to be looked at .
Given the decisive part they played in the subprime mortgage debacle , how have they managed to escape reprisals from politicians and regulators ?
Now they are at it again , propagating a follow - on crisis in Europe .
The question is not so much whether their new lower ratings on the PIGS ' debts are justified , but whether , supposing they are , their earlier high ratings of the same debt conveyed useful information in the first place -- or actually did the opposite , providing false assurance to the markets .
No information is better than bad information .
Creating a regulatory requirement for action based on this bad information , which is current policy , is doubly perverse .

Iceland ’s Eyjafjallajökull Volcano sent a plume of ash and steam across the North Atlantic in mid-April 2010 , prompting authorities in the United Kingdom , Ireland , France , and Scandinavia to close airspace over their countries .
The airspace closure had a ripple effect , disrupting flights to and from other countries as well .
Authorities could not say how long the airspace closure would last , and the ash ’s spread threatened to force closures of additional airspace over the coming days .
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite captured this natural - color image on April 15 , 2010 .
A volcanic plume blows from Eyjafjallajökull Volcano in southern Iceland toward the east - southeast .
The plume blows past the Faroe Islands and arcs slightly toward the north near the Shetland Islands .
The plume ’s tan hue indicates a fairly high ash content .
Unlike the soft , fluffy material that results from burned vegetation , volcanic ash consists of tiny jagged particles of rock .
Once sucked into an airplane ’s turbines , the abrasive material can easily cause engine failure , but an aircraft ’s weather radar ca n’t spot the ash .
Eyjafjallajökull ( or Eyjafjöll ) is a stratovolcano composed of alternating layers of ash , lava , and rocks ejected by earlier eruptions .
This volcano rises to a height of 1,666 meters ( 5,466 feet ) above sea level .
It began erupting for the first time in 190 years on March 20 , 2010 .
The eruption opened a 500 - meter ( 2,000 - foot ) fissure , and also produced lava fountains that built several hills of bubble - filled lava rocks ( scoria ) along the vent .

The Vatican has confirmed Cardinal Ratzinger 's signature The Pope is facing allegations he was responsible for delaying Church action against a paedophile priest - the first time he has been accused so directly .
The allegations stem from a letter signed by Benedict XVI in 1985 , when he was a senior Vatican official .
Associated Press said it had obtained the letter , signed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , resisting the defrocking of offending US priest Stephen Kiesle .
The Vatican says he was exercising due caution before sacking the priest .
Cardinal Ratzinger - who was at the time the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith - said the " good of the universal Church " needed to be considered in any defrocking , AP reported .
ANALYSIS By David Willey ,
BBC News , Rome
The Vatican claims the letter must be considered in its true context of a lengthy exchange of correspondence between California and Rome about defrocking an American priest who was a known child molester .
The Pope 's critics claim that he stalled and left unanswered for years letters concerning alleged cases of sexual abuse by priests .
American bishops are coming under increasing pressure from their flocks to explain why the church in Rome did not take more robust action or took no action at all .
So they are releasing confidential documents which put the future Pope 's lack of action in a bad light .
The Vatican insists that the Pope was only exercising due caution before sacking a priest for sexual misconduct .
Vatican officials say the letter was part of a long correspondence and should not be taken out of context .
Vatican spokesman Rev Federico Lombardi said : " The press office does n't believe it is necessary to respond to every single document taken out of context regarding particular legal situations . "
The allegations come as the Vatican says the Pope is willing to meet more victims of clerical abuse , and as the Vatican prepares to publish a guide on the internet about how bishops should deal with accusations of sexual abuse .
The Catholic Church has been hit by a series of child abuse scandals , including in Ireland , the US , Germany and Norway , and has faced criticism for failing to deal adequately with the problem .
' Grave significance ' AP said the Rev Kiesle was sentenced to three years of probation in 1978 for lewd conduct with two young boys in San Francisco .
It said the Oakland diocese had recommended Kiesle 's removal in 1981 but that that did not happen until 1987 .
Cardinal Ratzinger took over the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , which at the time dealt with some sex abuse cases , in 1981 .
ALLEGATIONS FACING POPE
In 1980 as archbishop of Munich and Freising , then - Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger unwittingly approved housing for a priest accused of child abuse .
A former deputy later said he made the decision Cardinal Ratzinger failed to act over complaints during the 1990s about US priest Lawrence Murphy , who is thought to have abused some 200 deaf boys in Wisconsin Cardinal Ratzinger allowed a case against Arizona priest Michael Teta to languish at the Vatican for more than a decade despite repeated pleas for his removal Cardinal Ratzinger resisted the defrocking of California priest Stephen Kiesle , a convicted offender , saying " good of the universal Church " needed to be considered The Pope 's supporters say he has been unfairly blamed for cases handled by junior staff , and that he has been proactive in addressing child abuse .
AP says the 1985 correspondence , written in Latin , shows Cardinal Ratzinger saying that Kiesle 's removal would need careful review .
Cardinal Ratzinger urged " as much paternal care as possible " for Kiesle .
Kiesle was sentenced to six years in prison in 2004 after admitting molesting a young girl in 1995 .
Kiesle is now 63 and is on the registered sex offenders list in California .
On Friday , the Vatican urged Catholic dioceses around the world to co-operate with police investigating sex abuse allegations against priests .
Father Lombardi acknowledged that the Church had lost public trust and said Church law could no longer be placed above civil laws if that trust were to be recovered .
He also said Pope Benedict was prepared to meet more victims of abuse to offer them moral support .
This court ... deems it necessary to consider the good of the Universal Church together with that of the petitioner
Text of Pope ' letter '
Pope willing to see abuse victims BBC religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott says this is an abrupt change of tone by the Vatican .
He says officials had previously accused critics of trying to smear the Pope personally and only last weekend said he should ignore petty gossip directed at him .
Meanwhile Italian media have reported that the Vatican is to issue guidelines on its website on Monday on fighting paedophilia .
The Vatican has ruled out any possibility of a papal resignation over the scandals .

Recently I acquired an automotive engine wiring harness that needed some serious love and attention .
The previous owner had apparently stirred the dirty pot of electric gremlins , allowing them to surface from the deepest , darkest bowels of the vehicle .
After seeing it with my own eyes , it became my obligation to write a “ how - to ” on how to successfully breed automotive electrical gremlins .
The previous owner of this wiring harness had perfected this lost art , and I did n’t want the information to become lost again for all eternity .
Step 1 ) Use Scotch Locks to splice a few extra inches of wire in .
That ’s not what they are intended for but hey if it works , it works .
Step 2 ) Now solder some frayed wires together with zero flux or penetration .
If possible , just “ plop ” a dab of solder on the 2 wires , but not too much , this is n’t not meant to hold for more than a few days .
Step 3 ) Cut open a few important wires , run them through a blender , then leave them open to the elements .
This will allow for sparks , fire , and other forms of excitement .
Step 4 ) Add T - Taps , lots of them .
The goal here is to damage as many wires as possible , and this will get you well on your way .
Remember that moderation is not a word in your vocabulary .
Step 5 ) Find a connector that goes to something important , like a Mass Airflow Sensor for example , and cut it off .
Now , ever - so - gently twist the wires back together .
As soon as that is complete , pull them apart again , and lightly twist them back together in the opposite direction .
Do n’t bother shrink wrapping them or taping them , it wo n’t be necessary .
Step 6 ) Your car wo n’t run soon anyway , so why not start early by ripping off the fuel injector connectors .
One ?
Nah , go for 2 or 3 , at least .
Step 7 ) This is the final step so pay very close attention .
Find a ground loop connector , preferably with multiple wires going to it .
Now grab the nearest pair of wire cutters , and cut the entire thing off .
Quickly put the loop in your pocket , and do whatever you need to do to make sure it is never associated with the wiring harness again .
If you want to successfully breed electrical gremlins in your own ( or maybe a friend ’s car ) , these are the steps you need to take to complete the process .
Completing every step wo n’t be necessary because just one of these steps will cause endless hours of enjoyable electrical gremlin chasing .
So um , remember this crazy 14 - inch transparent OLED display Samsung was showing off perched atop a laptop at CES ?
Yea , that might be in the shops within the next 12 months .
If that does n't get you tingling with excitement , we do n't know what will .
Samsung will start its big push toward translucency with the IceTouch PMP , which we found to have a gorgeous 2 - inch display in our earlier hands - on , but it 's already working away in the labs on turning the prototype above into a concrete retail product .
The IceTouch is slated to make its US arrival early in the first half of this year , priced at around $ 332 .
European availability is as yet unconfirmed , but the Korean 's company is being very ambitious about its technology , suggesting that windscreen - mounted SatNav units could be next on the agenda and ruling nothing out as it strives to bring its transparent AMOLED displays into the mainstream .
Buried in a green Pennsylvania valley for nearly two centuries , the man had been reduced to a jumble of bones : skull , vertebrae , toes , teeth and ribs .
Gradually , though , he came alive for William and Frank Watson , twin brothers who are leading an excavation at a pre-Civil War railroad construction site outside Philadelphia , where 57 Irish workers are said to have been surreptitiously interred in a mass grave .
The plates of the man ’s skull were not fully fused , indicating he was a teenager when he died .
He was relatively short , 5 - foot - 6 , but quite strong , judging from his bone structure .
And X - rays showed he never grew an upper right first molar , a rare genetic defect .
The Watsons have tentatively identified him as John Ruddy — an 18 - year - old laborer from rural County Donegal , who sailed from Derry in the spring of 1832 .
He likely had cholera , alongside dozens of his countrymen , all dying within two months of setting foot on American shores .
Tipped off by a long - secret railroad company document , the Watsons searched the woods around Malvern , Pennsylvania , for four and a half years to find “ our men ” ( as they call the workers ) before locating the Ruddy skeleton in March 2009 .
They have since unearthed the mingled remains of several others and believe they know the location of the rest .
William is a professor of medieval history at Immaculata University ; Frank is a Lutheran minister .
Both belong to Irish and Scottish cultural societies ( they are competitive bagpipers ) , but neither had any prior archaeological training .
“ Half the people in the world thought we were crazy , ” William says .
“ Every once in a while we would sit down and ask ourselves : ‘ Are we crazy ? ’ ” Frank adds .
“ But we were n’t . ”
Today their dig is shedding light on the early 19th century , when thousands of immigrants labored to build the infrastructure of the still - young nation .
Labor unions were in their infancy .
Working conditions were controlled entirely by the companies , most of which had little regard for the safety of their employees .
The Pennsylvania grave was a human “ trash heap , ” Frank says .
Similar burial sites lie alongside this country ’s canals , dams , bridges and railroads , their locations known and unknown ; their occupants nameless .
But the Watsons were determined to find the Irishmen at the site , known as Duffy ’s Cut .
“ They ’re not going to be anonymous anymore , ” William says .
The project began in 2002 when the Watsons began reviewing a private railroad company file that had belonged to their late grandfather , the assistant to Martin Clement , a 1940s - era Pennsylvania Railroad president .
The file — a collection of letters and other documents Clement assembled during a 1909 company investigation — described an 1832 cholera outbreak that swept through a construction encampment along a stretch of railroad that would connect Philadelphia with Columbia , Pennsylvania .
Contemporary newspapers , which usually kept detailed tallies of local cholera fatalities , implied that only a handful of men had died at the camp .
Yet Clement ’s inquiry concluded that at least 57 men had perished .
The Watsons became convinced the railroad covered up the deaths to ensure the recruitment of new laborers .
Work on the Philadelphia and Columbia line , originally a horse - drawn train , began in 1828 .
Three years later , a contractor named Philip Duffy got the nod to construct Mile 59 , one of the toughest stretches .
The project required leveling a hill — known as making a cut — and using the soil to fill in a neighboring valley in order to flatten the ground .
It was nasty work .
The dirt was “ heavy as the dickens , ” says railroad historian John Hankey , who visited the site .
“ Sticky , heavy , a lot of clay , a lot of stones — shale and rotten rock . ”
Duffy , a middle - class Irishman , had tackled previous railroad projects by enlisting “ a sturdy looking band of the sons of Erin , ” an 1829 newspaper article reported .
By 1830 , census records show that Duffy was sheltering immigrants in his rental home .
Like many laborers from Ireland ’s rural north , Duffy ’s workers were probably poor , Catholic and Gaelic - speaking .
Unlike the wealthier Scotch - Irish families who preceded them , they were typically single men traveling with few possessions who would perform punishing jobs for a pittance .
The average wages for immigrant laborers were “ ten to fifteen dollars a month , with a miserable lodging , and a large allowance for whiskey , ” the British novelist Frances Trollope reported in the early 1830s .
When cholera swept the Philadelphia countryside in the summer of 1832 , railroad workers housed in a shanty near Duffy ’s Cut fled the area , according to Julian Sachse , a historian who interviewed elderly locals in the late 1800s .
But nearby homeowners , perhaps fearful of infection ( it was not yet known that cholera spreads through contaminated water sources ) , turned them away .
The laborers went back to the valley , to be tended only by a local blacksmith and nuns from the Sisters of Charity , who went to the camp from Philadelphia .
Later the blacksmith buried the bodies and torched the shanty .
That story was more legend than history in August 2004 when the Watsons began digging along Mile 59 , near modern Amtrak tracks .
( They ’d obtained permission from local homeowners and the state of Pennsylvania to excavate . )
In 2005 , Hankey visited the valley and guessed where the workers would have strung their canvas shelter : sure enough , the diggers found evidence of a burned area , 30 feet wide .
Excavations turned up old glass buttons , pieces of crockery and clay pipes — including one stamped with the image of an Irish harp .
But no bodies .
Then Frank Watson reread a statement in the Clement file from a railroad employee : “ I heard my father say that they were buried where they were making the fill . ”
Was it possible the bodies lay beneath the original railroad tracks ?
In December 2008 , the Watsons asked geoscientist Tim Bechtel to concentrate his ground - penetrating radar search along the embankment , where he detected a large “ anomaly , ” possibly an air pocket formed by decomposed bodies .
Three months later , shortly after St. Patrick ’s Day , a student worker named Patrick Barry struck a leg bone with his shovel .
On a recent afternoon , the valley was quiet , except for the scrape and clatter of shovels , the slap of wet dirt in the bottom of a wheelbarrow , and every now and then the shuddering shriek of a passing train .
The terrain would challenge even professional excavators : the embankment is steep and the roots of a huge tulip poplar have fingered their way through the site .
The team ’s pickaxes and spades are not much more sophisticated than the Irishmen ’s original tools .
“ We are unbuilding what they died to build , ” William Watson says .
The Watson brothers hope to recover every last body .
In doing so , they could provoke fresh controversies .
Some of the men might have been murdered , says Janet Monge , a University of Pennsylvania forensic anthropologist who is analyzing the remains .
At least one and perhaps two of the recovered skulls show signs of trauma at the time of death , she says , adding these may have been mercy killings , or perhaps local vigilantes did n’t want more sick men leaving the valley .
Identifying the bodies is a chal­lenge , because the laborers ’ names are absent from census records and newspaper obituaries .
And , says William Watson , the archives of the Sisters of Charity offer only a “ spotty ” account .
The most promising clue is the passenger list of a ship , the John Stamp , the only vessel in the spring of 1832 to come from Ireland to Philadelphia with a good many Irish laborers aboard — including a teenager , John Ruddy of Donegal .
Many of these immigrants did not show up in subsequent census records .
The news media in Ireland have reported on the Duffy ’s Cut dig since 2006 .
This past year , as word of the discovery of the skeleton of Ruddy made headlines , the Watsons received phone calls and e-mails from several Ruddys in Ireland , including a Donegal family whose members exhibit the same congenital defect found in the skeleton .
Matthew Patterson , a forensic dentist who worked with the Watsons , says the genetic abnormality is “ exceptionally rare , ” appearing in perhaps one in a million Americans , though the incidence may be greater in Ireland .
The Watsons are confident they have found the family John Ruddy left behind nearly two centuries ago .
But to be certain , the brothers are raising money for genetic tests to compare DNA from the skeleton with that of the Donegal Ruddys ; if there ’s a match , Ruddy ’s remains will be sent back to Ireland for a family burial .
Any unclaimed remains the Watsons disinter will be buried beneath a Celtic cross in West Laurel Hill cemetery , where they will rest alongside some of Philadelphia ’s great industrial tycoons .
In the meantime , the Watsons held their own impromptu memorial service , going down to the mass grave one June afternoon to play the bagpipes .
Staff writer Abigail Tucker reported on the excavation of a Virginia slave jail in the March 2009 issue .
Eucalyptol
A spicy , oily extract of the eucalyptus tree , this is also a decongestant — it relaxes the mucus - producing cells called monocytes in your airways .
Menthol
The sensors in your body that detect cold are fooled as easily as a tourist in Times Square .
When ingested or rubbed on the skin , menthol tricks them into telling the brain , " We 're cool ! "
And psychologically , cool equals clean .
Methyl Salicylate
The chief constituent of wintergreen oil , this flavoring — a phenol — is found in root beer , Bengay , and cigarettes .
It can also relieve mild aches and pains just like its salicylate cousin , aspirin .
Thymol
Phenolic compounds like this one disrupt the cell membranes of bacteria — including the ones living in your mouth .
Thymol , obtained from thyme or oregano , was also used by ancient Egyptians ( and Evita 's embalmers ) to preserve the dead .
Alcohol
FreshBurst Listerine is almost 44 proof .
To keep it from being taxed as liquor , Johnson & Johnson denatures it — making it unpalatable .
The company wo n't give its recipe , but perhaps coincidentally , denaturant formula 38 - B contains eucalyptol , menthol , methyl salicylate , and thymol .
The chemicals are coming from inside the house !
Sorbitol Solution
Original Listerine tasted awful ; now there are yummier alternatives .
Sugar promotes cavities , so J&J uses this sweetener and sodium saccharin , too .
Poloxamer 407
This petroleum - based detergent keeps oily ingredients in solution .
Its secret talent is to remain liquid at room temperature but gel at body temp .
That weird feeling on your tongue after you gargle could be P407 .
Benzoic Acid
An aromatic carboxylic acid , this was discovered in 1556 by Nostradamus .
1
He could never have predicted it would be used to keep bacteria and mold from growing in mouthwash .
FD&C Green # 3
The color of a substance depends on the wavelengths of light it reflects and absorbs , and for an organic dye , that depends on the number and type of bonds between its atoms .
This particular dye absorbs at 625 nanometers — perfect for displaying blue - green .
Note 1 . Benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid , not a
phenol as previously reported .
Being a maverick does n’t pay , at least not when braving a strange new world in a computer game that ’s like Survivor meets Second Life .
The outcome of a computerized game tournament , which finds that a copycat strategy is best , may help explain why mimicking others is so prevalent in nature .
The new study , appearing April 9 in Science , runs counter to the conventional idea that success in an unfamiliar , changing environment comes from a mixture of innovation and copying others .
“ What we find is that under a very broad range of circumstances , not only does social learning beat asocial learning hands down , it annihilates it , ” says study coauthor Kevin Laland of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland .
“ There ’s no balance , no mix of asocial and social learning . ”
Laland and his colleagues set up a tournament in which participants wrote computer programs that controlled the behavior of avatars living in a strange and unpredictable world .
The competition pitted 104 teams against each other to see who could come up with the best survival strategy and encode it in a computer program .
“ In a way , it ’s a bit like being dumped on a Pacific island where you do n’t know anything about the environment , ” says Laland .
“ You do n’t know what ’s good to eat .
You could fish , you could catch crabs , you could hunt antelope , pick for tubers , you name it .
Some of these will reap rich rewards and some will be fruitless . ”
Going into the study , the researchers thought the optimal strategy would be some kind of mixture of copying and innovating , Laland says , both of which have drawbacks .
An unknown berry might turn out to be a great food source for the person who first discovers it , or the berry might be poisonous .
On the other hand , copying others might be safer , but not if the information is outdated or wrong .
To the researchers ’ surprise , the best method relied almost exclusively on copying .
Players were presented with a choice of 100 different moves , each with its own payoff .
Each move , although described purely in mathematical terms , could be thought of as a corollary of picking berries or hunting antelope .
To make the situation more like reality , the payoffs associated with each action changed with time , representing a shifting environment .
At every turn , the players could copy others ’ behaviors or write a program to create a new move .
As the players racked up bigger payoffs , the probability that the avatar reproduced increased — a sign of success .
After many iterations of the tournament , a program called discountmachine written by a team of two graduate students from Queen ’s University in Canada beat out the competition .
Mathematician Daniel Cownden and neuroscientist Timothy Lillicrap won 10,000 pounds for the winning program .
In addition to discountmachine ’s penchant for copying , the program relied on a feature called a neural net that tracked how fast the environment was changing .
This allowed avatars to pay less attention to previous actions that were once successful , but may have become outdated .
“ The results have influenced my own thinking about how people can learn from their own experience and the experience of others , ” comments Robert Axelrod of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor .
In the 1980s , Axelrod conducted a similar tournament to study cooperation .
There is a caveat to the winning program ’s success , though .
It works only when there are other agents around to copy .
“ They ’re effectively kind of parasitic , ” Laland says .
“ You can think of social learners as information scroungers — they ’re stealing the information produced by others . ”
Evolutionary ecologist Richard McElreath of the University of California , Davis calls the new study a “ valuable and unique contribution , ” but points out that the current tournament defines social learning differently from previous studies and so may not be at odds with earlier models of behavior .
Even so , McElreath suspects that this tournament will “ become a classic . ”

Lafayette councilman Kerry Bensman is frustrated by the publicity his town has received in relation to the story of Spork , a ten - year - old dachshund who received a vicious - dog citation after he bit a veterinary technician last August .
He believes most media outlets have been underplaying the seriousness of the injuries sustained by the woman in question .
" The top of her lip and the bottom of her lip were torn off , " he says , adding , " At her request , they tried to find the tissue that had been torn off , so that it could be reapplied by surgeons , but it could n't be found .
It 's believed that the dog may have swallowed the live flesh . "
Bensman shared these concerns with Channel 31 , but says that most of his comments were left on " the cutting room floor . "
Meanwhile , numerous Lafayette staffers , as well as workers at the Japser Animal Hospital , where the biting incident took place , have been inundated with often nasty complaints from people around the country who 've heard about the case .
" What they 've done on their Facebook page is created an e-mail list of forty to fifty city employees -- people who did n't have anything to do with this .
And people are sending e-mails to that list , " Bensman says .
" I 've gotten between 75 and 100 from all over the country -- Hawaii , Michigan , Ohio , Kentucky -- and a smaller number from places like Fort Collins and Longmont .
" And Jasper Animal Hospital , which has been my veterinarian for about eight years -- I 'm on my third Husky with them -- got a death - threat letter yesterday that they reported to the Lafayette Police Department .
They 've gotten at least two death threats they 've told me about . "
Bensman says he does n't begrudge Tim and Kelly Walker , Spork 's owners , for spending many thousands of dollars defending their dog , although he believes the price is so high because of a lawyer change and various court maneuvers done by their choice .
Moreover , he thinks the Walkers are exaggerating the chances that Spork could be euthanized after a late April hearing .
In numerous interviews , including one with yours truly , Tim cited a 2007 Boulder Daily Camera stating that 26 of 33 dogs deemed vicious had eventually been put to death .
However , Bensman says he 's checked around , and the folks with whom he 's spoken only one remember one euthanization in the past couple of years .
Just as important to Bensman is the fact that " Spork has n't been declared a vicious dog , because the hearing has n't been held .
And if the judge thought it was a vicious dog , he could have impounded it -- but the dog's at home .
He has n't been impounded .
And there are a whole range of possible penalties .
There can be a fine , or the owners might have to confine their dog to the house or only be out on a leash -- or owners with a certain type of dog might have to build a dog run on their property with fences at a certain height , so the dogs can't jump out . "
That last one would n't apply to Spork .
As for the distinction between Colorado 's statewide animal ordinance , which exempts veterinary personnel from being able to file vicious dog charges , and Lafayette's , which allows them to do so , Bensman declines to weigh in , citing the ongoing litigation .
However , he points out a comment by Dr. Donald Dodge , founder of the Japser Animal Hospital , posted on the Boulder Daily Camera website report about Spork .
In it , Dodge says that he 'll argue for this particular loophole to be closed after the current controversy has been resolved .
In the meantime , Bensman urges people not to rush to judgment based on media reports that , in his opinion , did n't tell the whole story .
The only exception he mentions is the version presented by Channel 4 , which featured the photo of the injured vet tech seen above .
His choice for a more appropriate headline for Spork stories ?
" ' Vet Tech Maimed by Spork the Dachshund , ' " he says .
Look below to see a press release about Spork put out by the City of Lafayette , a release issued by Dr. Dodge , and Dodge 's comment on the Daily Camera website .
City of Lafayette press release :
Lafayette , Colorado -- February 24 , 2010
The City of Lafayette sent out the following response to those who wrote emails about Spork the Dog : The City of Lafayette is in receipt of your inquiry regarding a dachshund named Spork .
Please permit me to share some observations .
Several years back in rewriting the City code , the City decided to not go the way of breed specific regulations as it related to vicious animals .
Rather the City put in place conditions for the code enforcement and the courts to manage vicious animals .
This non -breed specific effort was applauded by other cities and animal advocate groups .
In no way does it require ' euthanization " other than in extreme circumstances as determined by the Judge .
The Spork incident happened in August of 2009 .
The veterinary technician then made a decision to file a report with the Police Department .
The bite was serious requiring medical attention and care by a plastic surgeon .
The case goes before our Municipal Judge in April .
We are confident that he will review all the facts of the case based upon the evidence presented in court , decide whether a violation occurred , and take appropriate action only if there was a violation .
It is significant to note that the ordinance governing vicious animals does allow immediate impoundment in the most serious cases .
In this case , Spork was not immediately impounded .
The public should understand that once charges are filed with the court , any interference with the judicial process by City Council or Staff could jeopardize the due process rights of all interested parties .
Thanks for reading this .
Gary Kiaphake City Administrator City of Lafayette
Jasper Animal Hospital statement By : Dr. Donald Dodge , Veterinarian and Founder , Jasper Animal Hospital
There have been some media reports about a tragic incident that took place at the Jasper Animal Hospital last August .
As the chief veterinarian at Jasper , I wanted to clarify some of the facts and to tell you how we feel about these events .
Jasper is a place , and I am a person , devoted to the welfare of animals and their guardians .
We have operated on that principle for eight years , and I have nothing but concern for the animal and the technician involved in this situation .
We had treated the dog , a dachshund named Spork , in the past , and he had never before exhibited any aggressive behavior .
On August 14 , 2009 , Spork came into our hospital for a dental procedure .
On that morning Spork , though visibly nervous ( as he had been before in the clinic ) , did not show any signs of aggression ( as had also previously been the case ) .
However , when our veterinary technician reached over to take Spork from his guardian , Spork suddenly bit the technician in the face .
The bite was serious .
Our technician required immediate medical attention .
She was treated at Boulder Community Hospital Urgent Care and by a plastic surgeon .
When an animal bites a person who seeks medical care , it is normal procedure for the hospital to alert animal control officers .
That is what happened here .
Boulder Community Hospital contacted Lafayette Animal Control , and an animal control officer responded to the call .
The veterinary technician then made an individual decision to pursue charges .
I supported that decision , because when an animal causes serious injury to a person , there should be a public record of that fact in case there are future incidents involving that animal .
This did not mean that Jasper wished to see the animal put at risk or the guardians prosecuted .
Jasper Animal Hospital has not advocated for , or participated in any way in subsequent decisions by the City of Lafayette to prosecute Spork 's guardians .
We remain very worried about everyone concerned - the dog , his guardians , and the injured technician .
We consider this incident a tragedy , and we sincerely wish the best for everyone concerned , Spork in particular .
To those who have been supportive to the Jasper Animal Hospital I would like to say that we have heard you and sincerely appreciate your concern .

Quoteworthy :
" People who do n’t like Nick Diaz , that does n’t make sense to me because here ’s a guy who has never put a syringe in his ass in his life .
He ’s a clean fighter .
Obviously [ marijuana 's ] not a performance enhancing drug , so therefore trying to take the guy ’s win away – all of these guys testing positive for steroids , and we ’ll focus on Nick ’s weed thing forever .
Oh , we did steroids , that ’s fine .
Let ’s not talk about that .
You did some cocaine or something .
People have this fetish for the weed thing or something .
Obviously he was n’t stoned for Gomi , but Nevada State with that idiot over there .
I ca n’t remember his name .
The little moron guy that was only an athletic commissioner guy because his daddy owned the hotel .
He was pathetic and he wanted to make an example of Nick because , who knows ?
There are theories .
Nick was n’t in the UFC .
The day Nick ’s not in the UFC he ’s testing positive .
That was kind of a weird thing because he always smoked the night before ( UFC fights ) .
Then all of a sudden he ’s in Pride and he ’s testing positive .
Oh we ’re going to take your win away .
Pride actually paid him a win bonus after he tested positive .
They said , ‘ nah , this is just a bunch of Nevada ( expletive ) , and he won that fight . ’
He got the win bonus and he went on from there . "
Map / Reduce is a term commonly thrown about these days , in essence , it is just a way to take a big task and divide it into discrete tasks that can be done in parallel .
A common use case for Map / Reduce is in document database , which is why I found myself thinking deeply about this .
Let us say that we have a set of documents with the following form :
{ " type " : " post " , " name " : " Raven 's Map / Reduce functionality " , " blog_id " : 1342 , " post_id " : 29293921 , " tags " : [ " raven " , " nosql " ] , " post_content " : " < p >...</p > " , " comments " : [ { " source_ip " : ' 124.2.21.2 ' , " author " : " martin " , " text " : " ... " } ] }
And we want to answer a question over more than a single document .
That sort of operation requires us to use aggregation , and over large amount of data , that is best done using Map / Reduce , to split the work .
Map /
Reduce is just a pair of functions , operating over a list of data .
In C# , LInq actually gives us a great chance to do things in a way that make it very easy to understand and work with .
Let us say that we want to be about to get a count of comments per blog .
We can do that using the following Map / Reduce queries :
from post in docs .
posts select new { post .
blog_id , comments_length = comments .
length } ; from agg in results group agg by agg .key into g select new { agg .
blog_id , comments_length = g.Sum(x=>x.comments_length ) } ;
There are a couple of things to note here :
The first query is the map query , it maps the input document into the final format .
The second query is the reduce query , it operates over a set of results and produces an answer .
Note that the reduce query must return its result in the same format that it received it , why will be explained shortly .
The first value in the result is the key , which is what we are aggregating on ( think the group by clause in SQL ) .
Let us see how this works , we start by applying the map query to the set of documents that we have , producing this output :
The next step is to start reducing the results , in real Map / Reduce algorithms , we partition the original input , and work toward the final result .
In this case , imagine that the output of the first step was divided into groups of 3 ( so 4 groups overall ) , and then the reduce query was applied to it , giving us :
You can see why it was called reduce , for every batch , we apply a sum by blog_id to get a new Total Comments value .
We started with 11 rows , and we ended up with just 10 .
That is where it gets interesting , because we are still not done , we can still reduce the data further .
This is what we do in the third step , reducing the data further still .
That is why the input & output format of the reduce query must match , we will feed the output of several the reduce queries as the input of a new one .
You can also see that now we moved from having 10 rows to have just 7 .
And the final step is :
And now we are done , we can't reduce the data any further because all the keys are unique .
There is another interesting property of Map / Reduce , let us say that I just added a comment to a post , that would obviously invalidate the results of the query , right ?
Well , yes , but not all of them .
Assuming that I added a comment to the post whose id is 10 , what would I need to do to recalculate the right result ?
Map Doc # 10 again
Reduce Step 2 , Batch # 3 again
Reduce Step 3 , Batch # 1 again
Reduce Step 4
What is important is that I did not have to touch quite a bit of the data , making the recalculation effort far cheaper than it would be otherwise .
And that is ( more or less ) the notion of Map / Reduce .
Gather around all ye LOLcat lovers , YouTube watchers , rabid facebookers and diligent tweeters , for there is good news for you .
Our beloved Internet is in the running for this year 's Nobel Peace Prize .
The Nobel committee 's decision last year to award the Peace Prize to the freshly elected President Obama was considered by many to be an unusual choice , but the committee could top itself this year .
The list of potential winners contains 237 nominees , including human rights activists like Russian Svetlana Gannushkina and Chinese activist Liu Xiaobo , but also our very own Internet .
The effort to get the net nominated was spearheaded by the Italian edition of Wired magazine .
The editors propose that apart from being a place for people to nurture their vanity and satisfy their need to look at kittens in costumes , the Internet is also a forum for peaceful dialogue and communication .
Thus , they say , it plays a valuable role in building peace .
Riccardo Luna , editor - in - chief of the Italian edition of Wired magazine said :
“ The internet can be considered the first weapon of mass construction , which we can deploy to destroy hate and conflict and to propagate peace and democracy .... What happened in Iran after the latest election , and the role the web played in spreading information that would otherwise have been censored , are only the newest examples of how the internet can become a weapon of global hope . ”
So far , the Internet has found a bunch of early backers , including the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi and designer Giorgio Armani .
You can support the net 's nomination by signing an online petition at Internet for Peace .
The results will be announced on October 8th and the winner will walk away with 10 million Swedish kronor ( $ 1.4 million ) .
Which brings us to our next question -- who picks up the award if the net wins ?
And who gets to pocket the cash ?
And most importantly , who gets to blab the acceptance speech ?
While we work those out , here 's the video for the Internet for Peace campaign .

It was a great fight and it depends on how you want to judge a fight .
Boogaard threw a few more punches , but King did more damage to Boogaards face .
More of a draw , but i can see where you can give boogaard a slight edge .
Very good showing for king though .
( edit )
Watch the play in slow motion you will see the first part of the fight where both landed two each , but Kings punches broke Boogaards nose and gave him a cut by the eye .
I wonder how many people would want to fight king now after this fight ?
( edit ) some of you people are blind because King landed 2 punches , not 1 .
You saw the first big one but when they were near the boards king threw 2 more punches , the first one missed , but the second one was the shot on his nose .
you have to watch it closely but you can clearly see the shot to the nose .
After that is when King got in close which what was his gameplan .
he talked to Chase and Jansens about the best way to fight him .
The both agreed he has stay in close .

How the ultra-rich enslave themselves
By George Monbiot , published in the Guardian 22nd February 2010
It ’s a bitter blow .
When the government proposed a windfall tax on bonuses and a 50 p top rate of income tax , thousands of bankers and corporate executives promised to leave the country and move to Switzerland ( 1,2 ) .
Now we discover that the policy has failed : the number of financiers applying for a Swiss work permit fell by 7 % last year ( 3 ) .
The government must try harder to rid this country of its antisocial elements .
Executive flight is the corporate world ’s only effective form of self - regulation : those who are too selfish to pay what they owe to society send themselves into voluntary exile .
It ’s an act of self - sacrifice for which we should all be grateful .
It ’s hard on the Swiss , but there ’s a kind of mortal justice here too : if you sustain a crooked system of banking secrecy and tax avoidance , you end up with a country full of crooks and tax avoiders .
Sadly , most promises of self - imposed exile are empty .
They seem to be intended , like Boris Johnson ’s warning last year that the City of London would be reduced to a ghost town by the new taxes ( 4 ) , to dissuade the government from taking action .
The universal public response , as Tracey Emin found when she announced that she could n’t possibly survive here on her scanty millions ( 5 ) , is “ Go on then , jump . ”
But self - awareness is yet to become the bankers ’ dominant trait .
Last week the president of Barclays insisted that Britain should be “ immensely proud ” of the bank ’s enormous profits ( 6 ) , while the Royal Bank of Scotland announced that it would give its staff bonuses of £ 1.3 bn – 84 % of which belongs to taxpayers – despite making another massive loss ( 7 ) .
The new taxes are being imposed because of the crisis caused by bankers ’ greed .
Yet the bankers seem to believe that we ’ll agree that they are the last people who should have to pay them .
There ’s something else that the threats tell us : some people appear willing to do almost anything for money .
In court papers made public at the beginning of this month , Guy Hands , the owner of the private equity company Terra Firma and the record label EMI , sought to explain why the case he is fighting against Citigroup should not be heard in London .
He moved to Guernsey last April to avoid UK taxes .
Since then , he says , he has “ never visited ” his wife and children , who still live in his former home in Kent , for fear of compromising his tax status .
For the same reason , “ I do not visit my parents in the United Kingdom and would not do so except in an emergency . ” ( 8 )
Hands , according to the Sunday Times rich list , is worth £ 100 m ( 9 ) .
Were he to allow the Exchequer to reclaim a few of his unnecessary millions , he would face neither ruin nor starvation .
He ’s reported to work 18 hours a day ( 10 ) , which means he is unlikely to find much time to enjoy his wealth .
It ’s hard to see how the fraction he has saved through becoming an economic refugee could bring him any discernible benefit , let alone happiness that could compensate for the life he has lost .
Extreme wealth invariably leads to captivity .
Its victims live in an open prison .
In Mexico and Colombia , they and their families face the constant threat of kidnap : they must scurry around , screened and shrouded , as if they were coppers ’ narks .
In Russia they can never be free from the fear of assassination .
Everywhere on earth they live behind walls and razor wire , guarded by cameras , dogs , watch towers and sensors .
The walls that shut the world out also shut them in .
They must , if they wish to maintain their place on the rich lists , also live in fear of their rivals .
Despite their lobbying power , they cannot permanently shake off the authorities , not least because of the irregular tax and accounting methods which helped many of them to become so rich : the remark attributed to Balzac ( “ behind every great fortune lies a great crime ” ) is at least half right .
Who in his right mind would volunteer for this life ?
The Conservative Party ’s most persistent embarrassment is the hazy tax status of its deputy chairman , Lord Ashcroft .
Ashcroft received his peerage in 2000 after promising that he would become a UK taxpayer .
Since then a succession of senior Tories has been quizzed by the media about whether he has redeemed this promise or is still registered in Belize , and they have writhed like hooked eels ( 11,12,13 ) .
Though this issue could explode as the election approaches , neither Ashcroft nor the party have yet produced an answer .
This gives us a pretty good idea of what it must be , and of where the party ’s priorities lie .
For some of the ultra - wealthy , tax avoidance seems to be a matter of principle : they ’ll be damned if they give a penny to the people , whether they would miss it or not .
On the few occasions on which I ’ve met members of this class , I ’ve been struck by their dissidence : they appear to see themselves as lonely rebels engaged in a perpetual fight against authority , even as they strive to get so rich that their own authority becomes impregnable .
In fighting the taxman , they draw on a heroic tradition of resistance .
In the New Testament , or to the Sons of Liberty seeking American independence , taxation was an instrument of colonial oppression .
The context has changed : today the tax avoiders are the oppressors .
But they still regard themselves as insurrectionaries .
Now , at last , the net is starting to close .
Far too late , the British government has begun to abandon its mystifying tolerance of the loss of its funds .
Last year HM Revenue and Customs retrieved three times as much unpaid tax from the very rich as it did five years before ( 14 ) .
In December the government announced that it would impose 200 % penalties on people who fail to declare their bank accounts in uncooperative tax havens ( 15 ) .
Last week the appeal court ruled that the British multimillionaire Robert Gaines - Cooper must pay £ 30 million in back tax , as he retains too many interests in this country to qualify as a resident of the Seychelles ( 16 ) .
The government is considering a new law on British residency , which it will introduce next year , in the unlikely event that it wins the election ( 17 ) .
Why has it left this so long ?
These efforts scarcely scratch the problem .
International attempts to close down tax havens remain half - hearted .
But if by some miracle these measures were to succeed , one haven – let ’s say St Helena – should be kept open .
It should be furnished only with rudimentary homes .
All who chose to could live there in peace .
Every penny they possessed would remain safe from the taxman , as long as they never set foot in another land .
They could sit in their cells and count their money for the rest of their lives .
Parties of schoolchildren would be brought to the island to goggle at these hermits , and learn some lessons about the follies of wealth .

We 're not entirely sure what 's going on here , but that 's a shot of a Droid Eris running Android 2.1 , and we 're told the update came over the air -- a story seemingly corroborated by a couple other people around the web .
Unfortunately , it seems like things are n't quite fully baked yet : the update does n't include Sense UI , and it apparently wipes all your data and does n't allow you to log back into your Google Account .
Verizon tells us that the Eris update to a " newer " Android is still in testing and has n't yet been officially released , so we 're taking all this to mean that there 's been a slip - up along the line -- especially since this obviously is n't final software .
In the meantime , we 'd say Droid Eris users should probably back up their sets just to be safe .

Looks like the immigration debate is back .
First , it was the Arizona law that has spurred some California Democrats to call for a boycott of the state .
Now , Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R - Alpine ) says the federal government should deport U.S. - born children of undocumented immigrants .
" Would you support deportation of natural - born American citizens that are the children of illegal aliens , " Hunter was asked .
" I would have to , yes , " Hunter said . " ...
We simply cannot afford what we 're doing right now , " he said . " ...
It takes more than just walking across the border to become an American citizen .
It 's what 's in our souls . ... "
Hunter made his comments at a " tea party " rally in the San Diego County city of Ramona over the weekend .
You can see a video of his remarks below .

Good evening everybody .
Harry Redknapp seems very confident ahead of tonight 's north London derby , having claimed in his pre-match conference that ( a ) Spurs have only lost one of their last 10 league matches ( they 've lost two ) and that ( b ) when everyone is fit , Spurs have a squad that can match Arsenal ( the current injury - ravaged Arsenal squad , perhaps , despite Harry spending £ 70 m in two transfer windows , a sum dwarfed only by that spent by Manchester City ) .
Meanwhile at The Emirates , Arsenal chairman Peter Hill - Wood has promised fans that Barcelona will not be putting in a bid for Cesc Fabregas during the summer .
That 's good news , as long as those same fans ignore the fact that this is the same Peter Hill - Wood who once claimed Arsenal " do n't need Stan Kroenke 's money and we do n't want his sort " , before skittering excitedly around the moustachioed American 's feet as soon as he waved his big bag of Benjamins .
Team news : Arsenal striker Robin van Persie is named on the bench for tonight 's clash with Tottenham and Arsene Wenger reckons he has 20 - 30 minutes in the locker " .
Van Persie is included in the squad for the first time in five months after recovering from ankle ligament damage .
Sol Campbell starts in defence against his old club while Theo Walcott has to settle for a place among the substitutes .
Captain Ledley King returns for Spurs after being out since February with a thigh injury , while Younes Kaboul and youngster Danny Rose are given the nod in midfield .
" He 's enthusiastic , been training well and a good ... eh ... eh ... passer , " says Harry of young Rose , before cryptically adding : " I nearly gave away his best attribute there , but I do n't think I should . "
Very mysterious .
What is Premier League debutant Danny Rose 's best attribute ?
A hammer for a left foot ?
A hammer for a right foot ?
An extra head ?
The power to make himself invisible just by screwing his eyes up and concentrating really hard ?
Or something more pleasing for the ladies , perhaps ?
Tottenham : Gomes , Assou - Ekotto , Dawson , King , Bale , Kaboul , Huddlestone , Modric , Rose , Pavlyuchenko , Defoe .
Subs : Alnwick , Bentley , Crouch , Gudjohnsen , Bassong , Kyle Walker , Livermore .
Arsenal : Almunia , Sagna , Campbell , Vermaelen , Clichy , Eboue , Diaby , Denilson , Rosicky , Bendtner , Nasri .
Subs : Fabianski , Eduardo , van Persie , Walcott , Silvestre , Merida , Eastmond .
Referee : Mark Clattenburg ( Tyne & Wear )
How they 'll line up : Samir Nasri will attempt to fill Cesc Fabregas 's size sixes tonight , with Abou Diaby and Denilson behind him in midfield supporting roles , and Emmanuel Eboue and Tomas Rosicky patrolling the flanks .
Nicklas Bendtner will play alone up front .
For Tottenham , Danny Rose and Gareth Bale will man the touchlines to the right and left of central midfielders Tom Huddlestone and Luca Modric .
Roman Pavlyuchenko and Jermain Defoe play upfront .
What the Betfair geezers have to say on that really annoying advert :
Geezer No1 ( who looks suspiciously like Norn Iron comedian and actor Michael Smiley ) : " In a derby match , you always bet with your heart . "
Geezer No2 : " In a derby match you always bet on the draw . "
Geezer No3 : " The form book goes out the window . "
Yeah , out the window , innit ?
With your heart , innit ?
Some laser sharp insights there from the Betfair geezers , who are genuinely good friends and not a disparate gang of jobbing actors who got paid £ 4,500 each to turn up and pretend to be compulsive gamblers .
Do n't you wish they were your friends ?
1 min : Arsenal kick off and Sol Campbell 's first few touches are greeted by a crescendo of boos .
He used to play for Tottenham , do n't you know .
Now their supporters hate him so much that they ... really wish he had n't left .
2 min : Arsenal win a corner , which is sent into the mixer from the right .
The ball 's flicked as far as Campbell , who sends a meaty header goalwards .
It beats Gomes , but Benoit Assou - Ekotto saves with his chest on the line .
4 min : I wonder is Benoit Essou - Ekotto is actually aware of the significance of this match ?
By all accounts , he does n't like football , takes no interest in Tottenham 's opposition on any given day and never has any idea what competition they 're even playing in when he lines up at the start of a match or traipses off at the end .
6 min : Gareth
Bale cuts in from the left wing before going down under a challenge in the D surrounding the Arsenal penalty area .
He appeals for a free - kick but does n't get one .
7 min : Rosicky and Eboue combine well down the left wing for Arsenal , with the former playing a give - and - go to the latter , only for the return pass to get lost in a forest of legs in the penalty area .
9 min : Bale takes on and beats Bakari Sagna down the left wing and gets his cross in .
Clichy clears .
The ball finds its way out to Danny Rose on the right wing and he sends in a cross for Pavlyuchenko to attack at the near post .
His shot is blocked by a frantic Thomas Vermaelen lunge - corner for Spurs .
GOAL !
Tottenham Hotspur 1 - 0 Arsenal ( Rose 9 min ) Danny Rose , 19 , scores on his Premier League debut with a volley from at least 40 yards .
That 's a sensational strike !
Spurs had a corner , which was sent in from the right by Modric .
Almunia punched it into the night sky , from where it dropped to Rose in the left channel .
He sent it back with interest , rifling a left - footed volley over Almunia and under the crossbar from 35 - 40 yards out .
Now we know what that secret weapon Harry Redknapp was talking about is .
Rose should retire now , because he 's never going to top that if he plays for another 20 years .
14 min :
That 's a turn - up for the books and no mistake .
Arsenal were on top , but have been left shell - shocked by that sucker - punch .
It was an astonishingly good goal and Danny Rose was mobbed by his astonished team - mates in the wake of scoring it .
16 min : Arsenal attack down the left flank again .
They 're dominating possession , but doing very little with it .
18 min : Arsenal have a problem .
Thomas Vermaelen goes down injured with what looks like a pulled calf muscle in his right leg .
On the touchline , Arsene Wenger is fuming , which is unsurprising seeing as he 's going to have to press Mikael Silvestre into action .
Arsenal substitution : Silvestre on , Vermaelen off .
20 min : Free - kick for Tottenham , just inside their own half .
Dawson larrups the ball forward towards Bale , who loses possession to Campbell .
He clears .
21 min : Slaloming through the centre , Samir Nasri beats two Spurs defenders before pinging a diagonal pass out to Eboue on the right flank .
He attempts to cross , but his efffort is blocked .
23 min : Spurs concede a corner , which Arsenal take short .
The ball is worked across to the right touchline , from where Eboue sends in a low cross that 's eventually hacked clear by Dawson .
24 min : Tottenham 's defence gets stretched and Nasri threads a ball through their defence into the path of Bendtner .
Offside , but not by much .
25 min : " Did you know that it is almost 100 years to the day since the first league match at Tottenham between these two clubs ? " asks Tony Attwood .
" The first game was on April 16 1910 .
The big difference was that 100 years ago this was a relegation battle .
A draw for Woolwich Arsenal would mean that they would stay up , a defeat for Tottenham could spell disaster , meaning they would almost certainly go down with Bolton .
The crowd was also almost the same - 38,000 100 years ago .
And yet this was not a London derby .
Woolwich Arsenal was in Kent and Tottenham at that time was in Middlesex , not London . "
27 min : Thanks for that Tony .
A genuinely interesting nugget of trivia there .
Have you thought about trying this ?
28 min : Arsenal go close , but Nicklas Bendtner gets the ball trapped under his feet and eventually digs it out to scuff a shot wide from six yards .
29 min : Arsenal win a throw - in in the Spurs half on the edge of the final third .
Denilson chucks the ball to Clichy , who promptly gives it away .
30 min : " Good history from Mr Attwood , " writes Gary Naylor .
" Does he know if Sol played in that match ? " I could n't tell you , Gary .
Did you send messages via carrier pigeon to whoever was writing the minute - by - minute report on it ?
31 min : Good defending from Benoit Essou - Ekotto who defends ... good ... ly , going down in a tangle of arms and legs with Bakari Sagna as he shepherds / bundles both Arsenal full - back and ball out over the endline .
33 min : If Suzanne Vega was here , she'd be serenading referee Mark Clattenburg with a rendtion of " His name is Luka ... "
The official takes down Modric 's name and waves his yellow card after the Spurs midfielder cynically blocks Sagna .
From the ensuing free - kick , Arsenal win a corner , which Gomes punches clear .
35 min :
The first booking is swifly followed by the second .
Denilson gets cautioned for a trip on goalscorer Danny Rose .
36 min : Now Kaboul 's name goes in the book , unfairly , after Rosicky ran across his path as he cut inside from the left wing on a goalward charge .
Kaboul did n't actually tackle him - Rosicky ran into him and fell over .
Free - kick for Arsenal , 25 yards out , well left of centre .
37 min : Nothing comes of it .
38 min : A rare sortie into the Arsenal box from Spurs , down the right flank .
The ball is crossed and only half cleared to Kaboul on the right - hand side of the area .
With Jermain Defoe unmarked at the far post and screaming for the ball , the right - back misplaces his pass and gifts possession to Almunia .
39 min : Modric misses what looks like a sitter that would have put Spurs two up .
Picking up the ball 25 yards from the Arsenal goal , he was ushered through by Silvestre , for reasons best known to the centre - half , rode a Gael Clichy challenge and found himself through on goal with only Almunia to beat .
The goalkeeper was quick off his line however and got down early to smother the shot .
Lionel Messi would have just scooped it over him , but Modric was unable to do so .
42 min : With Nicklas
Bendtner loitering on the edge of the penalty area , Gael Clichy has nobody to pass to after making a driving run into the Tottenham box .
He tries a shot , but hits the side netting .
43 min : " What , a goal by Danny Rose and no - one 's made any Woody Allen references yet ? " asks DH Cauthery .
" For shame .
I bet when the goal went in all the Spurs fans went Bananas .
Although if a bigger club comes in for him in the summer I reckon he should just Take the Money and Run .
As for Redknapp 's cryptic comments about him in the preamble , well , Deconstructing Harry 's never been easy .
I 'm sorry , I 'll go away now . "
45 + 1 min : " I 'd honestly never heard of this movie three minutes ago .
Half - time : Mark Clattenburg interrupts a game of head - tennis on the edge of the Tottenham penalty area with the half - time whistle .
Spurs go in a goal up .
On the balance of play they probably do n't deserve to be winning , but considering they went ahead through a goal of the season contender scored by a 19 - year - old making his Premier League debut , who 'd begrudge them their lead ?
Half - time emails : " Thanks for jinxing it with your 4 - 1 prediction in the Fiver , " writes Aidan Gibson , who does n't seem to realise that my prediction is well on the way to being spookily accurate .
" If Arsene Wenger wants to make this team as good as Barcelona he needs to focus more on who's on the field and less on copying Pep Guardiola 's touchline outfits , " writes Sean Orlowicz .
The atmosphere at White Hart Lane : Commentator Alan Parry has been saying it's " vibrant " , which I suppose is one way of describing the noise generated by thousands of morons singing " Sit down you paedophile ! " at Arsene Wenger .
No doubt we can expect a deluge of correspondence to follow from Spurs fans pointing out that ( a ) it 's only a small minority ( it 's always a small but remarkably vocal minority ) and ( b ) Manchester United fans sing it louder and with more venom .
This from Robert Meiklejohn : " With such a big goal in such a big game can Danny Rose also look forward to a glittering career with the likes of Preston North End ? " he asks .
Second half : Danny
Rose has been taken off , either because he 's picked up a knock , or realised the futility of carrying on after beginning his Premier League career with a goal that good .
Follow that , David Bentley .
GOAL !
Tottenham Hotspur 2 - 0 Arsenal ( Bale 46 ) Tottenham double their lead .
With the Arsenal defence caught napping , Gareth Bale prods the ball inside the right post from about six yards after running on to an excellent diagonal pass through the penalty area from Jermain Defoe .
48 min : The defending there was atrocious .
Campbell let Defoe saunter past him , the slack - jawed Clichy was standing with his arm up despite Sagna playing everyone on - side , Silvestre was day - dreaming ...
Wenger is going to be furious .
A draw is no good to Arsenal here - they need to win .
Chelsea 's players must be watching this with glee .
50 min : Spurs are tearing Arsenal apart here .
First Bale , then King maraud forward with the ball at their feet , trying potshots from distance .
Nothing comes of them .
Arsenal susbtitution : Walcott on , Sagna off .
Eboue moves back to right - back .
53 min : Walcott gets his first touch on the right flank .
He crosses , Dawson clears .
The ball drops for Eboue who shoots high and wide from 25 yards .
Dawson and King have been in total control in the Spurs penalty area tonight - I 'd say they 'll be content for Arsenal to continue sending crosses in for them to clear all night .
55 min : " Chelsea will be watching this with glee , until they remember it 's Spurs trying to hold on to the lead , " writes Mark Goodman .
" Surely they will bottle this . "
56 min : Theo Walcott gets double - teamed by Gareth Bale and Benoit A - E , if that 's not too sordid an image .
The young England tyro sprints down a blind alley and lets the ball run out over the endline .
Goal - kick for Tottenham after some good defending .
58 min : " The Chelsea players can literally watch this with ' Glee ' if they have Sky Multi - room set up on adjacent plasma screens , " writes Sean Welch , who I suspect may have played bass in a famous young people 's beat music combo from Hull , but is now more focussed on punsmithery than tunesmithery .
59 min : " Why do you hate Spurs ? " asks Michael Philip , who only needs to see his team go two up against Arsenal before getting delusions of adequacy and notions above his station .
I 'm fairly indifferent to Spurs , Michael , but if anyone was really looking for a reason to dislike them , this YouTube footage could provide one .
61 min : Bentley whips in an excellent cross from the right wing , which both Jermain Defoe and Roman Pavlyuchenko fail to capitalise on in quick succession .
63 min : Arsenal ping the ball around on the edge of the final third , wondering what to do next .
63 min :
With no opportunites to try and walk the ball into the net presenting themselves , Walcott opts for the more agricultural approach and sends in a cross from the right flank .
King heads clear ... again .
65 min : Eboue sends in a deep cross from the right , which Nasri volleys back across the Tottenham penalty area from the left .
Spurs clear comfortably .
They 're under the cosh , but coping admirably .
66 min : Bendtner goes close after being sent on his way by a pass down the right channel from Walcott .
Under pressure from King , he shoots low and diagonally across the face of goal .
Wide .
He should have hit the target .
67 min : Here he comes .
Arsenal substitution : Van Persie on , Denilson off .
Tottenham substitution : Gudjohnsen on , Defoe off .
69 min : Van Persie picks out Bendtner with a marvellous pass , sending the great Dane lolloping up the right channel towards Tottenham 's penalty area .
He loses the ball .
Moments previously , Gudjohnsen had skewed an excellent scoring opportunity out towards the right touchline with his first touch .
70 min : " Danny Rose 's goal is up on YouTube already ( well , until Sky take it down ) , " writes Paul Jaines .
" In 10 years we will all be saying ' What ever happened to that young Danny chap from Spurs ? '
My bet is Southend . "
Bloody hell - it did n't take long for that to go up .
Danny must have a laptop in the dressing room .
72 min : Arsenal are throwing the kitchen sink at Spurs , but to little avail .
Imagine having somebody repeatedly throw a kitchen sink at you , but only occasionally getting it on target .
Now imagine you have two big burly blokes named Ledley and Michael watching your back , who like nothing better in this life than heading kitchen sinks as far away from them as they possibly can .
That 's what this match is like .
74 min : Benoit A - E pings in a cross from the left flank , trying to pick out Pavlyuchenko or Gudjohnsen .
Campbell clears .
76 min :
In the left channel , Tomas Rosicky tries a shot from distance .
His effort fizzes well wide , closer to the corner flag than the Tottenham goal .
79 min : Tottenham are completely bossing this match now , with Arsenal reduced to pinging the ball around just inside the Spurs half , or trying shots from distance .
They 're 2 - 0 up and as Danny Baker might say , nothing can go wrong now !!!
80 min : Or can it ?
Van Persie goes close , holding off
Bale to chest down a cross from Diaby , swivel and volley from 10 yards .
Gomes pulls off a sensational save .
82 min : From the corner , Rosicky gets the ball on the edge of the area .
His low drive takes a deflection and goes narrowly wide .
Another corner .
82 min : Michael Dawson gets booked for a foul on Diaby .
Free - kick for Arsenal , about 25 yards out , just right of centre .
Van Persie takes it and hits the target , bringing another magnificent finger - tip save out of Huerelho Gomes , who tips the ball around his right upright for a corner .
That was a wonderful free - kick and a wonderful save .
Another corner for Arsenal .
GOAL !
Tottenham 2 - 1 Arsenal ( Bendtner 83 )
On the edge of the Tottenham penalty area , Van Persie conducts the orchestra .
He picks up the ball from Eboue on the left , then pings it towards Walcott on the right .
He drills in a low cross and Bendtner gets his ninth goal in 11 games for Arsenal , sliding it home from four yards .
The good news for Spurs fans is that they 're still winning 2 - 1 - nothing can go wrong now !
86 min : Moments before Arsenal pulled that goal back , Gomes had saved brilliantly for a third time in quick succession .
Campbell had got on the end of an inswinger from the left and looked to have scored with a bullet - header from point - blank range , only for the Tottenham goalkeeper to pull off another marvellous save .
87 min :
Yet another fine save from Gomes , who beats away a Bendtner drive for what should be a corner , but is strangely given as a goal kick .
Gomes is really keeping his team in the game here .
I can't stress enough , by the way , how rejuvenated Arsenal have looked since Van Persie has entered the fray .
He 's a wonderful player and he 's been a huge loss for them in recent months .
89 min : It 's all Arsenal now - they 're really turning the screw and would probably be ahead if it was n't for the heroics of Gomes , who had little to do tonight before being pressed into service time and time again in the past 10 minutes .
Speaking of minutes , there 'll be four of injury time .
90 +1 min : Tottenham substitution : Pavlyuchenko off , Crouch on .
90 + 1 min : Spurs win a throw - in , which they 're in no rush to take , for obvious reasons .
90+2 min : Eboue gifts possession to Bale , who heads straight for the corner .
Sol Campbell robs him of possession and passes the ball to Almunia .
He launches it down the field , where it eventually ends up in the warm embrace of Gomes .
90+3 min :
This is wonderful - real edge - of - the - seat stuff at the end of a thrilling game of football .
Tottenham win a corner , which they play short and try to keep in the corner .
Peep !
Peep !
Peep !
It 's all over - Tottenham have won and are deserving victors ... but only just .
They 've taken three points off Arsenal in a League match for the first time in over a decade .
Their heroes were a 19 - year - old debutant and a Brazilian goalkeeper that was once a laughing stock , but rode the storm of giggles to become the best goalkeeper in the Premier League , if not Europe .
This result pretty much ends Arsenal 's chances of winning the title and enables Spurs to keep up the race for fourth place ( and the opportunity to be dumped out of the Champions League qualifiers by AC Milan or PSV ) with Manchester City .
It 's also going to make for an awkward Football Weekly podcast for yours truly tomorrow morning - I 've been predicitng a Spurs collapse for months .
It looks like their humbling at the hands of Sunderland a couple of weeks ago was it .
Nothing can go wrong now !

The news came out last night that the early trending numbers for UFC 110 are weak , in the 215,000 to 240,000 range -- which is comparable to many of the UFC 's foreign tape - delayed events .
The difference was that UFC 110 , because it occurred on Sunday afternoon in Australia , aired live in the U.S. at the regular 10 pm EST slot .
First off , keep in mind that these same trending numbers for UFC 108 indicated a disastrous number for that event but later reports showed that the numbers were weak , but not as bad as initially feared .
Still , 108 ended up doing around 300,000 which is still very weak for a U.S. UFC in the post - TUF era .
Our own Michael Rome predicted something like this for UFC 110 :
We are just a few days away from UFC 110 , a card that has a number of appealing fights but simultaneously lacks anything with serious drawing power .
The event also comes just two weeks after UFC 109 , leaving the UFC with precious little time to promote the event in the United States , especially considering the fact that almost everyone in the organization is already in Australia or on their way there .
The main event is a very intriguing fight .
Cain Velasquez has stormed through everyone he 's fought , but Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira represents a serious step up in competition from the likes of Cheick Kongo and Ben Rothwell .
Unfortunately , the intriguing stylistic aspects of this match probably will not be converted to PPV buys .
Velasquez is a relative unknown to UFC fans , and Nogueira , while known , has never drawn a big number in the United States .
The real " draw " of the show is the co-main event between Wanderlei Silva and Michael Bisping .
Unfortunately for the UFC , Bisping has been very humble in his approach to this fight , leaving them without much of a hook to sell this fight on .
Given the shallow nature of the UFC middleweight division , the winner of this fight will probably only be a fight or two away from a title shot .
The rest of the card is packed with interesting fights that do n't mean a lot to casual fans .
Internally , people at the UFC are excited to get this card out of the way and get onto a number of big cards with title matches .
It 's usually hard to predict a buyrate until the day before a show , and since I like to stay safe , I 'm going to predict the number falls between 275,000 and 325,000 buys .
BE commenter NotThe Face puts the 110 numbers in context :
In 2009 the UFC averaged 620,000 buys per ppv event .
If we look at the percentage each event was above or below that average we can definitely see a downward trend from 100 .
UFC 100 1,600,000 + 245 %
UFC 101 850,000 + 29 %
UFC 102 435,000 - 30 %
UFC 103 375,000 - 40 %
UFC 104 500,000 - 20 %
UFC 106 375,000 - 40 %
UFC 107 620,000 +/- 0
UFC 108 300,000 - 51 %
UFC 109 275,000 - 55 %
UFC 110 240,000 - 62 %
Wow .
Is the UFC in a downward spiral .
But here is the other interesting thing we should look at when discussing 2009 ppv buys :
Average with title on line 820,000
Average with non -title main event 370,000 Since 100 there ( have ) been 3 cards with title defenses ( 101 , 104 , and 107 ) and 6 ppv cards without titles on the line .
Lesson to learn ?
Those belts really matter .
Because of their commitment to international expansion and their failure to lock down a deal with HBO in 2007 , the UFC has had too many events and not enough television venues .
Pay cable would have been an elegant solution to bringing American fans the European / Australian events .
As it is , they 're kind of dumped onto the American PPV market in the late afternoon or on Spike TV via tape delay .
Neither is an ideal situation .
But many of the flop events of 2009 / 2010 were NOT international events : 102 , 103 , 106 , 108 and 109 were just flat out duds .
Much of that had to do with bad luck and injuries .
But the refusal to cancel any of those events in the face of so many fluke fighter cancellations reflects a kind of hubris and inertia that is cause for concern .
The UFC has definitely lost the upward momentum that it had coming out of UFC 100 that carried over to UFC 101 .
Another topic that has n't been brought up much , is the ongoing financial difficulties of Station Casinos , the foundation of the Fertitta family empire .
They just reached terms with their creditors this week , allowing them to retain control of the casinos despite owing more than $ 2.4 billion .
The Las Vegas Sun reported earlier this week that part of that deal included a major payment from the Fertittas :
The Fertittas would make a substantial , but undisclosed , equity investment and the current management team led by Chairman and Chief Executive Frank Fertitta III would continue to lead the company .
MMA Payout noted that and connected some dots :
Note the " substantial , but undisclosed , equity investment " that the Fertittas will have to make in order to retain control of the company .
The cash from the 10 % sale of Zuffa LLC . to Flash Entertainment in Abu Dhabi might come in handy .
In today 's volatile no - you - own - it - now - you - do n't business climate , MMA fans should n't be too sanguine about the continued success of the UFC .
Things just get harder as the stakes get higher .

SCOPE merges the basic characteristics of video games and real - life toys to improve existing games or create new ones .
By attributing various virtual parameters commonly used in video games ( power , life , magic , experience , attack , weapons , etc. ) to tangible toys , it brings the toys to life .
With this approach , it is possible to create all sorts of videogame concepts mixed with the real world .
For example , a child ’s bedroom could become a natural battleground for play .
After the earlier post on the list of 10 AR Concept Games , someone on Twitter pointed out another fantastic game in - concept from Frantz Lasorne called “ Scope ” .
From the description :
It ’s an interesting concept using head - mounted displays for visuals and vision direction for selection ( which is a bit clunky but effective ) .
In the example he shows a turn - based battle - game between a lego man and some small bear toy ( a mimobot maybe ? )
See some video demonstrations of the concept after the break .

The following is what Adam wrote in response to a question on an AMA ( ask me anything ) : Former Mormon feature I did elsewhere on the web .
He apologizes for rambling .
-------------
Why was my mission the worst two years of my life ?
Well , the answer is going to be really big , really personal , and really hard to explain because I 'm going to have to give background info at every step .
I honestly do n't know if this even scratches the surface .
Looking back at everything I 've written I 'm realizing it would take an entire book to get the full message across .
First of all , you need to understand the social expectation of every " worthy " young man of 19 years to serve a mission .
Young women are taught their whole lives to stay pure so they can meet that special RM ( Returned Missionary ) and get married in the temple .
In a lot of ways , your mission is your breeding license , indicating to all the ladies that you 're good enough material in God 's eyes to be the father of their children .
After that it 's just a matter of them picking which one they like the best .
I guess girls are naturally pure and lovely , and do n't need to do anything to prove their worth .
A mission becomes your plumage for attracting a mate .
Without it you 're kind of hooped .
So what does being " worthy " to serve a mission mean ?
Well , you need to be keeping the commandments , especially the Law of Chastity .
There are conflicting reports , but I 've heard of guys who had sex in high school , repented , and were not allowed to serve because of their prior transgressions .
In mormon theology , breaking the Law of Chastity is second in severity only to murder : God decides who comes and goes , and those who take those powers into their own hands are in big trouble .
Now imagine you 're a fourteen year old boy .
Everybody knows what fourteen year old boys do .
Now imagine you 're in your sunday school lesson and your teacher points out that the law of chastity can be broken BY YOURSELF .
Just stop and think about the terror and internal turmoil of a fourteen year old who realizes that what they 've been doing in private is the second worst thing they could possibly do in God 's eyes .
Thus begins the shame spiral .
Now I do n't know about everybody else , but I do n't see how people ( especially teenage boys ) can just turn off the desire to masturbate unless they 've got some sort of asexual medical condition .
Each time you " relapse , " you feel disgusting , unworthy , and hopeless .
Each time , you promise that it will NEVER happen again .
After going through this process for weeks , months , and years on end , a person 's self worth becomes permanently damaged .
They cannot help but view themselves as broken somehow .
Imagine raising someone to think that food is sinful , and they must never partake .
It 's like Alcoholics Anonymous , but for breathing .
It 's just not healthy .
Every week in sacrament meeting the young men prepare and bless the sacrament .
Each week you are acutely aware of your unworthiness and inadequacy .
Then suddenly you 're 18 1/2 .
There is a rather explicit expectation for every worth young man to serve a mission when he 's 19 .
It 's time to get ready for a mission .
You know that they have " raised the bar " on the worthiness standards .
They expect you to be abstinent of all sexuality .
People as when you 're putting your papers in .
What do you tell them ?
Do you delay ?
Do you decline ?
Every ward ( congregation ) has " that person " who did n't serve a mission .
They 're the weird 35 year old with no family , no prospects .
Sometimes they go inactive ( stop coming to church ) .
The time came and they did n't step up to the plate .
So you tell yourself that you 've got it all under control , that despite your shortcomings you are worthy enough to serve .
I never even had the opportunity to stop and decide if this was something I wanted to do : it was expected of me , and nobody says no to the Lord .
* sigh *
This topic is so big , and I 've just scratched the surface , yet I do n't even know if I 'm getting the idea across .
So anyway , you end up on your mission .
Everyone tries their best to project the outward model of what you are supposed to be , and you feel like you are the only on who is struggling on the inside to even WANT to be that .
But you do n't stop trying .
It 's like the woman in an abusive relationship who takes her beating and then frets over what she must have done to deserve it .
The mission is two years completely dedicated to the Lord 's work : anyone who does n't love selflessly giving themselves to their Heavenly Father must not be living the Gospel right .
For two years you lose your first name .
You are given a new identity : " Elder / Sister So-and - so . "
You are supposed to lose yourself in the work , and really you do .
You start to lose all sense of who you are as a person , you see yourself only as a missionary , as a tool in God 's hands .
Except that only makes it worse , does n't it ?
Because people are n't meant to be perfect .
People are meant to have flaws .
But a flawed tool in God 's hands ?
You 're shortchanging God .
After all
He 's given you , he just asks for two years and you can't even do that properly .
And the work itself is grueling , vapid , and depressing .
Each day you wake up at 6:00 .
You have one hour for personal preparation ( breakfast , exercise , shower , dressing ) , and then it 's study time .
For three hours every morning you study the scriptures , the lesson manuals , various teaching aids .
You are expected to be a scriptorian .
And Mormons have a lot more scriptures !
On top of the Old and New Testament , there is the Book of Mormon , the Doctrine and Covenants , and the Pearl of Great Price .
At 10:00 , you hit the streets .
Door - to door tracting , street contacting , anyone , anywhere .
Nobody wants to listen to you .
You spend from 10 am to 8 pm being rejected by every person you see .
The only people who ever let us in to talk to them were those with obvious social or mental problems , who we referred to as " less accountable . "
We preyed on the weak , the lonely , the ignorant , while being constantly foiled and frustrated by the intelligent and well informed .
Although in hindsight I can see why nobody wanted to listen to the batshit crazy nonsense we were spouting , at the time we knew that the message was perfect : the fault must therefore lie in the messenger .
Each evening we would return to our apartments and call in our numbers to our supervisor : how many hours we had spent doing what .
How many people had actually let us speak to them .
How many return visits we had scheduled .
Our teaching sessions were called " discussions " rather than " lessons , " but they really were n't anything of the sort .
We were explicitly instructed to tell them our message , but that we were not supposed to hear their contradicting view in return .
The people I had to put up with made me want to kill myself .
Those who achieved leadership roles in the mission organization tended to be horrendously arrogant and self - righteous .
Authority in a theocracy comes down from God , through other people above you , so you can't really complain against them without complaining against God .
Each person for each position is chosen by revelation , and they are entitled to receive revelation to guide those under their stewardship .
That means that if you have an asshole for a Zone Leader who says everyone who does n't baptize someone this month is n't dedicated enough to the Lord 's work , that is the divinely revealed truth .
Then when you work your ass off all month and nobody gets baptized , it lands on your shoulders .
When they accuse you of things you did n't do , it turns out you 're wrong .
When they 're assholes and steal your personal belongings that they do n't think are in line with being a missionary , you can't complain .
For two years the mission decided what music I was allowed to listen to ( only things with the church 's logo , or classical music pre-1900's ) , when I was allowed to call home ( on Christmas and Mother 's Day , 30 minutes each ) , and who I could write emails to ( only family members ) .
They decided how many hours I had per week to buy groceries and do my laundry .
I had no recreation to speak of ( I started gluing popsicle sticks together out of boredom ) .
Missionaries are paired with a " companion " who lives , eats , studies , and works with you .
Literally the only time that they are not at arm 's length is when you are in the bathroom .
These are assigned as well .
I do n't really know how to get this across .
It was two years of the most mentally and emotionally damaging abuse I 've experienced in my life .
I vividly recall one morning , sometime early in my second year , when I realized how much longer I had left to go .
I was standing in the kitchen , holding the largest knife I could find .
I was trying to figure out how exactly to drop it on my foot to injure me enough to be sent home honorably without making me permanently disabled for life .
I was literally weighing which appendages I could stand to lose to get out .
If none of the particulars of what it was like get the message across , maybe that will at least let you know how it impacted me .
I came very very close to dropping the knife .
So I spent two years being a horrible person , dedicating my soul to being better at it , and feeling like a failure for not loving it .
I 'm also going to be talking a lot about masturbation , so you can go ahead and skip the whole post if that makes you uncomfortable .
A newfound frog species undergoes a " striking " change from a black , yellow - spotted youngster to a peach - colored , blue - eyed adult , scientists say .
Oreophryne ezra was discovered in 2004 in a tiny , mountaintop cloud forest in southeastern Papua New Guinea .
The forest has been long avoided by locals , who believe the misty jungle to be taboo , and perhaps guarded by spirits .
Though a few other frogs are known to switch colors as they mature , " I do n't think the difference in color pattern is as startling as what 's seen in this species , " said Fred Kraus , a vertebrate zoologist at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu , Hawaii .
But why the amphibian undergoes such a drastic transition is far from black and white , added Kraus , leader of a new study on the frog in the December 2009 issue of the journal Copeia .
( See a picture of another color - changing frog species found last August . )
The juveniles look like poison dart frogs , so " the first thing that comes to mind is ' warning , ' " Kraus said .
The young frogs even sit on leaves in broad daylight , consistent with the " danger does n't bother me " audacity of poisonous frogs , he added .
But " if the juvenile has a warning color , why would adults lose it ?
It makes no sense at all . "
To solve at least part of the riddle , Kraus would like to test whether the young frogs have poison to back up their bluster .
Color - Changing Frog Threatened by Warming
But Kraus may have to hurry up — even fear of spirits can't protect the frogs and their extremely small home against global climate change .
For one , cloud forests — which require cool temperatures to thrive — may dry up as the planet warms .
Cold - averse lowland plants may also start to creep uphill and displace mountain - dwelling species .

FRANKFURT — The European Central Bank is struggling to limit the fallout from Greece 's debt crisis on European financial institutions as it confronts a fresh problem closer to home : its own balance sheet .
Greek and other European banks likely have posted billions of euros in Greek government bonds and other securities as collateral for ECB loans .
The central bank , which has largely replaced the private market as a source of funding for Greece , could face losses on its loan portfolio if Greek financial institutions fail and Athens ...

Andrew Breitbart has been waiting 45 minutes for a filet mignon .
He drums his fingers on the table in this plush Italian restaurant off Times Square , a place where the media types he regularly trashes used to flaunt their expense accounts — back when they still had them .
Breitbart looks around for a waiter and launches into a stem - winder about collusion between Hollywood and the press — the " subtle and not - so - subtle use of propaganda to make a center - right nation move to the left .
" It 's not just the nightly news , " he says .
" You 're also getting television shows that reflect the same worldview , where Republicans are always the bad guys .
Al Qaeda 's never the bad guy .
The Republican is always the bad guy . "
From Danger Room
Acorn Filmmaker Made Tapes at U.S. Government Offices , Too
From anyone else , this would be just talk — or talking points .
( No terrorist bad guys on TV ?
Really ? )
But Breitbart is one of the people who rams those points into the popular consciousness .
Until last September , the beefy 41 - year - old with graying blond hair was a largely covert power in the right - wing media , the hidden hand behind the popular Drudge Report who also , weirdly , cofounded the liberal Huffington Post .
But then he struck out on his own .
Today his collection of Web sites draws more than 10 million readers a month .
He has a book deal worth more than half a million dollars , and he 's a regular presence on Fox News — where he 's headed later tonight , in fact .
The covert thing is out the window .
The filet finally shows and Breitbart digs in , ignoring the risk to his mustard - colored sports coat .
" The idea is that I have to screw with media , and I have to screw with the Left , in order to give legitimate stories the ability to reach their natural watermark , " he says .
After just a few bites of steak , Breitbart splits .
He has a meeting on the East Side with his lawyer to prep for a hearing tomorrow .
The Brooklyn DA is investigating the housing advocacy group Acorn and wants to talk to Breitbart about the infamous videos he spread all over television and the Internet last year that show Acorn staffers offering to help a man and a " teenage hooker " set up a brothel full of underage Salvadoran prostitutes .
( The DA would eventually find " no criminality " in the actions of the Acorn staffers . )
Later that evening , Breitbart arrives at the offices of Fox News on Sixth Avenue .
Host Sean Hannity greets him with a fist - bump and calls him " bruthah . "
Doug Schoen , Bill Clinton 's former pollster , waves hello .
Then the three of them walk into a cavernous television studio covered in stars and stripes .
" Breitbart , you did n't bring video tonight .
What 's up with that ? "
Hannity asks as the cameras start rolling .
Breitbart smiles a little .
" Oh , in the next year there will be more .
More than we all can handle , " he answers .
Hannity extracts a promise for an exclusive .
" This is changing the face of journalism , " he says .
Schoen pipes in : " It 's changing the face of politics , too . "
The taping ends with small talk and handshakes .
Afterward , Breitbart heads downstairs to visit Greg Gutfeld , who hosts the Fox overnight show Red Eye .
Then they meet up with Felix Dennis , the high - flying founder of Maxim magazine , and spend the rest of the evening at a midtown club drinking Cristal .
For someone who claims to hate the " Democrat - media complex , " Breitbart sure knows how to work it .
Few people are better at packaging information for maximum distribution and impact .
He is , depending on whom you ask , either the " leading figure in this right - wing creation of a parallel universe of lies and idiotic conspiracy theories " ( that was liberal critic Eric Boehlert of Media Matters for America ) or " the most dangerous man on the right today " ( from Michael Goldfarb , Republican consultant and former campaign aide to John McCain ) .
Breitbart is , in short , expert in making the journalism industry his bitch .
" The market has forced me to come up with techniques to be noticed , " Breitbart says .
" And now that I have them , I 'm like , wow , this is actually great .
This is fun . "
When he is n't on TV or drinking with rich guys , Andrew Breitbart spends most days combing through the thousands of tips he receives via email , instant message , and Twitter .
He passes on the choicest of those to the editors of his three group blogs : Big Hollywood , which focuses on liberals ' hold on pop culture ; Big Journalism , which calls out the press for lefty bias ; and Big Government , which — take a guess .
He also runs Breitbart.com , which essentially broadcasts headlines from wire services .
His fifth site , Breitbart.tv , hosts political videos .
It would be a lot to keep track of for someone with laserlike focus ; Breitbart is more of a disco ball .
" I have ADD , OK ?
Like I 'm 17 crack - addled monkeys on spring break .
It 's very difficult to organize my day , " he says .
It 's true .
After scheduling to meet in LA for this story , he instead kept a conflicting appointment in Washington .
But he could n't meet me there , either ; he was headed to New York .
And when I finally cornered him in Manhattan , he could n't remember the address of the building where his family keeps a studio apartment or where he had put the keys .
But a great tip can always capture his attention .
Today , for example , he 's working in that apartment , reading about the finances of Media Matters , the press watchdog that has devoted hundreds of posts in the past four months to bashing Breitbart .
He stares at his laptop screen .
" Oh , this is good .
This is good , " he mutters .
" They raised $ 10 million this year .
I 'm working out of a basement , and I 'm kicking their fucking asses . "
He 's also waiting for the man behind the Acorn videos , a conservative activist and guerrilla documentarian named James O'Keefe , who records himself and his cohorts performing outlandish , politically charged stunts .
He once offered Planned Parenthood money to abort African American babies .
( The organization said it would accept the donation . )
Last year , O'Keefe , posing as a college student and aspiring politician , went with a scantily clad confederate to the offices of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now in several cities .
Incredibly , staffers at the federally funded organization were ready to help him house 13 teenage prostitutes from El Salvador .
The first step : " Stop saying ' prostitution , ' " one Baltimore Acorn worker tells O'Keefe 's associate .
" If anyone asks you , your business is a ' performing artist . ' "
O'Keefe 's previous antics had failed to garner much attention , so he flew across country to show his footage to Breitbart , a guy known in conservative circles for his ability to incite media mayhem .
Breitbart delivered .
He was starting Big Government and needed attention for the new site .
He deployed an army of 200 bloggers to write post after post about Acorn , giving the story momentum that once would have required a swarm of media outlets to achieve .
Fox News ran several segments on the first day alone .
Breitbart initially released only the video from Acorn 's Baltimore bureau , which the group dismissed as an isolated incident .
The next day , he posted a video of O'Keefe getting similar results in Washington , DC .
Oops .
Acorn stepped on the rake again , claiming the videos were doctored .
Then Breitbart posted more — from New York City , San Diego , and Philadelphia .
Congress started pulling Acorn 's funding , and The New York Times flagellated itself for its " slow reflexes " in covering the story .
The traffic on Breitbart 's sites exploded , and he knew he had found a star .
Breitbart signed up O'Keefe to ... well , to something .
At one point , Breitbart said he and O'Keefe had a " first - look deal , " similar to what a Hollywood producer might give a hot screenwriter .
On another occasion , Breitbart talked about his purchase of O'Keefe 's " life rights . "
O'Keefe finally lopes into the Manhattan apartment , wearing a black newsboy cap and leather jacket .
Only the stubble on his chin keeps him looking 25 instead of a skinny 14 .
He is as serious as Breitbart is goofy , as focused as Breitbart is scattered .
All O'Keefe will say about his relationship with Breitbart is " He does n't tell me what to shoot . "
Then he asks me to turn off my tape recorder , powers up his laptop , and talks us through his latest sting .
I keep taking notes .
This time , there are no prostitutes involved , just a shady , and serious , tax - fraud scheme .
The ploy involves the Obama administration 's 10 percent tax credit to first - time home buyers .
The law says that the credit maxes out at $ 8,000 for an $ 80,000 home .
But at the Detroit office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development , the rule seems open to interpretation .
O'Keefe asks a staffer , What if I bought a place for $ 50,000 , but the seller and I agreed to write down $ 80,000 as the purchase price ?
" Flip it any way you want , " the staffer replies .
What if the place is worth much less — like only $ 6,000 ?
" Yup , you can do that . "
O'Keefe and fellow activist Joe Basel ran the same sting at HUD 's Chicago office and at several federally supported independent housing groups .
Breitbart paces the parquet floor .
The video is damning but not exactly Acorn - explosive .
Then O'Keefe stops the playback .
" Oh yeah , I forgot , " he says .
" We went to the Detroit Free Press , to the managing editor .
We told her the whole thing .
She said she was n't interested .
Wanna see the tape ? "
Breitbart starts to cackle .
Of course he wants to see the tape .
Sleazy HUD administrators are important , sure .
But media covering up sleaze ?
That 's entertainment .
" Dude , that 's the most important part ! " he says .
" I have seepage coming out of five parts of my body right now . "
O'Keefe hits Play .
A world - weary Freep editor listens to O'Keefe 's kickback story and politely declines .
There could be a thousand reasons why , but to O'Keefe and Breitbart , there 's only one explanation : liberal bias .
Breitbart slaps the walls like they were congo drums , grinning .
" OK , " he tells O'Keefe , " now I officially adore you . "
In 1991 , Breitbart was a bored twentysomething from Brentwood , a ritzy entertainment - industry enclave in west LA .
A hyperactive news junkie , he read several newspapers and watched several newscasts a day .
A low - level movie production job had left him disgusted by what he saw as Hollywood 's culture of limousine liberalism .
He was miserable .
" Kurt Cobain without the record deal , " he says .
" Just give me the gun . "
While waiting tables at a Venice bar and grill , he got to know one of the regulars , veteran TV actor Orson Bean .
Bean had a wild reputation in Hollywood .
He had written a book extolling the spiritual power of orgasm and , even more shocking , was a die - hard Nixon man .
Breitbart admired him as an unpredictable rebel , a raconteur , an independent thinker — the kind of guy Breitbart wanted to be .
He started dating Bean 's daughter Susie and eventually married her .
Bean served as Breitbart 's first mentor , encouraging him to cut against what both men saw as LA 's leftie grain .
Breitbart found his second mentor on a lark .
He had become a fan of Matt Drudge 's online newsletter , a weird , irresistible mix of right - wing politics , conspiracy theories , extreme weather , and pop culture .
In 1995 , Breitbart emailed Drudge to see if he could help out .
Pretty soon , his bylines were appearing on the report alongside Drudge's .
Breitbart had found his niche .
A link from the Drudge Report could bring hundreds of thousands of readers to a newspaper story — even if an editor had buried it on page C23 .
So reporters who wanted exposure for their work reached out to Drudge and Breitbart as soon as their pieces were published ( or even before ) .
Those tips gave the pair a back door into virtually every newsroom on the planet .
In early 1998 , the site was able to break not only the news that President Clinton had sex with an intern but also the fact that Newsweek spiked a story on the affair .
But scoops alone were n't what made the Drudge Report a must - read .
The site had a new feeling of urgency , of velocity .
Together , Drudge and Breitbart set the vicious , unceasing pace that is now the norm for Twitter - era journalism .
No one really knows how they did it .
Neither Breitbart nor Drudge will discuss their partnership .
" I 've honored Drudge 's wishes , spoken and unspoken " is all Breitbart will say .
" He 's a private guy . "
At the turn of the century , Drudge receded from the spotlight , and journalists and politicos learned that the key to getting link - love from the Drudge Report was to IM Andrew Breitbart .
Among those members of the Democrat - media complex : me , an ex-Clinton - Gore campaign staffer contributing to The New York Times .
In 2008 , I took Breitbart to Wired 's 15th anniversary party in Manhattan .
He took me to gatherings of pols and pundits at Yamashiro , a restaurant in the Hollywood Hills designed to look like a shogun palace .
Yet Breitbart 's relationship with the press is generally adversarial , and even though he has millions of readers , he describes himself as being part of the " undermedia . "
Breitbart believes in the conservative cause , but he also knows that casting himself as the Resistance in an information war gets him an audience .
" We know the undermedia has power , " Breitbart says .
" And it comes from positioning it against the mainstream media . "
One thing Breitbart will say about Drudge , though , is that his mentor introduced him to Arianna Huffington , then a right - wing pundit and Drudge confidant .
Breitbart became her researcher and Web guru .
By her side , he learned that the media could be more than scooped — it could be hacked .
The first exploit was almost an accident :
In September 1998 , he suggested that Drudge and Huffington go to the embezzlement trial of former Clinton business associate Susan McDougal .
The Los Angeles Times took note of their attendance the next day in a headline and a few sentences in the Metro section .
Publicists have been pulling similar tricks since silent - movie days , sending celebrity clients to public events .
But to Breitbart , the move was a revelation .
" You can play the media .
You can force them to cover things , " he says .
" This is not just stenography .
There 's a performance art to it . "
Breitbart started looking for ways to attract the spotlight to himself .
In 2004 , he and journalist Mark Ebner wrote the book Hollywood , Interrupted , which excoriated the drug habits and vapid liberalism of many stars .
Breitbart emerged as a conservative spokesperson with a passion for the culture wars not seen since the Lewinsky years .
" They 're an elitist pestilence , " he says of his celebrity targets .
" They tell us we can't have SUVs .
They try to impose a one - child - per - family policy .
But they can do whatever the hell they want because they 're gallivanting around in the name of the greater good . "
He pauses while I try to figure out the " one- child " comment .
" God , I fucking hate them . "
Shortly after Hollywood , Interrupted came out , Huffington — by then a left - wing pundit — invited Breitbart to help her and Democratic fund - raiser Ken Lerer assemble what would become liberal Hollywood 's favorite Web site , the Huffington Post .
It was political apostasy , of course .
But the paycheck was substantial for Breitbart , then a father of three .
Also , he says , building something from scratch was a chance " to show that I was a presence and a player . "
Breitbart liked the idea of a new forum for ideological combat , separate from the traditional media 's slanted playing field .
" He was extremely interested in how to have a conversation online — how to bring together all these interesting voices , " Huffington says .
" Now it 's , like , so obvious .
But at the time , it had never been done . "
The Huffington Post was consciously designed as the Left 's answer to ( and upgrade of ) the Drudge Report .
But instead of aggregating news and opinion , the HuffPo would host it .
Newswires would appear right on the site ; bloggers could battle it out in a giant group forum .
The site launched in May 2005 .
By June , Breitbart was out .
Today , five years later , even his role in building the site is a matter of dispute .
" I created the Huffington Post , " he says simply .
" I drafted the plan .
They followed the plan . "
Huffington disagrees , saying that while he helped with strategy , the idea for the site was cooked up at a meeting in her living room after the 2004 elections .
Breitbart , she says , " was n't present . "
Breitbart went back to Drudge , but he was still looking for ways to prove he was more than a behind - the - scenes guy .
He wanted to make a name for himself , earn some money , and advance his cause .
He realized he could build his own Web presence using all the lessons he 'd learned .
Even stories that seemed inconsequential could be framed to poke the mainstream media .
Any reaction — or lack of reaction — could be bent to Breitbart 's purpose .
It 's another media hack : Heads I win , tails you lose .
One 2009 post featured a two - year - old video of Oscar the Grouch joking about " Pox News " on Sesame Street .
When the PBS ombudsman apologized for the pun , Breitbart 's Big Hollywood blog wrote up the apology as an admission of systemic bias .
Another post lambasted the White House for displaying a painting it said was a Matisse rip - off .
When a critic at The Washington Post defended the work , it proved — said Big Hollywood — the desire of the press corps to " shield " Obama .
The stories do n't even have to be true to be useful .
In December , Big Government 's Michael Walsh put together a list of the top stories the mainstream media missed in 2009 .
Number four : Sarah Palin's claim that the health care bill included a " death panel " that would decide the fate of the infirm and disabled .
Of course , Palin 's claim — thoroughly discredited — was one of the most widely covered stories of the year .
But for Walsh , none of that mattered .
Death panels were " a marker for the entire Sarah Palin story , " he says .
" Sarah Palin makes the Left 's heads explode .
If only for that , it belongs on the list . "
Today , the adversarial media world that Breitbart helped create is fodder for both sides of the political spectrum .
The debate itself is the news .
Every time Breitbart goes after Oscar the Grouch , the Left goes after Breitbart .
Liberals get to feel superior to someone thuggish enough to attack Sesame Street , and Breitbart 's message gets an extra push .
Even the Obama administration plays the game , elevating opponents like Rush Limbaugh because they rally the Democratic base .
" This stuff is gold for the White House .
It 's gold for the Right , " says Republican consultant Goldfarb .
" Everybody profits . "
To build an alternative media empire , Breitbart had to find alternative sources of money and talent .
That has led to ties with some pretty sketchy characters .
His first solo Web site , Breitbart.com , got 2.6 million readers in its first month thanks in large part to links from the Drudge Report .
But Breitbart needed to turn that traffic into ad revenue , and he was n't much of a businessperson .
A pair of conservative entrepreneurs volunteered to act as his sales agents .
Brian Cartmell , a quiet programmer with money from his own antispam company , offered his coding expertise .
Brad Hillstrom , the bearded , garrulous co-owner of a chain of medical clinics , brought contacts .
Hillstrom flew Breitbart out to his lavish home on Lake Minnetonka for a weekend with Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty and Sandy Froman , president of the National Rifle Association .
Breitbart was suitably impressed .
He figured that his audience , combined with Cartmell 's geekery and Hillstrom 's Rolodex , would make millions .
On November 3 , 2005 , the three launched Gen Ads , a business that secured the exclusive rights to serve up banner ads on Breitbart.com .
By the end of January , they were suing one another .
Reuters was paying Breitbart a referral fee for every clickthrough from his site to Reuters.com , which Hillstrom and Cartmell said violated their exclusivity agreement .
Breitbart countersued , pointing out that the pair had failed to run any site - specific ads on Breitbart.com and had concealed their own rather lurid pasts .
Hillstrom 's company had been investigated by the Department of Labor for paying physical therapists brought in from Poland as little as $ 500 a month and was forced to pay $ 460,000 in back wages .
Cartmell had been sued by Hasbro in 1996 for turning candy - land.com into a porn site .
The legal wrangling dragged into the summer and cost Breitbart " more money than I had , " he says .
With the lawsuits behind him , Breitbart next became a champion of Pat Dollard , a former Hollywood agent turned gonzo war documentarian .
Then it came to light that Dollard had doled out liquid Valium to marines in Iraq and robbed a pharmacy there while dressed in US military fatigues .
A long Vanity Fair article detailing Dollard 's excesses made him toxic to all but the most extreme of conservative activists .
For Breitbart , though , Dollard fit right in with his self - image .
Despite his conservative views , Breitbart sees himself in some ways as an heir to 1960s radicals like the Yippies and Merry Pranksters , turning the absurd into political points .
In the end , that 's what he saw in O'Keefe , his star provocateur .
Now O'Keefe might become a liability as well .
The FBI says that in January of this year , Joe Basel — O'Keefe 's partner in the HUD stings — and another man put on fluorescent green vests and tool belts and walked into the New Orleans offices of Democratic senator Mary Landrieu , saying they were there to fix the phones .
O'Keefe was in the lobby , recording the encounter on a cell phone .
When Basel could n't produce identification , US marshals arrested them all for entering federal property under false pretenses " with the purpose of committing a felony " — a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison .
The cable networks , wire services , and political blogs called it a wiretapping plot .
The head of the Democratic Party in Louisiana condemned the " Watergate - like break - in . "
Breitbart says he had no idea that O'Keefe was in Louisiana , let alone in the senator 's office .
But he knew that actions this criminal and clownish had the potential to hurt him .
" I saw my life passing in front of my eyes , " he says .
O'Keefe and Breitbart traded instant messages even before O'Keefe called his attorney .
Then Breitbart went on the offensive , bashing the press on Big Government for overreaching .
Despite the hysterical headlines , O'Keefe had n't actually been charged with wiretapping .
MSNBC reprimanded correspondent David Shuster for his attacks on O'Keefe , and The Washington Post issued a correction to its story about his " bugging . "
Those are the kind of things that count as " wins " on Breitbart 's scorecard .
Then , Breitbart and his bloggers tried to swap the break - in narrative for a Byzantine conspiracy tale .
O'Keefe may have used poor judgment , they said , but his arrest and subsequent treatment proved that the Democrat - media complex was working to ruin Breitbart and O'Keefe as payback for the Acorn sting .
After the story 's first couple of waves come and go , I call Breitbart in Los Angeles .
" I believe the Justice Department is doing to me what we did to them , " he says .
" They kept him in jail for 28 hours .
During that period of time they were able to use the media to cast a false narrative of Watergate II , illegal wiretapping , breaking and entering , blah blah blah .
It 's a joke .
It shows the complicity between this administration and the press to destroy political enemies . "
He takes a breath .
" They call us tea - baggers .
They call us racist , sexist , homophobic , and we are finally punching back .
It 's over , dude .
It 's over .
You think you 're gonna be able to put the genie back in the bottle ?
It 's over .
And if you do n't like my aggression , there are going to be millions more of me , " Breitbart says , the cell phone connection skipping in and out .
" Because the new media provides the tools and there are millions out there who are outraged .
Now they realize , ' Wow , anybody can do that .
We can hold these people accountable .
We have the means .
We have the technology . ' "
Then Breitbart hangs up .
He has more interviews to conduct , a speech at the National Tea Party Convention to prep , and bloggers to talk to .
The O'Keefe story might still turn out very bad for Breitbart .
But there is no way he 's going to let someone else tell it .
Contributing editor Noah Shachtman ( stag-komodo.wired.com/dangerroom ) wrote about the Afghan air war in issue 18.01 .
Paris Hilton was in Canada for the Much Music Awards over the weekend and the heiress was quite friendly with a new man .
Miss Hilton was seen partying and holding hands with hockey player Jose Theodore , goalie for the Colorado Avalanche .
Surprisingly , the two left Club Ultra in Toronto together , and headed to Paris ' hotel .
Paris skipped into the front of the hotel and waited in the lobby for her date .
Theodore waited briefly , then exited Hilton 's car to join her .
Paris rep tells TMZ " Paris is single now , as she has stated publicly .
This is a time in her life where she will be concentrating both on her work and friends .
Nobody should read into any photos , gossip or reports about her social life . "
