The New York Civil Liberties Union today released a whitepaper documenting immigrants ’ stories of inadequate medical care and staff mistreatment at the Varick Federal Detention Center in Manhattan .
Voices from Varick : Detainee Grievances at New York City ’s Only Federal Immigration Detention Facility , provides a snapshot of the inhumane and illegal conditions plaguing the federal immigration detention system – a patchwork of federal , state , county and private prisons .
It analyzes a year ’s worth of grievances filed by men being held at the Varick facility , which the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has announced will close on Friday .
Varick detainees will be shipped to immigration detention centers that do not necessarily have a better track record of providing care .
“ This whitepaper provides a voice to people who are victims of the federal government ’s failure to adequately manage the nation ’s immigration detention system , ” said NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman .
“ Nobody should be treated inhumanely or denied basic medical care while in U.S. custody .
That ’s not what America is about .
The Obama administration must address this problem by issuing enforceable regulations to ensure that immigrants in detention are treated humanely . ”
In August 2009 , the NYCLU received a letter from a man being held at Varick saying that officials at the facility repeatedly failed to provide him treatment for severe dental and digestive problems .
In response , the NYCLU filed a Freedom of Information Act request in August 2009 for records concerning detainee grievances .
In October 2009 , the federal government turned over 210 grievances filed by Varick detainees from August 2008 to August 2009 .
The grievances were filed by 176 different detainees , representing 186 unique complaints about conditions at Varick .
Inadequate medical care was the most common complaint , representing 34 percent of the grievances .
Grievances alleging abusive treatment by staff were the second most common , accounting for 25 percent .
The third most common complaint concerned diet or food services , representing 13 percent of the grievances .
Several of the medical care grievances are disturbing .
For example :
Varick officials waited 10 months to schedule a dental appointment for a detainee suffering an abscessed tooth .
By the time the detainee had a dental exam , the infection had spread to seven teeth .
The dentist recommended pulling all seven teeth .
At his own expense , the detainee visited a private dentist , who determined that a series of root canals would address the problem .
The government refused to authorize this less invasive treatment .
After 16 months , the detainee ’s teeth still have not been treated , causing him extreme pain and compromising his health .
A detainee in extreme pain from prostate cancer requested a doctor ’s appointment .
Three weeks later , Varick staff still had not scheduled an appointment even though the man complained of extreme pain and difficulty urinating .
It is unclear whether the detainee ever received the requested appointment .
A detainee complained that his prosthetic leg caused pain and bleeding when he attempted to wear it .
Varick officials consulted a private vendor , who determined that the artificial leg should be replaced .
They informed the detainee of their intentions to request a replacement for him , but three months later the detainee had yet to receive a new prosthetic limb .
Expand alternatives to detention for individuals who do not pose a risk to others .
Possible alternatives for detention include supervised release , in - person reporting , home visits and community supervision .
Release eligible detainees .
DHS should engage in a case - by - case review of detention decisions for each detainee held at Varick and determine whether that detainee is eligible for release .
Ensure that any changes to the placement of Varick detainees be done in a way that allows detainees access to legal counsel and their families .
Improve grievance procedures to allow for better record - keeping and tracking of recurring complaints that should trigger heightened scrutiny by immigration officials .
On Jan. 14 , Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) announced plans to close Varick by the end of February and transfer detainees to Hudson County Correctional Center in Kearney , New Jersey .
The Hudson County facility has its own share of problems , including reports of detainee abuse and a lack of standards governing detainees ’ access to legal services , recreation or visitation .
“ Closing Varick wo n’t solve the problems documented in our whitepaper because inhumane conditions exist in immigration detention facilities throughout the nation , ” said Udi Ofer , NYCLU advocacy director .
“ We hope that federal immigration officials will heed the voices of the Varick detainees and improve conditions of confinement for the hundreds of thousands of men , women and children in immigration detention in the United States . ”
The NYCLU ’s top recommendation for the future of the Varick detainees and beyond is for the federal government to enact enforceable , legally - binding regulations governing conditions of confinement throughout the immigration detention system .
The problems documented in the NYCLU ’s whitepaper are a product of an immigration detention system that holds close to 400,000 people every year , yet is not governed by enforceable regulations .
“ The New York Civil Liberties Union has done a commendable job bringing to light many injustices at the Varick Detention Center , ” said New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand .
“ All New Yorkers deserve basic protections that our rule of law provides .
The Strong Standards
Act , which I co-sponsored , requires humane treatment of immigrant detainees and prevents unwarranted deaths and abuse by providing access to counsel , basic medical care , and appropriate protections for New Yorkers with serious health conditions .
In the past , I have expressed concern that the closure of Varick would undermine detainees ' access to counsel and am working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to ensure that detainees moving out of the city are able to see their attorneys . ”
The NYCLU ’s whitepaper also recommends that the federal government :
In 2007 , when Coleman Hickey was 14 , he made a stop-action film using Lego pieces and figures to depict a concert performance of the song “ Tonight I ’m Gonna Rock You Tonight , ” by Spinal Tap , the parody band featured in the 1984 mock documentary “ This is Spinal Tap . ”
Among the fans of the video , which has garnered 82,000 views on YouTube and includes a musician hurling himself into the audience of Lego figures and crowd surfing atop their upraised plastic arms , are the members of Spinal Tap .
The band showed the video during performances of its recent “ Unwigged and Unplugged ” tour .
But Lego is not amused .
As final editing was being done on a concert DVD of the tour , which included footage from the video projected on stage , Lego declined to grant permission to use its figures , which are protected by copyright .
“ We love that our fans are so passionate and so creative with our products , ” said Julie Stern , a spokeswoman for Lego Systems , the United States division of the Lego Group , a Danish company founded in the 1930s .
“ But it had some inappropriate language , and the tone was n’t appropriate for our target audience of kids 6 to 12 . ”
If you happen to be the 1 - in - 3 Americans who is neither obese nor overweight ( and , thus , considered at risk of becoming obese ) , you might well conclude that the habits of the remaining two - thirds of Americans are costing you , big time .
U.S. life expectancies are expected to slide backward , after years of marching upward .
( But that 's their statistical problem : Yours is how to make them stop costing you all that extra money because they are presumably making poor choices in their food consumption . )
In the debate over healthcare reform , the added cost of caring for patients with obesity - related diseases has become a common refrain : most recent is the cost - of - obesity study , also released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
It finds that as obesity rates increased from 18.3 % of Americans in 1998 to 25 % in 2006 , the cost of providing treatment for those patients ' weight - driven problems increased healthcare spending by $ 40 billion a year .
As evidence of this new " get - tough " strategy on obesity , they may well cite a study released today by the Urban Institute titled " Reducing Obesity : Policy Strategies From the Tobacco Wars . "
When historians look back to identify the pivotal moments in the nation 's struggle against obesity , they might point to the current period as the moment when those who influenced opinion and made public policy decided it was time to take the gloves off .
" Facing the serious consequences of an uncontrolled obesity epidemic , America 's state and federal policy makers may need to consider interventions every bit as forceful as those that succeeded in cutting adult tobacco use by more than 50 % , " the Urban Institute report says .
It took awhile -- almost 50 years from the first surgeon general 's report on tobacco in 1964 -- to drive smoking down .
But in many ways , the drumbeat of scientific evidence and the growing cultural stigma against obesity already are well underway -- as any parent who has tried to bring birthday cupcakes into her child 's classroom certainly knows .
Key among the " interventions " the report weighs is that of imposing an excise or sales tax on fattening foods .
That , says the report , could be expected to lower consumption of those foods .
But it would also generate revenues that could be used to extend health insurance coverage to the uninsured and under- insured , and perhaps to fund campaigns intended to make healthy foods more widely available to , say , low - income Americans and to encourage exercise and healthy eating habits .
If anti-tobacco campaigns are to be the model , those sales taxes could be hefty :
The World Health Organization has recommended that tobacco taxes should represent between two - thirds and three - quarters of the cost of , say , a package of cigarettes ; a 2004 report prepared for the Department of Agriculture suggested that , for " sinful - food " taxes to change the way people eat , they may need to equal at least 10 % to 30 % of the cost of the food .
And although 40 U.S. states now impose modest extra sales taxes on soft drinks and a few snack items , the Urban Institute report suggests that a truly forceful " intervention " -- one that would drive down the consumption of fattening foods and , presumably , prevent or reverse obesity -- would have to target pretty much all the fattening and nutritionally empty stuff we eat : " With a more narrowly targeted tax , consumers could simply substitute one fattening food or beverage for another , " the reports says .
Of course , the United States also would have to adopt extensive menu- and food - labeling changes that would make " good foods " easily distinguishable from the bad ones subject to added taxes .
Not to worry though : Several European countries , most notably Great Britain , have led the way in this area .
And here 's the payoff : Conservatively estimated , a 10 % tax levied on foods that would be defined as " less healthy " by a national standard adopted recently in Great Britain could yield $ 240 billion in its first five years and $ 522 billion over 10 years of implementation -- if it were to begin in October 2010 .
If lawmakers instituted a program of tax subsidies to encourage the purchase of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables , the added revenue would still be $ 356 billion over 10 years .
That would pay for a lot of healthcare reform , which some have estimated will cost as much as $ 1 trillion to implement over the next ten years .
There can be little doubt that lobbyists for the food , restaurant and grocery industries would come out swinging on any of these proposals .
But the report cites evidence of a turning political tide for proposals that would hold the obese and other consumers of nutritionally suspect food accountable for their choices .
A recent national poll found that 53 % of Americans said they favored an increased tax on sodas and sugary soft drinks to help pay for healthcare reform .
And even among those who opposed such an idea , 63 % switched and said they 'd favor such a tax if it " would raise money for health - care reform while also tackling the problems that stem from being overweight . "

Republican activists have successfully “ Google bombed ” Google , managing to have the Obama Administration appear as the first search result for “ worst failure ever . ”
A Google bomb ( or “ link bomb ” ) is Internet slang for an attempt to raise the ranking of a given page in results from a Google search , often with humorous or political intentions .
It is achieved by gaining enough links on the said term to the targeted page , although Google announced in 2007 that it had found a way to supposedly stop Google bombing taking place .
We ’ve tried locating the source of the Google bomb without success , although word of the Google bomb spread through Republican / Conservative sites and forums including Free Republic Saturday US time .
If you want to check it out , type “ worst ever failure ” into Google to obtain the result .
Google has been pretty quick in the past to crack down on Google bombs , although given it ’s the middle of the weekend as we publish this story , you might have until Monday before it disappears .
You see , but you do not observe .
The distinction is clear .

Active or deep interpretation of maps is a subject that is n't taught nearly enough in schools , which is a bit of a pity as recognizing maps as clues to a country 's character can give students an interest in geography they 've never had before .
Simply taking a good look at a map of a country compared to the other areas nearby is often enough to give one a good idea of what sort of geopolitical situation it happens to be in , and in many cases a good enough understanding of this can aid in even predicting the future between two or more countries .
Here are a few examples of some simple ways to read maps .
First of all , a perfectly straight border between countries .
Sometimes that can denote friendship between two countries , where a certain latitude or longitude is set as a common border , after which there is no fighting over it .
It can also mean that the land between two countries simply is n't worth fighting over or too hard to manage .
Here are a few examples from countries that border each other right in the middle of the Sahara Desert .
Compare those borders to the much less straight ones up north - Tunisia , and Morocco .
And after the Sahara ends in the south the borders become curvy again .
A generally straight border that nevertheless keeps twisting back and forth will usually mean a mountain range : or a river ( border of Mexico and Guatemala ) :
You can also tell quite a bit about a country 's situation by geographical oddities .
Take a look at this map : Democratic Republic of the Congo is located mostly in the centre of the continent , but for some reason suddenly juts out to the west all the way to the ocean .
Nations with access to the sea generally have it in a way not all that different from their other borders ( a natural result of a nation 's position ) , but when a large nation has a particularly tiny piece of access to the sea it usually means some sort of diplomatic resolution , without which it could have been landlocked .
In Dem Rep Congo 's case it was given this strip of land in 1885 by the Berlin Conference Exclaves are also oddities .
Kaliningrad is an obvious example .
Kaliningrad is part of Russia , but since the fall of the Soviet Union it has been an exclave completely surrounded by other countries , now the European Union .
Supplies sent to Kaliningrad from Russia have to cross two borders - Latvia and Lithuania , Belarus and Lithuania , or Belarus and Poland .
The existence of an exclave can sometimes mean political instability if the host country is lacking in influence , as the geographic isolation alone can lead those living there to conclude that it would be better to separate .
The area enclosed by the red circle is an exclave of Angola called Cabinda , where there was a conflict between the government and a secessionist movement there until a ceasefire was signed in 2006 .
The same can be seen in areas of land that are n't technically exclaves but still a bit odd compared to the rest of the geography of a country .
Looking a bit south you can see a strip of land stretching eastward from Namibia where you would n't normally expect its borders to extend .
That place is called Caprivi and unsurprisingly there 's a conflict there too between the country and a secessionist group .
The presence of a landlocked country where you would n't expect one will usually imply resentment or bad blood between one country and another .
Take a look at Ethiopia :
You 'll notice that Ethiopia one of the only countries in the area without access to the sea .
Somalia has it , Kenya has it , Sudan has it ... Ethiopia does n't .
The reason for that is the country located just to the north : Eritrea , which used to be a part of Ethiopia until it became independent in 1993 after 31 years of war with each other .
Not surprisingly , the two countries do not get along with each other Bolivia has a bit of a similar situation , though the conflict that caused it was much less recent ( 19th century ) .
Nevertheless , access to the sea is still blamed for a lot of problems in Bolivia and there is a Day of the Sea celebrated each year in the country to remember the former coastline the country had .
There are dozens and dozens more ways to guess the geopolitical situation of a country through maps alone , but the above should suffice for now since the post has gotten a bit long ( feel free to add your own in the comments below though ) .
I 'll end off with one more interesting one .
Here 's Indonesia : Then Vanuatu : And the Philippines .
What do they all have in common ?
They are all island countries , with a huge number of regional languages , but with one language that more or less unifies the country .
Well , with the Philippines it's two ( Tagalog and English ) .
The reason for this is that it 's simply impossible to manage a country of this type without a unifying language .
Countries like Spain are usually able to get by with a number of languages with regional autonomy , but Vanuatu has 200 languages over a population of only a bit over 200,000 , and administering this in the same manner would simply be impossible .
" This is what I 'm doing ?
I 've flown across the country , blown the money and the carbon credits , to get wiggy in a bar in Mirvish Village ?
This is heavy .
This is supposed to be a work trip !
Where are the contacts ?
Where are the literary dinners and book store visits ?
What do these fucking lights want with my soul ?
I... need some air , I feel extremely unusual .
" You will never , ever have a weekend like this one , so put down the Hunter Thompson novel , get a bottle of Wild Turkey , go dig your credit card out of the block of ice you 've frozen it into , and buy this zine .
Read it , remember it .
Easy .

Bienvenue sur la page d' ULYSSE 31 Soundtrack revisited .
Un projet un peu fou qui consiste à ré-interpréter les plus beaux thèmes du dessin animé ULYSSE 31 .
Précisons qu'il s'agit bien de ré-orchestrations et non pas des pistes originales de 1981 .
Tout ce que vous entendrez ici a été enregistré dans le studio privé de PARALLAX par David COLIN , depuis juin 2007 .
Aucune partition originale n'étant disponible , les seuls supports de travail ont été les DVD premium d'IDP et les pistes mono du CD audio Logarythme .
PARALLAX est le groupe de David COLIN , ou plutôt son nom d'artiste puisqu'il travaille quasiment seul sur ce projet depuis sa création en 2007 .
L'idée de départ était de fournir quelques minutes supplémentaires à la bande originale qui devait être éditée à la même époque .
Ce projet d'édition fût rapidement abandonné .
La principale raison étant les problèmes de droits d'auteurs bien connus aujourd 'hui .
Malgré cette annulation , David COLIN démarre tout de même son projet de réadaptation de la BO d'ULYSSE 31 par simple passion pour ces musiques dont il dit être redevable .
" Si je suis musicien aujourd ' hui , c'est grâce à quelques groupes comme QUEEN , MARILLION , PINK FLOYD ... et ULYSSE 31 . "

The House and Senate agreeing on another stimulus package is about as likely as two pandas mating in captivity .
Which is to say :
It 's not likely .
But that 's not a reason to avoid debating it !
Today and over the weekend we had Brad DeLong and Paul Krugman and Matt Yglesias and Felix Salmon and Martin Feldstein and Brad DeLong ( again ! ) and Ezra Klein and assorted eminent people in a Washington Post roundtable ( gosh , not to mention this Economist round - up ) all weighing in on the question :
Do we need a second stimulus ?
So , do we ?
Let me to give an impressively wishy - washy answer :
Yes and no .
On the one hand , I have a soft spot for Brad 's take on the current situation :
When Congress and the administration designed the first stimulus , they expected unemployment of 7.9 % .
Unemployment is now between 9.5 % and 9.7 % .
( That 's bad , and the month - over - month change in employment looks even worse . )
Moreover , I agree with Brad that this is n't evidence the first stimulus " did n't work . "
For one , it 's hard know where we'd be in the absence of the first stimulus .
For another , only a small portion of the first stimulus has been spent .
But it seems to me that Brad 's description of the current situation is a necessary but not sufficient ( as they say in law school ) argument for a second stimulus .
Asking , " Is the economy bad and getting worse ? " and answering " Of course ! " is only half the battle .
The other question is , " Would a second stimulus help right now ? "
And I 'm less convinced that the answer to that is such a no - brainer .
That 's because spending money quickly is hard -- really hard !
And we 'll soon run up against the limits of our capacity to spend , if we have n't already .
Here 's why :
It seems to me that the threshold question for Brad is :
Why would n't this bottlenecking happen to additional stimulus dollars ?
Would there be something different about the structure of the second stimulus ?
One big , instantaneous payroll tax cut ?
Eh ?
This chart is from Recovery.gov , the administration 's website for tracking stimulus spending .
It 's shows the amount of stimulus funding that 's been made available to federal agencies ( $ 174.9 billion ) over the amount of stimulus funding that 's been paid out ( $ 60.4 billion ) .
Note that the rate of increase for available funds exceeds the rate of spending .
This suggests that funds are becoming available faster than they are being spent .
It seems to me that the threshold question for Brad is :
Why would n't this bottlenecking happen to additional stimulus dollars ?
Would there be something different about the structure of the second stimulus ?
One big , instantaneous payroll tax cut ?
Eh ?

Ferrari , for quite some time now , and more recently , Lamborghini , have both announced plans to introduce hybrid vehicles to bring to market around 2015 .
And along the way they have both expressed a strong commitment to reducing CO2 emissions with each subsequent model .
What is basically shaping up is a pissing match between these two Italian supercar powerhouses .
About this time last year , Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo stated , “ We want to reduce our CO2 emissions by 40 per cent between now and 2012 . ”
And he also said , “ We are currently working on the development of a Ferrari that will use alternative energy sources and which will be based on what we are doing at the moment in Formula 1 . ”
This was basically a reference to Ferrari ’s Kinetic Energy Recycling System known affectionately as KERS .
This is a regenerative braking technology which converts some of the car ’s kinetic energy into stored energy , which is then fed back into the vehicle ’s power train .
There have been some rumors that a road - going version of KERS may be introduced into future versions of the prototype Ferrari 599XX , but that has yet to be confirmed .
Ferrari ’s alternative energy vehicles should be ready for mass production by 2015 .
The Ferrari boss eschewed the idea that potential buyers might not by interested in a hybrid or electric engine vehicle from the company by stating , “ Yes , of course .
It ’s the best sports car in the world .
It ’s still fundamentally a Ferrari . ”
After months of having to listen to reports , announcements and hoopla about a hybrid Ferrari in the works , just earlier this week Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann confirmed that a hybrid of their own is in development , hinting that the Gallardo may be the test - bed for such as vehicle .
An all - electric motor is not in the cards , but Winkelmann stated that for low speeds in city traffic an electric motor would be used to power the car until the Lamborghini ’s V10 or V12 gas engine is needed for acceleration or velocity .
These are two things the company is known for and would n’t want to lose .
It ’s unlikely that the current hybrid - drive technology that some Formula
One teams are using to provide short boosts of power will not be incorporated .
There is no real consensus yet on whether that type of tech is even viable .
In any case , it looks like we ’ll see a hybrid Ferrari and hybrid Lamborghini sometime in the very near future .
But what ’s most intriguing will be how these two companies , which are known for vaporizing large quantities of gas to propel their vehicles at breakneck speeds , will be able to temper this inherent quality with the demands of alternative energy and lower emissions .
This is going to get interesting …

At the beginning of 2008 , the Singapore economy was expecting to see a rise in the Consumer Price Index of 4 to 5 percent .
Based on statistics and data collected so far in 2008 , this inflation rate has exceeded that prediction .
According to the Department of Statistics ( DOS ) on a month - to - month change the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) for March 2008 rose by 0.1 percent compared to February 2008 .
On a 3 - month moving average month - to - month basis , the Consumer Price Index rose by 0.6 percent in March 2008 .
Compared to last year , the CPI went up by 6.7 percent due to higher costs of food , transportation and housing .
Food prices increased by 7.6 percent , communication and transportation costs by 7.9 percent , health care costs by 7.3 percent , and housing costs by 8.1 percent .
The CPI has not been this high since the 7.5 percent hit of March of 1982 .
Inflation in Singapore at this moment was mainly caused by the housing value revision , which was following the government ’s forecast of 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent inflation rate increase .
It caused an 11.1 percent increase in housing costs , which represents 21 percent of the CPI basket .
Another main cause of inflation not only in Singapore but in countries such as Vietnam , the Philippines , Hong Kong , Japan , Thailand , and India is the constantly increasing food prices , particularly on grains such as wheat and rice .
Furthermore , there is a reduced crop acreage paired with an increased demand on food due to rising living standards .
One of the effects of this record high inflation is a decrease in citizens ’ take - home pay .
The large pay raises that Singapore workers usually look forward to will be suppressed from now on .
This suppression is due to inflation and the surge in prices of oil , food , and lodging .
These factors counter - balance the workers ’ projected pay rises in a significant way , especially since the rises in inflation have caught a lot of people by surprise .
It is also going to affect salary increases for the rest of the year , because inflation was originally expected to be much lower .
This is going to cause a lot of trouble for employers , because they will need to provide higher salary increases later on to make up for the low increases this year .
Workers should expect and hope their pay to go up by 5 percent , much lower than the estimated 7.3 percent .
The Minister of Finance released a statement outlining strategies to cope with inflation .
One of these was moderating imported inflation through the Singapore dollar ( SGD ) exchange rate policy .
In this exchange rate policy , the Monetary Authority of Singapore turns the SGD within a secret - weighted band against a basket of major currencies .
This month they raised the central point of the trading band leading their national currency to hit a record high against the USD .
Recently it has tightened monetary policy ; it allowed a rise in SGD .
Other strategies included diversifying the food sources to minimize a rise in prices from disrupting the supply of one country being imported from , and promoting home ownership , which includes giving subsidies for lower - income families to own a home .
The Minister of Finance also recommended providing assistance to Singaporeans who find it difficult to cover the cost of living , and to keep the economy of Singapore competitive and to build capabilities to enjoy good growth .
Additional adjustments were made to the 2008/2009 budget to curb this inflation as well .
Some of the measures taken include giving the rich tax cuts while giving the poor handouts to cope with the highest inflation in 26 years .
The top income tax rate will not be cut by that much , however , in an attempt to stay attractive to investors .
The government expected to keep inflation within 4.5 to 5.5 percent this year , however the cost increase on prices in food and raw materials have exceeded this forecast .
Despite the rise in inflation , growth has rebounded and is doing very well .
Singapore ’s economy grew at 16.9 percent in the first quarter of 2008 , which was higher than economists expected , especially since growth shrunk in the last quarter of 2007 .
The high growth figures gave the Monetary Authority of Singapore the confidence to tighten monetary policy ( more specifically , the exchange rate ) in an effort to curb inflation .

If Silvio Berlusconi thought he'd shaken off the furore over his alleged use of escort girls , he was in for a nasty surprise today .
The Italian prime minister has successfully deflected and sidestepped lurid allegations about his supposed liaisons in recent weeks , helped by some timely international summitry which let him demonstrate his statesmanship , not to mention his commitment to dealing with the aftermath of the L'Aquila earthquake .
But today it was all about call girls , giant beds and the suggestion of a menage - a- trois , after a left - leaning news magazine , L'Espresso , posted " pillow talk " recordings that an escort said she made during a night with the septuagenarian Italian leader .
The escort , Patrizia D'Addario , claims the tapes relate to the night of 4 November last year , when the leaders of the world were holding their breath , waiting to see if Americans would elect their first black president .
Berlusconi , apparently , had other things on his mind .
According to D'Addario , Berlusconi was entertaining her in the bedroom of his magnificent Rome residence , Palazzo Grazioli .
In one fragment of conversation , Berlusconi appears to direct D'Addario to wait for him in bed while he showers .
In another conversation , recorded the next day , she protests to Giampaolo Tarantini , the businessman who allegedly set her up with the Italian prime minister , that she had not received the € 5,000 ( £ 4,300 ) she was expecting .
In a third snippet , it is claimed she confides to the same intermediary that Berlusconi asked her whether next time they met she would agree to a menage - a- trois with another of his girlfriends .
" He said that he has a girlfriend and would like to have me licked by this girlfriend , " D'Addario says , according to the posted recordings .
The Berlusconi camp moved quickly to rubbish the tapes .
Berlusconi's spokesman said : " This seesaw of gossip is not getting anywhere " .
A spokesman for his party , the Freedom People , called the release of the recordings " pathetic " .
An attorney , Niccolo Ghedini , said they were " without any merit , completely improbable and the fruit of invention " .
The content of the conversations was reported in broad terms last month , but the words themselves , some pronounced in what sound like the distinctively nasal tones of Italy 's prime minister , are likely to have an effect no news report can rival .
One of the conversations appears to back claims that Italy 's leader has a giant bed with a connection , as yet unclear , to his Russian counterpart , Vladimir Putin .
After an exchange in which the prime minister seems to be offering a present to D'Addario , he says to her : " I 'm taking a shower . "
He then asks her to wait on the big bed .
She asks which one .
He replies : " Putin's " .
The tapes also include ammunition for Berlusconi 's supporters , however .
He has said that he has never paid for sex , and insisted that he was unaware the women who attended his parties were being rewarded .
In the telephone call with Tarantini , D'Addario tells him that things went well , adding : " No envelope , though . "
There is another respect in which the recordings could help Berlusconi .
They imply that the 72 year - old billionaire politician , who has had prostate cancer , nevertheless has remarkable sexual endurance .
It remains to be seen if that will inspire more admiration than censure among ordinary Italians .
D'Addario tells Tarantini " we did n't sleep a wink " and when Berlusconi calls her later , she is heard to say that she is not tired even though she did n't sleep .
" Only my voice has gone , " she says .
He replies : " Why ?
We did n't shout . "
On the recording , both the voices sound gruff .
D'Addario , who stood as a candidate in local elections this year for a group close to the prime minister 's party , has given the recordings to prosecutors investigating Tarantini .
• This article was amended on 27 July 2009 , to correct one of D'Addario 's quotations .
McAfee , the antivirus software and computer security company , has just released its quarterly Threat Report ( download here ) and the results are n’t good .
McAfee reported that spam email accounted for 92 % of all email sent in the past quarter – beating the previous all - time record of 91 % .
In addition , June produced the most amount of spam they have ever seen for any one month – beating the old record by more than 20 % which occurred in October of 2008 .
Other interesting statistics included a break down of all spam based on subject .
For whatever reason , prescription drug spam skyrocketed to account for 60 % of all spam in the last quarter .
Taking second and third place was advertising with 16 % and male enhancement with 7.3 % .
Another interesting statistic to note is that although the United States is still the number one producer of all spam and accounts for more than 25 % of it , that figure continues to decline as other parts of the world develop and jump into the spam game .
I also find it quite funny how McAfee managed to infuse some humor throughout the report .

Hydrogen power has long been hampered by the lack of an inexpensive , renewable fuel .
As it turns out , the solution may be right underneath us .
Researchers at Ohio University have discovered that hydrogen can be produced from urine using an electrolytic process at only a fraction of the cost of generating hydrogen from water .
Researcher Geraldine Botte and team used the fact that hydrogen molecules in urea are less tightly bound than those in water to create an inexpensive nickel - based electrode that efficiently oxidizes urea .
A voltage of .037V is required to break down urea .
In comparison , 1.23V are required to break down water .
Up until this point , Botte has used synthetic urine made out of dissolved urea in her experiments , but she believes that human urine could be used just as easily .
Next up : long term stability studies on the electrolysis system .
Eventually , the system could be scaled up to produce hydrogen while also removing effluent from sewage plants .
The Ohio University discovery could one day produce hydrogen - powered cars that are competitive with EVs , but it will probably be many years before urine - fueled hydrogen is used commercially in vehicles .
By the time it ’s ready , the growing EV infrastructure may overshadow any advancements in hydrogen power .

Freegate amounts to a dissident ’s cyberkit .
E -mails sent with it can be encrypted .
And after a session is complete , a press of a button eliminates any sign that it was used on that computer .

The consortium also makes available variants of the software , such as Ultrasurf , and other software to evade censors is available from Tor Project and the University of Toronto .
Originally , Freegate was available only in Chinese and English , but a growing number of people have been using it in other countries , such as Myanmar .
Responding to the growing use of Freegate in Iran , the consortium introduced a Farsi - language version last July  and usage there skyrocketed .
Soon almost as many Iranians were using it as Chinese , straining server capacity ( many Chinese are wary of Freegate because of its links to Falun Gong , which even ordinary citizens often distrust ) .
The engineers in the consortium , worrying that the Iran traffic would crash their servers , dropped access in Iran in January but restored it before the Iran election .
“ We know the pain of people in closed societies , and we do want to accommodate them , ” Mr. Zhou said .
China is fighting back against the “ hacktivists . ”
The government has announced that new computers sold beginning next month will have to have Internet filtering software , called Green Dam ( the consortium has already developed software called Green Tsunami to neutralize it ) .
More alarming , in 2006 a consortium engineer living outside Atlanta was attacked in his home , beaten up and his computers stolen .
The engineers behind Freegate are now careful not to disclose their physical locations .
Granted , these technologies are not a panacea .

By now you 've all probably heard of Shona Holmes , the Canadian woman featured in those TV ads that have been running all over American TV in recent weeks , the ones slamming Canada 's healthcare system as some sort of nightmarish system from hell .
Well , the truth is now out and the fact is Shona Holmes never actually had a life - threatening brain tumor , as she 's been claiming in those ads and interviews on American TV .
Instead , according to the Mayo Clinic where she was treated , her " brain tumor " was actually a Rathke 's Cleft Cyst on her pituitary gland and " Rathke 's Cleft Cysts are not true tumors or neoplasms ; instead they are benign cysts . "
The real story , it seems , is that she was on a waiting list for treatment here in Canada for her non-life - threatening benign cyst , but did n't want to wait and therefore went to the States and paid for her own treatment instead .
Quite a different story from the one presented in those ads : a story about how the Canadian system was going to just let her die because it 's such a flawed , awful , dangerous system .
All this is from a great article by Julie Mason that appeared earlier this week in The Ottawa Citizen .
Sadly , CBC 's main news program , " The National " , covered this story a couple of nights ago , but somehow failed to mention ( or perhaps even research enough to find out ? ) that Shona Holmes never actually had any life - threatening brain tumor - obviously the most important part of her story .
A Right - Wing Ad Campaign
Watch the ad here and listen as Holmes states that " I survived a brain tumor , but if I relied on my government for healthcare I 'd be dead " .
This is simply not true .
And Holmes , it should be noted , is not just some naive flake being used by a right - wing group to help spread their anti-healthcare reform message , she 's actually an activist herself , one who has been all over the American media airwaves giving interviews and spreading lies , half - truths and slander about Canada 's healthcare system .
Now there 's no doubt that the wait times in this country can be unacceptable ( and , since her cyst was starting to cause vision problems , Holmes definitely should not have had to wait months to see a specialist ) , but if someone wants to criticize our system they should do it without lying .
The simple truth is that if a person has a life - threatening tumor in Canada they will be treated and not , as Holmes states , left to die .
A Fraud
Shona Holmes , it seems , is a fraud !
And why she'd want to see nearly 50 million Americans left completely uninsured simply because she was unhappy with her treatment in Canada is beyond me .
Tellingly , if you listen to her talk she does n't really seem to have much , or any , concern for the uninsured .
Being wealthy enough to travel down to the Mayo Clinic for $ 97,000 private treatment , she seems to only be concerned with people like herself , those with money .
The uninsured 50 million be damned .
Obama's Plan
Holmes ' stated aim in appearing in these ads and interviews is to persuade Americans to stick with their current system and reject Obama 's plan to cover everyone ( a mighty flawed , non-single - payer system , I might add , but at least a noble attempt to finally cover everyone with some form of insurance ) .
This current system that Holmes so passionately wants America to retain is of course the very same horrifically unjust one - the only one in the industrialized world that does n't cover all of its citizens - that the majority of Americans have wanted replaced for years .
Does Shona
Holmes really think that millions of American children are better off with no medical insurance than with a system like that in Canada , no matter how much she may find it lacking ?
Is she really that insensitive ?
Stupid ?
Self - absorbed ?
Or does she , perhaps just like being on TV a lot ?
Whatever the case , she sure comes across as a villain in all of this .
A petty villain perhaps , but a villain nonetheless .
Not so much to Canada and the Canadian healthcare system she 's so intent on smearing with her less - than - honest tale of woe , but more so to the American public who she 's hoping to condemn to the appalling status quo they presently call a healthcare system ... and the rest of the world calls a joke .
Yes , yes , of course if you 're wealthy and / or you 're lucky enough to have an insurance policy that actually covers you when you most need it ( rather than challenges your claim and / or denies you certain treatments ) then you will undoubtedly get some good care .
But , seriously , who wants to live in a system in which losing your job also means losing your healthcare , as so many Americans have been finding out over the past year ?
Nearly 50 million without any coverage whatsoever and tens of millions more with inadequate , partial and / or tentative coverage at best .
You call that a modern just society ?
" The Best System In The World "
Americans always want to believe they are the best at everything in the world and when it comes to certain things perhaps they are , but when it comes to their healthcare system the fact is they 're the laughing stock of the world .
The rest of the industrialized world long , long ago accepted the basic truth that any modern , just and civilized society unequivocally must provide two fundamental things to all of its citizens : universal primary and secondary education and universal healthcare .
Yet some 60 years onward America is still attempting to claw its way into the 1950s .
That is , 60 years after everyone else America is still attempting to give all of its citizens these two most basic and fundamental of human rights .
And if people like Shona Holmes have their wish they never will .
Check out Julie Mason 's article here :
A reality check on a reality check :
For years , Canadians have feared the American health care system ; now Americans are being told to fear ours
And for another excellent article on healthcare reform in America try this quite personal recent piece by Ted Kennedy :

Finally , check out this piece by David Sirota about how the wealthy in America ( including certain Democrats who Sirota calls " Land Rover Liberals " ) are doing all they can to defeat universal healthcare , at least as long as it involves them having to pay even a few thousand dollars more in taxes each year from their hoard of millions and / or billions :
One Percenters Enjoy Unprecedented Protection

This interview was frightening .
I 've followed the cluckerfuck of self - righteous Republican politicians who live at the tax - exempt C Street townhouse , speak of family values , and then fuck around on their wives .
I did n't realize that these same hypocritical bastards actually lived by a Nietzschean philosophy that morals apply to everyone but themselves .
As I was listening to Sharlet , I almost did n't believe him .
What he was describing sounded not just scummy but down right evil .
Sharlet had gone undercover and lived at the C Street house .
It appears he has particular insight and evidence on what goes on behind the walls of the C Street townhouse .
The " Christian " fundamentalists who run C Street refer to themselves as " The Family " in the same way the Mafia refers to itself as " The Family . "
This is not a coincidence .
According to Sharlet , they see themselves as similar to the Mafia , in so far as " the more invisible you can make your organization , the more influence your organization can have . "
Doug Coe , the leader of this cabal , sees his group as the leaders of something called " Jesus Plus Nothing " or " The Totalitarianism for Christ " , which models the way it wields power on the same way the Mafia , Hitler , Pol Pot , Osama Bin Laden , and Lenin wield power .
They also call themselves " The New Chosen " because they believe that if you have reached a certain pinnacle of success , whether financially or in terms of power ( in their minds Hitler , Pol Pot , and Lenin are considered successful ) , your success derives from the fact that God has chosen you to be successful .
The founder of this group claims he had a revelation from God that said that Christianity had gotten it wrong during its first 2,000 years .
Christians are not meant to concern themselves with the poor and downtrodden .
Instead ,
God wants people to serve the powerful , which they refer to as " The Up and Out . "
Sharlet recounts one conversation he overheard between Doug Coe and another man .
Coe asked the man , " Suppose I hear you rape three little girls .
What would I think ? "
The man said he thought Coe would consider him awful and a monster .
Coe said , " No . No I would n't because you 're Chosen .
As a member of The Family , you 're Chosen and , when you 're Chosen , the normal rules do n't apply .
Morality is for the little people . "
I urge you to watch the whole interview .
It 's almost hard to believe it true .
Nevertheless , it would explain the hypocrisy and degree of disconnect from reality that characterize today 's Republican Party ..
Bees have been hit by disease , climate change and pesticide use Britain 's honeybees are disappearing at an " alarming " rate , yet the government is taking " little interest " in the problem , a group of MPs has said .
The Public Accounts Committee ( PAC ) says bees , vital for pollinating crops , are worth £ 200 m a year to the economy .
It wants Defra to spend more money on research into bee health and make registration compulsory for beekeepers .
Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said £ 10 m had been earmarked to analyse the decline of pollinators , including bees .
But the PAC wants the government to ring - fence that money for honeybees alone and not allow it to be diluted by looking at other pollinating insects .
' Colonies lost '
The government says bee numbers have fallen by up to 15 % in the last two years , in part because agricultural changes have reduced the availability of the wildflowers they depend on for food .
Disease , climate change and pesticide use have also been blamed for the decline .
Honeybees and other pollinators are absolutely vital to producing our food
Environment Secretary Hilary Benn Chairman of the PAC , Edward Leigh said : " Honeybees are dying and colonies are being lost at an alarming rate . "
Given their value to the economy , he said it was " difficult to understand why Defra has taken so little interest in the problem up to now " .
Registration is currently voluntary for beekeepers , but the PAC says making it compulsory would allow Defra to deliver advice on bee husbandry to far more people .
Mr Benn said : " Honeybees and other pollinators are absolutely vital to producing our food .
" Defra is providing financial backing for a £ 10 m research initiative into pollinator decline , including honey bees , with decisions on projects to be made in the coming months . "
The British Beekeepers Association has backed the PAC 's call for research spending to be ring - fenced .

It took me foreverI used pop tabs all the way from the tip of nose to the tip of tail except for whisker .
I wanted to count it but again it 'll take me forever to count lol .
Also , I 'd like to give many thanks to * Whitty Kitty for great support .
And thanks to all my friends who collected the all tabs for me .
I glued them together with ordinary epoxy or cold - weld compound type of epoxy .
this guy 's about 14 inches long and 8 inches tall .
By the way i want this to be called 神魂龍 ( shinkonryuu ) which inhabits the spirit of a person , where they obtain the necessary energy to live .
When a person dies they move to a new spirit .

WILBRAHAM — Police are asking residents to be on the lookout for a man who has reportedly driven up to children at least twice in recent weeks and asked them if they wanted lollipops .
Police said the most recent incident occurred Wednesday night about 6:30 when the man approached two boys riding scooters on Lake Drive .
The two boys refused the offer and ran into one of their houses .
Adults , who then went outside , were able to get a description of the man and his car .
He is described as a white male in his 40s or 50s , driving an older silver or gray car , perhaps a Toyota Celica , Capt .
Roger W. Tucker said .
A similar incident was reported to police about two weeks ago .
Tucker said .
A series of e-mails sent to a number of residents throughout the town has prompted numerous calls to police , Tucker said .
Tucker said police are searching for the man but stressed that " no real crime has been committed at this point . "
It 's not illegal , Tucker said , to offer somebody a lollipop .
" Sometimes it 's innocent , sometimes it 's not . "
Tucker said those who spot such a scenario happening , or a suspicious vehicle , should strive to get a license plate number " so we can ID this guy and find out what his activities are . "
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran put on trial a French citizen and a local employee of the French embassy in Tehran on Saturday following the country ’s disputed June presidential election , the semi-official Fars news agency said .
“ Among those tried today are a French woman accused of collecting information and provoking rioters and also a local female French embassy staff person , ” Fars reported .
French citizen Clotilde Reiss , held in Tehran ’s Evin Prison , was arrested at Tehran airport on July 1 on charges of espionage when leaving the country after spending five months as a French language teaching assistant in the central city of Isfahan .
France has rejected the charge against Reiss as “ baseless ” and French President Nicolas Sarkozy has called for her immediate release .
The French Foreign Ministry said on July 15 that a French - Iranian woman , working for its embassy in Tehran , had been detained for three days by the Iranian authorities .
She was not identified by name and the reason for her arrest was not revealed .
Iran on Saturday put more prominent moderates on trial in connection with the unrest that erupted after the country ’s disputed June presidential election , Iranian media reported .
The June 12 vote has plunged the Islamic state into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic revolution and exposed deepening divisions in its ruling elite .
Some 100 moderates were tried last Saturday for various charges including acting against national security , which is punishable by the death penalty under Iran ’s Islamic law .
Crochet Balaclava Tutorial Balaclava is a traditional woolen hat cum helmet that covers the head , neck , ears and in some cases even the shoulders .
So what could be better than a balaclava hat to wear in extreme winters ?
Balaclava does look great in bright colors , in textured wools , adorned with crochet trims and flowers or may it be in complete crochet made with wool .
Balaclava looks really great with crochet as well as knitting .
This great discovery from World War I is a practical , easy wear and easy off accessory that is a must have for the winters .
Sometimes , there are people who want things beyond the fashion requirements .
Balaclava is perfectly for those .
Bikers , high mountain skiers , fishermen , campers , sailors , patrol personals for rescue , ski or hunter teams , gardeners , delivery guys are always in need of something that can keep those wind chills …. away .
Balaclava is obviously not for beginners , the more expert you are in crocheting ; the more neatness will show up .
Not every stitch falls perfect for this project .
There are certain stitches that are for sure the better choice to make balaclavas .
You wo n’t want crochet fans with lots of holes to let the wind get in right ?
So what to do ?
Try making balaclava in Tunisian , buttonhole crochet in horizontal or vertical , chevron stripes , double - double crochet , lattice stitch , leaf , little leaf , pineapple , up and down , zigzag , increasing , double increasing , rib , rose stitch , Russian and twisted stitches .
With so many types of stitches , it is easier for you to get started if you know a stitch or two from the list .
Crochet is one of those great crafts which need the minimum of supply and a good pattern to get started .
Making balaclava is technical as it needs more details and a little more time .
It is better if you choose to have a crochet video tutorial or somebody to teach you in personal .
For the supplies all you need is two balls of knitting worsted or Aram weight yarn , a little heavier than knitting worsted , with 15 % mohair content .
You ’ll also need # 7 and # 5 needles , circular and / or double point , plus a stitch - holder or spare yarn , and markers , tape measure , yarn needle , crochet hook for picking up dropped stitches if you want to make the major part with knitting ; as some might find it easier to knit the large portions .
On the contrary if you want it a complete crochet project you will need a crochet hook rather than knitting needles .
There are hundreds of websites and books on balaclava projects .
In case if you are looking for some good content as complete tutorials on balaclava crochet , try visiting these websites .

No one seemed to believe me when i said it , glad to see it 's on here !

DENVER , Colorado ( CNN ) --
Investigators in Colorado say they have broken up a massive methamphetamine ring in the Denver area that distributed pounds of the dangerous drug every week and laundered the profits using collectible comic books .
Aaron Castro and his brother were the leaders of the methamphetamine ring , authorities say .
" To launder the money you have to use something that is quick and convenient , " Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said at a news conference Monday .
" And in this case , they used classic comic books . "
While arresting the alleged ringleaders , brothers Aaron and Alfonzo Castro , law enforcement officers seized about 100 boxes of first - edition collectible comic books .
Investigators say one title alone is worth $ 3,500 and the total collection of comics is worth half a million dollars .
" It appeared they were working on a startup company for high - end comic books , " said Don Quick , the district attorney in Adams County near Denver .
Quick said the seized comic books included some first - edition Superman and Batman titles .
The fragile , vintage comics were stored in plastic bags for protection .
According to a grand jury indictment released Monday , the Castro brothers arranged for weekly , multiple - pound shipments of the meth from Phoenix , Arizona .
The brothers then distributed the drugs to a network of runners that made deliveries to dealers around the Denver area .
Suthers says Castro brothers sometimes used females " as drug mules by having them hide methamphetamine inside their vaginal cavities . "
These women would then deliver the meth to a series of houses , and then lower - level dealers would distribute the drug .
" It 's a tawdry piece of information , but it 's a big part of what this group was doing , " he said .
These same runners also collected money from dealers and delivered it to the Castro brothers .
Suthers said the drugs most likely were manufactured in Mexico , and each month 's shipments had a street value of about $ 2 million .
The indictment details 145 drug possession and distribution charges from October 2008 to earlier this month .
The Castros and 39 other people are listed as defendants .
The Castro brothers and their top runners are also charged with racketeering .
Of the 41 defendants , 40 are in custody .
The Castros are being held in the Adams County jail on $ 1 million bail each .
It is unclear if they have attorneys .

A Missouri truck dealer is hoping to stem the sales slide by offering a free assault rifle to customers who sign - up for a new set of wheels .
The novel scheme has grabbed the attention of media around the world , and you can hear all about it from the surprisingly genial - sounding owner of Max Motors on the CNN clip below .
Mark Muller is apparently upgrading an earlier sales gimmick in which he offered new truck buyers a choice between a $ 250 gas voucher or a gun voucher .
According to his website , the gun giveaway is back ' due to popular demand ' .
According to Business Insider , another US publication that reported the story , Muller says his scheme ' generates a lot of publicity and really angers liberals ' .
As giveaways go , it 's a lot more imaginative than the free set of floor - mats on offer from the typical UK outfit .
Amusing suggestions from PHers as to how our car dealers could spice up their offers with imaginative promotions are very welcome !
Punishment for 1944 Massacre German Court Sentences 90 - Year - Old War Criminal to Life
In one of the last Nazi war crimes trials , a court in Munich has sentenced former Wehrmacht lieutenant Josef S. , 90 , to life imprisonment for ordering the execution of 10 Italian civilians in June 1944 .
They say that your bedroom serves as a window of sorts into your personality .
Well , if that ’s the case , I wonder what tidbits can be gleamed about myself from the current chaotic state of my room .
Looking into that so - called window becomes extremely difficult when the blinds are shut morning , noon and night .
Good luck to you nosy folks trying to sneak around and unlock insight into what I am all about because you ’ll find just like when company comes over that the bedroom door remains shut .
I guess you could call the bedroom the Stephen Baldwin of rooms because it goes largely ignored in light of its ’ more popular brothers : living , dinning and bath .
Like Rodney Dangerfield it gets no respect .
Now do n’t get me wrong .
I desperately want to squash the nasty rumors going around about the person who mysteriously disappeared during game night after accidentally turning left instead of right on their way to the bathroom .
The thing is when you are cleaning like a mad man and are up against the clock ; your bedroom suddenly becomes a great hiding place for all the things you do n’t know what to do with .
For obvious reasons , the cleanliness of your bedroom ranks low on the totem pole of priorities when you are entertaining guests .
You see it is highly unlikely Jenn will decide out of the blue that the perfect location for the smoldering fondue pot is the middle of our bed over the duvet cover .
Chances are good we ’re not going to be sitting on throw pillows playing Uno , Catchphrase or Hearts .
Neither will the guys be huddled around the 26 inch TV with the wing tray laid out on our dresser when the big screen in the living room makes watching the Redskins lose a lead in the final minutes of the 4th quarter even that more painful .
The problem arises once all of the guests have long since gone and all Jenn and I can think of is entering dream world .
It feels like the bed is calling our name .
Unfortunately , his voice is muffled due to the pile of laundry resting on top of it .
We open the door ; walk delicately through the landmine field and after pushing all the ‘ stuff ’ off , collapse in bed .
We have ever intention of dealing with the mess in the morning , but would n’t you know it the girls are raring to go before the crack of dawn demanding our full attention .
Chipping away at it bit by bit causes the tide to turn .
For the most part , the bedroom goes back to normal for a while .
However , everything does n’t always go back to its proper place and over time the collection of stuff grows .
What should be a peaceful sanctuary has the tendency to become a graveyard where knick - knacks go to meet their maker .
Maybe my domestication effort is rubbing off on me because this trend is coming to an end .
Look out world .
Do n’t let that door swinging open smack you in your face .
The next time Jenn and I are entertaining the cleaning process will start with the bedroom first .
This way while friends are mingling and enjoying appetizers they can see where the magic happens ….
the magic of my cleaning ability that is .
Jeff de Boer is an artist that believes that cats would look way more awesome if they were wearing some freaking armor .
And he 's totally right .
He 's been making armor for animals since the 90's , and started with protective gear for mice ( see pictures after jump ) .
He then moved on to his line of cat battle gear , and I 've got to say , it looks great .
I 've got one cat in particular that would look great in these get - ups .
His name is Tiny , but we call him the terrorist or Shitty Bill .
He would totally rock the hell out of the neighborhood cats if we gave him a suit like this .
Of course then the little bastard would probably turn on me and kill me in my sleep .
So I 'm just going to make him cardboard armor instead .
If he 's lucky he may get a tinfoil helmet , but definitely no lance .
UPDATE : Shitty Bill cried until I promised him a lance .
So I guess I 'll make him one out out of a broomstick or something .
UPDATE : Jesus , now he wants a mount to ride .
UPDATE : Tied him to the dog .
They look great , totally ready for battle .
A bunch more pictures along with a link to the whole gallery after the jump .

Gaza is struggling to recover from the recent conflict with Israel
A 17 - year - old Palestinian girl has been killed in Gaza by Israeli fire .
After initial denials , Israeli army officials said the girl was killed by Israeli troops during a clash with Palestinian militants on Thursday .
Reports say that two others were injured in the exchange in central Gaza near the Israeli border .
The Gaza - Israel border has been quiet , except for sporadic violence , since Israel launched a devastating three - week campaign in Gaza in late December .
Six months after the offensive , Gaza remains under blockade , a state of affairs Israel says will continue while its soldier Gilad Shalit remains in Hamas captivity .
Reports named the 17 - year - old girl as Hyam Ayash , a resident of the Deir al - Balah refugee camp .
West Bank violence
Separately in the West Bank , a Palestinian woman carrying a toy gun was shot and wounded by Israel soldiers as she approached a checkpoint , the Israeli military says .
Reports suggest the woman was 18 years old .
Also in the West Bank , the Palestinian Authority has stepped up arrests against people suspected of Hamas membership .
A Hamas member of the Palestinian parliament said that the number of Hamas detainees had almost doubled from 460 to 890 .
Reports say that members of the rival Fatah faction have also been arrested in the Gaza Strip .
BBC Jerusalem correspondent Paul Wood says none of this bodes well for the Egyptian brokered effort to get Hamas and Fatah into a unity government .
The woman was pulled from the sea at The Leas ( photo by Max Hess )
Onlookers who refused to get out of the way of a rescue helicopter trying to land on a Kent beach were risking decapitation , coastguards have said .
A 49 - year - old woman was eventually airlifted to hospital after being saved from the sea at Folkestone on Saturday .
Spike Hughes , of Dover Coastguard said the rescue was hampered by people who refused to move to a safe distance .
He said it was madness people wanted to get so close , because a helicopter 's blades can kill .
Mr Hughes added : " What we had to try and do with our team is actually to clear that particular area for them to land .
It is absolute madness because the blades rotate so fast they can decapitate people
Spike Hughes , Dover Coastguard
" My team down there went into the area and asked a lot of people if they would move out of the area .
" The problem was there were a few people that did n't want to take note of what we were staying and decided to stay in the area .
" It is absolute madness because the blades rotate so fast they can decapitate people .
It 's just stupidity that people want to get so close to it . "
The woman was pulled from the water by two members of the public who went to her aid after she got into difficulties at about 1500 BST on Saturday .
She was treated by paramedics on the beach at The Leas and then airlifted to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford for treatment .

An earthquake measuring 6.9 struck Monday in Mexico but people in San Diego 's downtown high rises felt the shaking .
The U.S. National Earthquake Information Center reported the quake struck at 11 a.m. about 50 miles northeast of Santa Isabel in Baja , Calif. , 330 miles southeast of Tijuana .
Civil protection officials in the two states on either side of the quake -- Baja California and Sonora -- said there were no reports of damage or injury .
The quake came minutes after two others calculated at magnitudes 5.8 and 5.0 , according to the earthquake center .
In San Diego one city employee reported seeing crowds of people filing out of her building .
By 11:30 a.m. , the crowd of people had moved back inside .
It was more of a strange sound than a rattling according to one downtown worker .
“ Was n’t so much that I felt it but I heard it , ” said Greg Shimansky .
“ It lasted so long it did n’t feel so much like an earthquake . ”
Charles Washington was sitting at his desk in a building downtown .
“ It felt like a creaking noise .
It lasted up to 40 seconds , ” said Washington .
“ We thought it was a window washer at first too . ”
“ We thought it was really something , ” he said .
The quakes were all centered in the middle of the narrow slice of sea between the Baja peninsula and Mexico 's mainland , which should help cut down on its chances of causing major damage , said Don Blakeman , an analyst at the center .
" It 's going to be felt extremely widely and it 's possible there may be some damage but there 's no way to speculate at this point , " Blakeman said .
NBCSanDiego received reports from two people working on higher floors at two separate downtown high rises saying books fell of shelves and file cabinets rocked .
One of our Facebook users , Raffael Antonio Scullari in North Park , messaged us saying nothing was felt in North Park .
Delfina sent us an email saying the SANDAG offices at the Wells Fargo Plaza were swaying .
Daphanie works for the city at 4th and B and emailed us to tell us that her building shook during the quake as well .
Did you feel the shaking ?

Every time I have to argue politics with people coming from the US I have to internally cringe at the way most political concepts and movements have been distorted and twisted by their fear of Communism .
It only becomes worse when people will ask me “ but is n’t libertarian socialism an oxymoron ? ” or automatically conflate Anarchists with simple anti-statists .
I end up having to mentally decode what an US American would say and what they really mean in the political language of everyone else .
It ’s as if their whole political spectrum has taken as a whole a turn to the right , to avoid mentioning ( Oh Horror of horrors ) “ Socialism ” .
And since I notice that there ’s others encountering the same issues .
I decided to make a handy table to make it easy for non-Americans to understand what the US are talking about .

That scandal had the most impact on Philadelphia and its judicial system .

Well , it is about time that Reid drew his line in the sand .
And I love this pay line quote :
Reid opened a private meeting of health care providers in Las Vegas on Tuesday by saying , according to one attendee who took notes :
“ We have a problem in America and it ’s called the private insurance industry . ”
“ We ’re energized and we ’re also confident that Sen .
Reid is on the right side on this issue , ” said Michael Ginsburg , a community organizer at the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada , who attended the meeting .
“ That ’s something we can take to our supporters and reassure them . ”
Reid has been traveling throughout the state talking to constituents about health care and other issues while Congress is on summer recess .
[ UPDATE ]
Can I get a witness ?
An AMEN ? for real .
There has been serious hand wringing about this health care insurance reform , or whatever it is called now , and it has been warranted .
When you do not have the White House along with the Democratic Party in lock step , in tandem motion people get concerned where this is going .

We 've highlighted more methods than you can shake a stick at for speeding up Firefox and improving its sometimes out - of - control memory use , but it should behoove the folks at Mozilla to get to the bottom of this issue , one way or another — and users should n't have to learn 18 obscure tricks to take care of it themselves .
It 's not just about memory , either ; if Firefox memory ran high but the browser stayed snappy , that 'd be one thing — but that 's just not the case .
And even though some tests show Firefox winning the memory battle against other browsers , the fact of the matter is this :
If users are commonly experiencing serious browser slowdowns because of a skyrocketing memory footprint over time , then all the tests in the world do n't really make it better .
2. Syncing of Everything

Xmarks ( formerly Foxmarks ) has been around and helping us sync browser bookmarks for years ( and now passwords as well ) ; more recently , Mozilla Weave has added bookmark , password , history , and tab syncing — not a bad start .
But the pie - in - the - sky sync we 've never seen but have been dying for ever since Firefox was born is extension syncing .
Beyond that , we 'd love to see full preference syncing , as well .
( We 've done our best to sync our extensions and profiles across computers by rolling our own solution , but it 's not perfect . )
As Kevin put it when I asked him for his biggest Firefox wish : " When I reinstall Firefox , or switch to another computer , I want my add - ons , settings , bookmarks , passwords , and even my last set of tabs open to come on over , or be brought in with a click . "
Hear hear .

3. Backwards Compatibility for Extensions
Advertisement
We 've performed the same song and dance every single time Firefox updates :
We turn off compatibility checking in new releases of Firefox so that our old extensions will work with the new release even though they have n't specifically been updated for it .
We understand what Mozilla is trying to do here — presumably good extensions are actively updated , right ?
And we want to make sure that all our extensions jive with new releases .
But the fact is , some extensions are so simple that the kind developer who dedicated her time to creating the extension may not be interested in changing a version number inside the extension 's source every time Firefox updates — leaving most to either come to terms with the fact that their must - have extension is now in the dead pool or hoping that some other generous soul will take on the extension as their own personal project .
The point is , if Microsoft were making every program virtually unusable every single time Windows updated , people would be pissed .
The folks at Firefox need to think of some way to address this issue and allow for backwards compatibility with their add - ons .

4. A Tool to Diagnose Bad Extensions
Advertisement
If it 's possible , extensions are both the most attractive thing about Firefox while simultaneously being an enormous thorn in its side .
We 're often led to believe that Firefox memory problems arise as the result of bad extensions that leak memory and / or slow down the 'fox .
That 's all fine and dandy , but how is the general ( or hell , even the power user ) supposed to know which extensions are slowing his / her browser to a crawl — apart from the tedious - as - hell disable / enable troubleshooting dance ( which , frankly , rarely works all that well under any but the most obvious of circumstances ) .
We 'd suggest Firefox look into something similar to what they 've done in Internet Explorer 8 ( yeah , you read that correctly — in IE ) :
The Manage Add-ons tool in IE8 displays the load time for all your add - ons to give you an idea what toolbars and extensions are slowing down your load time .
If it were possible ( and I surely do n't know if it is ) , it'd be even better to see an additional column displaying memory usage .

5. Tab Isolation à la Google Chrome
We know the folks at Mozilla are already working on this one , but when Google introduced Chrome and showed us how it isolated each tab as a separate process so that a bum tab would n't crash the entire browser , and how you can see how much memory each tab is using , they left Firefox ( and every other browser ) in the dust on this one — meaning we probably wo n't see content processes in Firefox for at least a year .
Bummer .

Bonus Gripes
In addition to the five big ones we listed above , here 's a quick rundown of some niggling little annoyances and much - desired tweaks we'd like to see addressed :
We want to see spellchecker suggestions that include items in your custom dictionary ( i.e. , words you 've added to the Firefox dictionary by right - clicking and selecting Add to Dictionary ) .
( i.e. , words you 've added to the Firefox dictionary by right - clicking and selecting Add to Dictionary ) .
I 'd kill to see the keyword field in the regular bookmark dialog .
It 's there when you right - click on a bookmark and select properties , and it's a necessary component of my absolute favorite Firefox productivity booster
.
It 's there when you right - click on a bookmark and select properties , and it's a necessary component of my I want to be able to right - click on bookmarks inside folders to delete or edit them in OS X .
This may sound nitpicky ( and it is ) , but it 's also extremely annoying if you 've ever butted up against this one .
You can do it in Windows , but if you want to edit or delete a bookmark inside a folder on your bookmarks toolbar in OS X , you have to open the bookmark manager to do it — and that 's a place I never desire to go .

So there 's a quick look at our main Firefox wishlist .
Our passion regarding what we'd like to see improved in Firefox is a testament to how much we love it , but some of our wishes — like the memory management issue — are things that need to be addressed if Firefox is going to remain in its privileged position .
We certainly did n't hit every angle , so if you 've got your own list of wishes and or gripes , let 's hear them in the comments .

What sorts of things did gay men get up to in the past , and how much did these differ from what we get up to today ?
Does gay sex have a history , or do the forms of pleasure remain the same across centuries ?
Have some tastes declined , and new tastes arisen ?
Some things , like cruising and cottaging , have been popular for centuries .
Public latrines and baths or " stews " were good pick - up spots in the late Middle Ages .
Dutch gay men in the early 18th century coined the word " kruisen " , and their favourite cruising grounds were the quays along the waterfront .
In Amsterdam in the 1760s many sodomites were arrested in the public toilets built next to the city ’s numerous bridges ; favourite toilets were given nicknames , such as The Old Lady and The Long Lady .
In 18th - century London , gay men were regularly arrested in the Lincoln ’s Inn bog house , on the east side of New Square , Lincoln ’s Inn Fields .
The Savoy bog house was used so regularly by gay men that members of the Society for the Reformation of Manners often posted themselves outside and could be sure of making an arrest there .
And in the Temple bog house in 1707 a hole had been deliberately cut in the partition wall between two stalls – making it the first recorded glory hole .
In 18th - century England , what gay men called " picking up trade " was common in the covered arcades of the Royal Exchange and Covent Garden , where they competed with Women of Pleasure .
In 1718 a watchman caught sight of two people shagging while leaning against the rails of Covent Garden Church , not an unusual sight , but when he realised they were both men he started calling them filthy sodomites .
One of these men , whose breeches were down around his ankles , replied " Sirrah !
what ’s that to you , ca n’t I make use of my own Body ?
I have done nothing but what I will do again . "
Public parks and open fields were popular resorts for gay sex .
The path that ran across the middle of Moorfields , the large fields just north of the City walls , was called the " Sodomites ’ Walk " .
The basic pick - up technique was to stand up against a wall and pretend to be making water , and to wait until someone expressed some interest .
The best area for male prostitution was Bird Cage Alley in St James 's Park .
There , Guardsmen regularly offered themselves for sex and then blackmailed their tricks .
A soldier named James Brown and his brother claimed that they had picked up and then blackmailed five hundred gentlemen in Bird Cage Alley in the late 1750s .
Another soldier , John Mitchell , who bragged that his penis was nine inches long , said , " When I wanted Money , I took a Walk in the Park , and got 4 or 5 Guineas a - Night of Gentlemen , because they would not be expos’d . "
Contrary to the view that gays in the past took strictly " active " or " passive " roles , eighteenth - century trials ( our best source for details about sex ) show that most gay men took turn and turn about , and enjoyed reciprocal sex .
A single sexual encounter often covered a broad range of activity .
An illustration of this is the case of two men who were prosecuted in 1772 for buggering one another in the toilet of the Red Lion pub in Moorfields .
Robert Crook , a 19 - year - old man who was sharing a drink with Charles Gibson , said : " I went into the yard to make water , he came into the yard while I was making water , took hold of my yard , and began to work it with his hand ; he said ‘ It was a very good one , and he liked it very well ’ ; he then asked me to go down to the vault [ i.e. the bog - house ] with him , which I did .
There he said ‘ Did not you know Dick that lived in this house ?
He had a fine tool , almost as big as my wrist , you are just such a lad as he was , let ’s see if your ’s is as big as his . ’
Then he worked my yard till he made it spend in his hand .
Then he pushed me back upon the vault , and worked me in the same manner on the seat of the vault till I did it in his hand ; after that he kissed me very heartily ; then he unbuttoned his own breeches , put my hand to his private parts , and kept tickling me about ten minutes ; he kissed it and rubbed it , then he said ‘ Now it will do ’ ; he then turned round , and put his naked breech into my lap , and put his hand behind him , laid hold of my yard , and pushed it into his backside , twice or three times , I am not sure which . "
After they were finished , Gibson wanted to change positions and bugger Crook .
Crook claimed he was drunk and had been forced to take part in sex .
But others had seen them kissing in the pub , and it transpired that this was not the only time both men had been to the vault together .
In this incident Gibson kissed Crook ’s " yard " .
But there are only half a dozen references to sucking between men in 18th - century English trials .
In the Dutch Republic it was also rare , and considered a special treat .
In 1730 a wealthy patrician was prosecuted for sucking his servants ; one of the things he liked to do was spit their semen into a glass of wine and drink it .
In 1765 a pedler was tried in Amsterdam for sucking a friend .
He claimed he had learned the practice from a physician , who on one occasion said " Oh boy , I swallowed it . "
Cock - sucking is mentioned , usually as an insult , in Ancient Classical literature , but the practice nearly disappeared between then and modern times .
In late medieval Florence , it is mentioned in 12 per cent of the legal records concerning sex between men .
In German lands in the 1530s there are cases of men approaching other men in public latrines and offering to " suck out the nature " from them .
There are allusions to oral sex in Richard Barnfield ’s poem The Affectionate Shepherd , Containing the Complaint of Daphnis for the love of Ganymede , which was published in 1594 , e.g. :
If it be sinne to loue a louely Lad :
Oh then sinne I , for whom my soule is sad .
. . . . . .
O would to God ( so I might have my fee )
My lips were honey , and thy mouth a Bee .
Then shouldst thou sucke my sweete and my faire flower
That now is ripe , and full of honey - berries .
" Fee " is a common Elizabethan pun for sexual intercourse .
Elsewhere in the poem Barnfield hopes his beloved will " suck my Coyne " ( " coin " is a common Elizabethan metaphor for semen ) , and he also uses puns such as " stones " ( meaning testicles ) and " purses " ( meaning scrotum ) .
However , although Barnfield ’s homoeroticism is clear , and was recognized by his contemporaries , it has to be acknowledged that any claim that he deals with fellatio depends upon our interpretation of metaphors and puns .
Less metaphorical descriptions of oral sex feature in some late 18th - century French erotica , especially by the Marquis de Sade , and there are prints illustrating it .
But in real life , hardly anyone in the 17th or 18th centuries , male or female , prostitute or otherwise , gay or straight , ever engaged in oral sex .
Some historians of sexuality argue that oral sex between men and women was n’t common until the early twentieth century .
For example , it was n’t treated favourably in marriage manuals until the late 1920s .
For gay men , the taste for oral sex has grown over the years .
In Havelock Ellis ’s book Sexual Inversion , published in 1897 , nine of the gay men in his case studies preferred anal sex , compared to only three who preferred oral sex .
In America , in the late nineteenth century some laws for the first time specifically prohibited oral sex between men , which might indicate that it was a newly popular practice .
Herman Melville in his novel Redburn , published in 1849 , refers obliquely to oral sex between sailors .
It seems possible that oral sex became popular among gay men first in America and was then imported into Europe .
Gay Swedish men working on the liners sailing between Gothenburg and New York in the 1930s reported that they got lots of oral sex in New York , while the main sex act in Gothenburg was mutual masturbation .
The slang terms " blow " and " blow job " originated in 1930s America .
Even in the 1960s and 1970s , it was generally believed that oral sex was more common between American men , while anal sex was more common between British men , and these national preferences are reflected in the pornography of the time .
The changing taste for oral sex is one area where there is a sharp break between the past and the present .
Some historians argue that in the past oral sex was disagreeable to people becasue their personal hygiene left something to be desired .
That argument is n’t entirely convincing .
For one thing , people did in fact wash themselves using a hand basin and water jug even though they did n’t take baths or showers ( and they did go to saunas and " stews " or public baths every so often , where lots of non-oral sex was enjoyed ) .
For another , dental hygiene was n’t too great either  most people had rotten teeth and stinking breath  but that did n’t prevent them from enjoying a good long kiss now and then .
There is probably a strong taboo concerning semen , which gay men overcame earlier than straight men and women .
Though semen has no procreative value in sex between men , it nevertheless has a magical value .
In some cultures , notably Melanesia , the ingestion of semen features in " coming - of - age " initiation rituals , whereby masculinity is transferred to young men .
The two Victorian pioneers of gay liberation , Edward Carpenter and John Addington Symonds , felt that their personal experience confirmed this .
Symonds wrote to Carpenter in December 1892 : " I have no doubt myself that the absorption of semen implies a real modification of the physique of the person who absorbs it , & that the most beneficent results , as regards health and nervous energy , accrue from the sexual relations between men . "
Volcanic jets of the liquid erupt in gay pornography , as in the Victorian pornographic novel Teleny ( 1893 ) , which was probably written by a group of men under the direction of Oscar Wilde : " my breath came thickly ; I panted , I sighed , I groaned .
The thick burning fluid was spouted out slowly and at long intervals .
As I rubbed myself against him , he underwent all the sensations I was feeling ; for I was hardly drained of the last drop before I was likewise bathed in his own seething sperm . "
A lot of " rubbing " takes place in this novel , as well as sodomy .
The most common forms of sex between men during Victorian times seem to have been mutual tossing off or between - thigh fucking .
Oscar Wilde did n’t much care for anal intercourse , but preferred to have one of his " panthers " or rough trade sit in his lap while he " played " with him .
Then Wilde would mount his partner face - to - face to enjoy " spending on his belly " .
But sexual tastes vary according to temperament as well as historical period .
For example , Oscar Wilde ’s lover Lord Alfred Douglas preferred to bugger young schoolboys , while Wilde preferred " rough " older lads .
Neither Wilde nor Douglas would seek sex with an obviously effeminate " pouf " .
Times have changed .
Some marked changes in gay sexuality have occurred especially since the 1950s and 1960s .
Fisting , for example , has no historical precedent  although impalement features in some early gay fantasies .
In Teleny , a man who is not satisfied by a dildo bleeds to death after a large glass vase inserted into his anus breaks .
Surveys of diaries , news reports , and the gay media have established that fisting was invented in the summer of 1971 , in the " backroom " of a gay bar in New York City .
The practice quickly spread to the backroom bars of San Francisco , and was exported thence to Japan and Europe .
The pent - up libido that was released in the Swinging Sixties has blossomed in a garden of special interests , notably fetishistic sex games ranging from mild bondage and discipline to the extremes of sadomasochism .
To see how things have changed , we can compare the original 1881 edition of The Sins of the Cities of the Plain : Or , The Recollections of a Mary - Anne , with an edition published in 1992 by Badboy Books , New York .
This Victorian gay pornography is the genuine ( albeit semi- fictionalised ) autobiography of a male prostitute , or " Mary - Ann " , named John Saul , aka Dublin Jack , and it probably contain an accurate account of what gay men did in the 1870s .
Saul was game for anything , and his memoirs contain plenty of descriptions of between - thigh rubbing , " bottom - fucking " ( often by sitting in someone ’s lap ) , rimming preparatory to buggering , fingering ditto , cock - sucking and sixty - nining .
But the 1992 " reprint " added several totally new scenes catering for the modern S/M market .
In a long episode not in the original , a wicked voluptuary seizes a large candle from a table laid for a banquet and drips molten wax over Jack ’s flesh , before stuffing him like a turkey with the said candle .
Another important change is that the 1881 original had several heterosexual sex scenes , while the 1992 " reprint " changed the gender pronouns in these scenes , thus making the book exclusively homosexual throughout .
Such alterations suggest that over the course of a century there has been a historical shift in gay self - identity , and a more masculine gay self - image .
Alternatively , the changes in the two versions of may simply represent the fact that the modern market for pornography has become much more rigidly segregated between gay and straight than it was a century ago .
Nevertheless , in this novel and in other sources we see that the " Mary - Anns " or gay prostitutes in Victorian times often dressed up as women , or at least wore make - up and presented an effeminate appearance .
The most famous in real life were Ernest Boulton and Frederick William Park , aka Lady Stella and Miss Fanny .
When they were arrested in the Burlington Arcade in 1869 Boulton was wearing a cherry - coloured silk evening dress , trimmed with white lace , and Park was wearing a green satin dress trimmed with black lace .
In the 1920s male prostitutes often wore make - up and , like Quentin Crisp , presented an " effeminate " appearance .
Today , although male prostitutes often wear distinctive " costumes " , they generally present a macho appearance , echoing the " physique " magazines since the 1950s , when photographers such as Bob Mizer had their models pose as bikers and leathermen , construction workers and sailors of the rougher sort .
The " effeminate " model of sexually available young men or " lady - boys " is still common , however , in places such as Thailand and other countries frequented by sexual tourists , and prostitution is the main form of employment of the self - castrated hijras of India .
Even in the West , transsexuals form a large percentage of prostitutes , and " chicks with dicks " are an intriguing sub-section on gay porn sites on the web .
However , some things never change .
Trial records for all periods turn up cases of men who lived together in " sodomitical sin " that included intimacy and tenderness .
Several men investigated by the Paris police in the 1740s claimed that they sought " a relationship which might last " .
According to one police report , two men had lived and slept together intimately for two years :
" It was even almost always necessary for Duquesnel to have his arm extended along the headboard , under Dumaine ’s head .
Without that Dumaine could not rest . "

Seventy - seven members of Congress , 76 Democrats and 1 Republican , sent a letter to the White House today asking for the President to suspend current Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell investigations and discharges by presidential moratorium , which would change the policy ’s implementation within the Department of Defense , as opposed to an Executive Order .
Excerpts from the office of Congressman Alcee L. Hastings :
… Although we are confident that you will remain true to your campaign promise to end Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell , our LGBT service members and our country ’s national security will continue to suffer if initial action is delayed until 2010 or 2011 .
We urge you to exercise the maximum discretion legally possible in administering Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell until Congress repeals the law .
To this end , we ask that you direct the Armed Services not to initiate any investigation of service personnel to determine their sexual orientation , and that you instruct them to disregard third party accusations that do not allege violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice .
That is , we request that you impose that no one is asked and that you ignore , as the law requires , third parties who tell .
Under your leadership , Congress must then repeal and replace Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell with a policy of inclusion and non-discrimination .
This bilateral strategy would allow our openly gay and lesbian service members to continue serving our country and demonstrate our nation ’s lasting commitment to justice and equality for all .
…
The American people and service members of the Armed Forces overwhelmingly support the repeal of Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell .
According to a national Gallup poll conducted in May 2009 , 69 % of Americans , including 58 % of Republicans , favor allowing openly gay men and lesbian women to serve in the military .
Furthermore , a 2006 poll of 545 troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan by Zogby International and the Michael D. Palm Center at the University of California , Santa Barbara , revealed that 73 % are personally comfortable with gay men and lesbian women .
John Shalikashvili , former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Clinton administration , and more than 100 retired admirals and generals support this repeal , in addition to the Human Rights Campaign , the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network , and Knights Out , an organization of LGBT West Point alumni cofounded by First Lieutenant Choi .
Mr. President , we cannot afford to lose any more of our dedicated and talented service members to Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell .
On behalf of First Lieutenant Choi , Lieutenant Colonel Fehrenbach , and the more than 12,500 gay and lesbian service members who have been discharged since Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell was implemented in 1994 , we stand ready to assist you in repealing this dishonorable and debilitating law as soon as possible , and in restoring justice and equality in our Armed Forces .
Update , July 1 , 2009 !
Check out this post about applying for Income - based repayment from your lender !
This July 1st , the College Cost Reduction and Access Act ( CCRAA ) of 2007 will take effect and includes provisions to make undergraduate and graduate education more affordable for aspiring social - impact professionals .
The CCRAA is a complicated piece of legislation that , if you take advantage of it , can help you retire college and grad school debt early .
The main programs that the CCRAA has created include :
Income - Based Repayment ( IBR ) —
Caps monthly direct and guaranteed ( FFEL ) student loan payments based on the borrower ’s income and family size .
According to IBRinfo , “ For most eligible borrowers , IBR loan payments will be less than 10 percent of their income – and even smaller for borrowers with low earnings .
IBR will also forgive remaining debt , if any , after 25 years of qualifying payments . ”
Besides taking out the right kind of loan to start with ( or consolidating your loans into the Direct Loan Program ) , it ’s important to note that if you get married , your spouse ’s income counts when calculating your monthly payment .
Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) — Retires the direct or guaranteed ( FFEL ) student loan debt of public service professionals who ’ve been making ten years of qualified payments on their loans .
Counting as “ public service ” includes 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit employment ; government ( federal , state , local , tribal ) , military , public school and college employment ; and national service participation ( like AmeriCorps and Peace Corps ) .
Read the fine print of what counts as “ qualified payments . ”
You can put both of these new programs to work for you — so you can make income - contingent payments for ten years , and then retire your debt , if you qualify for participation .
Also note that it ’s really all up to you to access the programs and to keep track of your payment and employment records so that you can prove your eligibility .
Resources to Help You
Many twists and turns exist in the path to understanding the new law as you try to take full advantage of these programs for yourself , your students , or corps members in your program .
Below are some places to learn more :
Equal Justice Works has launched a Student Loan Debt Relief Resource Center and podcast show to break down the facts .

A gang of cyber fraudsters were arrested this morning after allegedly making tens of thousands of pounds by buying their own records from Apple iTunes and Amazon using stolen credit cards .
Nine people are currently being held in custody following arrests at addresses in London and the West Midlands earlier today .
The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that the arrests were the result of a parallel international probe carried out with the FBI that kicked off in February 2009 .
The police units found that between September 2008 and January this year , a criminal gang allegedly provided music via an unnamed US web firm that uploaded the tracks to iTunes and Amazon.com for sale .
The Met claimed the network pulled in sales of approximately $ 750,000 ( £ 468,750 ) using 1,500 compromised UK and USA credit cards , that slipped under the radar of both Apple and Amazon .
The two internet giants were hoodwinked into coughing up royalties totalling $ 300,000 ( £ 187,500 ) to the gang , said the Met .
" This investigation , with its national and international dimension , exemplifies why we have set up this national response to e-crime .
It shows the success that can be achieved through our close working relationship with the FBI , " said the Met 's e-Crime unit spokesman DCI Terry Wilson .
" We are now making it more risky for criminals who seek to exploit the internet and commit e-crime across national borders .
We are working hard through partnership with industry and law enforcement to combat e-crime and are committed to pursuing those responsible . "
Some 60 UK officers from the Met and West Midlands police took part in this morning 's raids in London , Birmingham , Kent and Wolverhampton , where six men and three women between the ages of 22 and 46 were arrested .
The Met confirmed that the nine alleged fraudsters remained in custody in a number of London and Midlands police stations on suspicion of conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering . ®
Warning … veering off topic …
On a humid July morning 40 years ago today , Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong , Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin climbed aboard the most dangerous vehicle man had ever built , on a voyage to the moon .
I was two and half years old .
I remember that day , or at least have convinced myself that I remember it , sitting in front of an old black and white television watching a streak of light hurtle towards the stars .
Like most boys growing up , I was fascinated by all things space and dinosaurs .
While interest in the Jurassic and Cretaceous eventually faded , the love of space and space travel , did not .
Astronomy books , science - fiction novels , movies , I could n’t get enough .
I was a certified space geek .
When I went off to college I decided to study aerospace engineering , with the dream of working one day for NASA or JPL , but soon realized I had little of the prerequisite discipline necessary for that field of study , ie the math .
And there was a lot of it .
So I switched to Journalism , which had only slightly more math than English .
But my interest in all things space never waned .
Barely a year into my studies I watched in horror as the shuttle Challenger exploded into a million pieces across the Atlantic .
I attended no class that day , not even the Astronomy elective I was taking .
I remember President Reagan ’s moving tribute later that same evening : “ We will never forget them , nor the last time we saw them , this morning , as they prepared for their journey and waved good - bye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God … ”
There have certainly been other triumphs and disasters since , but for me , none quite so much like the day humankind took their first steps on the moon .
In honor of 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch , the JFK Library and Museum explores the mission in extraordinary detail at WeChooseTheMoon.com .
The site tracks the mission in realtime as it happened , creating a thoroughly immersive and cool experience .

The lush green of the rain forest offers rich natural resources which the Ashaninka Indians have lived on for centuries .
At the Yoreka Atame school of primeval forestry in Brazil , young indigenous and non-indigenous people have been learning how to make use of them in a sustainable way .
Since 2007 , the school has taught more than 2,000 participants skills like the cultivating fruit trees , keeping bees , and erecting dams in creeks and lakes to enhance spawning grounds for fish .
Cultivating traditional plants is part of the curriculum
" That 's how we Ashaninka Indians here in the border region between Brazil and Peru want to pass on our traditional knowledge , " said Moises Piyako .
He cofounded the Yoreka Atame school together with his brother Benki in 2007 .
Illegal logging threatens biodiversity
Political problems between Brazil and its neighbor Peru make life complicated for the indigenous people in the border region .
" We are suffering from Peruvian logging companies , and now the Peruvian government also wants to dig for oil along the border , " said Moises Piyako .
Illegal timber - fellers from Peru are increasingly encroaching on the rainforest on both sides of the border .
The land and its resources belong to the Ashaninka , according to the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 169 adopted by the International Labour Organisation , ILO .
It recognizes the rights of ownership of the peoples over the lands which they traditionally occupy .
But Peru has been trying to circumnavigate international law by granting mining concessions for areas that are owned by indigenous peoples .
The Ashaninka live in the border region between Brazil and Peru
" In the process , Peruvian timber companies even illegally enter Brazilian territory , " said Ashaninka spokesman Benki Piyako .
" Illegal logging is putting our whole region and its biodiversity at risk . "
The invasion of Ashaninka rainforests by illegal loggers started in 2001 with a company called Forestal Venao , which is owned by the daughter of the former Peruvian president , Alberto Fujimori .
He was recently put on trial for corruption and has already been convicted to 25 years in prison for severe human rights violations and killing opposition politicians .
His daughter , Keiko Fujimori , has announced her candidacy for the presidency as well as her aim to officially pardon her father should she come to power .
Her political campaign is partially funded by the earnings from her timber company .
Demand for a ban
Illegal logging damages the rainforest
To prevent Forestal Venao from wreaking further havoc on Brazilian territory , Benki and Moises Piyako demand a world - wide ban on imports of wood illegally felled in rainforests .
" There are only a few specimen left of many of the tree species , and we are trying to recultivate these economic plants , " they said , adding that there is a lack of understanding for the importance of managing resources sustainably .
" We must make sure that our natural resources are not destroyed in the struggle for survival . "
In their fight for environmental protection , the Ashaninka combine traditional knowledge and modern technology .
Some remote communities have already set up satellite - supported communication systems in the rainforest .
By checking satellite photographs on a computer , the communities can monitor illegal logging activities or the illegal construction of roads in their region .
" We install this monitoring system , and we teach the local people how to operate the GPS technology , " said Benki Piyako .
Hi-tech to protect the rainforest
CO2 certificates pay for recultivation efforts
In addition , Benki Piyako and his village of Apiwtxa have set up a video blog on life in the rainforest .
There , they also post satellite photos that document how illegal logging is devastating huge areas .
It is their aim to teach people how the forest and its resources can be used without destroying them .
And they also want to set up a global network supporting the protection of their region .
Modern tools are also employed when it comes to environmental protection .
The indigenous organization in Apiwtxa sells CO2 certificates , and the Ashaninka also offer them to companies that want to support the protection of the rainforest .
Several international rock bands have already planted new trees in the rainforest to compensate for the energy consumption during their concerts .

Divergent messages from the Obama administration in the past two days hint at a tough political reality : Nobody likes higher taxes , but that may be the price of getting America 's fiscal house back in order .
Although Barack Obama campaigned on a pledge of no tax hikes on the middle class , top administration officials on Sunday appeared to open the door to rethinking that position .
Then on Monday the White House press secretary said the door really is n't open .
Either way , the discussion of possible tax hikes is already out of the stable .
Economists generally agree with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner that the nation is on an unsustainable fiscal path , and that hard choices will need to be made – although the reckoning may not occur on Mr. Obama 's watch .
Some say the magnitude of the hole to be filled is so large that spending cuts alone are unlikely to do the job .
" It ’s going to take a combination of things that will slow the growth of spending ... and increasing [ tax ] revenues , " predicts Jim Horney , a budget expert at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities , a left - leaning Washington research group .
Virtually “ all agree that under our current path we ’re going to see over time an explosion in deficits and debt . "
The path of inaction would have serious consequences , he warns : slower economic growth , greater risk of rising interest rates , and a growing burden of debt dumped on younger generations of Americans .
Political peril of tax hikes
But the path of action has consequences , too , if tax hikes are involved .
Just ask George H.W. Bush , who lost the White House in 1992 after departing from his pledge , " Read my lips : No new taxes . "
In the election , Obama pledged that tax rates would n't rise for Americans with household incomes below $ 250,000 a year .
Recent polls confirm that Americans are generally not in a mood for a broad tax hike .
Asked if they are willing to pay more taxes to reduce the federal deficit , 56 percent said no and 41 percent said yes in a New York Times / CBS News survey late last month .
Deficit outlook worsens
But the mammoth federal spending designed to lift the economy out of recession , coupled with a recession - related slump in tax revenues , has made the outlook for budget deficits much worse .
Add the projected costs of covering healthcare for baby - boomer retirees and , possibly , those who are currently uninsured , and it's clear why the issue of taxes is weighing heavier on the public and politicians lately .
In a televised interview on ABC on Sunday , Secretary Geithner talked about the need to make " hard choices " to rein in federal budget deficits .
And the president 's top economic policy adviser , Larry Summers , said on CBS that healthcare reform will cost money , and " it is never a good idea to absolutely rule things out . "
Is this code language for reconsidering a middle - class tax hike ?
On Monday , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs insisted that 's not the case .
" The president 's clear commitment is not to raise taxes on those making less than $ 250,000 a year , " he said .
The 8 percent solution ?
Whereas conservatives talk about solving the budget problem by cutting spending , and liberals ( including Obama ) call for making the highest - earning Americans pay more , the scale of the challenge may end up defying those prescriptions .
The federal deficit " is projected to average at least $ 1 trillion per year for the 10 years after 2009 , even if the economy returns to full employment and the stimulus package is allowed to expire in two years , " economists William Gale of the Brookings Institution and Alan Auerbach of the University of California , Berkeley , concluded in a study earlier this year .
They say the US must close a gap equal to about 8 percent of gross domestic product .
That means if the nation acts now , taxes must either go up that much or federal spending must go down that much , permanently , to put government finances on a sustainable course .
For comparison , federal revenues totaled about 18 percent of GDP in 2008 .
To close the whole gap with tax increases might crimp economic growth , as the government grabbed a larger share of national income .
Spending cuts of that magnitude might displease legions of voters who – whatever they may say about bureaucracy – rely on government services .
It 's hard for policymakers to agree to a shift that big all on the spending side , or all on the tax side .
In the past , Mr. Horney says , progress on budget deficits has generally come with compromises on both sides of the ledger .
Not everyone agrees on the size of the so - called " fiscal gap . "
But budget experts agree that the gap grows progressively larger , as a percentage of GDP , with each year of delay .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office offers one scenario outlining the gap being 8 percent of GDP if action is taken today , and 12 percent of GDP if action is taken in 2030 .

Android Forums members have been wondering about TomTom for Android since November 2008 .
It ’s time for that discussion to continue as TomTom execs have clearly implied the company is working on a TomTom Android application :
“ We cannot ignore such a successful platform as Android .
HTC is an important partner of ours and Android is becoming increasingly important too . ”
Windows Mobile has had TomTom capabilities for some time now and the Apple iPhone TomTom app is the most recent addition to the stable .
Symbian and BlackBerry users will have to wait a little longer , if not forever :
“ We spent so much time producing the iPhone software and we were later on the scene than we wanted but the standard of the service and the quality of the satnav is what was most important to us . ”
“ I do not question the opportunity that RIM might offer but we know that a satnav device needs to have a large touchscreen and voice commands to be able to work for turn - by - turn navigation .
We come from a PDA background and we know what will work . ”
This will be a GREAT story to follow – I know for a FACT that there are a LOT of Android owners out there craving TomTom integration .
Right now Telenav leads the way in on -Android GPS navigation , but the introduction of TomTom for Android will be a welcomed alternative .
For a point of reference , here is a quick initial review of TomTom on the iPhone :
The TomTom iPhone App costs $ 100 and I would expect the Android price to be comparable .
Clearly one of the more pricey apps on the Android Market , would that be worth it to you ?

As war raged in Lebanon in the summer of 2006 , people around the world called for international intervention to stop the shelling of civilians .
In January this year , millions shared similar feelings of horror and anger witnessing the bloodshed in Gaza .
Both events were especially painful to Muslims watching other defenceless Muslims being killed .
But why have the deaths of vastly more unarmed Muslims in Darfur caused so little concern among co-religionists ?
The Khartoum regime , brought to power in a highly ideological and fundamentalist Islamist coup 20 years ago , has killed an estimated 400,000 of its fellow Muslim citizens .
Yet , there is near silence about massive human rights abuses in the remote western corner of Sudan .
As Tareq Al - Hamed , editor of the Asharq Alaswat paper , has asked , " Are the people of Darfur not Muslims as well ? "
When the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Sudanese leader , President Bashir , in March , Muslim politicians from Senegal to Malaysia rallied behind him .
The same people who demand international justice for war crimes in Lebanon and Gaza abruptly changed their tune .
Instead of denouncing Bashir as the architect of ethnic cleansing , they congratulated him for defying the " conspiracy " to undermine Sudan 's sovereignty so the West can take its oil .
The Iranian Parliamentary Speaker , Ali Larijani , said the ICC warrant was " an insult to the Muslim world " .

Mercifully , the views expressed by Arab and Muslim leaders are at odds with their citizens .
The Lebanese American pollster James Zogby found 80 per cent of those questioned in four Arab countries were concerned about Darfur and felt it should have more media attention .
However , they were reluctant to apportion blame , and , not surprisingly , they were hostile to international intervention .
Meanwhile some commentators in Muslim - majority countries are questioning their leaders ' support for Bashir .
According to The Daily Star of Lebanon , " Bashir has sought to cultivate an image of himself as an Arab / African hero who is standing up for his fellow Arabs / Africans by defying the edicts of foreign ' imperial ' powers . "
So , are Darfuris the " wrong " kind of Muslims because they self - identify as black Africans rather than Arabs , despite widespread inter-marriage in Sudan ?
The Ugandan president , Yoweri Museveni , cites Arab chauvinism against Africans .
I have lived in Arab countries and seen first hand the racism and bigotry that commands the minds of the Arab political class .
The Canadian academic Salim Mansur claims : " Blacks are viewed by Arabs as racially inferior , and Arab violence against blacks has a long , turbulent record . "
For the Nobel Prize winning novelist Wole Soyinka , the unwillingness to confront Arab racism is rooted in the role of Arabs in the slave trade .
" Arabs and Islam are guilty of the cultural and spiritual savaging of the Continent , " he writes .
The Ethiopian academic Mekuria Bulcha estimates that Arab traders sold 17 million Africans to the Middle East and Asia between the sixth and twentieth centuries .
Yet , there is an almost total reluctance on the part of Arab intellectuals to examine their central role in slavery , past or present .
Any attempt to confront persistent Arab racism is shouted down by appeals to Arab / African solidarity against the neo-colonialist West , a sentiment that seldom moves beyond slogans .
Sheikh Saleh Al - Fawzan , a member of the senior council of Wahhabi clerics responsible for writing Saudi school text books , states : " Slavery is part of Islam .
Slavery is part of jihad and jihad will remain as long as there is Islam .
It has not been abolished . "
Arab racism is familiar to African guest workers in countries like Libya and Egypt , enduring routine verbal and physical attack .
Sudanese Arabs suffer from their own racial identity dilemma , viewed as black by their Egyptian neighbours to the north ( Sudan is a corruption of the Egyptian word for black ) .
I have heard the Arab Sudanese use the word for slave ( abid ) to the faces of their fellow citizens who self - identify as non-Arab .
It is also known for Sudanese parents to tease their darker - skinned children , calling them slaves .
To be charitable , it seems that Muslim and Arab leaders wish Darfur would simply go away .
Hence their enthusiasm for postponing Bashir 's arrest warrant " to allow peace talks to work " .
Shortly after the ICC announcement , key members of the Khartoum regime attended an Arab League summit .
They were confident the League would call for the cancellation of ICC jurisdiction in Darfur , conferred by the United Nations Security Council in 2005 .
The meeting failed to agree on anything stronger than the usual denunciations of Israel and America .
Privately , Jordan , Egypt , and Saudi were urging Sudan to deal with the ICC through legal channels .
The Sudanese also failed to get a solidarity summit in Khartoum .
However , Bashir did enjoy a victory tour of countries where he was hailed rather than arrested .
Arab and Muslim leaders are by no means unique in failing to back up their words with action .
Both the US and the UK until recently had leaders who frequently cited their Christian faith , yet did little to help Christians being persecuted in China , Nigeria , Eritrea , North Korea or Egypt .
However , " Muslim solidarity " matters for two reasons .
The Khartoum dictatorship is sensitive to the opinion of Muslim and Arab leaders .
A genuine peace deal will be more likely as a consequence of private pressure from Iran or Egypt rather than Canada or Sweden .
Muslims ' amnesia about Darfur is also symptomatic of the malaise affecting the public face of a faith that lacks the confidence to engage in constructive debate or renewal .
Until Muslims can be self - critical without being condemned as heretics , there will be atrophy where there should be vibrancy , and polarisation and extremism where there should be tolerance and inclusiveness .
Darfur 's tragedy is fast becoming an indelible stain on the collective name of Islam and Muslims .

Everyone has a cause that they ’re passionate about — and as Ira Glass , host of This American Life on NPR , told David Letterman last night , one woman ’s mission inspired him to become vegetarian .
That woman , Karen Davis , is the president of United Poulty Concerns — a a nonprofit organization dedicated to the compassionate and respectful treatment of domestic fowl .
Every year , she organized people to write in to This American Life and complain about their annual “ Chicken Poultry Slam ” series ( a play on Poetry Slam ) that would tell stories about eating chickens and turkeys around the holidays .
She urged Glass to come visit her farm and see just how much personalities chickens have .
And he did — and became a vegetarian .

Iran ’s political crisis intensified Wednesday when the nation ’s main opposition figure announced that he would create a political organization to “ lay the groundwork for a large - scale social movement ” stemming from his disputed election loss to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Many supporters of Mir-Hossein Mousavi had feared the announcement would amount to a disavowal of the civil disobedience campaign that has sprung up since the June election in which the government has been accused of massive vote fraud .
Instead , Mousavi explicitly praised the protest movement as a cornerstone for change in Iran .
In his most extensive remarks in weeks , Mousavi said that “ power is always inclined to become absolute , and only people ’s movements can put a hold on this inclination . ”
Several other opposition figures , emboldened by high - ranking clerics and unbowed by the severe government crackdown on protesters , have also issued challenges to the authority of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his ally Ahmadinejad .
A senior cleric on Wednesday issued a fatwa , or religious edict , encouraging Iranian officials to skip Ahmadinejad ’s inauguration in early August , and former President Mohammad Khatami warned that if his proposal for a referendum on the disputed election was rejected , “ all other legal channels would be practically closed on people , ” leading to unpredictable consequences .

And in a further slap at Khamenei , Iran ’s highest political and spiritual authority , Aftab , a newspaper close to moderate Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , dropped the word “ supreme ” from his title , referring to him in reports only as the leader of Iran .
Increasingly , disparate reformists appear to be acting in concert , coordinating announcements and strategy .
In recent days , photographs have begun appearing on the Internet showing opposition figures at well - attended meetings with supporters .
Mousavi said his new political organization would begin on a small scale with “ influential figures ” and eventually expand into a large movement .
The war of words has followed a government crackdown on massive street demonstrations that followed the June 12 election .
Dozens of Iranians were killed in the public protests and hundreds imprisoned by government forces and militiamen .
Hard - liners have returned fire , with multiple warnings from Khamenei and security officials that protesters are undermining the system and playing into the hands of such foreign enemies as the United States , Britain and Israel .

On Wednesday , a pro-Ahmadinejad lawmaker demanded that the minister of intelligence and security begin airing prison confessions on TV that were extracted from opposition figures detained in the solitary confinement wing of Tehran ’s Evin Prison .
Those held include former Vice President Mohammad Ali Abtahi ; Mostafa Tajzadeh , a former deputy interior minister ; and Behzad Nabavi , a former deputy speaker of the parliament .
Hard - liners in the Revolutionary Guard allege that such reformist figures masterminded riots at the behest of Iran ’s foreign rivals .
But several observers in Iran said airing such confessions could backfire badly , serving to further fan the flames of the protest movement .
“ The amount of mistrust toward the public television networks and security forces has gotten so high that the people will feel sympathy for those who are forced to make these interviews , ” said Saeed Madani , a Tehran social scientist who was once locked up in the solitary confinement wing of Evin .

Khamenei on Monday warned the country ’s political establishment to end a campaign against Ahmadinejad ’s presidency .
Mousavi , a first cousin of Khamenei , has emerged as the figurehead of the grass - roots political movement outraged over what it calls forged election results and the subsequent crackdown .
The former prime minister did not challenge Iran ’s Islamic system , saying its constitution allows enough leeway to accommodate public demands .
Rather , he criticized Ahmadinejad ’s ruling faction .
“ The government ’s level of tolerance has sharply dipped , ” Mousavi said .
“ We are facing a government unwilling to recruit our elites to use their experience .
In the meantime , our elites have no desire to cooperate with this government .
It means lack of legitimacy and efficiency . ”

Mousavi urged his followers to maintain unity above all by avoiding divisive slogans .
“ Our green symbols managed to bring together people from different inclinations to reach agreement , ” he said .
“ Consensus is doubtlessly our main objective . ”
Other reformists have directed sharper barbs at Khamenei .
At a meeting with families of political prisoners Tuesday night , Abdullah Nouri , a former interior minister , compared Khamenei to Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi , who was overthrown in the revolution that established the Islamic Republic 30 years ago .
“ In the 1970s , nobody imagined that limited struggles would drive the shah out of the country , ” he said , according to a reformist website .
Meanwhile , two high - ranking reformist clerics declared support for the protest movement and openly challenged Khamenei ’s leadership .
They also gave tacit permission for government officials and clerics to boycott Ahmadinejad ’s inauguration .

“ The supreme leader ’s confirmation of a president born out of a rigged election could not grant him any legitimacy , ” Grand Ayatollah Asadollah Bayat Zanjani said in a religious edict .
“ Both the supreme leader ’s confirmation and the president ’s swearing - in are acceptable if and only if the president is elected in a clean vote . ”
Ayatollah Mohammad - Ali Dastgheib Shirazi called on other top clerics to support those protesting the election results .
“ Using firearms and crude weapons against people and incarceration of the revolutionaries will never help safeguard Islam and the establishment , ” he said , according to several websites .
Security forces and the highest echelons of government appear convinced that any concession or compromise would only encourage their opponents to demand more , possibly leading to the collapse of the government , several analysts and former government insiders say .

But the popular swell wo n’t be crushed by conventional means , some analysts predict .
“ The protest movement is a new social movement , a network of relations that cannot be stopped by any security force , ” said Madani , the social scientist .
“ There ’s no way to stop this .
It will change Iran ’s political system . ”
Rafsanjani , whose Friday prayer sermon last week buoyed the opposition , subtly made such an allusion by posting on his website an excerpt from his memoirs about his imprisonment during the time of the shah .
In it , he quotes a report about him by the SAVAK , the shah ’s notorious secret police .
“ Jail has failed to calm Rafsanjani and it has even encouraged him to increase his activities , ” the report said .
“ We should think of another solution . ”

Every time I watch any version of “ Robin Hood , ” I think to myself , “ Would n’t it be great if Robin had an automatic weapon and sunglasses ? ”

Risky business
Blog is reporting that Atlas Entertainment , the producers of 300 and The Dark Knight , are putting together a futuristic take on the altruistic hero of Noddingham .
The movie will be based on a pitch by Nicolai Fuglsig who will also direct the film , and Spread writer Jason Hall will write the screenplay .
We do n’t know many plot details , but the movie will take place in a dystopian London where a band of thieves restore the hope of the populace .
I looked up Fuglsig on IMDB , and the man has n’t done … well … anything , it seems .
He ’s a commercial director and photojournalist known for the scale of his 30 - second opuses , and it ’s apparently his “ visual conception ” of the project that sold the producers on making the film .
I ’m always open to a visual director taking a step into feature - length storytelling and knocking it out of the park .
I always want a feast for the eyes that takes seemingly different styles , genres and influences and spins them into something amazing , but the whole “ remake a classic in the future ” gimmick does get old pretty quickly .
I just hope Robin still has a little feather in his pointy cap .
It ’s true ; the idea , at first , sounds super - dumb .
But who knows … it could be cool , right ?
RIGHT ?
To Catch a Criminal , It 's All About Presentation
Dallas ’s police department changed the way it lines up its suspects for identification .
Instead of the common “ six pack ” method where the victim looks at six photos at once , detectives ( blind to who the suspect is ) started showing the photos one at a time , reports the Associated Press .
This small change , according to the AP , can lower misidentification rates by 39 percent .

Building tiny systems with embedded NetBSD
By Brian Rose
Overview NetBSD is an extremely flexible operating system that is designed to be portable across various architectures .
This feature makes it attractive for embedded developers .
In this article , I will demonstrate a process for creating a very small kernel that can boot , either to a shell prompt or to a login screen .
Booting to the shell prompt allows the developer to quickly give life to a system and perform some basic interactions .
The shell itself can be a powerful management tool , combined with the right collection of programs .
Doing this requires only the kernel and two binaries .
Booting to a login prompt provides a little added security by controlling access to the machine .
This would be useful in devices where the console can be accessed by the user , and you need to control what the user has access to .
There are a few added files in this setup , and to keep things small , you will need to manually trim some of them .
But this is still a very easy process .
The minimum single user system
The first stage of embedded development usually involves getting a skeleton operating system up and running .
Assuming you are using one of NetBSD many supported platforms , this is quite easy .
I used a PC booting off of a floppy drive .
But this method can also be easily adapted to handle diskless clients that boot off a network .
At an absolute minimum , you will need the kernel , the / dev nodes for your system , and a / sbin / init file .
You can craft the init program yourself , putting all of your application code into it .
This may be a good solution when you only have one application that you would like to run .
Another option is to use the stock init program and a shell to call your application .
This is a bit easier than writing your own init program , and it also allows you to add functionality to your system by simply adding more tools from the stock system .
The shell itself is a powerful tool that can make future development much easier .
This is the method that will be illustrated here .
Building the kernel
The first thing that needs to be done is to build a kernel with a built in ramdisk .
The ramdisk will hold the kernel 's root filesystem .
A good kernel configuration to start with is the INSTALL_TINY configuration .
This kernel has all the important stuff in it , without a lot of bloat .
Make sure that it has the following lines in it .
in sys / arch / [ arch ] / conf $ cp INSTALL_TINY MYTINY $ vi MYTINY # Enable the hooks used for initializing the root memory - disk .
options MEMORY_DISK_HOOKS
options MEMORY_DISK_IS_ROOT
# force root on memory disk options MEMORY_DISK_SERVER=1 # make the ramdisk writeable #options MEMORY_DISK_ROOT_SIZE=2880 # 1.44 M , same as a floppy options MEMORY_DISK_ROOT_SIZE=8192 # 4 Meg options MEMORY_RBFLAGS=0
# do n't force single user
This configuration includes ramdisk support , has the kernel boot from the ramdisk , allows the ramdisk to be written to , sets the size a 8192 sectors ( 512 bytes each ) , and allows the kernel to boot into multiuser mode ( if the files are available ) .
You will also need to check the ramdisk driver to make sure that it supports the MEMORY_RBFLAGS option .
In my 1.6.0 system , it did not , so I needed to add the following code .
in sys/dev/md_root.c /* *
This is called during open ( i.e. mountroot ) */ ## #ifndef MEMORY_RBFLAGS
## #define MEMORY_RBFLAGS
RB_SINGLE
## #endif void md_open_hook ( int unit , struct md_conf * md ) { // ............................... added code if ( unit == 0 && ( MEMORY_RBFLAGS & RB_SINGLE ) ) { /*
The root ramdisk only works single - user .
*/ boothowto |= RB_SINGLE ; } } Once this is done , build your kernel .
$ config MYTINY $ cp ../ compile / MYTINY
$ make depend ; make Creating the crunched binaries Although you could copy the binaries from your host into your mini filesystem , a more efficient way ( sizewise ) to do this is to use a utility called crunchgen .
Many programs in the NetBSD system are linked statically .
For example , each program that uses the utility library ( libutil ) has one copy of the library linked to it .
Several programs on the system produce redundant copies of the libraries used by the programs .
Crunchgen takes the programs ' object files and merges them into one uber - program .
This crunched binary is then linked to the libraries , so only one copy of the library is needed for the whole system .
" But how do I use the different programs ? " , you ask .
The answer lies in hard links .
A hard link is like a filesystem 's alias for a program .
For example ,
If I have a program called print_my_error , I can link that to the alias myerr .
Then when I invoke myerr , the filesystem simply follows the link and runs the program print_my_error .
I can even make the two program names have slightly different behavior .
This is done by having print_my_error look at argv [ 0 ] that is passed to the main ( ) function .
If it is myerr , then I can have it do a special task .
This is how crunchgen works .
It takes all of its constituent programs and globs them together .
Then in the crunched binary 's main routine , there is logic that examines argv [ 0 ] and calls the main routine for the appropriate constituent .
To make a crunched binary , you need to know what binaries you want , where their sources are located , and what libraries they use .
Once you settle on what binaries to use , simply search the /usr / src folder for the sources .
The layout of /usr / src is straightforward .
To look for the source for / sbin / init , you would look in /usr / src / sbin / init .
To find the /usr / bin/ login , go to /usr / src/usr.bin/login .
To find out which libraries are used , open up the program 's Makefile , and look for the LDADD lines .
You should see entries like " - lutil - lcrypt " .
Sometimes , programs in the NetBSD distribution are simply hardlinks to another program .
For example , mount_mfs is an alias for newfs .
You will find no /usr / src / sbin / mount_mfs directory .
So how do you find out where the sources are for mount_mfs ?
Search through the makefiles for " LINKS = $ {BINDIR}/ newfs $ { BINDIR}/ mount_mfs " .
This shows you that the Makefile will link mount_mfs to newfs .
$ find /usr / src - name Makefile - exec grep mount_mfs {} \ ; MAN= newfs .8 mount_mfs .8 LINKS= $ {BINDIR} / newfs $ {BINDIR}/ mount_mfs MLINKS= mount_mfs .8 mfs.8
Armed with this information , you can now create your crunchgen configuration file .
This is just a list of the above information .
There are some additional features , which I will outline below .
srcdirs / usr / src / bin /usr / src / sbin progs init sh reboot ls ln sh - sh special init objpaths
/usr/src/sbin/init/obj/init.smallprog.o

The first line tells crunchgen where to look for sources .
It looks for the sources by appending the program name onto the listed directories .
The progs line is the list of programs that you want included in your binary .
The ln lines tell crunchgen about aliases that are used for some of the programs .
The shell is sometimes invoked as - sh , so the crunched binary will recognize " - sh " as " sh " .
Also , as noted above , some binaries are simply aliases for other programs .
The crunched binary needs to be on the lookout for these aliases as well .
The special line tells crunchgen that init should not be built from source , but rather just use the specified object file .
In this case , I built the init program with the SMALLPROG # define , so I do n't get the annoying " Enter pathname of shell or RETURN for sh : " prompt when the system starts in single user mode .
Instead , it will silently drop to the shell prompt .
To do this , I build my special init program this way .
$ cd /usr / src/sbin/init $ make -D SMALLPROG $ cp obj / init.o obj/init.smallprog.o
This functionality makes it easy to customize your system without too much trouble .
You could create a customized version of a standard program and use that in your embedded builds , while keeping the original for other purposes .
Finally , the last line tells crunchgen which libraries to link to .
Again , you can get this information by looking through the Makefiles for the constituent programs and noting the LDADD lines .
I 've had trouble with library ordering , so if you have errors indicating unresolved externals , and you know you included the library , try moving the " missing " library closer to the front of the list .
This worked for me .
Once your crunchgen file is crafted , build it with the following commands .
The finished executable will be named after your conf file , but without the conf extension .
$ crunchgen -m Makefile mytiny .conf $ make -f Makefile objs exe Continue to page 2 : Creating the filesystem image and the minimum multi user system .
LEWISTOWN , Pa. --
The growing ranks of unemployed Americans are turning to the traditional fallbacks -- retail , restaurants , customer service -- to ride out a rough economy .
The bad news is job openings there are growing scarce , too .
Widespread " trading down " is sparking a fight for low - wage jobs that employers once struggled to fill .
Mark Hall , 24 years old , of Alexandria , Pa. , lost his $ 12 - an - hour gig as a videographer when his employer folded and is now looking for anything to make ends meet .
" Finding a regular job , not even in my field , is very challenging , " said Mr. Hall .
" Even working for Lowe 's , I 'd settle for that , and I have a four - year degree . "
Last week , Mr. Hall joined more than 500 people at a job fair in Lewistown , a fading manufacturing hub .
Hardware and appliance retailer Lowe 's was among 30 employers recruiting , down from 46 last year , and looking for mostly part - time and seasonal employees .
Despite what objectives they may have put atop their resumes , when asked to describe the work they really wanted , the job seekers largely had the same goal : " I 'll take anything right now . "
I was wondering ...
And this is no more logical than what I thought they might think ... excellent satire .
To the guy two below me , Obama 's birth certificate has been posted online , if you really do n't believe he was born in hawaii , just like every other reliable source says , then you can look at that , too .
Glad to hear your fraternity has n't converted you beyond all hope yet .
Oh , and the watermelon / voodo man was amazing .

Newer Linux kernels have per-process I / O accounting and you can use the iotop tool to find out what ’s performing I/O , but in many cases I ’m trying to find the source of an I / O problem in an older kernel .
I found sort of a hack - ish way to do that today , while trying to figure out why a system was basically unresponsive .
I found a post on Stack Overflow that showed a way you can get per process I/O statistics from the kernel even in older kernels .
I adapted this to my needs , and wrote a little script .
Here ’s how you use it .
First , get it :
wget http://aspersa.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/iodump
Then turn on kernel messages about I/O :
echo 1 > / proc/sys/vm/block_dump
This makes the kernel start writing messages about every I /O operation that takes place .
Now all you have to do is get those messages and feed them into my script :
while true ; do sleep 1 ; dmesg - c ; done | perl iodump
Wait a little while , then cancel the script .
The results should look something like the following :
root@kanga :~# while true ; do sleep 1 ; dmesg - c ; done | perl iodump ^C# Caught SIGINT .

ST . PAUL  A lawyer for Norm Coleman , the Republican who is fighting a recount battle with Al Franken , a Democrat , for a Senate seat , faced sharply skeptical questioning on Monday from justices of the Minnesota Supreme Court in a crucial hearing on the case .
Mr. Coleman , who served one term before the November election , is challenging the rulings of a state recount board and a lower court , which declared Mr. Franken the winner of the race by hundreds of votes .
Associate Justice Christopher J. Dietzen said Mr. Coleman ’s argument that thousands of absentee ballots had been wrongfully excluded had “ no concrete evidence to back it up . ”
He said , “ In my experience , I ’ve never seen an offer of proof like this . ”
The lawyer for Mr. Franken was also questioned about whether the differences in the acceptance of ballots did not show some evidence of the deeper electoral problems that the Coleman team described .
With nearly 750 responses , and solutions written in everything from ABAP to MUMPS to XSLT , I ’d say that last week ’s Programming Praxis ( Russian Peasant Multiplication ) was certainly a success .
The comments are most certainly worth a read , if nothing else but to see things like the circuit diagram solution , something done entirely using regular expressions , and some obscure childrens ' language called Baltie 3 .
That said , I 'm excited to present this next Programming Praxis .
Titus Flavius Josephus was an important first - century historian .
Having survived the siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD , he authored several works on Jewish history , including The Jewish War and Antiquities of the Jews .
Not only have his writings given valuable insight into first century Judaism , they provide an extra-Biblical account of early Christianity .
But aside from the books , and the writings , and all of his other invaluable contributions to history , Josephus also told the story of how he had escaped death by quickly standing in the " safe spot " of what is now called Josephus ’ Circle .
As the legend goes , Josephus and forty of his fellow soldiers retreated from the siege of Yodfat to a small cave in the hills .
Surrounded by the Roman legion with no chance of escape , the soldiers saw no other choice but to commit suicide .
Like the people of Masada , they would rather die than face capture .
In order to decide who would die in which order , the soldiers stood in a circle and , starting with the top of the circle and continuing clockwise , counted to three .
The third man got the ax and the counting resumed at one .
The process continued until there was no one left .
Josephus , who did n't quite agree with the whole " we should all kill ourselves " idea , figured out the perfect way to avoid death : be the last man standing .
Of course , the above illustration has only twelve men , and Josephus somehow managed to figure out — very quickly — where to stand with forty others .
Your challenge : write the Josephus function .
There should be two inputs ( number of soldiers , soldiers to skip ) and one output ( index of the safe spot ) .
And if you 'd like , post your solution in the comments .
Got an idea for a Praxis problem ?
Please let me know !
By By Carol Forsloff Jun 21 , 2009 in Lifestyle Years ago when America was seeking integration , women 's equality and peace , folk songs told the story .
This is happening with the Iranians as well , as they put their voices to song telling the story of revolution and the innocents who died .
Music , poetry , and great patriotic speeches have often played a part in history and helped to communicate ideas to others .
Peter , Paul and Mary helped John F. Kennedy ’s programs of brotherhood as they sang , “ If I Had a Hammer , ” a song that talks of all these things .
It also became the anthem against the Vietnam War , as were the songs of people like Odetta who made people come together in sharing the pain of war in her song , “ Anthem of the Rainbow . ” “ We Shall Overcome ” was the signature song of the move to equality for African Americans , for the dream to be realized envisioned by Martin Luther King .
Now voices , guitars and poetry render the story of Iran ’s revolution , even as events unfold .
Are their stories just emotion ?
How much is fact and what is not ?
Only the details of history , seen through those who participate directly , might ever know the truth .
Years ago ,
The music is here for others to enjoy .
As the story continues to unfold in Iran , it is told in the words of a song , even as the one before by Peter , Paul and Mary sang of peace .
While people reflect on who should tell the news and how , the people on Facebook of Iranian background continue to tell their stories .
They post videos , music bits , pictures , ideas and patriotic statements for all the world to read .
Some talk of family back in Iran , while others talk of a country they want to see move towards more personal freedom .
A woman has become the martyr many are now mourning .
She , an innocent , shown as beautiful in life , and blood streaming from her face in death , has become the symbol of a cause Iranians say they hope will end up with change in the direction of peace .
Music , poetry , and great patriotic speeches have often played a part in history and helped to communicate ideas to others .
Peter , Paul and Mary helped John F. Kennedy ’s programs of brotherhood as they sang , “ If I Had a Hammer , ” a song that talks of all these things .

Now voices , guitars and poetry render the story of Iran ’s revolution , even as events unfold .
Are their stories just emotion ?
How much is fact and what is not ?
Only the details of history , seen through those who participate directly , might ever know the truth .
Years ago , an Iranian poet named Qurrat'ul - `Ayn , who took the title Tahirah put in motion the woman ’s movement when she was martyred by taking off her veil publicly in Iran .
She was a public figure , and a famous writer of the mid nineteenth century whose wonderful works continue to be talked about in literary circles , not just in Iran , but in those places where the poetry of the East is recognized as viable along with poetry of Shakespeare .
The West knows Khalil Gibran , the Christian poet –prose - essayist , but many do n’t know Tahirah , whose defiance of religious codes in expressing women ’s rights became a martyr to the cause of women .
Her life was portrayed by Sarah Bernhardt , and her life story read by Queen Marie of Rumania , the country to first put women ’s suffrage in place , long before the United States and such countries as Great Britain and France .
It is only fitting , perhaps , another woman becomes the centerpiece of a movement , a story , a testament , as is happening now on Facebook , as people share the story of Neda .
The music is here for others to enjoy .
As the story continues to unfold in Iran , it is told in the words of a song , even as the one before by Peter , Paul and Mary sang of peace .

WETUMPKA -- A 21 - year - old man , who told Montgomery police during a job interview that he possessed child pornography and had sex with an underage girl , has been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
Circuit Judge Ben Fuller sentenced Max D. Hinton of Deatsville on Monday after his conviction of second - degree rape , sodomy , enticing a child for immoral purposes and producing and possessing child pornography .
The girl testified the two had consensual sex when she was 15 and he was 17 .
But a person younger than 16 in Alabama can't legally consent to have sex , and the judge voiced outrage over the child pornography involving girls as young as 6 .
There was no explanation why Hinton mentioned the pornography in his job interview , which prompted an investigation and his arrest .
The Power of the Middle Finger
By Gina Simmons , Ph.D .
So you drive to work , start to change lanes ( without glancing back over your shoulder ) only to notice another car speeding toward you .
You correct the error and quickly steer back to your original lane .
The other driver speeds by giving you the middle finger salute .
Perhaps your heart races a bit .
You feel insulted , a little foolish and maybe angry .
Yes getting “ flipped off ” inspires hostility in the receiver of the nasty gesture .
I once watched two middle - aged adults in a flip - off contest , each trying to out shout and out gesture the other in an absurd display of immaturity .
Funny to watch , in a bad - television - sit - com kind of way .
We find evidence of the insulting middle finger gesture in writings from ancient Greece and Rome .
Fans of the Click and Clack radio program will get a kick out of the urban legend they created on the origins of the “ Pluck Yew . ”
Most cultures find the gesture insulting .
In France if you give the V - sign with the back of the hand out it translates as “ up yours . ”
The A - OK sign , with thumb and first finger making an O , offends people in Latin American countries .
And our cheerful thumbs - up gesture infuriates those from Australia , Bangladesh and most Islamic nations .
In the U.S. some have been arrested and convicted for use of the middle finger gesture although most cases were overturned on appeal .
But the real power of the middle finger salute might surprise you .
According to new research , “ extending the finger in response to an annoying behavior may increase one ’s perception of others apparent hostility , potentially justifying further aggressive responses . ” ( Chandler & Schwarz , 2008 ) .
When we use the middle finger we actually see others as more hostile .
Likewise , using the thumbs - up sign can cause us to see others as friendlier ( Note to troops : do n’t try this in Iraq or Afghanistan ) .
If you want to avoid escalating conflict , try a gesture that will make you feel better : Smile .
When you smile facial muscles send messages to your brain priming you to feel better .
Others think you look more attractive and will likely smile back .
You can start a whole upward spiral of feel - good emotions using far less energy than flipping the digitus impudicus .

Conservative leader David Cameron has apologised for using a four letter word during a radio interview about the social network website Twitter .
Mr Cameron made the remark while talking to Christian O'Connell on Absolute Radio .
He later said he regretted if the slip had caused any offence .
Broadcast regulator Ofcom said it had not received any complaints about the interview .
I am a small - government conservative / libertarian and have hated the concept of socialized medicine almost all my life .
But now , I could live with universal health coverage in the U.S. .
Here 's why .
We now have the worst of both worlds : we are paying for universal health coverage , but not getting it .
In fact , we pay more for health care in taxes than countries that provide universal coverage .
Then we pay more than that amount again in private coverage .
Additionally , what we have now in the U.S. is nowhere near a free market in health care .
Defending the status quo is not defending a free market .
And if socialized medicine is your fear , we already have it .
I 've heard no one , on either side of the political spectrum , play up the fact that the government in the U.S. already spends more on health care than almost every other country on earth .
I 'm talking government spending , not private spending .
According to the U.S. Statistical Abstract , government spending on health care in the U.S was $ 2,168 per person in 2001 ( the last year for which comparison data are available ) .
Here were the top 10 government spenders on health care in 2001 .
Norway : $ 2,550
U.S. : $ 2,168
Denmark : $ 2,098
Iceland : $ 2,025
Sweden : $ 1,832
Germany : $ 1,803
France : $ 1,599
Canada : $ 1,531
UK : $ 1,518
Belgium : $ 1,417 .
If we add in private spending as well , it 's not even close .
U.S. : $ 4,887
Switzerland : $ 3,690
Norway : $ 2,982
Denmark : $ 2,545
Iceland : $ 2,441
Germany : $ 2,407
Canada : $ 2,161
Sweden : $ 2,149
Netherlands : $ 2,134
France : $ 2,104 .
Note that the countries frequently cited as models of universal health care , Canada and the U.K. , spent less on public health than the U.S. did .
Sweden , the notorious welfare state , spent 15 % less than the U.S. .
The only country to spend more , Norway , has about the size and population of Colorado , with oil exports over 3 million barrels per day .
Even as a fraction of GDP , government in the U.S. spent a comparable amount to other nations ( 6.6 % in 2002 ) .
Canada spent just slightly more ( 6.7 % ) , and Japan and the U.K. spent less ( 6.4 % ) .
Only seven countries of the 28 countries listed spent a greater fraction of GDP on public health funding than the U.S. .
What about the private side , the " free market " side ?
There , government regulates the health industry and mandates what health insurance must cover .
While the U.S. does not have universal health coverage , it has had universal health care since 1986 .
Any person who goes to an emergency room in virtually any hospital in the country must be examined and then either treated or transferred to another hospital for treatment if the condition requires immediate care .
According to the Council for Affordable Health Insurance ( CAHI ) , " By the late 1960s , state legislatures had passed only a handful of mandated benefits ; today , CAHI has identified more than 1,900 mandated benefits and providers .
And more are on their way . "
According to CAHI , such mandates include :
Providers such as chiropractors and podiatrists , but also social workers and massage therapists ;
Benefits such as mammograms , well - child care and even drug and alcohol abuse treatment , but also acupuncture and hair prostheses ( wigs ) ; and ,
Populations such as adopted and non-custodial children .
Then there are federal mandates such as minimum hospital stays for baby deliveries , equal coverage caps for both mental and physical health benefits and reconstructive surgery after mastectomies .
According to the CATO Institute , the net cost of health regulation in the U.S. is over $ 169 billion , or an average of $ 1,500 per household .
So let 's review .
The government provides Medicare for the old , Medicaid for the poor , veterans ' hospitals for veterans , medical research funding and whatever else adds up to 6.6 % of GDP .
The federal government forces hospitals to provide emergency treatment to all comers .
State governments mandate over 1,900 types of coverage on health insurance .
Health care regulations cost the average household over $ 1,500 .
We already have socialized medicine and we are already paying for it -- twice : once in taxes and once privately .
What we are not getting is universal coverage .
But if universal care ( via emergency rooms ) is already mandated , what 's the problem ?
First , it is not the best way to get treatment .
For one thing , the condition has to be regarded as a medical emergency .
Also , the law does not relieve you of having to pay for that treatment .
In fact , medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcies in the U.S. , accounting for half of them .
So while you might not die , the U.S. health care system does give you the age - old offer of " your money or your life " .
As small - government conservatives or libertarians , we could say , " That is the individual 's choice : get the insurance or suffer the consequences . "
But if that is our policy , then why is our government paying over $ 2,100 per person per year and regulating health care at a cost of $ 1,500 per household ?
What are we getting for that money ?
If we are to be consistent libertarians , then the government should stop meddling in health care and health insurance altogether .
End Medicare .
End Medicaid .
Close down veterans ' hospitals .
Stop funding medical research .
Stop funding pharmaceutical research .
Stop mandating vaccines .
Stop mandating emergency room treatment .
Stop mandating health insurance policies .
Stop doing those things that cost us 6.6 % of our GDP when we have to kick in another 7 % or more of our own .
If our government stopped all those things , then I would a happy libertarian .
But the government will not stop them .
If politics is the art of the possible , it is not possible to end all the programs and policies cited above .
So ... if we are going to be forced to pay for something , then we ought to get it .
Either provide us the coverage , or give us our money back .
Full disclosure :
My daughter needed a heart transplant at age 15 .
We had full coverage from my employer , so cost was never a personal issue to us .
I 'm not sure what these things cost ( neither did her cardiologist ) , but I believe the surgery and resulting hospital stay would be a few hundred thousand dollars .
Testing and diagnostics beforehand could exceed $ 100,000 .
Anti-rejection drugs and follow - up testing could run to six figures yet again .
I believe a total cost of $ 500,000 is not out of the question , with annual post - surgery costs in the five figures .
This was not a matter of elective treatment .
There was nothing that could have prevented it .
In my daughter 's case it was a rare condition , with cause unknown , unforeseen and unforeseeable .
The choice was do or die .
And there was no decision on our part that could have reduced the cost in any significant way .
There are no low - cost heart transplants .
There or no alternative treatments .
A bake - sale here or poker - run there would not come near the required amount .
If you are struck with such a catastrophic health crisis , you simply must have a very good health insurance policy or a net worth into the millions to avoid both death and bankruptcy .
And health insurance is not a trivial cost .
Family coverage goes for about $ 13,000 per year or more .
The median family income in 2001 was $ 51,407 .
The choice for some families is to pay over a fourth of their after - tax income on health insurance , or risk relying on emergency room care only and then going bankrupt should a catastrophic health issue come up .
Many chose no or inadequate coverage , and many went bankrupt .
The cost problem is not one just for poorer families .
At $ 13,000 and up per year per family , and growing faster than inflation , health insurance affects everyone .
We now spend 15 % of our GDP on health .
Any Chief Executive Officer would love to have health insurance taken off his worry list .
Any state governor would love to have Medicare removed from his federal mandates .
It is impacting our productivity and competitiveness .
Let me make something else clear : universal health care coverage is not the same as single - payer health care .
Canada and the U.K. have nothing to brag about regarding either the quality of health care or the cost of it .
But those are not the only models of universal coverage .
Germany , Japan and others have universal , or near - universal , health coverage without a single - payer system .
It would be naïve of me to propose a specific plan .
But a true conservative ought to be able to work within the following guidelines .
Public health spending in the U.S. not to exceed current costs as a fraction of GDP ( currently 6.6 % of GDP ) .
Coverage of all U.S. citizens .
The definition of " coverage " could be debated , but should include catastrophic type coverage as a minimum .
Consolidation and integration of all aspects of public health programs should be on the table , including Medicare , Medicaid , veterans ' hospitals , research and all federal health programs and policies .
That is , Medicare reform should be part of the deal .
Preservation of private choices in health care .
Medical tort reform .
Reduced mandates on individuals , insurers , health providers and states regarding health care policies and practices .
I do n't see why a small - government conservative or libertarian would think the above is worse than what we have now .
I also do n't see why the above should be impossible , even politically .
Someday , some sort of universal coverage is going to happen in the U.S.
What plan would you prefer -- one consistent with the above , or one dictated by Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama or John Edwards ?
When Iraq becomes yesterday 's news , Republicans need to be ready with this issue .
It is , by anybody 's standards , an arresting image : a truly beautiful photograph of a luscious , radiant creature , all shiny eyes and silky skin .
And Greta Scacchi , who is pictured clutching the cod to her naked body , does n't look bad either .
In the months and years to come , this picture , flashed throughout the British media last week , will doubtless come to be seen as the seminal image for a particular moment , when the gruelling , knotty business of campaigning around food issues finally became sexy .
The use of celebrity skin to push an ethical issue is nothing new , of course .
In the 1990s , Peta - People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals - convinced a bunch of supermodels , including Naomi Campbell , to appear in the buff under the legend " I 'd rather go nude than wear fur " .
But fur is just so passé .
And , in any case , Campbell proved just how fickle the modern celebrity can be by soon deciding that actually , come to think of it , she would much rather wear fur than go nude , and did so on the catwalk in Milan .
Where celebrities are concerned , it seems , food is the new fur .
The current set of images featuring Scacchi alongside actress Emilia Fox , director Terry Gilliam and actor Richard E Grant , were launched to back the cinematic release of The End Of The Line , a film about the threat of overfishing - but they are only a part of it .
Tomorrow , Paul McCartney and his daughters Stella and Mary are launching a campaign to convince the public to go meat - free for one day a week .
Another movie , Food Inc , which looks at the excesses and foul side - effects of industrial food production has just been released in the US and will shortly arrive here .
Plus there is a major investigation by environmental campaigner Tracy Worcester into the dark underbelly of the global pig-rearing business which is about to be screened on digital channel More4 .
Food , and more importantly , really bad food , is hot .
What marks out these campaigns is their sophistication .
It began a couple of weeks ago with the news that Nobu , the global high - end chain of Japanese restaurants favoured by the glitterati , was still serving bluefin tuna despite it being an endangered species .
The restaurant had added a note to its menu pointing out the threat to the magnificent bluefin and inviting diners to ask for an alternative , but had refused to stop serving it , unlike big - name chefs such as Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver .
This was an old story ; it had first been reported in September .
It reared its head again because it features in The End Of The Line , the film version of a book by respected journalist Charles Clover .
Cue a letter from a familiar roster of celebrities - Jemima Goldsmith , Trudie Styler , Elle Macpherson - demanding Nobu remove it from their menus so they could eat at the restaurant with a clear conscience .
Stephen
Fry took to twittering about the issue .
" It 's astounding lunacy to serve up endangered species for sushi , " he later said .
" There 's no justification for peddling extinction , yet that is exactly what Nobu is doing in its restaurants around the world . "
For its part , Nobu has refused to change its policy ; apparently it feels it can do without the custom of Trudie and Stephen .
The producers of The End of The Line were n't finished , though .
Clover had been discussing how to publicise the film with Nicholas Rohl and Elizabeth Bennett , friends of his who run the highly regarded ethical London sushi restaurant Soseki and who have helped pioneer sustainable fishing methods .
" It was they who suggested getting celebrities on board , " Clover says .
" It was basically using celebrities to shame other celebrities and I 'm rather keen on that . "
Nicholas Rohl , who as well as co-owning Soseki is a screenwriter , has long known Scacchi .
" I contacted her and she opened up her address book , " he says .
" It took us two or three weeks to set up .
We sent out hundreds of emails and made hundreds of calls , but eventually we got the names together . "
The photographer Rankin agreed to take the shots .
Richard E Grant , pictured bare - chested with two feet of lovely , silvery , long - snouted fish , says he was motivated to get behind the campaign by his 30 years of scuba diving .
" Commercial sea - floor dredging is an abomination , " he says .
" And free celebrity endorsement is the cheapest way to publicise an issue without wasting valuable funds , which are better spent on the cause itself . "
Clover agrees .
" The fact is that if you want to put an issue into the popular mind you have to get it into Heat magazine , " he says .
Scacchi even appeared on the Today programme to argue the case .
" She 's much better suited for doing something like that than me , and catches people 's attention in the way I can't , " Clover adds .
But is n't it frustrating that , because of the way the media work , an actress who knows almost nothing about the subject is favoured over the man who literally wrote the book ?
Clover says not .
" When you start hearing what you 've been saying for five years in the mouth of someone who did n't know anything about it until five minutes before , it 's awesome .
It blows your mind . "
Food writer and television cook Hugh Fearnley - Whittingstall , who has used his shows to argue for improvements in the way cheap chickens are raised in this country , sees nothing intrinsically wrong in non-expert celebrities getting involved .
" What matters is how well they carry the message and whether they are in it for the long haul , " he explains .
Nevertheless , there are bound to be some complications with celebrity - driven campaigns , not least the way they are , by habit , completely micro-managed .
For example , Paul McCartney has sent letters to people in the media inviting them to a lunch tomorrow to launch his meat - free Monday campaign .
" Livestock continues to have a greater impact on climate change than the combined transportation sector , " he writes .
" This industry amounts to a huge 18 % of the global warming effect - a terrifying statistic ...
Help us to encourage the nation to reduce their meat intake by cutting it out just one day a week . "
It sounds like an eminently sensible idea , but no more can be said about it , because the McCartneys have agreed an exclusive interview deal with another , unnamed newspaper and so will not talk to us , or anybody else for that matter , until tomorrow .
So why are all these campaigns happening now ?
Fearnley - Whittingstall believes the current burst of interest around food is a direct response to government inaction .
" I certainly thought it was worth doing something like the chicken campaign , because government was n't doing enough , " he says .
" If you want to save fish stocks or improve conditions for livestock , do you take it to politicians or do you take it to television and cinema ?
The latter seems the better way to work right now . "
He credits Jamie Oliver with paving the way for campaigns like his , both by his efforts to improve school meals and his project to recruit jobless youngsters for his restaurants .
" His shows marked a crossover for campaigning TV from dry documentary to more mainstream popular TV , " he says .
" The crunch question is to what degree the audience are converted . "
It is a question Food Inc tries to answer .
The feature - length documentary digs deep beneath the glossy , groaning piles of fresh produce in US supermarkets to reveal the less than appetising methods used to produce them - which have been held responsible for fatal outbreaks of e. coli and salmonella .
The film is designed to be a wake - up call , its creators say .
They include Eric Schlosser , author of Fast Food Nation , and Michael Pollan , author of In Defence of Food , who narrates the movie .
" A lot of it is hard to watch , " Pollan has said , " but I think people are ready to take a good , unflinching look at how their food is produced . "
Naturally it comes with celebrity endorsement from the likes of US chef Alice Waters and lifestyle guru and sometime jailbird Martha Stewart , for no food campaign would be complete without that .
But perhaps more intriguing is the 300 - page book published alongside the film , full of essays on issues surrounding climate change , the environment and agriculture and offering advice on what consumers can do to make a difference .
" This is one of the most interesting social movements afoot right now , " Pollan told Newsweek last week .
" The politicians have n't quite recognised it yet .
Hopefully this movie will be a part of the change . "
Those who regard issues around food , which affect everything from the environment to healthcare and economic sustainability , as one of the greatest challenges currently facing the developed world will hope that he 's right .
They will also hope that no well - meaning celebrities have a Campbellesque change of heart and are caught feasting on bluefin tuna sashimi with a side order of baby panda rissoles any day soon .

Almost nine in 10 Australians are stressed and many say work is to blame , according to a national poll commissioned by Lifeline Australia .
The annual survey released today reveals 41 per cent of Australians are experiencing unhealthy levels of stress , and a whopping 87 per cent of the nation is experiencing some degree of stress .
Lifeline Australia chief executive officer Dawn O'Neil says while the overall figures are an improvement on last year 's results , work - related stress is on the rise .
" What 's really interesting about this year 's results is that slightly less people are stressed than last year , when 91 per cent indicated some level of stress , " she said .
" However , at the same time , work stress is on the up with 73 per cent of working Australians indicating they were stressed about work and 17 per cent saying they were very stressed about it . "
It found , second from work , other major stress factors include finances , thoughts about the future , health and personal relationships .
Ms O'Neil says people were slightly less concerned with their finances this year , after the Federal Government 's stimulus handouts and six interest rate drops since the previous poll .
But she says Aussies are still experiencing high levels of stress in their lives , which can can lead to a number of health issues .
" We know that small amounts of stress can sometimes help us , but each year , these results are showing us that we are no longer just feeling a little bit of stress , " she said .
" Extreme levels of stress can lead to real and lasting mental and physical health problems , like anxiety , depression , back and neck pain and heart problems . "
The poll also revealed that people who earn more tend to be more stressed , and that singles find it harder to cope than couples .
Pirate Party supporters celebrate their win in the European elections Sweden 's Pirate Party has won a seat in the European Parliament .
The group - which campaigned on reformation of copyright and patent law - secured 7.1 % of the Swedish vote .
The result puts the Pirate Party in fifth place , behind the Social Democrats , Greens , Liberals and the Moderate Party .
Rickard Falkvinge , the party leader , told the BBC the win was " gigantic " and that they were now negotiating with four different EU Parliamentary groups .
" Last night , we gained political credibility , " said Mr Falkvinge .
" People were not taken in by the establishment and we got political trust from the citizens . "
The profile of the Pirate Party and issues surrounding copyright law have dominated headlines in Sweden over the past few months .
Rallying cry
In April , a court in Sweden sentenced the four men behind The Pirate Bay , the world 's most high - profile file - sharing website , to a year in jail and ordered them to pay $ 4.5 m ( £ 3 m ) in damages .
Mr Falkvinge said it had played a significant role in getting them the vote .
Many people just do n't see illegal file - sharing as a crime , however hard the media industries try to persuade the public that it 's just as bad as shoplifting
Rory Cellan- Jones
BBC technology correspondent
Read dot.life in full " The establishment is trying to prevent control of knowledge and culture slipping from their grasp .
" When the Pirate Bay got hit , people realised the wolf was outside the front door .
" That happened one month before the ballot opened , so it had quite a rallying effect , " he said .
Parties within the European Parliament tend to join one of the big voting blocs , otherwise their MEP can become marginalised .
Mr Falkvinge said they were still considering their position .
" We 're looking at four different EU Parliament groups , " he said .
" However , we 're probably going to join either the Green block or the ALDE group . "
The biggest loser in Sweden 's election was the eurosceptic June List party , which saw its share of the vote fall by more than 10 points to 3.6 % of the vote .
The Left Party also saw its vote halved to 5.6 % .

The University of NSW psychologists also tested the effect of the shooters ' mood on the choice of people they mowed down , and these findings were surprising - those who shot the greatest number of unarmed turban - wearers were the happy people .
In our society happiness is a prized commodity .
Feeling upbeat is supposed to make us more creative , co-operative and successful - a positive state we are encouraged to strive for .
Yet the most deeply ingrained human emotions - fear , anger , disgust and sadness - are negative ones , points out Professor Joseph Forgas , of the University of NSW .
" It seems intriguing that despite our apparently never - ending quest for happiness and satisfaction , the human emotional repertoire is nevertheless heavily skewed towards negative feelings , " he says .
The reason why fear , anger and disgust evolved in the dangerous environment our ancestors faced is easiest to understand .
These emotions would have helped prepare people for flight or fight in the face of threats .
But the advantages of feeling sad are more puzzling , he says .
Many ideas have been proposed for why sadness might have evolved .
Sitting in a corner feeling glum after defeat in a fight , rather than challenging the victor , may have been a lifesaving strategy for our ancestors - a trait they could then pass on to their offspring .
It could also have signalled to other members of the group that an individual needed extra support and protection .
Sadness , and time out to think , may have helped people learn from their mistakes as well as deterred them from being reckless , suggests Professor Allan Horwitz and Jerome Wakefield in their book The Loss of Sadness : How Psychiatry Transformed Normal Sorrow into Depressive Disorder .
There have also been suggestions that sadness can affect the way people think and process the information around them , and this is where the University of NSW research fits in .
Forgas and his colleagues have shown not only that being happy can have its drawbacks , but that there are also some important upsides to being down .
Mild sadness can improve people 's recall of everyday events , make them more sceptical and better at detecting deception by others , and less likely to make snap judgments about people , based on stereotypes .
" It seems counterintuitive , but a little bit of sadness in some situations can turn out to be a good thing , " Forgas says .
The findings are particularly relevant in legal and forensic settings , where the negative or positive mood of a witness , a police officer or a judge might influence their recall or decisions .
Mild sadness tends to make people more attentive to the details of their surroundings and have a more careful , thorough thinking style .
People who are expecting to participate in a demanding personal event , such as meeting a stranger , intuitively know this and prefer to reduce their level of happiness first by reading sad articles , research shows .
Forgas and his colleagues chose a suburban newsagency in Sydney last year to test the influence of positive and negative mood on memory .
They placed 10 little items on the counter , including a pink pig , a London bus and a toy cannon , and then quizzed 73 unsuspecting customers about them as they left the shop .
On cold , wet days , when sombre music such as a requiem was playing , people could list three times as many items as on a sunny day when they heard cheery music , such as Gilbert and Sullivan tunes , the study , published in April , found .
" Accurately remembering mundane , everyday scenes is a difficult and demanding task , yet such memories can be of crucial importance in everyday life , as well as in forensic and legal practice , " Forgas says .
Feeling happy cannot only reduce the accuracy of a witness 's memory , it can also make them more susceptible to believing false information , the Sydney psychologists have found .
In another study people looked at pictures of a car - crash scene and a wedding , and later were given misleading suggestions , for example , that a firefighter had used a hose at the crash .
People in a happy mood were more likely to include this misinformation in their description when they recalled the events .
Despite being wrong , they were also more confident they were right .
Those in a gloomy state , on the other hand , were less likely to be fooled .
" In fact , negative mood almost completely eliminated this common misinformation effect , " Forgas wrote in a review of their research to be published soon .
Deciding whether someone is a liar or telling the truth is also vital in police investigations and court cases , so the team looked at the effect of mood on this human ability .
People were told to either steal a movie ticket from an empty room or leave it there .
They then had to deny taking it in a videotaped interrogation .
When other people were asked to judge the guilt of a defendant they were more likely to accept the denials as truthful if they were in a happy mood .
" Sad judges made significantly more guilty judgments and were significantly better at correctly detecting deceptive targets , " Forgas says .
And as the turban study showed , happy people also tend to rely more on pre-existing stereotypes .
The Sydney team used music , the weather , watching movies and remembering happy or sad events to induce mild positive and negative moods in the participants .
In real life , other factors than mood could be at play , for example whether people are focusing their attention closely on events .
But eventually courts may need to take the mood of a witness during an event into account , Forgas says .
In the Loss of Sadness , Horwitz , a professor of sociology at Rutgers University , and Wakefield , a professor of social work at New York University , suggest intense sadness after a major loss may also have evolved because it had some sort of survival value .
" As Darwin noted , apes and humans show similar facial expressions in situations that are associated with sadness , including elevated eyebrows , drooping eyelids , horizontal wrinkles across the forehead , and outward extension and drawing down of the lips , " they say .
Like us , apes also withdraw socially , stop playing , slouch and even adopt foetal - like postures to cope with the painful emotion .
For these behaviours to have been naturally selected , there must have been special circumstances where the benefits of intense sadness outweighed the costs , Horwitz and Wakefield say .
They liken it to acute pain after an injury , which immobilises people and prevents them doing further damage .
Not only might it have led to a defeated person withdrawing from physical battle in the past , it might help people today accept that some other life goals are unattainable , they say .
Sadness is a natural response to life crises , such as the death of a loved one , loss of a job , the end of a love affair or failure to achieve a dream .
When people are forced to re-evaluate their futures , a period of sadness might " allow the individual to emerge properly motivated by newly selected goals " .
Loading Psychiatrists caution that sadness can lead to depression and people have the right to seek treatment for symptoms that concern them .
But the two authors argue that a clear distinction needs to be made between depressive illness and a period of normal sadness after a loss .
Although drugs to treat depression can lift sadness , there may be some benefits to experiencing this emotion , they say .

Big hit over here !
I cut the oil to 1 cup and subbed the eggs with bananas ( mashed with baking powder = common sub ) because my little guy is allergic to eggs .
Which by the way he has eaten 1 muffin everyday for the past 3 days .
Nice & moist and good for breakfast .
Great recipe Frost , thanks !

Rating : 4 stars I changed this recipe a lot but it turned out really well .
I only did a half batch and cut the oil to 1/2 cup and also cut down the sugar a bit .
I substituted half of the flour for whole - wheat and used carrot instead of zucchini .
I forgot to cut the pineapple in half so added the entire can with the juice .
I found the muffins to be a bit too sweet but everyone in my house loved them !

These muffins are delicious , and when the garden produces more zucchini than you can possible use , it 's a great way to use it up .
However , very high fat .
Does anyone have a formula for cutting the oil ?
Use 1/2 cup applesauce to replace 1/4 cup oil ??
Oil actually saturated some of the paper muffin liners .
But delicious .

Not extraordinary just uncommonly dependably good .
I basically changed nothing ; just had to work with scaling down this huge recipe to better suit my needs .
So I hope the following helps others who need to do the same : scaling this down to 16 servings resulted in 12 perfectly shaped and sized muffins .
An 8 - oz . can of crushed pineapple and one small to medium sized zucchini worked well .
Hubs keeps telling me he likes neither muffins nor quick breads yet he always seems to like what I bake including these he had two AFTER supper .
Pleasantly sweet not heavily spiced with a tender light moist crumb that s cake - like in texture .
Just a nice breakfast type muffin to accompany a cup of coffee or tea .
These would have been fine as is but I did give them a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar just cuz .
For those who really have to have their muffins sweeter a simple glaze of powdered sugar and the drained pineapple juice would be awesome good !

If you are going to try this one I 'd recommend that you try a partial batch first ... it 's a huge yield and I wasted a lot of good ingredients on muffins nobody in my house will eat .
They turned out surprisingly bland and with a weak cupcake texture instead of the muffins I expected .
Even using the helpful tips from other reviews could n't save this one - disappointing .

I think next time I will try using half oil half applesauce as they were a little greasy on the paper liners .
Good taste combination though - will make these again .

These are great muffins !
I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil because that was all that I had on hand .
I also used the pineapple juice because I got distracted by my kiddos and poured the whole thing in - worked fine .
I would also be interested in how to eliminate some of the fat .
I thought I had over greased my pans but maybe not ...
These would be great for breakfast and they 're not too sweet so they would be fine with dinner or just a quick snack as well .

IMPERIAL , Calif . 
Ten minutes into arrant mayhem in this town near the Mexican border , and the gunman , a disgruntled Iraq war veteran , has already taken out two people , one slumped in his desk , the other covered in blood on the floor .
The responding officers  eight teenage boys and girls , the youngest 14  face tripwire , a thin cloud of poisonous gas and loud shots 
BAM !
BAM !
 fired from behind a flimsy wall .
They move quickly , pellet guns drawn and masks affixed .
“ United States Border Patrol !
Put your hands up ! ” screams one in a voice cracking with adolescent determination as the suspect is subdued .
It is all quite a step up from the square knot .
The Explorers program , a coeducational affiliate of the Boy Scouts of America that began 60 years ago , is training thousands of young people in skills used to confront terrorism , illegal immigration and escalating border violence  an intense ratcheting up of one of the group ’s longtime missions to prepare youths for more traditional jobs as police officers and firefighters .
( CNN ) --
The U.S. military did major damage to the site of one of the wonders of the ancient world while converting it into a base , the United Nations said in a new report .
An U.S. soldier looks over the ancient city of Babylon in Iraq in 2004 .
The site of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon was converted into Camp Alpha shortly after the United States invaded Iraq in 2003 .
The troops and their contractors caused " major damage " by digging , cutting , scraping and leveling while they were revamping the site to meet military standards , the U.N. cultural agency , UNESCO , said in a report .
" Key structures that were damaged include the Ishtar Gate and the Processional Way , " the report added .
The Ishtar Gate , an entrance to the northern part of the city , is decorated with animals that portray the symbol of the god of the city of Babylon .
" Damage to the gate includes smashed bricks on nine of the bodies of the animals adorning the gate , " according to the report .
A military official said she had not seen the U.N. report , but added that one of the reasons troops set up a base at the site was to safeguard it .
" Coalition forces first occupied the Babylon site in April 2003 during the ground campaign of Operation Iraqi Freedom with a purpose , among others , of protecting the ruins from looting after the provincial museums in Babylon and Kufa were robbed of their entire contents , " said Lt. Col.
Tamara Parker , a spokeswoman .
" U.S. forces respect historical sites in Iraq , " she added .
The United Nations lists additional damage to the site , including trenches used as firing positions and barbed wire secured to various spots .
The stakes used to set up the barbed wire damaged walls , according to the report .
Babylon , an hour 's drive south of Baghdad , dates to ancient Mesopotamia .
The city on the banks of the Euphrates River was the home of Hammurabi and later Nebuchadnezzar , who built the famous gardens for his wife .
Alexander the Great wished to make Babylon his capital , but died before realizing his plan .
During colonial times , archaeologists hauled off Babylon 's artifacts to Europe .
Some of those artifacts can be seen in a museum in Berlin , Germany .
The site was occupied by Camp Alpha from September 2003 till December 2004 , the report said .
The United States has agreed to pay $ 800,000 to help rehabilitate the Babylon site , an Iraqi official said .
" We were very disappointed when multinational forces took over these ancient sites as bases although they knew how important these sites are to Iraqis and to the entire world , " said Abdulzahra al - Talaqani , spokesman for the ministry of tourism .
Plans are under way to clean up the area in August with the help of hundreds of volunteers , according to al - Talaqani .
The U.N. report noted that U.S. troops were not solely responsible for ruining the 4,000 - year - old city .
Before their arrival , local residents had contributed to the damage , mostly through development , the report said .
" The features of the western side of the city of Babylon disappeared many years ago due to encroachment by agriculture and development on the archaeological zone , " the report said .

But do n't expect the White House to consider legalizing marijuana , drug czar Gil Kerlikowske said on Friday .
As head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy , Kerlikowske coordinates the efforts of 32 government agencies to limit illicit drug use .
He has been in office less than a month , but the Obama administration has already taken a less confrontational approach to the nation 's 35 million illegal drug users .
The FBI is no longer raiding state - approved facilities that distribute marijuana for medical purposes , and the White House has told Congress to eliminate the sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine .
Kerlikowske said he hopes to ditch the chest - thumping military rhetoric at the center of U.S. policy since President Nixon first declared a " war on drugs " 40 years ago .
" We should stop using the metaphor about the war on drugs , " said Kerlikowske , a career police officer who headed the Justice Department 's community - policing initiative under President Clinton .
" People look at it as a war on them , and frankly we 're not at war with the people of this country . "
Nevertheless , Kerlikowske also plans to disrupt trafficking across the Mexican border through a new focus on the guns and cash that travel south , as well as the drugs coming north .
U.S. drug policy has been criticized for focusing too much on fighting supplies from Colombia and other countries in South America and not enough on curbing demand at home , the world 's largest drug market .
Balancing The Approach
Kerlikowske said a more balanced approach was needed , with greater emphasis on treatment programs , especially in prisons .
" It 's clear that if they go to prison and they have a drug problem and you do n't treat it and they return ... to the same neighborhood from whence they came that you are going to have the same problem , " he said .
" Quite frankly people in neighborhoods , police officers , et cetera , are tired of recycling the problem .
Let 's try and fix it . "
Obama , who described youthful marijuana and cocaine use in his autobiography , has proposed a budget for the fiscal year starting in October that boosts funding for substance abuse programs by 4 percent to $ 3.6 billion .
Needle exchanges for intravenous drug users , now banned at the federal level , will be considered a healthcare issue , he said .
As Seattle police chief , Kerlikowske worked in a city that ran a needle - exchange program , celebrates an annual " Hempfest " that draws tens of thousands of marijuana smokers , and passed a referendum that made enforcing marijuana laws the department 's lowest priority .
Other state and local governments have loosened their marijuana laws as well .
Medical marijuana is now legal in 13 states , and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last month welcomed a public debate about proposals to legalize and tax the drug .
While that 's not going to happen on the federal level , Kerlikowske suggested the government should devote less effort to prosecuting nonviolent drug users .
" We have finite resources , " he said .
" We need to devote those finite resources toward those people who are the most dangerous to the community . "

In 1996 , Californians passed Proposition 215 so that AIDS patients could smoke a bowl and gulp down a meal and folks on chemo could avoid puking .
One great side effect is that normal folks without a chronic terminal illness now have the ability to legally purchase and smoke weed .
But the process is a little confusing ( probably because you ’re stoned ) .
First , you ’ll need to find a doctor .
All you have to do is search “ medical marijuana ” online or find the weed page in the LA Weekly .
As you might surmise by the fact that they ’re advertising amongst psychics , people seeking egg donors , and rub ‘ n ’ tug parlors , most medical marijuana doctors are n’t the most ethically strict practitioners .
According to California law , you can get a prescription for medical marijuana if you have a chronic condition that impairs your ability to function .
In my case , I am severely depressed , probably as a result of being born Jewish , poor and hung like a toddler .
I told my weed doctor about my condition and my past medication , and he said “ So , you would like to get weed to improve your ability to function ? ” ( apparently this is the legal equivalent of “ Oh my God , you ’re tearing me apart ” while having sex ) .
Other conditions that could get you legal weed include anxiety , TMJ , tennis elbow , smoker ’s cough , the swine flu , Irritable Bowel Syndrome , and being Jamaican .
In order to back up your claims , your doctor will ask you to provide some sort of proof of your condition , such as medical records , prescription bottles or a copy of an invoice for therapist visits .
In my case , I did n’t bring anything with me , and my doctor did a “ Hey , please make sure you fax me proof , wink - wink ” kind of speech .
After paying $ 150 , I got my card .
Once you have your card , you ’ll need to find a marijuana dispensary .
Again , online or the LA Weekly helps .
Your dispensary will check your paperwork and ID and verify your eligibility .
Then the fun begins .
You can check out all the varieties of weed , the hash , the kief , the various edibles like cookies and brownies .
And the competition for your business is so fierce , all the dispensaries offer freebies and discounts .
I got $ 20 off a quarter and two free muffins ( which tasted like weedy , minty sponges ) .
So with an LA Weekly , $ 150 , and a creative excuse , you too could be on your way to sitting on your couch , playing Xbox 360 , and smoking discounted , legal weed .
Our founding fathers would be proud ( because they totally smoked weed , man ! ) .
On Friday , Mozilla announced the availability of the first Firefox 3.6 alpha release .
It introduces several new features and brings a number of performance improvements to the popular open source Web browser .
Firefox 3.5 was officially launched in June , roughly one year after the release of Firefox 3.0 .
Version 3.6 , which is codenamed Namoroka , is tentatively expected to arrive in 2010 .
Performance and customization improvements are a major part of the roadmap for Namoroka .
Mozilla is also exploring some new user interface concepts that could be used to augment the tabbed browsing model .
Although Namoroka is still at a very early stage of development , the 3.6 alpha includes very noticeable performance enhancements .
In Firefox 3.5 , Mozilla introduced a new high - performance JavaScript engine called TraceMonkey that uses just - in - time compilation and an optimization technique called tracing to deliver faster JavaScript execution .
Improvements to this engine have helped to further accelerate JavaScript performance in the 3.6 alpha release .
TraceMonkey developer Andreas Gal , one of the researchers behind tracing optimization , says that JavaScript performance in 3.6 is roughly 15 percent faster than in 3.5 .
That 's already a meaningful improvement , and it's possible that we could see TraceMonkey get even faster as the development cycle progresses .
It 's still not quite enough to catch up with Google 's Chrome Web browser , however , which also got a touch of extra turbo in its latest beta release .
Firefox 3.6 offers several new CSS features .
Among these , the most intriguing is support for CSS gradients , which allow Web developers to paint the background of an element with a color gradient with multiple color stops .
This feature was originally invented last year by Apple and implemented in WebKit .
It is based partly on the gradient features described in the HTML 5 Canvas specification .
We have seen it appear in several different WebKit variants , including the rendering engine in Chrome .
Mozilla 's move to add it to Firefox 's Gecko rendering engine marks the first time that it has been used in a renderer other than WebKit .
Mozilla 's syntax for CSS gradients , however , is slightly different from that of WebKit .
Unlike Safari and Chrome , which specify the type of gradient as the first parameter , Mozilla has elected to move the gradient type into the CSS property name ( linear - gradient ( ... ) rather than gradient ( linear , ... ) ) , meaning that it has a separate property for each kind of gradient .
This arguably simplifies the parsing of the subsequent parameters .
The following example is adapted from a simple test that I made for comparing CSS support in WebKit variants :
. heading { background : # 729 FCF - moz - linear - gradient ( left top , left bottom , from ( rgba ( 255 , 255 , 255 , 0.45 ) ) , to ( rgba( 255 , 255 , 255 , 0.50 ) ) , color - stop ( 0.4 , rgba( 255 , 255 , 255 , 0.25 ) ) , color - stop ( 0.6 , rgba( 255 , 255 , 255 , 0.0 ) ) , color - stop ( 0.9 , rgba( 255 , 255 , 255 , 0.10 ) ) ) ; color : white ; height : 40 px ; }
Mozilla is also working on a lot of major architectural improvements for Firefox 3.6 .
The earliest of this work has started to land , including a new compositing engine and a rework of how focus is handled .
The compositing engine is said to improve scrolling performance .
A significantly more ambitious architectural change that is being explored is support for multiprocess browsing .
Mozilla has already revealed details about its plans in that area , but it 's not clear yet if this approach will be ready in time for Namoroka .
Firefox has an enormous amount of momentum and is moving forward at a very rapid pace .
Mozilla recently celebrated the billionth download of its popular browser .
Competitors are gaining ground , however , and Firefox is having to match their strengths in order to retain its place at the front of the pack .
It 's worth noting that the JavaScript performance gains and new CSS features introduced in this release are about attempting to achieve parity with WebKit , rather than raising the bar .
This reflects the increasingly healthy competition that is redefining the browser space .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Sarah Palin represents the worst of America , in all its attractive yet self - destructive glory .
She is ignorant – and does not care to educate herself .
She is confident , without much reason to be .
She is unreflective , and proud of it .
Like a wahhabi among Muslims , she does not consider most of her fellow - countrymen “ pro-American . ”
Like a reincarnation of Richard Nixon ( or a classic Marxist ) she seeks power through class warfare .
Like a second coming of George Wallace , she waves the flag in defense of prejudice and hatred and incites crowds to near - violence .
And yesterday , Sarah Palin announced she would resign her office .
She sounded the same themes she had in her national debut – those themes that I hopefully deride as yesterday ’s but fear may be themes again tomorrow .
This is no surprise , as as in her first speech on the national stage she accused those examining her record – the media – of being part of the “ Washington elite ” and looking down on her – and ridiculed her opponent as a crusader for terrorist rights .
And when a comedian made a joke that she saw she could exploit , she talked used this as her excuse to rail against the “ Hollywood / NY ” elites who did not understand real American values .
Again and again she invoked the same , old tired class warfare images .
The question is , why does this woman – who has a solid shot at the 2012 Republican Presidential nomination – decide to give up her governorship ?
As everyone acknowledges – and especially given her tawdry history of small - time lies , personal vendettas , and misuse of public power and funds – she may be trying to sidestep some brewing scandal the press has n’t gotten wind of .
Even Will Kristol , the foremost Palin defender in the country acknowledges this .
But if this does not turn out to be the case , there are still significant reasons why she might be stepping aside – in a calculated move to better position herself for 2012 .
As Kristol later suggested , she might be – in this instance , “ crazy like a fox . ”
As Marc Ambinder points out , as Governor of Alaska , she is a sitting duck and marginalized from the centers of power she so desperately wants to be part of .
The heady presidential campaign clearly gave her a taste of something she now craves – the attention and adulation of adoring crowds .
She seems to believe she is destined for greater things than merely governing a state with a population the size of a medium - sized city .
But as long as she is governor , she is generating a record that can be picked apart and attacked – and she is unable to effectively reach out to the Iowa and New Hampshire Republican primary voters she will need .
At the same time , her national ambitions – and her role in the McCain campaign – have hurt her in Alaska – as her popularity has dipped and legislators have begun to feel as if she is looking beyond Juneau .
As only 51 % of voters in Alaska said they would reelect her as governor , she would likely face a tough campaign .
At the same time , Palin is facing the same problem as many other governors : the states are facing a crunch , and without help from the federal government are going to have to make drastic cuts in services or raise taxes .
In Alaska , the downturn – and the drop in the price of oil – has lead to a deficit of nearly $ 3 billion over the next two years , with little chance of recovery until the price of oil goes back up .
By resigning in the middle of this year , she gets to avoid the painful cuts in government services or raises in tax rates that will be needed to keep the state functioning .
Governing during this deficit explosion would make it harder ( though for Palin , far from impossible ) to deride Barack Obama ’s deficit spending ( most of which Obama himself inherited from another former Governor who liked to cut taxes and increase spending ) .
Given these two motivations , one can see why Will Kristol suggests this move might be crazy like a fox .
But remember this : by giving up in the middle of her term , Sarah Palin has forever disqualified herself from the presidency .
I ’m sure she does n’t think so – and I ’m sure her most ardent supporters do not think so either .
She may make a solid run for the Republican nomination – and , she may get it .
But every reason she gave for resigning would be doubly true if she were to win the presidency .
Her family would be under greater scrutiny , and the butt of more jokes .
Lawsuits against her would eat into her time – as they did Bill Clinton ’s .
If the relatively low - level of scrutiny and pestering lawsuits she is subject to now have intimidated her from staying in office , imagine what pressures she would face sitting in the Oval Office .
The American people will remember that when the going got tough in Alaska , she went .
And she did n’t accept any blame – instead , she played the same game she has played as long as she has been in the national spotlight .
She blamed the media elite and everyone else who is n’t “ proud to be American ” and who instead “ deride[s ] our ideals . ”
America can forgive her the class warfare .
They can forgive her inciting her supporters to near - violent outrage .
They can forgive her betrayal of the man who brought her out of obscurity .
They can forgive her for using her children as political props .
They can forgive her for all of her small lies .
They can forgive her her ignorance .
And they can love her for her saucy winks , her baseless confidence , and her faux - religiousity .
What the American people cannot forgive and will not look past is a quitter – and the message from yesterday ’s events – the message that comes through loud and clear above her strident attempts to distract – is that Sarah Palin is a quitter .
Never again will the Barracuda of Wasilla attain the glory that was hers for one glorious September night – as she strode onto the stage , confident beyond reason and shining with the light of Destiny .
This I hope , and I pray .
For our nation ’s sake , most of all .
But for the moment , what can we do but celebrate that our modern - day George Wallace has stepped down , and the spectre of a Palin presidency is just a bit further away .

Bright children from middle and working class families are missing out on professional jobs because of continuing " elitism " , a government - commissioned report warns today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The report , by a cross-party panel chaired by former Cabinet minister Alan Milburn , calls for urgent action to break " closed shop mentality " which , it says , still characterises the professions in Britain .
The panel found more than half of all the top professional jobs were still taken by candidates who were independently schooled , even though they accounted for just 7 per cent of all schoolchildren .
Failure to break this pattern will , it says , mean that the opportunity of achieving the most significant wave of social mobility since the Second World War will be lost .
The panel was originally set up by Gordon Brown to examine the barriers to entering the professions .
In more than 80 recommendations , it will argue that enhancing social mobility must be the top social priority for any government , now and in the future .
The report will show that while up to nine out of 10 new jobs in the future will be in the professions , they are currently drawn from a relatively narrow section of society .
It will say that the typical professional of tomorrow will be growing up in a family that is better off than seven out of 10 families in Britain , while occupations such as the law and finance are still dominated by people from independent schools .
Currently 75 per cent of judges and 45 per cent of senior civil servants were independently educated .
Among the advantages for children going to private schools or the best state schools are the chance to develop through extra curricular activities and mentoring schemes , which help to mark out candidates when it comes to applying for jobs in the professions .

Later on , when it comes to getting work placements or internships , it can often depend on " who you know " , putting children with no connections to the professions at a disadvantage .
Among the measures it recommends for tackling the problem , is a new army of young professionals and university students to mentor young people and a national " Yes you can " campaign , headed by inspirational role models , to raise aspirations .
It also calls for a radical overhaul of work experience programmes , and a new focus on the teaching of " soft skills " in schools .
The panel wants armed services cadet forces - currently largely the preserve of independent schools - to be established as the norm in state schools - teaching team - building and confidence and opening up the armed forces at a professional level for all children .
It also recommends that the Government should examine proposals to give parents a new right of redress , when a school consistently fails them , to allow their child to go to a school of their choice and give schools incentives to take them on .
Kim Wong refuses to buy the new Xbox 360 game Shadow Complex .
Revolted by the political views of a novelist associated with the game , the 27 - year old gamer 's conscience holds him back .
But there 's another side to the story .
Advertisement
For the past week or so , some gamers and game reporters online have begun discussing the newly - released Xbox Live Arcade side - scrolling adventure game Shadow Complex in ways not intended by its creators .
Stepping away from a discussion about how the game is one of the biggest downloadable titles ever made , a collaboration between a leading studio and some bright young talents , a love letter to the classic , but neglected , designs of Nintendo 's early Metroid adventures , some gamers have instead debated whether buying Shadow Complex is an intolerable act of support for someone they view as an opponent of gay rights , novelist Orson Scott Card .
The debate around the game has provoked a rare discussion about whether the political , moral or religious views of people involved with making or promoting a video game — views so rarely discussed publicly by video game creators — should or would affect whether a person buys a particular title .
Fun factor 's got nothing to do with it .
Or does it ?
Advertisement
Kim Wong has discovered that moral views of creators do matter to him .
He cannot countenance the involvement with Shadow Complex of Card .
The acclaimed science fiction author has written that practicing homosexuals should not be treated as equal citizens and has described gay rights as a " collective delusion . "
He has supported legal movements to block laws that would allow gay people to marry .
In a phone interview this week , Wong told me : " I decided I could not in good conscience support a product of a person whose views I find abhorrent and knowingly give him money .
In my everyday life I probably give enough money unknowingly to bigots or at least to people whose personal and political views I find distasteful . "
Card was not the main creator of Shadow Complex .
He did not conceive it nor code it .
His name has been used in the game 's promotion by its developers and publisher , Microsoft , to trade both on the renown for his classic novel , Ender 's Game , as well his 2006 book , Empire , which was based on the same fiction as Shadow Complex : a Right - Wing - vs. - Left - Wing future American civil war crafted by members of the new game 's development studio , Chair Entertainment .

Card , who has expressed his views about homosexuality in more detail than can be summarized in a sound bite , has , for years , bristled at accusations that he is a homophobe , establishing his views about homosexuality in the context of his faith as member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , a faith , like those of Catholics , that deems the practice of homosexuality as a sin .
( Card did not return Kotaku 's requests to comment for this article . )
While Card 's writings and efforts to ban gay marriage have sparked outcry from Wong and other gamers who say they wo n't buy Shadow Complex , those involved in the creation of the game had not commented publicly about this debate until now .
The Creators Speak
Advertisement
" Card 's political beliefs sure did n't come up during the game 's development , " Mark Rein , vice president of Gears of War development studio Epic Games , which owns Chair Entertainment , told Kotaku .
He was speaking on behalf of Epic and Chair .
" Even if they had , we do n't discriminate when hiring or choosing partners based on people 's personal beliefs .
Heck , Gears of War was made by Democrats , Republicans , Libertarians , and even a few Canadians like me .
It takes all kinds to make great creative games . "

Game developers do n't often flash their party affiliation or state their positions on ethical debates .
Reporters like me rarely ask .
We wind up knowing more about the moral beliefs of Hollywood stars and politicians than we do whether the person who created the year 's biggest game thinks abortion should be illegal or that the Israelis or Palestinians are right or wrong .
Will Wright 's contributions to the Republican Party and Alex Rigopulos ' to the Democrats become public in legally required campaign filings but neither the promotion of Spore nor Rock Band involves the discussion of America 's Right and Left .
If there is a block of Conservatives who are planning on not buying Beatles : Rock Band , I am unaware of them .
Even marginally more public statements about social issues do n't seem to stir much gamer reaction .
Two weeks ago at QuakeCon , programming legend John Carmack mocked the green movement and described the eco-friendly selling point of the Tesla electric car as a " sham , " to little reaction and certainly no major debate about whether the next Doom he creates should be bought by those who consider themselves eco-conscious .
Advertisement
Yet the opinions of Card , expressed so vividly and available so readily online have generated the kind of debate that appears to be costing the developers of Shadow Complex at least a few consumers .
Advertisement
Card has likened homosexuality to other predispositions to sin , like those of a hormonally active teenage boy .
He told Salon.com in 2000 that he found charges that he was homophobic to be " ugly . "
But his critics have had an easy time making that charge , given the frankness of Card 's writings .
" The Church has plenty of room for individuals who are struggling to overcome their temptation toward homosexual behavior , " he wrote in a 1990 essay called The Hypocrites of Homosexuality that argued that practicing gay people should not have equal rights .
" But for the protection of the Saints and the good of the persons themselves , the Church has no room for those who , instead of repenting of homosexuality , wish it to become an acceptable behavior in the society of the Saints .
They are wolves in sheep 's clothing , preaching meekness while attempting to devour the flock . "
Advertisement
No one from the Shadow Complex development team has said whether they agree with Card .
A few years ago , the author was referred to me by Chair 's co-founder Donald Mustard as a friend .
But there is an argument to be made that it is irrelevant whether Chair 's team agrees or disagrees with Card or is friends with him or not .
That argument was made by Peter David , the comic book writer and novelist hired by Chair to script Shadow Complex , and a man who may not have much more patience for Orson Scott Card than Kim Wong .
Advertisement
" My disagreements with Orson 's politics are hardly limited to his views on gay marriage , " David told Kotaku in an e-mailed statement .
" We are at opposite ends of the political spectrum on pretty much everything .
Why , then , did I agree to work on the game ?
Because among my most cherished beliefs is that , while I disagree with everything you have to say , I will defend to the death your right to say it .
[ Comic book creator ]
John Byrne has said no end of vicious things directed at me personally ; I still buy his comic books because I like his work .
I never , EVER , allow someone 's stated opinions to impact on whether I support his work so long as those opinions do n't transform the work itself into something that I have no desire to support .
" Shadow Complex was n't a huge paying gig for me but I took it because I thought the developers were a nice couple of kids , and I found the story of a reluctant warrior being forced to find something worth fighting for to be a compelling narrative .
By the same token , all the money in the world could not have gotten me to be involved if the story was something I personally found repellent . "
Advertisement
To Boycott Or Not ?
There is no sign that the debate about Card is significantly hurting Shadow Complex 's sales even if the game and its developers ' reputation are taking some abuse on gaming Internet forums .
Shadow Complex has scored high marks from reviewers .
" It 's up to the individual to make their own purchasing decisions , " Wong told me , saying he does not advocate a boycott of the game .
He said it 's been easy to resist buying Shadow Complex , both because of the many other games available for purchase and because of how provocative he finds Card 's views .
" With good conscience I can't support that , and I would like other gamers to think about this issue as well . "
Advertisement
I asked Wong if he had ever taken a similar stance .
He said he has urged friends to avoid supporting advertisers who buy time on the shows of other public figures he disagrees with , like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck .
But he admits that it would be impossible to avoid supporting every product that was partially made by or connected to people whose views he dislikes .
That 's no reason to not take a stand here , he said : " With the limited voice that I have in the public discourse , I am choosing to voice my disapproval by not purchasing the game , as are the other friends of mine who have made the same decision . "
The debate here echoes so many debates about supporting the work of socially controversial filmmakers and authors .
It 's doubtful whether there will be agreement about whether such debates are a sign of the gaming industry maturing or taking a sour turn .
Will an expression of political views become a prerequisite for game developers in the future ?
Will gamers desire an explanation as to where the creators stand ?
Developers , writers and anyone else associated with a game might find themselves losing a possible fan — and maybe gaining another — based on the social views they express .
It happens in most other forms of entertainment , whether relevant or not .
Advertisement
Aside from all of those options , there is another way this could be handled .
Shadow Complex writer Peter David offered it : " If anyone wants to boycott the game and thus damage me or Chair while doing nothing to change Orson 's opinions , that 's naturally their right .
Or ... They can display the sort of tolerance for someone who is different from them that they feel is lacking in Orson and thus prove they 're better .
Your choice . "

I see Ruby people bashing Python a lot on Stackoverflow .
It ’s a bit sad , Python and Ruby are usually bestest friends forevah .
So I started a question on Stackoverflow , not about which of them is best , but just what the differences are , objectively .
It was more difficult to make that objective than I thought , but I sure learnt a lot .
And , as suspected , many of the differences are just semantic , like Ruby using @attribute and Python using self .
attribute .
And of course it ’s objectively it ’s impossible to say what language is better , which we of course knew from the beginning .
That ’s no surprise .
The surprise is that there are so few differences that can be cast as better or worse at all .
Even such things that sound like an objective good or bad , such as a language having a certain feature , turns out to mostly be a matter of taste .
I could just find these differences that in any way can be called objectively better :
1. Ruby has a reference to the class in the class body
This means that code like this is possible :
class MyClass initialize_magick ( )
end
While in Python , you would have to write :
class MyClass : pass initialize_macgick ( MyClass )
As you see the practical difference is very small .
But Rubys variant is cleaner , as the magic stuff is done in the class definition , so you see that it ’s being done when you look at the class .
And indeed , the Zope component architecture uses some heavy magic with metaclasses to make the same thing happen in Python :
def MyClass : implements ( IMyInterface )
So it ’s possible ( In Python 2 ) by some clever tricks to get the same effect .
In Python 3 it is n’t because the metaclass syntax is different , so in Python 3 you instead need to use class decorators .
And what you think is cleaner of
@magickly_initialized def MyClass : pass
or
def MyClass initialize_magick ( )
end
is again a matter of taste .
So , a small plus for Ruby there , without a doubt .
But it ’s really not a big deal , because calling the initialize method after the class or as a decorator is really not a major drawback .
2. Ruby has continuations
Continuations are heavy magic .
And Ruby has them , and Python has not .
You can “ fake ” them , and it seems that many of the usecases can instead be done with passing variables into .next ( ) which you can do in Python 3.1 .
The use of continuations seem rather limited , and hard to understand , but it ’s there in Ruby , and not in Python .
So another plus for Ruby .
3. Python has generators
You can fake them in Ruby by using blocks , or use continuations .
So no big deal again , but a small plus for Python anyway , as Pythons generators are both easy and clean .
4. Python has multiple inheritance
Some people claim multiple inheritance is evil .
But having it means that if you think it ’s evil , you can simply not use it .
I have used it a lot , never found it a problem , but I think adaptation is a better pattern .
Still , it ’s clearly a plus for Python .
5. Python has docstrings
Docstrings makes it possible to attach documentation directly to the classes and methods .
That ’sa nice documentation plus , and makes things like the Python interpreters help ( ) function really useful .
Another plus .
Aaaaannnd , that ’s it !
These five small differences are the only things that I can see are objective improvements over the other language .
And as you see , none of them are really major .
It ’s just small things that are more convenient or not .
So , am I gonna switch to Ruby now , when it ’s almost just as good ?
Nope .
Because there are lot of other differences , that are differences in attitudes and semantics .
And there I really like Python better .
Here are three major features of Ruby that in my opinion either are misfeatures or just not of value :
1. Ruby has built - in regexp and line input looping
This is inspired by Perl , and means you can easily make a script that looks through a text file and munges each line separately and prints out another text line .
This is extremely useful ’in many cases .
Also Ruby is said to be better to make glue .
scripts , so it can more readily be used for a shell script replacement than Python .
Plus for Ruby ?
Well , no , not in my book .
I do these things sometimes , mostly in awk .
If they get more complex than that , I prefer to use the clarity of Python than the obscure machinations of regexps .
And having a small open ( filename ) .readlines ( ) is n’t that much trouble .
So this is a feature I think only adds clutterm and I ’m happy Python does n’t have it .
Wow !
That turned out to be a subjective issue !
That surprised me .
2. Ruby protects class attributes etc
Ruby treats variable names that has the first letter in capitals like a constant , so you ca n’t modify it .
You also ca n’t access attributes of objects from outside the class .
Python does n’t protect your code from other programmers .
If they want to shoot themselves in the foot they are allowed to .
I like that .
I remember when using Delphi , and I needed to subclass an object in the standard library , but some attributes or methods were protected , so I could n’t .
I ended up having to duplicate almost the whole ( rather big ) component class in my subclass , just because the developer of the base class had n’t forseen my type or requirement .
So these sorts of protections are generally just a problem .
OK , it ’s less of a problem in Ruby , as it allows you to monkey - patch the class but this still is a big plus for Python in my book .
I ’m sure Ruby people do not agree .
It ’s subjective again .
3. Ruby has blocks
But some differences are more differences in attitudes than anything else .
And sometimes these different attitudes seem to in the end be the same attitude but from different angles .
Ruby has for example the concept of blocks .
Blocks seems to pretty much be Rubys name for closures , and it ’s an abstract concept basically meaning a piece of code that gets variables from somewhere else and can have local variables that does n’t pollute the surrounding name space .
Rubys blocks are widely hailed ( by Ruby people ) as something fantastic compared to Python .
But it turned out to be very difficult to find actual cases where Ruby really did something in a cleaner way than Python thanks to blocks .
Well , it turns out that Python also has blocks .
But they are called “ functions ” .
What ’s the difference ?
Functions need a name , while blocks do n’t .
At this point a Python programmer says “ Aha , so blocks are lambdas ! ”
Yes , except that blocks can be multiline code and do anything , while Pythons lambdas are restricted to being expressions .
OK , so plus one to Ruby then ?
Well , no .
Because what use is a block if you do n’t attach it to a variable name so you can call it ?
In Ruby you create blocks and use them directly like this :
amethod do |variable| print variable end
This is principally equivalent to Pythons
def theblock ( variable ) print variable amethod ( theblock )
Which of course is doable in Ruby as well .
Which way is neater ?
Matter of taste again .
And it becomes even harder to decide when considering that Ruby has a special statement to call the block with parameters .
It ’s called yield .
Yield exists in Python as well , but there it ’s used for generators .
But the we get this code examples :
def themethod for a in [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] yield a end end themethod do |b| puts b end
Which is almost suspisciously similar to
def themethod ( ) : for a in [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] : yield a for b in themethod ( ) : print b
So in the end , this much touted principle of block seem to very rarely actually lead to any significantly different code than in Python .
So here are widely discussed differences in principals that in the end…end up as the same thing ( almost ) !
4. Python has list comprehensions
It ’s worth mentioning here that Python has some big features that Ruby does n’t , like for example list comprehensions .
[ foo ( x ) for x in alist if bar ( x ) != ' frotz ' ]
But although I use them all the time because they are practical I do n’t know what I think about them .
Well , it ’s shorter than :
foo = [ ] for x in alist : if bar(x ) != ' frotz ' : foo.append (x )
But is it really neater and more readable ?
I ’m not sure .
It becomes a matter of taste again .
I did not like list comprehensions when they first arrived in Python , but of course now I ’ve gotten used to them .
So that is not a good argument for Python .
It ’s subjective again .
5. Python has decorators
Decorators are prettier than the other ways of doing the same in Python , for example the above initialize_magick ( class ) .
But again it can be argued that the @decorator syntax just makes Python ugly , and that you do n’t need them as much in Ruby .
Again , matters of taste .
So why Python ?
So , in the end , why do I , subjectively prefer Python over Ruby in almost everything ?
Because of Pythons clarity and simplicity , and it ’s attitudes and principles .
In Ruby , you have open classes , so you can extend any class .
In Python , you can monkey patch in extensions into any class .
The difference ?
That in Python it ’s an ugly attitude that is frowned upon .
In Ruby , many people tutorials and examples of blocks extend the Array class , like brutally monkey patching the standard types is a normal thing to do .
( A hint guys :
That does NOT help in explaining blocks , it ’s just confusing ) .
In Ruby , there are no functions , but there are methods , blocks and lambdas .
All of them seem to have subtle differences , and sometimes you need to not just call them , but use .call ( ) .
In Python , there are only functions .
Lambdas are functions whose __name__ is < lambda > .
Methods are functions that are wrapped to you do n’t have to pass self .
Simple and clear .
Python is more explicit .
In Ruby you can skip the ( ) when calling a method .
Rubyists like that because it makes calls look like statements they say .
Pythonists like me think it ’s a bad idea to make a call look like a statement .
If it ’s a call it should bloody well look like one .
And Pythons packages and modules are just so much better for namespaces than Rubys modules .
Again , subjectively .
And you can choose if you want to import * in Python or not .
In Ruby that ’s all you can do
And all of these things , the things that makes me go “ Eww … ” about Ruby and “ Yeah ! ” about Python turns out not to be features , but just subjective options of the different languages semantics and attitudes .
It is truly so that none of the Languages are better than the other .
Except , of course , that Ruby sucks . 😉
Chansa Kabwela edits Zambia 's best - selling newspaper
An editor at Zambia 's biggest - selling newspaper has been charged with distributing obscene materials relating to a health sector crisis .
The Post sent harrowing images of a woman giving birth in the street to government ministers to highlight the effects of a health sector strike .
In May and June , Zambia 's hospitals and clinics ground to a halt as doctors and nurses went on strike over pay .
An official government spokesman declined to comment on the case .
The trial of the Lusaka - based Post 's female news editor , Chansa Kabwela , is due to start at the beginning of August .
' Too gruesome to publish ' Pictures of the woman giving birth , to a child which subsequently died , were taken by a family member and handed to the Post .
Unfortunately the president and his ministers and some of his supporters have chosen to ignore the plight of that woman
Sam Mujuda
Post deputy editor - in - chief Nine months pregnant and unable to afford private care , she had gone into labour .
But with her baby emerging feet first , she was turned away from two clinics and then Zambia 's largest hospital .
Sam Mujuda , the Post 's deputy editor - in - chief , described the pictures as " particularly graphic " .
" I found these pictures quite gruesome and our decision was that we could not publish these pictures , " he said .
" Here was a woman giving birth , it was a breach birth , legs first dangling between the legs of this woman . "
The editors ' decision to post copies of the pictures to government ministers to focus their minds on the consequences of the strike did not go down well , the BBC's Jonah Fisher reports from Zambia .
At a press conference , Zambian President Rupiah Banda condemned the Post for circulating what he called pornography .
Then , this week , the paper 's Ms Kabwela was charged with distributing obscene materials .
" What I see in those pictures is suffering , " Sam Mujuda added .
" Suffering of a helpless woman who needed assistance .
Unfortunately the president and his ministers and some of his supporters have chosen to ignore the plight of that woman . "

You know , the Religious Right might not like Florida Gov. Charlie Crist very much , but God sure seems to , which is why he ’s prevented his state from being hit by a hurricane during his time in office :
Could it be divine intervention that ’s kept Florida safe from hurricanes since Gov. Charlie Crist took office ?
Crist said he is n’t trying to take credit , but he told a group of real estate agents Friday that he ’s had prayer notes placed in the Western Wall in Jerusalem each year and no major storms have hit Florida .
Crist noted that just before his election in 2006 , Florida had been affected by a total of eight hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 .
“ Do you know the last time it was we had a hurricane in Florida ?
It ’s been awhile .
In 2007 , I took my first trade mission .
Do you know where I went ? ” said Crist , a Methodist , referring to a trip to Israel .
He then told of going to the Western Wall and inserting a note with a prayer .
He said it read , “ Dear God , please protect our Florida from storms and other difficulties .
Charlie . ”
“ Time goes on – May , June , July , August , September , October , November , December – no hurricanes , ” Crist said .
“ Thank God . ”
Last year , Sen . Nan Rich was traveling to Israel and Crist asked her to put a note in the Western Wall , a holy site in Judaism and a place where written prayers are traditionally placed .
“ It was the same note , by the way , the same prayer , ” Crist said .
This year a friend was going to Israel and he gave him a prayer to put in the Western Wall .
“ You can do it on the Internet now , but I ’d rather have it physically in there , ” Crist joked .
The note was placed in the wall in May .
“ May , June , July , August – we ’re getting closer , ” Crist said .
“ Knock on wood .
I would ask you all to say a prayer . ”
Afterward , he said he ’s not taking credit for the lack of storms in this hurricane - prone state .
“ I give that to God , ” Crist said .
“ But it ’s nice . ”
With the Needle That Sings in Her Heart
Moving to avoid a rift with Moscow , Barack Obama has " all but abandoned " plans to locate parts of a controversial US missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic , a leading Polish newspaper claimed yesterday .
The Warsaw daily Gazeta Wyborcza said that the Pentagon has been asked to explore switching planned interceptor rocket sites from the two east European states to Israel , Turkey , the Balkans or to mobile launchers on warships .
Asked about the claim , a Pentagon spokesman last night said the missile shield plans were still being reviewed .
" No final decisions have been made regarding missile defence in Europe " he said .
The threats and rhetoric surrounding the missile defence plans , a key plank of defence policy under the Bush administration , contributed as much as any other issue to the souring of relations between Moscow and Washington in recent years .

In 2007 , then - President Vladimir Putin compared the plans to the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s .
He warned that if the plan went ahead , Russia would be forced to point nuclear missiles at European cities .
Since then , the Kremlin has brushed aside repeated US claims that the shield would be aimed not at Russia but at Iran , North Korea and other rogue states .
Moscow has insisted that the shield 's deployment would compromise Russian strategic security .
With the Obama administration 's promise to " reset " relations with Russia , came the President 's decision to launch a strategic review of the defence shield .
Controversy erupted earlier this year when rumours surfaced of a secret letter written by Mr Obama to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev allegedly hinting that the White House would back away if Russia offered help on reining in Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
Publicly , both sides have insisted that there is no horse - trading to be done over the issue .
At a summit in Moscow last month Mr Obama promised only to take Russia 's concerns into account .
This was nevertheless a marked change of rhetoric .
The Bush administration had repeatedly stated that what Russia thought was irrelevant .
The Department of Defense has identified 765 American service members who have died as a part of the Afghan war and related operations .
It confirmed the death of the following American yesterday :
FREEMAN , Matthew C. , 29 , Capt. , Marines ; Richmond Hill , Ga. ; Third Marine Expeditionary Force .

Egyptian Fury at Dresden Murder Protestors Accuse Germany of Racism
Fury and sorrow in Egypt : the murder of a pregnant Egyptian woman in a German courtroom last week has sparked protests in Egypt with mourners chanting " Down With Germany . "
The woman was stabbed to death in a racist attack .
It was only a few years ago , on St. Patrick ’s Day , when Teddy buttonholed me on the floor of the Senate for my support on a certain piece of legislation that was coming up for vote .
I gave him my pledge , but expressed my skepticism that it would pass .
But when the roll call was over , the bill garnered the votes it needed , and then some .
I looked at Teddy with astonishment and asked how he had done it .
He just patted me on the back , and said “ Luck of the Irish ! ”
Of course , luck had little to do with Ted Kennedy ’s legislative success , and he knew that .
A few years ago , his father - in - law told him that he and Daniel Webster just might be the two greatest senators of all time .
Without missing a beat , Teddy replied , “ What did Webster do ? ”
But though it is Ted Kennedy ’s historic body of achievements that we will remember , it is his giving heart that we will miss .
It was the friend and colleague who was always the first to pick up the phone and say , “ I ’m sorry for your loss , ” or “ I hope you feel better , ” or “ What can I do to help ? ”
It was the boss who was so adored by his staff that over five hundred spanning five decades showed up for his 75th birthday party .
It was the man who sent birthday wishes and thank you notes and even his own paintings to so many who never imagined that a U.S. Senator of such statue would take the time to think about someone like them .
I have one of those paintings in my private study  a Cape Cod seascape that was a gift to a freshman legislator who had just arrived in Washington and happened to admire it when Ted Kennedy welcomed him into his office the first week he arrived in Washington ; by the way , that ’s my second favorite gift from Teddy and Vicki after our dog Bo .
And it seems like everyone has one of those stories  the ones that often start with “ You would n’t believe who called me today . ”
Ted Kennedy was the father who looked after not only his own three children , but John ’s and Bobby ’s as well .
He took them camping and taught them to sail .
He laughed and danced with them at birthdays and weddings ; cried and mourned with them through hardship and tragedy ; and passed on that same sense of service and selflessness that his parents had instilled in him .
Shortly after Ted walked Caroline down the aisle and gave her away at the altar , he received a note from Jackie that read , “ On you the carefree youngest brother fell a burden a hero would have begged to been spared .
We are all going to make it because you were always there with your love . ”
Not only did the Kennedy family make it because of Ted ’s love  he made it because of theirs ; and especially because of the love and the life he found in Vicki .
After so much loss and so much sorrow , it could not have been easy for Ted to risk his heart again .
That he did is a testament to how deeply he loved this remarkable woman from Louisiana .
And she did n’t just love him back .
As Ted would often acknowledge , Vicki saved him .
She gave him strength and purpose ; joy and friendship ; and stood by him always , especially in those last , hardest days .
We cannot know for certain how long we have here .
We cannot foresee the trials or misfortunes that will test us along the way .
We cannot know God ’s plan for us .
What we can do is to live out our lives as best we can with purpose , and love , and joy .
We can use each day to show those who are closest to us how much we care about them , and treat others with the kindness and respect that we wish for ourselves .
We can learn from our mistakes and grow from our failures .
And we can strive at all costs to make a better world , so that someday , if we are blessed with the chance to look back on our time here , we can know that we spent it well ; that we made a difference ; that our fleeting presence had a lasting impact on the lives of other human beings .
Augmented Reality was not meant to hit the iPhone 3GS until at least the release of iPhone OS 3.1 .
Augmented reality uses your iPhone 's camera , GPS , and compass to show virtual items in the real world .
Put your camera in front of a restaurant and it will come up with info , or use it to find nearby Twitter users .
The potential is endless .
Yelp 's new iPhone app is now the first iPhone App with Augmented Reality .
It takes Yelp information and overlays it into the real - world .
It 's actually a secret easter egg ( discovered by Robert Scoble ) , which may be why Apple did n't reject Yelp 's augmented reality app .
We have screenshots and a demo video to show you what this is all about .
How to Activate Monocle , Plus Screenshots
Robert Scoble has posted instructions on how to activate this new Easter Egg :
Download the new Yelp app ( came out yesterday ) .
So you shake your iPhone 3 times .
That activates a feature called Monocle .
A message should come up if you activated it .
A blue box will come up saying " the Monocle has been activated . "
It will create a button in the top right corner .
Now you should be able to look at the bars , restaurants , etc .
Only works on iPhone 3GS .
It took our Jennifer Van Grove several tries and many shakes to get it to work , but if you have an iPhone 3GS , it works .
The result is this :
Screenshots do n't tell the whole story though , so Jennifer Van Grove took the Yelp App out for a spin .
Here is the full demo .
Prepare for pure awesomeness :
It 's astonishing that Yelp was able to sneak this one past Apple , but we 're so glad they did .
When The Pirate Bay was raided by police in 2006 they confiscated the site 's servers .
Now one of those servers has been bought by a Swedish museum , which will display the machine as a device that has impacted people 's lives .
In another development , damning CAM footage of the upcoming TPB movie has leaked showing the crew calculating their huge earnings .
The big question today is just how many Pirate Bay articles can we get out before our heads explode ?
Answer :
We do n’t know , but we ’ll keep trying – hopefully our brains will be intact to deliver the trial verdict tomorrow .
In the meantime , according to a report , one of the servers originally confiscated by the police in the 2006 Pirate Bay raid is set to become a museum piece .
Sweden ’s National Museum of Science and Technology has announced it has bought the server for 2,000 kronor ( $ 243 ) .
It will be displayed in a section of the museum dedicated to machines and inventions that have changed people ’s lives .
Pirate Bay ’s ‘ museum ’ server
In other Pirate Bay news , film director and producer Simon Klose previously announced he was making a documentary about the site entitled “ TPB - AFK ” .
The movie , which is being made by Klose from a fly - on - the - wall perspective , is scheduled to be finished in five years .
When it ’s released , Klose hopes that it will be heavily pirated but of course , pirates do n’t operate on other people ’s release schedules .
Impatient at having to wait years for a release , someone sneaked a CAM into an early screening and released the footage onto the Internet .
The damning footage , which shows the crew working out how much money they have earned from the site , is available below .
More Pirate Bay updates as we get them …

WHEREAS , A part of the members of the Church of God in the North have become ultra upon the present political issues between the North and the South , and have declared the systems of servitude as laid down in the Bible as evil , and incompatible with the interest of the American people ,
AND WHEREAS , they have by so doing , violated our Book of discipline , the New Testament , which is our only rule of faith and practice , and recognized by the church , as sufficient , without any human legislation upon it whatever ,
AND WHEREAS , the course pursued by a few , in publishing antislavery resolutions , and other articles of similar character , in the Church Advocate , which have embarrassed and brought us into serious and great difficulties , owing to the fact that the mass of the people do not understand our system of church cooperation ,
AND WHEREAS ,
Their course has subjected us to an unnecessary persecution , and greatly militated against the work of reformation of the South ,
AND WHEREAS , they have , by so doing , seceded from the early practice of the church , and do not , ( as they once did ) stand upon our creed , ( the Bible ) , but have virtually joined issue with that portion of the Bible , which exhorts servants to be obedient to their masters , which course of theirs is contrary to the letter , spirit , and design of the Gospel .
And in as much as we are taught in the Bible , " to be subject to the powers that be , and obey them which rule over us , " which most emphatically implies obedience to the laws of our land ,
AND WHEREAS , we in fact are pro-slavery men , and intend to be governed by the laws of the land , in which we live , as we ever have been .
THEREFORE ,
RESOLVED , that the Eldership in Texas , stand upon the Bible and that she does not deviate from it , but cleave to , and defend it , as being sufficient for our faith and practice in every particular .
RESOLVED , that we will , as we ever have been , and call upon all to be subject to , and assist in carrying out and enforce the laws of our country , and further ,
RESOLVED , that we claim no fellowship in Church with abolition members , North , East , West , or South , or wherever they may be found ; and have neither voice or part , either directly or indirectly , in making , forming or even winking at abolition resolutions , and declare them unscriptural , unbrotherly , and unconstitutional , and destructive to the interest of Church and State .

In an interview with CNN Headline News anchor Robin Meade today , former president George H.W. Bush condemned the attacks by Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich on Obama Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor .
Bush said , “ It does n’t help the process to be out there name - calling . ”
When asked what Sotomayor ’s impact will be on the Supreme Court , Bush said , “ I think she ’d pull a ripcord just at the right time and make a very nice parachutist .
I ’m going to leave that to others to analyze , but she should be given a fair hearing .
She should be accorded every courtesy that goes with her record as a judge and her aspirations to be a Supreme Court justice .
And I have a feeling she will be confirmed , but again , I do n’t go into that day in and day out . ”
The now 85 year old former president condemned those Republicans who were calling Sotomayor a racist , “ I like the way Sen . John Cornyn said it .
I mean , he may vote for her , he may not .
But he ’s been backing away from these — backing off from those who use radical statements to describe her or to attribute things to her that may or may not be true .
I mean , she was called by somebody a “ racist . ”
Well , that ’s not right .
I mean , it ’s not fair .
It does n’t help the process to be out there name - calling .
So let them decide whether they want to vote for her or not , and get on with it . ”

The thing that struck me about Bush ’s comments was that he sounded just like a president talking to Congress , with his let them decide and get on with it comment .
The former president echoed the thoughts of most Senate Republicans when he dismissed charges that she is a racist .
It is also interesting that as many in the right wing media are defending their extremism , George H.W. Bush would describe their attacks on Sotomayor as radical .
George H.W. Bush is the kind of Republican that Rush Limbaugh would seek to drum out of today ’s GOP .
He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the US District Court , and his building of a true international effort for the Gulf War , that if tried in this day and age , would be mocked by the neo-cons in the GOP , so Happy Birthday Bush 41 .
I ca n’t help but wonder what you think of the state of your Republican Party today ?
A Lebanese citizen being held in a detention center here was hooded , stripped naked for photographs and bundled onto an executive jet by FBI agents in Afghanistan in April , making him the first known target of a rendition during the Obama administration .
Unlike terrorism suspects who were secretly snatched by the CIA and harshly interrogated and imprisoned overseas during the George W. Bush administration , Raymond Azar was flown to this Washington suburb for a case involving inflated invoices .
Azar , 45 , pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy to commit bribery , the only charge against him .
He faces a maximum of five years in prison , but a sentence of 2 1 / 2 years or less is likely under federal guidelines .
Defense lawyers and prosecutors declined to comment on the case Friday .
Advertisement
But Joanne Mariner , terrorism and counter - terrorism director at Human Rights Watch , called the case “ bizarre . ”
“ He was treated like a high - security terrorist instead of someone accused of a relatively minor white - collar crime , ” she said .
Justice Department lawyers have denied any misconduct in the case .
“ The FBI followed standard operating procedures when transporting prisoners to the United States , ” Gina Talamona , a Justice Department spokeswoman , said Friday .
She said restraints “ were used with the sole purpose of ensuring the safety of the defendants and the agents . ”
Advertisement
As the Obama administration steps up efforts to curb fraud at military facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan , a senior Army official said Azar ’s case “ should serve as a warning ” to other contractors .
In court papers , Azar said he was denied his eyeglasses , not given food for 30 hours and put in a freezing room after his arrest by “ more than 10 men wearing flak jackets and carrying military style assault rifles . ”
Azar also said he was shackled and forced to wear a blindfold , dark hood and earphones for up to 18 hours on a Gulfstream V jet that flew him from Bagram air base , outside Kabul , to Virginia .
Before the hood was put on , he said , one of his captors waved a photo of Azar ’s wife and four children and warned Azar that he would “ never see them again ” unless he confessed .
Advertisement
“ Frightened for his immediate safety . . . and under the belief he would end up in the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay or Abu Ghraib to be tortured , ” Azar signed a paper he did not understand , his lawyers told the court .
Prosecutors , however , said that Azar was “ treated professionally , ” kept in a heated room , offered food and water repeatedly and “ provided with comfortable chairs to sit in . ”
They said he was photographed naked and subjected to a cavity search to ensure that he did not carry hidden weapons and was fit for travel .
Court records confirmed that Azar was shackled at the ankles , waist and wrists and made to wear a blindfold , hood and earphones aboard the plane .
Prosecutors also said that FBI agents read Azar his rights against self - incrimination on three occasions , and that he “ voluntarily ” waived them .
Advertisement
The FBI agent in charge , Perry J. Goerish , denied in an affidavit that Azar was “ told he would never see his family again unless he confessed . ”
Arrested along with Azar was Dinorah Cobos , 52 , a naturalized American from Honduras .
Cobos , who did not make the same claims of abuse , this week pleaded guilty to conspiracy and bribery .
Their case is different from the widely criticized “ extraordinary renditions ” carried out after the Sept. 11 attacks .
In those cases , CIA teams snatched suspected Al Qaeda members and other alleged terrorists overseas and flew them , shackled and hooded , to prisons outside the United States without any arrest warrants or other judicial proceedings .
The FBI arrested Azar and Cobos with warrants signed by a federal magistrate .
And the State Department , Talamona said , asked the government of Afghanistan “ for its consent in advance to take these two individuals into custody and return them to the United States to stand trial .
They consented to our request . ”

Azar and Cobos worked for a Lebanese construction company , Sima Salazar Group , which was awarded more than $ 50 million in Pentagon contracts for reconstruction and supply work in Afghanistan .
In December , according to the indictment , the pair offered to pay kickbacks to an Army Corps of Engineers officer in Kabul .
In exchange , he agreed to approve $ 13 million in outstanding bills from Sima Salazar .
Over the next four months , according to the charges , more than $ 106,000 was wired to the officer ’s bank account in Manassas .
But the case was an FBI sting , and Azar and Cobos were arrested at Camp Eggers , a U.S. military base in Kabul , after being lured to a meeting April 7 .
Sima Salazar Group is also under indictment .
On Wednesday , Cobos ’ sister , Gloria Martinez , 61 , pleaded guilty in federal court in New Orleans to conspiracy and two counts of bribery in a related case .
Prosecutors said Martinez , a senior Army Corps of Engineers official , accepted $ 425,000 in cash , jewelry and other gifts for herself and Cobos from companies seeking military contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan .

As a candidate last year , President Obama vowed to end “ the practice of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far - off countries . ”
After taking office , he ordered the CIA to close its network of “ black site ” prisons and promised to shutter the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The Justice Department has seized and transported foreign drug lords , terrorists and other high - profile fugitives to U.S. courtrooms when normal extradition was not considered possible .
The Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that such renditions , as the transfers are known , are permissible .
In 1997 , for example , FBI agents in Pakistan captured Mir Aimal Kasi , who was on the FBI ’s Ten Most Wanted list , and returned him to Washington to stand trial .
Kasi was convicted of murder in the killing of two CIA employees and was executed in Virginia in 2002 .

Azar is hardly in the same league , but Talamona pointed out that “ we take very seriously criminal fraud against the United States government . ”

Do you remember as a kid taking your cup to those self - serve drink kiosks at fast - food restaurants and mixing all the sodas together ??
I think we used to call them “ suicides ” or something .
We would mix like six drinks together and we thought it tasted amazing … or maybe we thought we were so unbelievably cool and that totally trumped the taste factor …
In any case , with Coca - Cola ’s new “ Freestyle ” machine we can now enjoy those same childhood mix-ups on a more sophisticated level .
The Coke Freestyle is a sleek , touch screen soda dispenser that allows you to mix over 100 different drinks ( sodas , juices , waters , teas , everything ! ) including some drinks that have n’t even been sold in the US before !
The machines are currently being tested in “ quick - serve ” restaurants in California and Atlanta and hopefully will be in cities near us by early next year .
I ca n’t wait .
Here ’s a video of a borderline creepy guy showing how the machine works .
He ’s kind of awkward and talks a lot , but you NEED to see machine for yourself and he does explain all the features .

My new job will involve coding in Q. Q is a scripting language derived from APL .
It is mostly used for stuff related to trading and finance .
I do n’t know it yet , I ’m supposed to learn it on the job , so I decided to have a look at it .
As an exercise , I took a couple of Haskell functions in the standard Data .
List module and tried to see how one can express them in Q. Experienced Q developers ( called “ Q gods ” in the Q terminology ) will probably laugh at my code , but well , I have to start from something .
Any corrections and idioms from Q gods are welcome .
Here are a couple of trivial functions that are special cases of builtin Q functions
init : { - 1_x} tail : { 1_x} head : { x [ 0 ] }
Q is a functional language .
It allows to take functions as parameters in functions .
Here the takeWhile function takes a predicate as its first parameter .
The code is probably too imperative for Q , I am sure there is a better way .
takeWhile : {[ p ; xs ] i:0 ; while [ ( i < count xs ) & p[ xs [ i ] ] ; i+:1 ] ; xs[ til i ] / quite readable , is n't it }
Q supports anonymous functions so one can call takeWhile as follows :
q ) takeWhile [ {x >0} ; ( 1;2;4;0;3;4;5 ) ]
1 2 4
Here {x >0} is an anonymous function that returns true ( 1b ) when the argument is positive and 0 b when it is less or equal 0 .
My first shot at Haskell ’s intersperse looked like this :
intersperse : { - 1 _ raze y , ' x }
Here y , ' x creates pairs with first element taken from y and second equal to x :
( 1;2;3 ) , ' 0 1 0 2 0 3 0
raze removes one level of nesting so we get a list instead of a list of pairs :
raze ( 1;2;3 ) , ' 0 1 0 2 0 3 0
- 1 _ then drops the last element
This works well , but only when the first argument is an atom ( not list ) .
intersperse [ 0 ; ( 1;2;3 ) ]
1 0 2 0 3
But when we want to intersperse a list we get an error :
q ) intersperse [ ( 0;0 ) ; ( ( 1;1 ) ; ( 2;2 ) ; ( 3; 3 ) ) ]
{- 1 _ raze y , ' x } ' length
To get a more general version we first define Haskell ’s replicate :
replicate : { [ n;e ] a : {x , ( enlist z ) } ; () a [ ; ;e ] / ( til n ) / folds the dyadic ( binary ) function a [ ; ; e ] over a list of length n }
Here a : {x , ( enlist z ) } creates a triadic ( ternary ) function that appends the third argument to the first and ignores the second .
This replicate implementation seems too complicated for such simple task , but I was unable to figure out anything simpler .
We also need Haskell ’s zip :
zip : { x { ( x;y ) } ' y }
And now we can define intersperse :
intersperse : { - 1 _ raze zip [y ; replicate [ count y; x ] ] }
This works better than the first attempt :
q ) intersperse [ ( 0;0 ) ; ( ( 1;1 ) ; ( 2;2 ) ; ( 3; 3 ) ) ]
1 1 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3
Haskell ’s map is kind of redundant in Q as unary functions ( called “ monadic ” in Q , is n’t that funny ? ) get mapped when called with a list as an argument .
q ) ( 3+ ) 4 7 q ) ( 3 + ) ( 1;2;3 ) 4 5 6 q )
This approach causes problems though when we want to map a function that works both for atoms and lists .
One such function is enlist , which creates a singleton list in Q , kind of like Haskell ’s return in the list monad .
( enlist 3 ) [ 0 ] 3
So how can we map enlist over a list ?
Just calling it on a list gives a singleton list with the argument as the only element of the result :
q ) count ( enlist ( 1;2;3 ) ) 1
The only solution I can see is to use a trick with folding similar to the one in the definition of replicate above .
map : { [ f ; xs ] a : {x , ( enlist z[y ] ) } ; () a [ ; ;f ] / xs }
This works :
q ) map[enlist ; ( 1;2;3 ) ]

An aerial view of the brewery in North Korea which houses the Ushers plant
By Adrian Brown
BBC News
The Ushers brewery in the Wiltshire town of Trowbridge used to produce award - winning traditional British real ales .
After an extraordinary journey , it 's now being used to brew a beer dubbed the " Pride of Pyongyang " .
Nine years after the brewery was sold to the secretive government in Pyongyang , its new brew - Taedong River Beer - has made international headlines this week after inspiring what is thought to be North Korean television 's first beer advert .
How the brewery plant was sold , dismantled and shipped to the North Korean capital is a curious tale .
Pyongyang 's warming relations with the West ( since cooled ) , international trade , and the Koreans ' thirst for a decent beer all played a part .
It began around 2000 when North Korea 's leader , Kim Jong
Il , decided he wanted a world class brewery for his country which was just coming round from a devastating famine .
History of Ushers brewery The Ushers brewery was on the market at the time , having been deemed no longer cost effective by its owners .
Briton Peter Ward , of brewing company Thomas Hardy Brewing and Packaging , bought the plant and sold it to the North Koreans through a German agent .
He remembers the deal vividly .
" When I was first approached about selling the brewery to the Koreans , I assumed it was the South Koreans , " he said .
Surprised to discover that it was the North Koreans who were buying , his first thought was , " Am I going to get paid ? " .
That was taken care of when a German bank agreed to underwrite the £ 1.5 m sale .
His other concern was security .
What if the North Koreans , who were pursuing a secret nuclear weapons programme at the time , were buying the brewery to make not beer but biological weapons ?
" There 's not a lot of difference between plant for a brewery and one for pharmaceuticals or biochemical activities .
Brewing equipment could be used for other things , " he said .
Again , the Germans assured him that Kim Jong - il was after beer , not bugs , and the deal went ahead .
Before long a team of North Korean engineers , workers , translators and officials had arrived in Trowbridge to dismantle the brewing equipment .
They got to work immediately and did not stop until they had finished .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" They worked extremely hard and long hours .
They did n't go out and spent most of their time in their lightweight boiler suits , " Mr Ward remembers .
" Engineering - wise , you would be turning back the clock 50 years .
From a mechanical point of view they were happy to take a blow torch to it rather than dismantle a piece of plant .
" They were going to rip it up without drawings , but we helped them taking it down and marked it all up for shipping to North Korea . "
Within 18 months of shipping the plant home , the North Koreans had the brewery up and running .
Uwe Oehms , the German agent who was asked by the North Koreans to find a brewery , remembers the deal as " one of the most interesting " of his life .
Though the North Koreans had limited experience of modern technology , he bought them a series of books on the latest brewing techniques .
" Despite their lack of English I was surprised that they were learning how to do this quite well , " he recalls .
" The quality of the beer was quite good in the beginning but when they could n't buy good foreign ingredients the quality decreased .
The North Koreans quickly picked up how to use modern brewing techniques
In Trowbridge itself , the memory of the Ushers brewery , which began brewing in the town in 1824 , is fading fast .
Though the building 's facade is still standing , plans to redevelop the site are still incomplete .
Part of it will be housing , another part will be a major supermarket .
Town councillor Clive Blackmore says selling the brewery was a major blow to the town .
" It was a big employer but it 's just one of a number of businesses that have left the area , " he says , before adding : " You can't blame them for taking it abroad .
There 's no bad feelings towards the North Koreans . "
But would the Pride of Pyongyang ever take the place of Ushers ' award winning ales ?
" I can't see anyone here being against it .
It would depend on what it tasted like .
If it 's fine , I 'd drink it , " he says .

Sirius has invested billions of dollars into amazing technology , but without a partnership that gives new car buyers a free subscription for a limited time , they would have failed years earlier .
They make the same argument , that they 've got exclusive content , but just like Times Select , walling off that content just made it less relevant .
Howard Stern was going to be the man who made Sirius a must have for millions of fans , but when was the last time you heard anybody mention the man ?
How did he go from a must - hear personality who was constantly in the news for his antics or his outrageousness to a " whatever happened to ? " has been ?
Simply , he was put behind a pay wall .
Oprah has her own channel , but I 've never heard it mentioned .
If the King of All Media and a woman who has enough influence to swing a national election can't get people to pay , why on earth does Murdoch think he can ?
Why is Google promoting two open source operating systems that can both be run on netbooks — Android and Chrome ?
Is this part of a larger strategy , where Google will direct the two along different paths — Chrome for netbooks and Android for the smartphone ?
Or could the Internet search giant just be floundering , with different groups of techies each going their own merry way with no clear marketing position ?
Free to Choose ?
Google announced the Chrome OS in July .
This was many months after the release of the first smartphone to carry the Android operating system .
While Android has already won the favor of several smartphone manufacturers , the OS can also run on netbooks after a little tweaking , which means developers , netbook vendors and users could be forced to choose between the two OSes .
Google ’s motivation has puzzled analysts .
“ I ’m not sure that even the respective Chrome and Android teams at Google know the answer , ” Laura DiDio , principal at ITIC , told LinuxInsider .
“ One would have expected Google to base Chrome on Android , but it did n’t . ”
Unless Google clarifies its strategy , having two OSes could backfire , DiDio warned .
“ Instead of Chrome challenging and eroding Microsoft ’s market share when it ships sometime in 2010 , it could cannibalize Android , ” she said .
Chrome , in fact , is already nibbling away at Android ’s market .
“ The Chrome OS did substantial damage to the Android momentum when news of it was released prematurely , ” said Rob Enderle , principal analyst at the Enderle Group .
“ One OS positioned against Microsoft is hard enough , and trying for two competing platforms at the same time is near - suicidal , ” he told LinuxInsider
Android - Powered Computers
At least two Android - powered , non-smartphone devices are already on the market .
Chinese manufacturer Skytone offers the Alpha 680 , which has a seven - inch screen and runs on an ARM11 32 - bit 533 MHz processor .
The device has a seven - inch LCD screen with 800 by 480 pixel resolution , and it comes equipped with two USB 2.0 slots ; an SD / MMC card slot with support for SDHC ; and 10/100 MB Ethernet .
Prototypes of the Skytone Alpha 680 were demonstrated at an electronics trade show in April .
Another device purportedly comes from i-Buddie , according to the gadget blog Engadget .
It runs on an Intel Atom N270 processor .
A video demonstration of the i-Buddie is available on YouTube .
Meanwhile , Acer has announced support for Android on its Aspire line of netbooks , due in the third quarter .
The Beat of Different Drummers
Google has perhaps been less than reassuring to vendors who have committed to Android as an OS .
In announcing Chrome OS , senior Google executives Sundar Pichai and Linus Upson said it is a new project , separate from Android , which was designed from the beginning to work across a variety of devices , from phones to set - top boxes to netbooks .
The Chrome OS is for people who spend most of their time on the Web .
Chrome is being designed to power computers ranging from small netbooks to full - size desktop systems .
“ Anyone can take the Android platform and add code or download it to create a mobile device without restrictions , ” Google spokesperson Eitan Bencuya told LinuxInsider .
“ The Android smartphone platform was designed from the beginning to scale downward to feature phones and upward to MID and netbook - style devices .
We look forward to seeing what contributions are made and how an open platform spurs innovation . ”
In plain English , it seems Google is throwing both OSes out there and seeing what people do with them .
Battling for the Smartbook Market
The first battlefield for Android and Chrome is the smartbook market , where they overlap , Enderle said .
Smartbooks are mobile devices that fall between smartphones and netbooks , offering always on , all - day battery life ; 3G connectivity and other smartphone features together with a full QWERTY keyboard .
“ That should be the ceiling for Android and the floor for the Chrome OS , which will grow to larger devices , ” Enderle said .
Early smartbooks are expected to be powered by Qualcomm ’s high - performance Snapdragon processors , but other chip makers are developing low - powered ARM - based chips for this market .
At the Computex Taipei show , Qualcomm said more than 15 manufacturers , including Asus , HTC and Toshiba , are developing products based on Snapdragon .
The processor does not run Windows OSes , so Snapdragon - based smartbooks have to run Linux .
Netbooks Are Hot , MacBooks Are Not
Meanwhile , the netbooks market is heating up as the recession bites into consumers ’ wallets .
ITIC projects that netbook unit shipments will double over the next year , although they have a small base at present .
More expensive laptops , however , may suffer .
A survey by online consumer electronics recommendation site Retrevo found that most students wo n’t consider buying a Mac because they ca n’t afford one .
Thirty - four percent of the more than 300 people surveyed said they ’d buy netbooks , while 49 percent said they would buy full - sized PCs .
The release of Windows 7 on Oct. 22 will further hit Mac sales , Retrevo president and CEO Vipin Jain told LinuxInsider .
“ We think Windows 7 is likely to change the playing field for Apple in the laptop category . ”
That will also open up the market for Google , if it can keep its eye on the ball .
Which Way Is Up ?
The problem is , it ’s not clear that Google even knows what the ball is or where it is .
“ Google does n’t seem to know which OS it wants netbook makers to pick , and this is causing all kinds of problems , ” Enderle of the Enderle Group said .
“ This is already causing problems with vendors and shifting out ship dates . ”
Google needs to come clean and provide the industry — especially crucial software developers and hardware OEMs — with specifics regarding its strategy for both Chrome and Google ; the differences in each platform ; and where each will be used , ITIC ’s DiDio said .
“ Otherwise , in the ensuing confusion , third - party ISVs ( independent software vendors ) and hardware OEMs could eschew both Chrome and Android in favor of other manufacturers , ” she warned .
“ If Google scales back plans to use Android as its primary OS for netbooks , what happens to companies like Acer , which has already announced support for Android on its Aspire
One line of netbooks , due in the third quarter ? ”
Google ’s timing for the announcement of Chrome OS was a bid to steal the thunder from Windows 7 , according to DiDio .
“ Chrome ca n’t challenge Microsoft in the near or intermediate term since it wo n’t be commercially available until next year , ” she pointed out .
“ This is a classic big - vendor maneuver by Google to camouflage its shortcomings . ”

Gasoline and diesel fuel are the two main sources of energy for today ’s cars .
Â
Although they are both derived from the same source ( oil ) they certainly are n’t interchangeable , have different chemical properties and are burned in two different ways .
Â
Below is a quick overview of the differences between the two fuels and the pros and cons of each .
First off , there are very long winded , scientific answers to this question , and if you ’ve come here for that you ’re not going to find it .
Â
This is going to be a very quick and dirty breakdown of the two fuels with minimal chemistry and jargon .
Both gasoline and diesel fuel are derivatives of crude oil , however they each consist of very different molecular structures .
Â
This happens due to each fuel being derived at different temperatures within the crude oil refining process .
Aside from the chemical differences , the diesel fuel and gasoline differ in how they are burned and used to create energy for your car :
Gasoline Engines :
Cars that use gasoline have to use spark plugs in order to ignite the fuel , which is due to the fact gasoline engines have a relatively low compression ratio .
Â
Here is what a typical stroke cycle looks like for a gasoline powered engine :
Gasoline and air are combined and forced into the cylinder Gas / air mixture is compressed .
Spark plug fires causing the mixture to ignite and explode , forcing the piston up and giving your car power .
Burned mixture is forced out as exhaust .
Diesel Engines :
Because diesel engines have much higher compression ratios , a diesel engine does n’t utilize spark plugs .
Â
As I ’m sure you remember from chemistry class , as gases are compressed , their temperature will increase , and diesel engines have such a high compression ratio that the heat produced by the compression is enough to ignite the fuel / air mixture .
Â
Here is what the typical stroke cycle looks like for a diesel powered engine :
Air is forced into the cylinder , and is compressed .
As this is going on , diesel fuel is sprayed into the cylinder .
The compression causes the diesel fuel to ignite , causing the piston upwards , which gives the car energy .
Burned mixture forced out as exhaust .
Of the two fuels , diesel tends to get better gas mileage than gasoline because it has a higher density , which leads more energy per each explosion within the cylinder .
Â
Also , diesel engines tend to be more efficient by nature .
Despite the better fuel economy from diesel fuel , gasoline is the cleaner burning of the two , and is one of the main reasons why diesel cars are n’t as popular in the United States .
So , that ’s the quick and dirty look at the differences between gasoline and diesel fuel .

Result :
This family was thrilled with our firm for not only getting rid of $ 160,000 of unsecured debt , but also paying less than half of what they owed on their car to own it outright .
This family owed $ 160,000 in unsecured debt and $ 16,000 on their car at around 20 % interest .
They made almost $ 100,000 a year .
That is over $ 30,000 more than what the Code allows for you to pass the first half of the Means Test for a Chapter 7 .
Mrs. C. lost her job shortly before filing , so their 6 - month average " current monthly income " did not properly reflect their realistic income moving forward .
After filing an affidavit of unemployment , we convinced the U.S. Trustee that this family was eligible for a Chapter 7 and we discharged all of their burdensome pre-existing unsecured debts .
However , the beauty did n't stop there :
The car that they owed $ 16,000 on was only worth $ 8,000 and they were getting killed on the interest rates due to bad credit .
We filed a Motion to Redeem and they paid only $ 8,000 for their car , which saved them over $ 10,000 over the life of the loan .

She originally hired an attorney in Missouri who charged her over $ 20,000 in attorney fees , drug out her case for over a year , and recommended that she accept the D.A. 's offer of 6 years in prison .
She fired him .
She hired us .
Mr. Pelley got her case dismissed in one single appearance in Court .
She was actually a Texas resident .

However , they made almost $ 100,000 as a family of two .
The applicable family income to file a Chapter 7 is $ 57,000 , so they clearly failed the first half of the Means Test .
We worked with them to maximize their qualified expenses .

Seattle is the most sustainable big city in the nation , according to a list compiled by Smarter Cities , an NRDC project that looks at the progress American cities are making toward going green .
Not surprisingly , San Francisco and Portland are the runners - up .
Using data from the EPA and the U.S. Census Bureau , as well as some voluntary survey responses from city governments , the project identified the top 15 large , medium , and small cities according to 10 different environmental criteria , from air quality to recycling to transportation .
Here ’s a look the top 15 large cities ( population of 250,000 or more ) :
Photo : Simonds1 . Seattle
The Emerald City gets props for its brand - new light rail system , reliance on hydroelectricity ( and the resulting good air quality ) , Mayor Greg Nickels ‘ U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Agreement , and two global warming initiatives : Seattle Climate Action Now and Seattle Climate Partnership .
Seattleites are described as “ highly educated and environmentally minded . ”
Think it ’s just a coincidence that Grist is headquartered here ?

San Francisco
San Francisco ’s dense population , walkability , plastic - bag ban , city - created carbon offset fund , solar power program , and booming local food movement propelled it to the No. 2 spot .

Portland
Seattle ’s neighbor to the south got its light rail up and running more than 20 years ago , and the city has always been ahead of the curve on controlling urban sprawl and suppressing greenhouse - gas emissions .
Portland ’s residents also recycle more than half their waste .

Oakland , Calif .
This once - struggling city has a Green Jobs Corps , a New Urbanist 10 K Downtown Housing Initiative , a Zero Waste Plan , and a growing local food movement ( as urban farmer Novella Carpenter explains ) .
It also gets 17 percent of its electricity from renewable sources .
Sounds like there is a there there .

Glenn Greenwald spells out why the Democrats must get their act together on the public option and stop compromising with the idiotic Right :
Over the past decade , the Democratic Party has specialized in
offering up one excuse after the next for its collective failures .
During the early Bush years , the excuse was that they endorsed Bush
policies because his popularity and post - 9/11 hysteria made it
politically unwise to oppose him .
In later Bush years when his
popularity plummeted , the excuse was that Democrats were in the
minority and could do nothing .
After 2006 when they won a
Congressional majority , the excuse was that Bush still controlled
the White House and had veto power .
After 2008 when a Democrat won
the White House , the excuse was that Republicans could filibuster .
Now
that they have a filibuster - proof majority , a huge margin in the House
and the White House , the excuses continue unabated , as Democrats are
now on the verge of jettisoning one of the most significant attractions
for progressives to the Obama campaign -- active government involvement
in the health insurance market .
The excuses for " compromising " are

If we do have a situation where the public option is negotiated away by the Democrats for no good reason , it is probably time to start building another political party capable of threatening the status quo .
The public insurance option is the line in the sand that serious progressives have drawn , and they must be willing to withdraw support from the President should he cross it .
This is a guest post by Kevin Rietmann , aka The Dude , on The Oil Drum .
The post is a response to Tuesdays NYTimes
Op-ed by energy analyst Michael Lynch , showing some historical track records between some ' peak oilers ' , Mr. Lynch and others .
Michael C. Lynch and “ the false threat of disappearing oil . ”
Energy analyst Michael C. Lynch 's op - ed piece “ ‘ Peak Oil ’
Is a Waste of Energy , published in the August 24th edition of the New York Times , has naturally garnered much attention from those in the peak oil community itself .
Lynch 's dim estimate of predictions of declining supplies of energy is evident from the title of his piece , and those familiar with views espoused by him in the past were n't surprised by this new batch of commentary :
A careful examination of the facts shows that most arguments about peak oil are based on anecdotal information , vague references and ignorance of how the oil industry goes about finding fields and extracting petroleum .
And this has been demonstrated over and over again : the founder of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil first claimed in 1989 that the peak had already been reached , and Mr. Schlesinger argued a decade earlier that production was unlikely to ever go much higher .
Indeed forecasts of the demise of oil in the past have often been far wide of the mark , as documented in Lynch 's own 1998 piece CRYING WOLF : Warnings about oil supply .
In this paper he shows how prominent peak oil advocate Colin Campbell 's forecasts from 1989 and 1991 were inaccurate , which they were :
One bit of data which would have been of value to include in this paper would have been who Campbell was being compared to in the first place .
Likely guesses are that “ CERI ” is the Canadian Energy Research Institute , “ EMF 11 Avg ” is the Energy Modeling Forum , and “ IEW ” is the International Energy Workshop .
As the graph shows , Campbell 's forecasts were the most inaccurate of this sampling , although whether other forecasters were even further off the mark for predicting production – or price , which was n't included in this broader comparison – is n't remarked upon ; but then this was a short piece , whose contents were intended to dismiss the then - current warnings of impending irreversible decline in oil supply coming from both Campbell and Jean Laherrère , who were recent collaborators on the March 1998 Scientific American article
The End of Cheap Oil , the notoriety of which had undoubtedly reached Lynch 's ear ; many look to this publication as marking the onset of the modern era of discussion of peak oil , including the coining of the term “ peak oil ” itself a few years later .
Having dismissed Campbell 's credibility with his article – or so one would imagine , anyway – Lynch then rounds things up with Colin 's current batch of forecasts for the early 21st century , contrasted with a handful of others , making sure the reader will be left with the impression that Campbell 's projections are in no way to be taken seriously :
Lynch ( 1996 ) argued that the Hubbert method fails because it takes recoverable ( not total ) resources as fixed , and assumes that to be the area under the curve of total production .
When the estimate of the area under the curve ( resources ) is increased , the entire increase must be applied to future production .
This is exactly what is happening with Campbell , as Figure 15 shows .
The errors in his 1991 forecast and the adjustments he has made in his latest work are thus predicted by Lynch ( 1996 ) .
Campbell has not provided an alternative explanation , merely ignored them .
And as Figure 18 shows , his forecast is well outside the mainstream .
Short - term prices will certainly fluctuate , and we will surely have more oil crises , since they are short - term events .
Unfortunately , there is little doubt that the certain failure of the current Cassandras will be forgotten within a few years and a new round of alarms will be sounded .
Hopefully , it will not receive the attention that the current ( and previous ) ones did , and even more hopefully , most governments and companies have already learned their lesson from the tens of billions of dollars wasted when others cried wolf during the 1970s .
As in his current NYT Op Ed Lynch implores the reader to pay no mind to those predicting a limit to liquid fuels production in any time frame worth considering ; as with other sections of the article he includes an easy to digest graph , this of another camp of forecasts , including his own :
So , how have things turned out in the intervening years ?
No doubt Campbell and his ilk have once again shot far and wide of the mark ; of course they will never learn their lesson , but people have been insisting that world oil production will soon irrevocably decline for practically as long as the industry has been around .
Well , let 's see : here is a version of Lynch 's graph , with bars added by me to delineate increments of 10 mb/d ( horizontally ) and 2008/2009 ( vertically ) , which were n't in the original :
This is of crude + condensate ( C+C ) ; 1998 average production was 66.96 kb/d according to the EIA 's International Energy Statistics .
As we can see Lynch , perhaps in a burst of confidence , was foreseeing the highest level of any on this graph , which , besides Campbell , included quite sizable government institutions : the EIA , IEA , and World Bank .
One might class these as optimistic by nature ; thus Lynch would trump even them in a burst of glory .
The trouble is , of course , that it was Lynch that aimed wildly off course here , and it is his nemesis Campbell that appears to have hit the bullseye .
Time constraints prevent me from digging up the original documents that these forecasts are derived from , but we can tell enough by simply eyeballing the chart .
The plateau of supply Campbell was predicting has n't come to pass , but if it had it would yield 2008 production of ca. 69 mb/d ; actual C+C levels for 2008 were , on average , 73.79 mb /d according to the EIA ; a difference of 4.79 mb /d .
The World Bank 's call looks to be about 79 mb/d , which would equate to 5.21 mb/d diff .
No doubt we could settle the niceties of who gets the blue ribbon here with the actual numbers used ; but what is incontestable is that Lynch was very far off the mark ; his 2008 levels are at least 86 mb/d , more comparable to the actual level of 85.47 mb/d for all liquids – perhaps this was even his intent , to forecast increased use of oil sands and the like , compared with Campbell 's pessimistic focus on C+C and little else .
But if so the presentation , lacking any kind of elaboration on this point , was misleading , to say the least .
What is more , in the intervening years it appears to have been the peak oilers who have made the accurate production forecasts , not cornucopians or massive government agencies such as the EIA and IEA .
This is a chart I prepared from data included in the Oil Drum 's Peak Oil Update - July 2009 : Production Forecasts and EIA Oil Production Numbers , prepared by Sam Foucher :
The columns show the accuracy of the forecasts at present ; the line delineates the year of global peak predicted in the forecasts .
As can be seen , calls for near term peaks have overall proven more accurate over the years than those foreseeing peaks decades in the future ; amusingly enough , a peak based on the simple stability in historic per capita oil consumption ( “ Population based ” ) has proven more accurate than that of any of the government agencies .
A remarkable aspect of these results is that , while the median date of publication of these documents is 2006 , the most accurate call for 2008 was from the 1998 paper of peak oilers Duncan and Youngquist .
Some obvious caveats suggest themselves immediately ; for instance , perhaps more optimistic researchers than those documented here made even more accurate calls , possibly from even earlier dates .
For this we can turn to a Canadian commentator on energy issues , Freddy Hutter , who is quite optimistic as regards to the future supply of hydrocarbons .
He has a “ Prediction Scoreboard ” on his page of Peak Oil Depletion Scenarios , which includes forecasts from a broad spectrum of researchers ; perhaps one of Lynch 's colleagues is way out in front ?
Or perhaps not ?
Using projections made 9 - 14 years ago , Jean Laherrère earns bragging rights for the most accurate forecast for 2008 with a calculation that was within 1 - mbd of the final tally .
Looking ahead using Year - to - date figures for 2009 and short term projections , the USA 's EIA is poised to garner the long term prediction crown for 2009 & may share 2010 with Duncan & Youngquist .
It would behoove the editors of the Times to inform their readers of these fundamental flaws in Lynch 's analysis ; in the forecasting department he has stumbled more than a bit badly , and those he has denigrated in the past – and present – have made long term predictions of conditions in the energy markets that leave Lynch 's past work – and thus , we surmise , his present work as well – throughly in the shade : indeed , perhaps little better than that “ based on anecdotal information , vague references and ignorance of how the oil industry goes about finding fields and extracting petroleum . ”
Toby Sunderland declared Thursday “ Zac Day ” in honor of his older brother -- and that it was .
Hundreds of admirers could not wait for Zac Sunderland , 17 , to guide his 36 - foot vessel into Marina del Rey on Thursday morning , completing a 13 - month quest to become the youngest person to sail around the world alone .
So they formed a conspicuous armada that included skiffs , sailboats and yachts , and greeted the mariner offshore .
There were lifeguard boats , police boats and news helicopters , which buzzed in a light fog that gave way to sunshine as the shaggy - haired adventurer rounded the breakwater .
Once ashore -- Sunderland ’s first steps as a figure of sailing lore -- he looked the way he generally has when reaching port : casual , as though he ’d just returned from a Sunday cruise .
Advertisement
This despite the magnitude of what he ’d accomplished : Fewer than 250 people have sailed solo around the world , according to the American Sailing Assn. , whereas more than 300 people climbed Mt. Everest just this year .
Hundreds of people had lined the waterfront at Fisherman ’s Village .
They clapped their hands and shouted , “ You did it ! ” and at one point broke into a chorus of “ God Bless America . ”
To be sure , if sailing is a pastime purely for the wealthy , that was not evident on this historic morning .
Sunderland , who departed Marina del Rey when he was 16 on June 14 , 2008 , not only broke a record held by Australia ’s Jesse Martin , who was 18 when he finished in 1999 .
He became the first person to solo - circumnavigate the planet before turning 18 -- a mark he ’ll never relinquish .
Advertisement
And he did this without major sponsorship on an older Islander sailboat named Intrepid , as one of seven Sunderland children who live in a modest Thousand Oaks home .
“ I think society puts young people in a box -- people 15 , 16 , 17 -- and does not expect them to do much but go to high school and play football and stuff like that , ” Sunderland said .
“ This just shows they can do a lot more with some strong ambition and desire .
My [ advice ] is to get out there and do your thing with all you got . ”
Beyond the media were throngs of “ Zac Packers , ” fans who have followed the sailor ’s odyssey on his blog .
Among them was Wyatt Gardner , 9 , a third - grader from Glendale , attending with classmates and their teacher , Kim Labinger .
Advertisement
“ It ’s amazing to see how a 17 - year - old can do all this in a year , ” Gardner said .
“ I wonder what his mom felt like when he was out there all alone , dealing with squalls , pirates and rocks and stuff . ”
Nearby was Joyce Rubin , who came from Studio City because she ’s also the mother of a 17 - year - old .
“ I can only cringe at the thought of what this must have been like for his parents , ” she said .
Laurence and Marianne Sunderland endured a lifetime supply of anxious moments , which included the time Zac was approached in the Indian Ocean by a mysterious - looking vessel that seemed sure to harbor pirates .

Zac used his satellite phone to call home , frantically , during his family ’s Sunday dinner .
He was instructed by Laurence to load his pistol and “ shoot to kill ” if necessary .
The vessel , with its crew hidden , maneuvered directly into the sailor ’s wake before slowly veering away .
Sunderland , whose voyage spanned three oceans , five seas and twice led him across the equator , once spent 60 hours without sleeping , while trying to fix broken rigging in 15 - foot seas and gale - force winds .
He endured brutally long windless periods while bobbing cork - like beneath a blazing sun , eating canned food and drinking nothing but tepid , desalinated water .

As he approached the Caribbean island of Grenada , during his crossing of the Atlantic , Intrepid was swamped by a monstrous rogue wave that struck at 2 a.m. as Zac , who was working on deck , hugged the mast to avoid being washed overboard .
“ All I saw was this huge green wall , ” he said .
“ So I grabbed and hung on ” as the boat rolled to one side and righted itself .
He also experienced exhilarating moments sailing effortlessly as one with the wind , often beneath a night sky aglitter with more stars than seem imaginable .
He passed beneath brilliant rainbows spawned by ominous black squalls sweeping ravenously across the water .
The sailor praised the extremely tightknit global sailing community , which along with his shipwright father helped him fashion innumerable repairs .

Without this support -- Laurence said he has missed six months of work flying to far - flung ports to assist his son -- he could not have achieved his goal .
Unfortunately for Sunderland , however , a Brit named Mike Perham , who is a few months younger , embarked on a similar quest last November and is expected to complete his solo - circumnavigation , aboard a 50 - foot racing yacht , in about three weeks .
Barring significant delay he ’ll become the youngest .
Then there ’s Australia ’s Jessica Watson , 15 , who is poised to begin a nonstop global quest later this summer , which might ultimately trump both boys ’ endeavors .
“ There ’s always someone younger who ’s going to come along , and I ’m fine with that , ” Sunderland reasoned , wiping hair from his face and smiling , seeming pleased just to be home .

He acknowledged that little of what he has accomplished has sunk in yet , and said he has no idea how the voyage might have changed him .
“ Ask my friends in about a week , ” was his answer to the latter question , prompting laughter .
But there ’s little doubt that it has changed him .
Karen Thorndike , who 11 years ago became the first American woman to solo - circumnavigate the planet , said Zac will forever have this as his private secret .

“ And the secret is , he ’s done something amazing , ” Thorndike said .
“ There are no words to describe it and it ’s his secret .
He did it .
He found that energy ; he found the strength ; he found that knowledge .
“ If he did n’t already know it before he left , he learned it along the way .
And that ’s the biggest thing you realize -- is that you do n’t have to know it all before you do something , as long as you can figure out how to learn how to do it . ”
As for Zac Day , Toby Sunderland , 11 , was hopeful it ’d involve cake , and he was not disappointed .

The Federal Building in downtown Youngstown , Ohio , features an extensive use of natural light to illuminate offices and a white roof to reflect heat .
It has LEED certification , the country ’s most recognized seal of approval for green buildings .
But the building is hardly a model of energy efficiency .
According to an environmental assessment last year , it did not score high enough to qualify for the Energy Star label granted by the Environmental Protection Agency , which ranks buildings after looking at a year ’s worth of utility bills .
The building ’s cooling system , a major gas guzzler , was one culprit .
Another was its design : to get its LEED label , it racked up points for things like native landscaping rather than structural energy - saving features , according to a study by the General Services Administration , which owns the building .
Builders covet LEED certification  it stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design  as a way to gain tax credits , attract tenants , charge premium rents and project an image of environmental responsibility .
But the gap between design and construction , which LEED certifies , and how some buildings actually perform led the program last week to announce that it would begin collecting information about energy use from all the buildings it certifies .
Soon , BrighterPlanet.com will feature a portable social Web application that will allow visitors to calculate the status of their carbon footprints and share what they are doing on conservation on other social platforms like Facebook .
Friends , family and colleagues can immediately see how saving the environment is important to Brighter Planet members , Ms. Prairie said .
“ That ’s what we find is the beauty of social networking , particularly for environmental - type causes . ”
A recent study for Sage North America found that 65 percent of small businesses that used social networking sites said that they felt more comfortable doing so this year than they did last year , and 51 percent said that they had acquired and retained customers because of it .
More than 260,000 North American businesses currently use social networking to promote their businesses , Mr. King said .
In April , Sage , which has 2.9 million small and midsize business customers , introduced its own networking site , SageSpark .com .
“ We know we ’re not the first to the game , ” Mr. King said .
“ Our twist really is the community , tools and services . ”
Other niche sites have sprouted recently , like Shustir.com .
Last week , Shustir.com introduced its virtual marketplace , which was started by two former Lehman Brothers colleagues , Shu Kim and Khanh Pham .
“ It matters where you spend , ” Ms. Kim said , echoing the site ’s catchphrase .
The goal , they said , is to keep Main Street U.S.A. alive .
“ We want you to spend with small businesses , ” Ms. Pham said .
“ By doing so , 80 percent of the money goes directly back to the community . ”
I never thought I 'd see a crowd of people heckle and boo a handicapped woman in a wheelchair .
I never thought I 'd be called a communist and a shill for big business - both in the same ten minutes .
But that was before the debate over federal health care reform came to my hometown , last night , at a town hall meeting on federal health care reform with Rep. Frank Pallone ( D - 6th District ) .
I kind of wish it had n't .
There was no discussion , no one listened to anyone .
Pallone could not open his mouth before being jeered and heckled .
Opponents of the health care legislation sponsored by Pallone grew so rabid they at one point began booing people who were asking Pallone NOT to vote for the bill .
When one opponent of the bill began her comments by quoting Margaret Mead , she was booed loudly .
She was challenging Pallone and was clearly opposed to the bill .
But I guess the crowd heard her mention
Margaret Mead
and assumed , if they were quoting an intellectual , it must be a liberal talking .
So they bood her almost out of the joint .
Both sides did their share of yelling .
I guess they at least got their frustrations out .
But for someone like me - who believes we need fundamental health care reform , but maybe HR 3200 is not the way to go about it , there was no relief .
And there seems to be no place at all for us in the current debate .

There is a book in my library , published in 1962 , titled : " The Best of Basketball From Scholastic Coach " .
There is a chapter in this book written by former Kansas State coach Tex Winter about " The Triangular Sideline Series " .
Yes , the same Tex Winter who has been the offensive architect of Phil Jackson 's nine NBA titles .
And yes , the chapter focuses on the " Triangle Offense . "
CoachSpeak Interested in the X's and O's of college basketball , but do n't understand the terminology ?
Read ESPN 's Fran Fraschilla 's introduction to Hoops 101 on ESPN.com for a crash course in the basics of basketball .
Actually , when it comes to the Triangle , it was Winter 's college coach at Southern Cal , Sam Barry , who planted the early ideas in his player 's mind about the offense .
And , it was at Kansas State , a place Winter where won eight Big 8 titles , where the Triangle first flourished .
Today , because of the recent success of the Bulls and the Lakers , the Triangle ( or Triple Post ) has gained favor with many college coaches .
And it can be found in both the men's and women 's games .
Both Geno Auriemma's Connecticut Lady Huskies and Pat Summitt 's Tennessee Lady Vols have won NCAA championships because of Winter 's innovation .
And , as recent as last year , Indiana 's Final Four run was helped , in part , by some elements of the " triangle " in the Hoosiers ' offense .
Basically , the Triangle consists of a three - man triangle on one side of the court and a " two man game " on the other side of the court .
Unlike set plays , there is a freedom of movement in the offense .
There are a wide variety of cuts , depending on how the defense plays .
Winter would describe this as " read and react " .
Unlike a freelance motion offense , there is a structure requiring precise court spacing and cutting .
Every player must know each position on the floor .
And , while there is no way that we can show all of the many options in the Triangle , this week 's lesson plan will look at basic movements of the Triangle Offense .
Setting Up the Triangle
The Triangle Offense starts in a 1 - 2 - 2 set with the players spaced about 15 feet apart .
This spacing spreads the defense , thereby discouraging doubleteams , and allows for short , crisp passing that will reduce the risk of interceptions .
There are a number of different ways of getting into the Triangle Offense :
Here , the point guard ( 1 ) passes to small forward ( 3 ) , and then makes an inside cut toward the corner .
Here , the point guard ( 1 ) passes to small forward ( 3 ) , and then makes an outside cut .
The Triangle Offense also allows guards to get into the low post .
Again , there are several ways to get into this offensive look .
For example , as the point guard ( 1 ) passes to small forward ( 3 ) , the center ( 5 ) pops out to the corner , allowing the off guard ( 2 ) to move into low post .
There is also a dribble entry option , as the point guard ( 1 ) dribbles to the spot previously occupied by the small forward ( 3 ) , who moves down to the corner -- creating a " triangle " with the center ( 5 ) .
Running the Triangle Offense
Once the " triangle " is set up -- in this case with the point guard ( 1 ) having cut to the corner -- a " line of deployment " has been created between the ball ( 3 ) , the post ( 5 ) and the basket .
In order for the center 's man to stay between him and the basket , he must play behind him -- as long as the post player ( 5 ) stays on the " line " .
Once this happens , it 's clear how the " triangle " opens up a clear passing lane for the small forward ( 3 ) , with an easy angle to pass into the post , or " post feed " the center .
Look at the two diagrams below .
For the post defender ( X5 ) to prevent the pass into the post , or center , ( 5 ) , he must play on either side of him , or " front him " .
If he plays in front of the post man , he loses position between the center and the basket , leaving the option open for a lob pass or quick pass to either side .
Any one of these entry passes into the post leads to an easy basket .
Trust me when I tell you that that we could be diagramming plays all day if we wanted to show you the magnitude of entry passes and options .
Unlike many offenses , there are a myriad ways to get into the " triangle spots " .
Thus , it makes it very , very difficult for defenses to prepare for and disrupt the Triangle Offense .
Proper spacing allows for several great opportunities to feed the post , create 1 - on - 1 situations , as well as , chances for every player in the " triangle " to help the other get open .
Here are some other options the " triangle " creates off the " post feed " .
The Post Split :
As the small forward ( 3 ) passes to the post man ( 5 ) , he screens for the point guard ( 1 ) as they " split " off the post .
The Screen Away :
The small forward ( 3 ) passes to the post and then screens away for the power forward ( 4 ) , who is looking for short jumper , as the point guard ( 1 ) makes back door cut along baseline .
Pass To The Corner :
This option starts with the small forward ( 3 ) passing to point guard ( 1 ) in the corner , and then making a " shuffle cut " off the post man .
The point ( 1 ) will pass it back to the small forward ( 3 ) if he is open .
If the small forward is covered , the center ( 5 ) will set a screen on the ball for the point ( 1 ) , and then rolls to the basket .
There are also plenty of weakside options within the Triangle Offense .
See if you can identify some of these variation of the " triangle " while watching a team like Indiana this season .
Back Door Lob :
If the center is not open , the power forward will flash to ball .
If the defense overplays the power forward ( 4 ) , it 's up to the point guard ( 1 ) to look for a backdoor lob pass to the power forward .
Pinch Post : Another option is the pass back to the off guard , and a pass to the " pinch post " or weak side elbow area .
This happens when the off guard ( 2 ) cuts around the power forward ( 4 ) for a handoff , or the point guard ( 1 ) comes off the double screen from the center ( 5 ) and small forward ( 3 ) .
Screen and Roll :
On the pass back to the off guard ( 2 ) , the power forward ( 4 ) steps up to screen on the ball .
Back Door for 2 : This option presents itself when the off guard is overplayed .
The power forward ( 4 ) will then flash to receive a pass from the small forward ( 3 ) and , on the catch , the off guard ( 2 ) makes backdoor cut to basket .
As in every offense we 've showed you , the execution of the fundamentals of passing , dribbling and shooting are paramount to success .
There is no genius to the X's and O's and good coaches recognize this .
Q & A with Fran Fraschilla
Send in your Hoops 101 questions .
Fran Fraschilla will answer a few each week as the season continues .
" Would it be acceptable to say that just like the Lakers in the NBA , teams like UNC , Arizona , and most of all , Duke get an unfair advantage during the course of a game from the officials ? "
Matthew Wilkinson ,
Atlanta , Ga .
You make an interesting observation .
The vast majority of officials do a terrific job .
Fans AND coaches would be surprised at how often they make the right call in a sport where the athletes are quick and strong and the pace of the game is furious .
The very best officials do not care who wins the game , or where the game is being played .
And , they officiate the last minute of the game like the first minute .
I 've never bought into the idea that officials should " let the players decide the game " in the final minutes .
If a player is impeded from getting to the basket in the final 10 seconds of a tie game , it is a foul and the defender has " decided the game " by fouling .
I have seen , in my 23 years , that there are a " minority " of officials that , subconsciously , do not want to be involved in an upset of a more talented team by a less talented team that played better that particular night .
It is human nature and officials , like coaches and players , are human .
I have been on both sides of this equation and it is frustrating when you are on the short end .
Officials at the college level have a tough job and thankless job .
They are constantly evaluated by their conferences and the coaches .
Ultimately , they are at their best when the fans , players , and coaches do n't notice them .
" Brandin Knight is an outstanding basketball player on a great team .
But free throws are an important part of a player 's and team 's game .
With him shooting his free throws under 50 percent , does he have any chance of leading his team to the NCAA championship ? "
Jonathan Burdick ,
Cambridge Springs , Pa .
As a point guard , Brandin Knight provides so many positives for the Pittsburgh Panthers , that his contributions far outweigh his one weakness -- his 43 percent free throw shooting .
He is so valuable and finds so many ways for his team to win that Ben Howland always has him on the floor in " crunch time " .
Knight might not be the best point guard in the country -- there are some great ones this season -- but he might be the most competitive .
And , hey , he made his last three in Pittsburgh 's one - point over Georgetown on Saturday .
" As a longtime Oklahoma State fan , I have always watched and admired Eddie Sutton 's defensive system and coaching .
However , I have not been able to explain the in's and out 's of his offense .
Could you break down Eddie 's offensive system for us ?
Thanks .
Brian Lundin ,
Austin , Texas
If you 're a longtime Cowboy fan , you 're having some fun this year .
I just saw their win in Waco over the Baylor Bears last week and was very impressed .
Coach Sutton is doing another outstanding job .
His team is playing outstanding man - to - man defense .
It is an extremely quick team that pressures the ball and tries to disrupt every " passing lane " , making it difficult for teams to run their offenses .
As you probably know , Coach Sutton comes from the " family coaching tree " of the legendary Henry Iba , who was the father of " motion offense " -- which we will get into greater detail later in the season .
The Cowboys rely on a simple " motion offense " with no predetermination of movement by the players and some simple " set plays " designed to get the ball to particular players .
While their offense is not complicated , OSU is a team that executes the fundamentals of passing , catching and shooting the ball .
They do n't turn the ball over much , so they do n't beat themselves .
" I really enjoy Hoops 101 .
I hope this feature stays on ESPN.com for a long time to come .
This type of " coaches view " analysis is very informative and it provides the fan with a new prospective on the game .
What are the keys to success for the UConn women 's team ?
Tom ,
New York , N.Y .
Thanks for the question on Geo Aureimma 's UConn Huskies .
I 've been amazed that they continue to build their winning streak despite losing four great seniors .
Everything starts with Diana Taurasi , who may not be the best player the country -- I love Alana Beard -- but might be the best leader in the country .
She 'a averaging 18 points , 6 rebounds , and 5 assists .
And she 's played the last couple of weeks on a very gimpy ankle .
In addition , Taurasi is surrounded by a talented group of freshman and sophomores .
Jessica Moore and Ashley Battle , a pair of sophomores anchor the inside , along with freshman Barbara Turner , who had 25 points at Notre Dame , and Willnet Crockett .
Most importantly , the Huskies play great team defense , limiting opponents to 50 point a game , 32 - percent shooting , and outrebound them by almost 12 a game .
By the way , freshman Nicole Wolff , who started the first 10 games but been hurt lately , is the daughter of Boston University 's men's head coach Dennis Wolff .
" What is your opinion on using zone vs man - to - man defense at the junior high level .
Many ' experts ' have said that leagues should not allow zone at that age , in order to force man - to - man fundamentals .
Be aware that some of your players are not as athletic and the opposing players cannot hit the outside jump shot . "
Brian ,
Melbourne , Fla .
Brian ,
Thanks for your question .
You have touched on a subject that I am passionate about .
There is a breakdown of the fundamentals at every level .
I have seen NBA , college , and high school teams practice this year and the problem is pervasive .
Do n't assume because a player get to the highest levels , that he is fundamentally sound .
Coaching at the junior high level and below should be strictly based on teaching the offensive and defensive fundamentals of basketball at the expense of winning games .
Basketball skills like passing , shooting , ball - handling and defending man - to - man are eroding in this country .
We live in an age where the dunk , the 3 - point shot , spectacular steal , and fancy pass are what is most often shown on SportsCenter .
Great team defenders , simple passes to an open player in the low post , proper footwork to catch a pass in scoring position , and the 12 - foot baseline jumper are becoming obsolete .
Here are some suggestions if I were coaching at the junior high and youth levels :
1. Stress the fundamentals every day in every practice .
Repetition is the key to learning .
2 . Make practices competitive but fun .
3 . Stress playing hard , playing as a team , and stress proper values like discipline and doing things " right " .
Winning will be a byproduct of this .
4. Play man - to - man defense .
Get players to learn how to guard one - on - one , but also learn how to help each other on defense .
5. Teach " game situations ' " and get my players to " think the game " .

Ferrari 458 Italia - Click above to watch the videos after the break
For all those Ferrari devotees that immediately closed their eyes and began making revving engine and shifting gear sounds after drooling on the keyboards in their cubicles over the new 458 Italia earlier this morning , we have good news .
While not exactly a new series of photos , the crew from Maranello has let loose two new videos of its mid-engined hypercar .
The first vid gives us an early glimpse of the suitably high - tech view from the driver 's seat , but both new clips may offer something even better : the glorious sound of Ferrari 's latest mid-mounted 4.5 - liter V8 engine running up and down the ratios of its seven - speed dual clutch gearbox .
While we 'll always have intense affection for the sound of a good 'ol over - cammed and under - muffled American V8 engine rumbling away at idle , there 's something uniquely intoxicating about the screeching wail made by 562 Prancing Italian Horses galloping along at a full 9,000 rpm .
Thanks for sharing , Ferrari .
Click past the break to watch the videos ... and be sure to turn up those speakers .
A proposed permanent needle - exchange site in Victoria has received a thumbs down from junkies , who say the area is too dangerous and too far from downtown .
In a July 23 letter to the Vancouver Island Health Authority 's Needle Exchange Advisory Committee , a group calling itself SOLID -- Society for Living Intravenous Drug Users -- said a proposed site on Princess Street was inappropriate .
No address was given .
article continues below
The letter , a copy of which was obtained by the Times Colonist , said the area is known to drug users as " extremely dangerous and violent due to street gang activity , " and any attempt at extra policing would only scare away needle - exchange clients .
SOLID , listed as a member of the Needle Exchange Advisory Committee , also said that the site was too far from downtown services , buildings were badly maintained and unsuitable for a health service and current tenants would have to be displaced .
The letter argues 941 Pandora Ave. , the site of the old St. John 's Ambulance Society , is still the best site for a needle exchange .
But Shannon Turner , chairwoman of the Needle Exchange Advisory Committee , said the Pandora Avenue location is no longer an option , largely because of community objections .
The Vancouver Island Health Authority dropped that building from consideration in March 2008 after an outcry from the community , including parents and officials at St. Andrew 's School on Pandora Avenue , kitty corner to the St. John 's Ambulance building .
" Given what we heard from the larger community , that [ site ] would be problematic , " said Turner , who serves as director of public health for the health authority .
She would not reveal the address of the Princess Street site .
But she confirmed the existence of the letter and said the health authority has identified one possible site for a fixed needle exchange .
Turner said a meeting with members of SOLID to address their concerns is planned early this month .
The Needle Exchange Advisory Committee was formed in the months following the decision to abandon the Pandora Avenue site , and includes representatives of the business community , drug users , social agencies , police , the city and others .
While it wo n't make the final decision on a needle exchange , it 's expected to provide input to the Island 's chief medical health officer .
Turner said a fixed site is a missing piece from Victoria 's harm - reduction efforts for illicit drug users , which now include mobile needle exchanges and some pharmacies .
The more options for access , the more likely people will be better served , she said .
" People will have multiple access points so access is not a barrier . "
The issue of a fixed needle - exchange site has long been contentious in Victoria .
The previous fixed exchange on Cormorant Street ran for about six years before being evicted by its landlord in May 2008 after repeated complaints from neighbours about discarded needles , bloody refuse , discarded condoms and human excrement .
In June , a group calling itself Harm Reduction Victoria opened a " guerrilla " needle exchange , handing out needles in the 900 block of Pandora Avenue , near St. Andrew 's School .
The move was a violation of a voluntary undertaking to keep needle - exchange activities away from schools , and was condemned by many now participating on the Needle Exchange Advisory Committee .

LUXUS FÜR IHRE NÄGEL

Seeing Microsoft 's latest attempt to take a chunk out of Yahoo - this time , to in effect take over its search advertising business - I 'm reminded of one of Bob Monkhouse 's lines : " Everyone laughed when I said I wanted to be a comedian .
Well , they 're not laughing now . "
Everyone did indeed laugh when Microsoft made its $ 44.6 bn bid for Yahoo in February 2008 ; principally inside Yahoo , where they had financial projections which suggested that the company would be worth far more within a short period of time .
Unfortunately , as anyone outside Yahoo could have told them , the projections were nonsense - made when the credit crunch had barely begun to bite , and when people assumed that online advertising would continue to grow without end , swallowing up all the money being spent on TV , radio , print and other outlets until it was the only form .
Jerry Yang , then head of Yahoo , turned the deal down , and despite Microsoft 's chief executive Steve Ballmer repeatedly trying to talk some financial sense into him ( although whether the deal would have made corporate sense is a different question entirely ) , it did n't happen .
Well , reality intruded .
Yang was unceremoniously dumped , ousted by carpetbagging shareholders who'd hoped to make a pile from Microsoft 's money .
Carol Bartz is now in , and she 's a pragmatist - allied to the fact that Yahoo's profits have slumped seriously .
Nobody 's laughing , especially at Yahoo , and although Yahoo is still a bigger referrer than Microsoft 's newly - rebranded search engine Bing - for the Guardian Technology site , for example , Yahoo generates about 30 % more referrers than Bing , though both are almost one - tenth the size of Google as a referrer - the momentum is with Microsoft .
The deal being considered would mean Microsoft takes over the search advertising for Yahoo , and pays back a guaranteed amount each year .
This is a bit like sale - and - lease - back on a commercial building : Yahoo gives up one of its most valuable properties , but hopes to get a guaranteed amount from it .
For Yahoo , that 's an admission of defeat in the search market : one of the most - visited properties online deciding that it can't cut it , and that search and search advertising are something that others do better .
In the physical world , sale - and - lease - back always makes accountancy sense ( it reduces your static assets and increases your flexibility ) but it cuts you off from what you used to be tied to : the organisation becomes rootless .
Taking control of Yahoo's search business would give Microsoft 30 % of the US search business .
But the effects will be less on Microsoft , and more on Yahoo .
Bartz and Ballmer discussed the failed deal at the AllthingsD conference in May , and all the signs are that that is where they began to get the discussion back on track .
Microsoft 's track , that is .
Yahoo is due to announce its past quarter 's results next week , and Bartz will be keen to have something to offer to Wall Street analysts , who will be seeking evidence that her hard - as - nails approach is bearing fruit .
The problem for Yahoo is that after all these years it 's still trying to decide what it 's for .
Is it a search engine ?
Is it where you get your email ?
Your news ?
Your TV ?
Bartz has n't , as far as we can tell , given any indication to the troops of what the company 's real mission is .
Google 's is " to organise the world 's information and make it accessible " .
( And sell adverts against it . )
Microsoft 's is to " get a computer on every desk , running Windows . "
( And run Windows on anything that can run an operating system . )
What 's Yahoo's ?
If the deal is inked - and Kara Swisher of AllthingsD , who has followed its ups and downs perhaps the closest of all the reporters out there says it 's " down to the short strokes " - then Microsoft will begin to look like a worthy adversary for Google .
But Yahoo , despite its size , will start looking like a rump .
Analysts expect it to earn about $ 104 m profit on revenues of $ 1.14bn , compared to $ 131 m on revenues of $ 1.8 bn a year ago .
That 's not good either .
In short , this deal with Microsoft - should it come off - will be good for Microsoft .
But it still leaves
Yahoo searching for an identity it lost some time in 2000 .
What nobody has yet answered , but Bartz needs to , is : what is Yahoo for ?
Gay rights activists in India say a ruling by the Delhi High Court decriminalising homosexuality in the country is a landmark .
The judgement overturns a 149 - year - old colonial law which described a same - sex relationship as an " unnatural offence " .
VIKRAM DOCTOR , WRITER AND GAY RIGHTS ACTIVIST
The ruling is a huge step forward .
It is fantastic .
I hope the government of India accepts the Delhi High Court decision .
It has been an eight - year battle and I am glad it came through .
In one way it changes nothing - there are many gay couples in India anyway .
In another way , it changes everything .
Till now we were considered to be criminals .
If a gay couple wanted to buy a house together , it was not possible .
No financial institute would even consider them .
Rights groups have long campaigned for a repeal of the law I am not saying they can do this now but now we can start fighting .
There are gangs who target gays as they would not go to a police station for the fear of being booked themselves .
Even some policemen are part of these gangs .
In Lucknow there has been an incident where even social activists working with MSMs ( Men having Sex with Men ) for HIV prevention have been detained by the police .
And these incidents happen everywhere .
NITIN KARANI , GAY RIGHTS ACTIVIST
For me , most importantly people who are afraid to come forward will be able to do so .
It is very difficult to reach out to HIV - positive people .
Also families who use this section to scare their children and get them married forcibly wo n't be able to do so .
This ruling will contribute in making society 's attitude more positive .
Cases of police harassment may reduce .
I have seen people driven to suicide .
I hope this decision gives more confidence to gay people to come out , be less afraid .
ADITYA BANDYOPADHYAY , LAWYER AND GAY RIGHTS ACTIVIST
We are elated .
It 's a path - breaking judgement .
It 's a historic judgement , it 's India 's Stonewall .
I think what now happens is that a lot of our fundamental rights and civic rights which were denied to us can now be reclaimed by us .
The government has so far been pandering to narrow parochial groups , religious groups but the court order shows that India is ruled by constitutional laws and not by vote - bank politics .
It 's a fabulously written judgement , and it restores our faith in judiciary .
ANJALI GOPALAN , NAZ FOUNDATION WORKING ON HIV PREVENTION
We have finally entered the 21st Century .
The government can't ignore this .
GAUTAM BHAN , GAY RIGHTS ACTIVIST
This is a long - awaited and incredible judgement .
The judges in their verdict spoke about inclusivity , equality and dignity .
They spoke about a vision of India as an open , tolerant society and to hear all this from the Delhi High Court was amazing .
SCOTT LONG , TRANSGENDER RIGHTS PROGRAM , HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH
This legal remnant of British colonialism has been used to deprive people of their basic rights for too long .
This long - awaited decision testifies to the reach of democracy and rights in India .
British colonisers introduced Section 377 to India in 1860 .
It became a model for similar sodomy laws imposed on other British colonies , and comparable provisions survive today from Singapore to Uganda .
Most of the world 's sodomy laws are relics of colonialism .
As the world 's largest democracy , India has shown the way for other countries to rid themselves of these repressive burdens .
CELINA JAITLEY , BOLLYWOOD ACTRESS
I 'm overwhelmed .
It 's great not to be criminalised for being a human being and what you do in your bedroom .
WENDELL RODRICKS , FASHION DESIGNER
It is a historic moment for all of India .
It has been a long fight .
Now , one is not a criminal when anyway one was not in the first place .
It is a move in the right direction and I would go further to say that India is not a religion - run state and this decision is restoring dignity to a community that has been fighting for a long time .
ONIR BASU , FILMMAKER
It is an important decision , a step in the right direction .
When I was making my film My brother Nikhil ( a film with a gay couple as protagonists ) , no one was willing to finance us .
No big star was ready to be part of it .
People used to ask why I would want to get slotted .
The ruling is good for prevention of HIV .
Whenever something is hidden people do not get to know .
The disease spreads because no one talks about it .

Georgia and Russia have been trading accusations in recent days Georgia has accused Russia of trying to seize more of its territory as the anniversary of last year 's brief war between the two countries approaches .
Tbilisi said Russian troops had been moving border posts along the boundary between Georgia and its Russian - backed breakaway region of South Ossetia .
Georgia 's foreign ministry called Sunday 's moves " extremely alarming " .
Russia has accused Georgia of firing mortars into South Ossetia .
EU monitors said they could confirm neither claim .
Click here for a map of the region Russian troops had entered the village of Kveshi near South Ossetia and put up new border posts , the Georgian foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday , condemning the alleged move as a deliberate provocation .
The statement said the incident represented " an attempt by the Russian occupants to penetrate into the depth of Georgian territory " .
On Saturday , Moscow accused Georgia of targeting South Ossetia with mortar fire and said it would respond if this continued .
The EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia ( EUMM ) , the only organisation now monitoring the border , said there was currently no evidence for either accusation .
The EUMM had intensified patrols around the border area and called on both sides to refrain from making accusations to escalate tensions at such a sensitive time , a spokesman told the BBC .
Georgia protests
Last year 's conflict erupted on 7 August as Georgia tried to retake control of South Ossetia .
Russia quickly repelled the assault , and built up its military presence in both South Ossetia and Georgia 's other breakaway region of Abkhazia .
Analysts say both sides are using the approaching anniversary to try and score political points against each other .
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has faced mass protests calling for his resignation since April .
The opposition accuse the Georgian president of bungling the 2008 war , and failing to strengthen the rule of law and improving democratic freedoms .
Critics say Mr Saakashvili has not addressed how he plans to regain control of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , which are both now recognised and supported as independent states by Russia .
US Vice - President Joe Biden made clear on a visit to Georgia last month that the US would not support any attempt to solve the impasse militarily .
Under a new official agreement with South Ossetia , Russia is now in charge of the territory 's border protection .

I 'll be giving a talk at the Brisbane Cocoaheads meeting this Monday evening ( Oct 6 ) .
Come along and heckle .
It 's an iPhone post because I finally can .
Here 's a good way to slide your view around when editing UIText Fields so that they never get trapped under the onscreen keyboard .
Hidden text fields
The iPhone 's onscreen keyboard occupies the bottom 216 pixels on screen ( 162 in landscape mode ) .
That 's around half the screen , so if you ever have a text field you want to edit in the bottom half of the screen , it needs to move or it will get covered .
You can just animate the whole window upwards by the height of the keyboard when editing a text field in the bottom half but this does n't work well for text fields in the middle ( they can get moved too far up ) .
Instead , I 'm going to show you a method which divides the window as follows :
Everything in the top section will stay still when edited .
Everything in the middle section will animate upwards by a fraction of the keyboard 's height ( proportional to the field 's height within the middle section ) .
Everything in the bottom section will animate upwards by the keyboard 's full height .
Implementing the delegate methods
All of the methods shown here should go into a view controller probably the " main " view controller for the current screen ( i.e. the visible ViewController of the current UINavigationController , your RootViewController or other top - level view controller ) .
You will need to make this view controller the delegate ( in Interface Builder ) for every UIText Field you want to animate .
Your view controller will need the following instance variable :
CGFloat animatedDistance ;
The following constants should also be declared somewhere ( likely the top of the view controller 's implementation file ) :
static const CGFloat KEYBOARD_ANIMATION_DURATION
= 0.3 ; static const CGFloat MINIMUM_SCROLL_FRACTION
= 0.2 ; static const CGFloat MAXIMUM_SCROLL_FRACTION
= 0.8 ; static const CGFloat PORTRAIT_KEYBOARD_HEIGHT
= 216 ; static const CGFloat LANDSCAPE_KEYBOARD_HEIGHT
= 162 ;
Animate upwards when the text field is selected
Get the rects of the text field being edited and the view that we 're going to scroll .
We convert everything to window coordinates , since they 're not necessarily in the same coordinate space .
- ( void ) textFieldDidBeginEditing : ( UIText Field * ) textField { CGRect textFieldRect = [ self .
view .
window convertRect : textField .
bounds fromView : textField ] ; CGRect viewRect = [ self .
view .
window convertRect : self .
view .
bounds fromView : self . view ] ;
So now we have the bounds , we need to calculate the fraction between the top and bottom of the middle section for the text field 's midline :
CGFloat midline = textFieldRect .
origin . y + 0.5 * textFieldRect . size .
height ; CGFloat numerator = midline - viewRect .
origin .
y - MINIMUM_SCROLL_FRACTION
* viewRect . size .
height ; CGFloat denominator = ( MAXIMUM_SCROLL_FRACTION
- MINIMUM_SCROLL_FRACTION
) * viewRect . size .
height ; CGFloat heightFraction = numerator / denominator ;
Clamp this fraction so that the top section is all " 0.0 " and the bottom section is all " 1.0 " .
if ( heightFraction < 0.0 ) { heightFraction = 0.0 ; } else if ( height Fraction > 1.0 ) { heightFraction = 1.0 ; }
Now take this fraction and convert it into an amount to scroll by multiplying by the keyboard height for the current screen orientation .
Notice the calls to floor so that we only scroll by whole pixel amounts .
UIInterfaceOrientation orientation = [ [ UIApplication sharedApplication ] statusBarOrientation ] ; if ( orientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait || orientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown ) { animatedDistance = floor ( PORTRAIT_KEYBOARD_HEIGHT
* heightFraction ) ; } else { animated Distance = floor ( LANDSCAPE_KEYBOARD_HEIGHT
* heightFraction ) ; }
Finally , apply the animation .
Note the use of setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentState : — this will allow a smooth transition to new text field if the user taps on another .
CGRect viewFrame = self .
view .
frame ; viewFrame .
origin .
y -= animatedDistance ; [ UIView beginAnimations : nil context : NULL ] ; [ UIView setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentState : YES ] ; [ UIView setAnimationDuration : KEYBOARD_ANIMATION_DURATION ] ; [ self .
view setFrame : viewFrame ] ; [ UIView commitAnimations ] ; }
Animate back again
The return animation is far simpler since we 've saved the amount to animate .
- ( void ) textFieldDidEndEditing : ( UIText Field * ) textField { CGRect viewFrame = self .
view .
frame ; viewFrame .
origin .
y += animatedDistance ; [ UIView beginAnimations : nil context : NULL ] ; [ UIView setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentState : YES ] ; [ UIView setAnimationDuration : KEYBOARD_ANIMATION_DURATION ] ; [ self .
view setFrame : viewFrame ] ; [ UIView commitAnimations ] ; }
Since we 're writing the delegate methods ...
This next method has nothing to do with animation but since we 're writing the delegate methods for a UIText Field , this is essential .
It dismisses the keyboard when the return / done button is pressed .
- ( BOOL ) textFieldShouldReturn : ( UIText Field * ) textField { [ text
Field resignFirstResponder ] ; return YES ; }
Result
For a window that looks like this :
Editing text fields in the top , middle and bottom sections will look like the following :
Notice in particular how the middle section remains in the middle of the visible area after the keyboard appears .
This is the primary benefit of the presented approach .
A University of Calgary archaeologist who is one of the few researchers in the world studying the material culture of human beings ' closest living relatives – the great apes – is joining his colleagues in creating a new discipline devoted to the history of tool use in all primate species in order to better understand human evolution .
Julio Mercader , holder of the Canada Research Chair in Tropical Archaeology in the U of C's Department of Archaeology , is a coauthor of a new paper titled " Primate archaeology " published recently in the journal Nature .
Mercader is one of 18 co-authors from universities including Cambridge , Rutgers , Kyoto University and schools in Spain , Italy and France .
They argue that recent discoveries of tool use by a wide variety of wild primates and archaeological evidence of chimpanzees using stone tools for thousands of years is forcing experts to re-think the traditional dividing lines between humans and other primate species as well as the belief that tool use is the exclusive domain of the genus Homo .
The researchers advocate for a new inter- disciplinary field of primate archaeology to examine tool use by primates in a long - term , evolutionary context .
" There is a need for systematic collaboration between diverse research programs to understand the broader questions in human evolution and primatology , " Mercader says .
" For example , few archaeologists have seen a wild primate use a tool , while few primatologists have taken part in archaeological excavations , " he explains .
Mercader was the lead author of a team that laid the foundations of the emerging discipline of chimpanzee archaeology in two previously - published papers in Science and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
He is the archaeologist who uncovered the first prehistoric evidence of chimpanzee technology in 2007 — a 4,300 - year - old nut - cracking site in the rainforests of Côte D'Ivoire , West Africa that provides proof of a long - standing chimpanzee " stone age " that likely emerged independently of influence from humans .
" It 's not clear whether we hominins invented this kind of stone technology , or whether both humans and the great apes inherited it from a common forebear , " says Mercader .
" We used to think that culture and , above anything else , technology was the exclusive domain of humans , but this is not the case .
We need comparable methods of data collection among researchers dealing with 2 million year old hominin sites and modern primatological assemblages . "
The official inauguration of the new field of primate archaeology marks the culmination of several years of work on the part of the handful of researchers including Mercader , who joined the U of C in 2002 with the support of the Canada Research Chairs program and the Canada Foundation for Innovation .
" This is truly at the vanguard of archaeology and I am so pleased these agencies and the University of Calgary had the vision seven years ago to be a part of creating a new discipline that is seeing its birth now , " Mercader says .
The paper is the result of the international symposium " Palaeoanthropology meets Primatology " held on Oct. 18 , 2008 at Cambridge .

August 22 , 2009 -- Marxsite --
Most people sympathetic to radical politics outside the United States have probably never heard of Ayn Rand , and a brief introduction to her ultra pro-free market views would doubtless be enough to convince them they have n’t missed anything .
Yet 27 years after her death , Ayn Rand continues to be seriously debated in the US , her books sell hundreds of thousands each year , her views are propagated by right wing think tanks and foundations and – bizarrely – Charlize Theron is in discussions to turn Rand ’s 1088 - page magnus opus Atlas Shrugged into a TV mini-series .
The Times Educational Supplement claimed in July that the Ayn Rand revival is gathering pace on US campuses .
According to the TES :
The surge in interest has also been propelled by the millions of dollars given to 25 universities by the charitable foundation of banking giant BB&T , run by one of her adherents .
But even this funding , handed out so institutions can teach and study Ms Rand and to establish centres for the advancement of American capitalism , has been controversial .
The faculty at Meredith College in North Carolina rejected a $ 420,000 ( £ 260,000 ) grant because it came on the condition that Ms Rand 's work be taught there , and there was a similar uproar at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte .
Even many of the professors who now teach Rand , Dr McCaskey said , " will preface their presentations with , ' I do n't agree with this , but you should hear it ' .
In her lifetime Rand strongly influenced Ronald Reagan , and long - time chair of the US Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan was part of her entourage as a young man and remained faithful to her views throughout his career ( catastrophically so as far as the US economy was concerned ) .
According to The Week magazine :
Rand attracted a group of disciples , known , with self - conscious irony , as the Collective ...
It was n’t just her ideas that inspired the group , it was Rand ’s charisma .
At the height of her popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s , Rand cut a highly exotic figure with her bobbed hair , Russian accent , dollar - sign brooches , and long cigarettes , smoked through a holder .
She saw smoking as a Promethean symbol of creativity and regarded health warnings as a socialist conspiracy .
When she died of lung cancer , in 1982 , a 6 - foot - high floral dollar sign was erected by her open coffin ( April 16 , 2009 ) .
Astonishingly , the advent of the world banking crisis has led to an upsurge in Ayn Rand book sales , with 300,000 copies of Atlas Shrugged sold last year , and in January 2009 it came in at number 33 in Amazon ’s top 100 US book sales .
The Ayn Rand Institute argued strongly against state money bailing out the banks , and unsurprisingly Randites have been to the forefront of opposing US President Barak Obama ’s rather mild plans to extend health - care insurance .
Ayn ( rhymes with mine ) Rand was the pseudonym of Alisa Zinov ' yevna Rosenbaum , an exile from Bolshevik Russia who stayed in the United States after a visit in 1926 .
She started off writing film scripts on anti-Soviet themes , and her links with the film industry enabled her to get her first major novel The Foutainhead turned into a 1949 film starring Gary Cooper , Patricia Neale and Raymond Massey .
A film about her love life , The Passion of Ayn Rand , was released in 1999 starring Helen Mirren as Rand and Peter Fonda as her long - suffering husband Frank O’Connor .
The same year she was even put on a US postage stamp .
Capitalist ideology
Rand propounded her views through her novels and a series of essays and interviews , but left no major single work outlining her political and social theory .
Her appeal and her cult status is based on two central ideas that chime in perfectly with key aspects of US capitalist ideology .
These are a ) self - interest , not altruism , is the highest moral value and as a guiding thread leads to the best outcomes , and b ) free - market capitalism is the system that leads to the best economic outcomes and allows the fullest development of individuals .
It spontaneously leads to the best possible outcomes for everyone – this a version of Adam Smith ’s ``hidden hand ’' .
Free -market capitalism in this version is a system where the only function of the state is to exercise the monopoly of the legitimate use of violence , preventing violence between individuals thus allowing business to develop uninterruptedly .
Nothing else – not healthcare , not the post office , not education of any type , not firefighting and rescue services , absolutely nothing whatsoever – is the business of the state .
This is ultra-privatisation on a scale probably never seen in the history of capitalism , a point made frequently by Rand herself , although she did n’t understand the significance of this fact .
That self - interest not altruism happens to serve the highest good ( though not any ``collective good ’' which Rand regarded as a meaningless concept ) is indeed a remarkably fortunate outcome for the many right - wing adherents of her ideas .
Just do what ’s good for yourself , do n’t care about anyone else , and lo and behold you happen to be doing the morally right thing as well !
Ayn Rand ’s writings reveal a consistent and utterly naive idea about wealth .
Wealth is created by the effort , intelligence and inventiveness of ``men ' ’ who are prepared to stand out from the crowd and be true to their own visions .
For her , capitalists , whom she regarded as a persecuted minority , are always self - made ``men ' ' ( she was utterly consistent in never using any other pronoun to describe clever people ) ; she did briefly discuss the issue of inheritance , but never acknowledged that power and wealth were due to class positions , rather than individual genius .
Once the simple fact that most rich people are rich because they come from rich families is established , Rand ’s whole system collapses .
The strivings of the talented against the holding back of the collectivist philistines is the theme of both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged .
The former ’s main protagonist , Frank Roark , is an architect who from the time he is a student fights back against attempts to throttle his individuality and make him conform to stylistic fashion and consensus .
In Atlas Shrugged , ``Atlas ' ' is the talented , the geniuses , the clever people who ``hold up the world ' ' ; their ``shrug '' is a worldwide strike organised by their international champion , the mysterious John Galt , who unusually for a modern novel makes a 60 - page speech explaining what is in effect Ayn Rand ’s philosophy .
Rand ’s time and context
Ayn Rand became famous through The Fountainhead in 1943 , and remained prominent until her death in 1982 , speaking at numerous meetings , notably the Ford Hall Forums in Boston and appearing on radio and television .
Her great ideological battle was against the mixed economy welfare state model of capitalism – Keynesianism – a battle waged by the US right during and immediately after the second world war .
She described a trinity of ideological opponents – altruism , collectivism and mysticism .
It was the latter that got her into trouble with many on the US right , then as now a Christian redoubt .
To give Ayn Rand her due , she loathed and detested religion as not based on reason ( obviously ) .
This led her into many battles with more mainstream conservatives , for example William F. Buckley , influential editor in the 1960s of the National Review and a key intellectual behind the extreme right - wing Republican candidate for the presidency in 1964 , Barry Goldwater .
Ayn Rand was vicious in her denunciation :
The good , say the mystics of spirit , is God , a being whose only definition is that he is beyond man 's power to conceive - a definition that invalidates man 's consciousness and nullifies his concepts of existence ...
Man 's mind , say the mystics of spirit , must be subordinated to the will of God ...
Man 's standard of value , say the mystics of spirit , is the pleasure of God , whose standards are beyond man 's power of comprehension and must be accepted on faith ....
The purpose of man 's life ... is to become an abject zombie who serves a purpose he does not know , for reasons he is not to question ( For the New Intellectual ) .
Rand also annoyed mainstream conservatives with her views on abortion :
An embryo has no rights .
Rights do not pertain to a potential , only to an actual being .
A child cannot acquire any rights until it is born .
The living take precedence over the not - yet - living ( or the unborn ) ….
Abortion is a moral right — which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved ; morally , nothing other than her wish in the matter is to be considered .
Who can conceivably have the right to dictate to her what disposition she is to make of the functions of her own body ? ”
Rand made many searing attacks on the anti-abortionists not because she saw herself as a feminist – she told a Ford House Forum that on feminism and the Equal Rights Amendment she “ disagreed with all that ” – but because she saw it as a matter of individual rights .
Philosophical individualism is the cornerstone of her system .
Basic fallacies
Ayn Rand ’s system is made possible by a series of fallacies which underpin her system .
As she herself said many times about her opponents , these errors are so glaring it ’s difficult to believe anyone would make them in good faith
Fallacy 1 – Wages under capitalism
In her essay Capitalism , the Unknown Ideal , Rand uses the following illustration of individual responsibility .
Imagine , she says , a “ little stenographer ” who spends all her money on lipstick and not microscopes .
Her choices are not irrational if her individual values accord lots of importance to lipstick .
However , if she later gets sick she may regret she did n’t allocate some money to ``microscopes ' ' -- here a metaphor for medical science and medical insurance .
If she does n’t have the health insurance it ’s her own fault .
This of course is bog - standard free - market nonsense .
The obvious fallacy is that any waged worker under capitalism could possibly earn enough to pay privately for every good and service they might need in a lifetime .
As capitalism evolved its neoliberal phase the amount of discretionary income workers have at their disposal has diminished .
In Britain privatisation of transport , gas , electricity , most forms of dentistry etc. has swallowed up workers ’ incomes so that , unlike in Ayn Rand ’s time , it needs two full - time workers to support a household – especially with the astronomic cost of housing .
The complete privatisation of healthcare would lead to millions of workers being unable to afford to have many therapies and treatments .
Just like in the United States where , as Michael Moore shows in Sicko , insured people are regularly ripped off by health insurance companies that specialise in not paying .
Fallacy 2 : The source of wealth is individual effort and talent
Ayn Rand ’s world , where the clever and industrious are the one ’s who reap the rewards , was always a major caricature , even in her own times .
In the neoliberal epoch dominated by finance capital it is ludicrous .
Finance capital takes a chunk of the money paid for most commodities in the form of rents , interest etc .
It ’s money that makes money , and that may involve second - order artfulness and gambling techniques , but it probably does not involve anything very clever , inventive or productive .
But even in the sphere of industrial capital Rand ’s ideas do n’t work .
The example of Carlos Slim , Mexico ’s richest man and two years ago listed as the richest man in the world , is highly indicative about the source of wealth today .
Slim got his $ 70 billion by owning Telmex , the Mexican telephone and communications giant .
He was given it by his close friend Carlos Salinas de Gortari , who as Mexican president in the 1980s oversaw the advent of neoliberalism and privatisation .
Rand ’s model assumes that corruption and the use of the state apparatus for personal enrichment does not exist .
But under capitalism it ’s endemic , because the economic power of the capitalists enables them to further enrich themselves through non-economic power techniques like corruption and violence .
Ayn Rand waxes lyrical over the clever , the industrious and those who create things .
But the people who make most things , whose billions of hours of labour make the world go round each day , are the workers – in industry , in services and on the land .
Rand has nothing but contempt for them .
Fallacy 3 : The state , class and society
Millions of people remember British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher ’s famous adage that “ there is no such thing as society , only individuals and their families ” .
This utterly shocking view , that there was no collective good , was highly damaging to Thatcher and the Tories .
But it was not an aberration – Ayn Rand said it first :
The tribal notion of the ``common good '' has served as the moral justification of most social systems – and of all tyrannies – in history ... The ``common good '' ( or ``public interest ' ' ) is an undefined and undefinable concept ; there is no such entity as ‘ the tribe ’ or ‘ the public ’ ; the tribe ( or the public or ``society ’ '' is only a number of individual men .
Nothing can be good for the tribe as such ; ``good '' and ``value '' pertain only to a living organism – to an individual living organism – not to a disembodied aggregate of relationships .
( What is Capitalism , p. 20 )
Even if we accept Rand ’s strange terminology and discuss the fate of tribes – for example Native Americans or pre-historic Europeans – it seems fairly obvious that the tribe as a collective had overall interests .
For example , it had the collective interest of finding somewhere with accessible food and water ; of not being massacred by white settlers ; of moving somewhere warmer with the advent of harsh winters ; of finding shelter ; of not being eaten by predators etc. etc .
This may seem a small and trivial example , but it goes to the heart of everything that is wrong with Ayn Rand thought .
It was in the interest of each individual member of the tribe to do all the above things .
But individuals could n’t do all of them on their own .
So they banded together in groups who produced and reproduced their existence by working together collectively , by collaborating .
( The social nature of humanity and the social nature of labour is of course the very basis of Marxist thought .
Collaboration for the common good is essential for virtually any type of society to work , including capitalism . )
Even under advanced capitalism there are many things that individuals and private companies either ca n’t or wo n’t do – or if they do they run into trouble because it ’s inherently unprofitable but socially necessary .
A classic case is the Channel tunnel linking the UK with Europe .
The investment needed was so vast it could n’t be recovered in fares and charges over any reasonable time to recoup investors ’ money .
So the company effectively went bust and was bailed out by governments .
Which shows that it should have been financed by the UK and French governments all along .
It is possible to argue that every road , bridge and museum should be built by private money for a profit , but then the system of tolls and charges would be so enormous and complex , that people would spend all day sorting out change and things would slow down in a major way .
But there is a more important issue , another one that goes to the heart of Ayn Randism .
If profit is the sole criterion of everything except the police and the army , then you radically limit the range of things that can and will be done .
You will sabotage the arts , education , social security and health – and the quality of life for millions of real individuals .
You will have massive unemployment , thousands of beggars on the streets and social explosions so vast that spending on the repressive apparatuses would skyrocket to repress the consequent riots and uprisings .
Capitalism has always needed the state , indeed capitalism was brought into existence in the mercantilist period under the aegis and protection of the state .
So long as capitalism subsists there will be a permanent battle about the priorities of the state , especially state spending .
As a rule of thumb , the higher state spending the lower the level of poverty .
A linked blind spot for Rand is class .
The capitalist class , the working class and the petty bourgeoisie ( middle class ) are absent actors from her texts .
Since there is no such thing as society , other ``disembodied aggregates '’ like social classes as disallowed too .
Rand ’s individualism is sustained by ignoring real collectives .
Fallacy 4 : social solidarity and individual recognition
Rand saved some of her most persistent vitriol for ``altruism '' .
This issue divided her from many conservative contemporaries who at least saw charities and some state health and welfare spending as necessary .
The sea of altruism – and the unworthy and lazy claiming the wealth of the creative and industrious through taxes to fund social spending – was rotting the moral fibre of the United States and preventing the adequate recognition of the worth of ``Atlas ' ' -- the talented and vigorous whose achievements ``hold up the world ' ' .
Marxists however do not advocate altruism – being generous to the less fortunate in the manner of well - meaning aristocrats – but social solidarity .
This proposes that people work for the common good , sure , but not only for that .
Even in an egalitarian , collectivist society , the question of the recognition of individual achievement would be an important one .
The need for recognition , for positive feedback from peers , to have personal qualities of skill , hard work and inventiveness recognised by others is something built into human beings , part of ``human nature '' if you want .
And it is clearly part of the motivation for the activity of billions of human beings .
The esteem of others is always part of the self - esteem that everyone needs .
Recognition and esteem for individuals is not counterposed to social solidarity or collectivism .
Ayn Rand ’s vision of this , perhaps best explained in her dystopian novel Anthem , is that collectivism leads to the obliteration of individual recognition and individual personality – even individual names are replaced by numbers .
This is a 1984 - style vision of Stalinist totalitarianism , the kind of thing that is being wheeled out to oppose Obama ’s health reforms , revealing the deeply paranoid style of the US right .
The question is not whether individual talent and achievement shoul be recognised , but whether hugely disproportionate financial rewards should accrue to those who make major contributions .
Fallacy 5 : The capitalist free market equals freedom
According to Ayn Rand , freedom means only one thing – freedom from the threat of physical violence , and it is the role of the state to ensure that freedom .
Everything else is a matter of contract – agreements freely drawn up between individuals on the basis of legal equality ( Rand was a true daughter of John Locke ) .
This is an entirely restricted view of freedom , of course .
Real freedom is the freedom to develop your own individuality and creativity on the basis of freedom from hunger , from poverty , from disease , from exploitation , from intimidation – and from the permanent exhaustion imposed by capitalist work regimes .
( It is no accident that the centre of modern capitalist work regime methods , the United States , is the sleep deprivation capital of the world . )
People do not confront one another in the market place on the basis of freedom and equality , but on the basis of deep structural inequalities – of class , race and gender .
They do not have equal access to education , and as a result the education system in modern capitalist states tends to spontaneously reproduce existing structural inequalities .
Social mobility is slowing down , not speeding up .
The overwhelming majority will remain in the social class into which they were born .
Karl Marx said that being rich meant being rich in free time , which is what most full - time workers ca n’t get .
The free marketeers point that nobody is ``forced '' to do a particular job is trivial and puerile .
Yes , you have the right to be destitute ; otherwise for most people it means having a full - time job , which for most people means an end to freedom .
Objectivism – the vacant heart of Ayn Rand thought
As befitting a cult guru , Ayn Rand topped off her system with a quack philosophy which she called ``Objectivism ' ' .
This says that a ) ``Existence exists '' ; b)
People should be guided by reason and not religious faith ( mysticism ) : reason is the method in which information from the senses is integrated and synthesised ; c ) Reason determines that individualism , not altruism , shows the right way to live ; and d) Each ``man '' must determine their own ``values '' on the basis of reason , but these values are contingent on time and circumstances , except that they must be conditioned by c ) .
The real problem which this system is the lack of any determination about what ``values '' might be , except the dogma about individualism .
Lacking any secure concepts about history or society , lacking any engagement with Freud which might have yielded up something about individual motivation , it really says ``use your reason to determine your own best interests ' ' .
Rand adds an ontology , which is peripheral to her system , but is as it happens completely wrong .
She says contradiction in reality cannot exist : A = A .
A thing is what it is and nothing else .
This of course is a radical rejection of dialectical thinking that sees phenomena not as things in themselves , but in the process of their development and in the light of their interconnections with other phenomena .
It is this dynamic view of phenomena which enables Marxists to understand that everything – including capitalism fortunately – has a beginning and an end .
The cult of Ayn Rand
For a lot of people the success of cults – like Scientology for example – seems a mystery .
How did Scientology manage to recruit all those Hollywood stars ?
It is less of a mystery when you realise that Scientology is really a self - improvement system .
On the basis of mumbo jumbo , it aims to convince you that you are the centre of the universe , you can do anything , you must concentrate all your energy on being successful .
Thus with Ayn Rand thought .
Individuals must be morally comfortable with unbridled self - interest , and use reason to think through the ways they can be most successful .
This is deeply appealing because it links in with the great US myth – anyone can make it , on the basis of hard work , creativity , intelligence .
It ’s all up to you : individual and not collective solutions are the key .
All these systems fall on one central point .
Stephen R. Covey says in his multimillion selling Seven Habits of Highly Effective People , “ Highly effective people make their own world ” .
Covey is incapable of seeing that making our own world is just not available to the vast majority of the world ’s population .
How does a poor women in an Indian village make her own world ?
Or a peasant in a Mexican village ?
Or a Russian factory worker ?
The realities of class , of power and wealth – the deep structures of capitalism – prevent the vast majority of people exercising the kind of autonomy necessary to make real choices .
Capitalism does not make people free .
It enslaves people .
Appendix : the world according to Ayn Rand
The New Left
" If concern with poverty and human suffering were the collectivists ’ motive , they would have become champions of capitalism long ago ; they would have discovered that it is the only political system capable of producing abundance .
But they evaded the evidence as long as they could .
When the issue became overwhelmingly clear to the whole world , the collectivists were faced with a choice : either turn to the right , in the name of humanity — or to the left , in the name of dictatorial power .
They turned to the left — the New Left .
Instead of their old promises that collectivism would create universal abundance and their denunciations of capitalism for creating poverty , they are now denouncing capitalism for creating abundance .
Instead of promising comfort and security for everyone , they are now denouncing people for being comfortable and secure . "
Return of the Primitive
" Old - line Marxists claimed [ falsely ] that they were champions of reason , that socialism or communism was a scientific social system , that an advanced technology could not function in a capitalist society , but required a scientifically planned and organized human community to bring its maximum benefits to every man , in the form of material comforts and a higher standard of living .... [ T ] oday we see the spectacle of old Marxists blessing , aiding and abetting the young hoodlums [ of the New Left ] ( who are their products and heirs ) who proclaim the superiority of feelings over reason , of faith over knowledge , of leisure over production , of spiritual concerns over material comforts , of primitive nature over technology , of astrology over science , of drugs over consciousness . "
Fascism and communism
`` Fascism and communism are not two opposites , but two rival gangs fighting over the same territory ... both are variants of statism , based on the collectivist principle that man is the rightless slave of the state . ''
Lipstick and microscopes
``A microscope is of no value to a little stenographer struggling to make a living ; a lipstick is ; a lipstick , to her , may mean the difference between self - confidence and self - doubt , between glamour and drudgery .
`` This does not mean , however , that the values ruling a free market are subjective .
If the stenographer spends all her money on cosmetics and has none left to pay for the use of a microscope ( for a visit to the doctor ) when she needs it , she learns a better method of budgeting her income ; the free market serves as her teacher : she has no way to penalize others for her mistakes .
If she budgets rationally , the microscope is always available to serve her own specific needs and no more , as far as she is concerned : she is not taxed to support an entire hospital , a research laboratory , or a space ship ’s journey to the moon .
Within her own productive power , she does pay a part of the cost of scientific achievements , when and as she needs them . ''
Conservatives
``Objectivists are not `conservatives . '
We are radicals for capitalism ; we are fighting for that philosophical base which capitalism did not have and without which it was doomed to perish ...
``Today ’s culture is dominated by the philosophy of mysticism ( irrationalism ) — altruism — collectivism , the base from which only statism can be derived ; the statists ( of any brand : communist , fascist or welfare ) are merely cashing in on it — while the `conservatives ' are scurrying to ride on the enemy ’s premises and , somehow , to achieve political freedom by stealth .
It ca n’t be done . ''
Collectivism
``Collectivism holds that the individual has no rights , that his life and work belong to the group ... and that the group may sacrifice him at its own whim to its own interests .
The only way to implement a doctrine of that kind is by means of brute force — and statism has always been the political corollary of collectivism . '' – The Virtue of Selfishnesss , p. 128
Altruism
`` What is the moral code of altruism ?
The basic principle of altruism is that man has no right to exist for his own sake , that service to others is the only justification of his existence , and that self - sacrifice is his highest moral duty , virtue and value .
`` Do not confuse altruism with kindness , good will or respect for the rights of others .
These are not primaries , but consequences , which , in fact , altruism makes impossible .
The irreducible primary of altruism , the basic absolute , is self - sacrifice — which means ; self - immolation , self - abnegation , self - denial , self - destruction — which means : the self as a standard of evil , the selfless as a standard of the good .
`` Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beggar .
That is not the issue .
The issue is whether you do or do not have the right to exist without giving him that dime .
The issue is whether you must keep buying your life , dime by dime , from any beggar who might choose to approach you .
The issue is whether the need of others is the first mortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence .
The issue is whether man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal .
Any man of self - esteem will answer : ` No . '
Altruism says : ` Yes . '''
Contradiction
``A contradiction cannot exist .
An atom is itself , and so is the universe ; neither can contradict its own identity ; nor can a part contradict the whole .
No concept man forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction into the total sum of his knowledge .
To arrive at a contradiction is to confess an error in one ’s thinking ; to maintain a contradiction is to abdicate one ’s mind and to evict oneself from the realm of reality . ''
– Speech by ‘ John Galt ’ , For the New Intellectual .
Free market
`` In a free economy , where no man or group of men can use physical coercion against anyone , economic power can be achieved only by voluntary means : by the voluntary choice and agreement of all those who participate in the process of production and trade .
In a free market , all prices , wages , and profits are determined — not by the arbitrary whim of the rich or of the poor , not by anyone ’s `greed ' or by anyone ’s need — but by the law of supply and demand .
The mechanism of a free market reflects and sums up all the economic choices and decisions made by all the participants .
Men trade their goods or services by mutual consent to mutual advantage , according to their own independent , uncoerced judgment .
A man can grow rich only if he is able to offer better values — better products or services , at a lower price — than others are able to offer . ''
[ Phil Hearse is a activist in the British socialist organisation Socialist Resistance , which publishes a newspaper of the same name .
This article first appeared at Hearse 's web site Marxsite . ]
Israeli troops were repeatedly encouraged by officers to prioritise their own safety over that of Palestinian civilians when they embarked on the ground invasion of Gaza in January , according to the first direct testimonies of soldiers who served in the operation .
The picture that emerges from the testimonies , which have been seen by The Independent , is one of massive fire power to cover advances and rules of engagement that were calculated to ensure , in the words attributed to one battalion commander , that " not a hair will fall of a soldier of mine .
I am not willing to allow a soldier of mine to risk himself by hesitating .
If you are not sure , shoot . "
The first eye - witness accounts of the war by serving Israeli reservists and conscripts describes the Israeli use of Palestinian civilians as " human shields " .
They detail the killing of at least two civilians , the vandalism , looting and wholesale destruction of Palestinian houses , the use of deadly white phosphorus , bellicose religious advice from army rabbis and what another battalion commander described to his troops as " insane firepower with artillery and air force " .
The reports amount to the most formidable challenge by Israelis since the Gaza war to the military 's own considered view that it conducted the operation according to international law and made " an enormous effort to focus its fire only against the terrorists whilst doing the utmost to avoid harming uninvolved civilians " .

They are contained in testimonies from about 30 soldiers that were collected by Breaking the Silence , an army veterans organisation that seeks to " expose the Israeli public to the routine situations of everyday life in the occupied territories " .
Although the organisation has collected hundreds of testimonies from ex-soldiers before , this is the first time that it has done so from serving soldiers so soon after the events they describe .
They tell how :
* Unprecedentedly loose rules of engagement were put in place to protect Israeli troops .
One soldier said his brigade commander and other officers made it clear that " any movement must entail gunfire " .
He added : " I do n't remember if the brigade commander said this or someone else .
I' m not sure .
No one is supposed to be there .
If you see any signs of movement at all , you shoot .
These , essentially , were the rules of engagement .
Shoot if you like if you are afraid or you see someone , shoot . "
Another soldier said his battalion commander had said the operation was not " a limited confrontation such as in Hebron , and not to hesitate if we suspected someone nor feel bad about destruction because it is all done for the safety of our own soldiers ... if we see something suspect and shoot , better hit an innocent than hesitate to target an enemy " .
One soldier said the " awareness of each soldier going in is simply ... a light finger on the trigger .
You see something and you 're not quite sure ?
You shoot " .
* Houses were systematically demolished .
Despite official accounts that homes were only destroyed for strictly " operational " reasons , one reservist , a veteran of the conflict in Gaza since before 2005 , said " I never knew such fire power " used by tanks and helicopters for the " constant destruction " of houses .
The soldier said that some houses had been destroyed for normal operational reasons , such as because they had been booby trapped or used by militants to fire from , or had contained tunnel openings .
But he said others were destroyed for the " day after " – to make a " very large " area " sterile " , to allow better " firing capacity , good visibility and control " once the operation was over .
This meant , demolishing houses " not implicated in any way , whose single sin is that it is situated on a hill in the Gaza strip " .
* A civilian man between 50 and 60 who was unarmed but carrying a torch was shot dead after the unit 's commander ordered his soldiers not to fire warning shots but to hold their fire until he was 50 m away .
The soldier said the company commander announced over the radio after the incident : " Here 's an opener for tonight " .
The soldier said that the commander was challenged over why he had not authorised deterrent fire when the man was further away : " He did n't agree and could n't give a damn , and finally the guys felt that even if they could take this up with the higher echelons it would n't be effective . "
Another soldier said his unit commander shot dead an old man hiding with his family under the stairs of a house .
While the soldier said that the killing of the man was a mistake , it had happened as the unit entered the house using live fire .
* Palestinian human shields – or " johnnies " as they were termed by soldiers on the ground – were suborned to enter surrounded houses ahead of troops , including houses known to contain armed militants .
One account corroborates the story of one such human shield that was exposed in The Independent , that of Majdi Abed Rabbo in Jabalya in northern Gaza , who was ordered three times to enter a house to report on the condition of three armed Hamas militants inside .
* Military rabbis prepared troops for battle .
One soldier said an army rabbi had " aimed at inspiring the men with courage , cruelty aggressiveness , expressions as ' no pity .
God protects you .
Everything you do is sanctified '... there were specific scenarios discussed ... but from the context it was pretty obvious he came to tell us how aggressive and determined we need to be , that we must win because this is a holy war " .
Leaflets distributed at military synagogues had stated that " the Palestinians are like the Philistines of old , newcomers who do not belong in the land , aliens planted on the soil which should clearly return to us " .
* Mortars – rarely if ever used in Gaza before – were widely deployed .
They included 120 mm mortars of the sort that killed up to 40 civilians outside the UN el - Fakhoura school in Jabalya which was being used as a shelter , and in a nearby house .
One soldier explained that while " with light arms you 've got an 80 per cent chance of hitting the target with your first shot , with mortars it is much less " .
Another said : " I finally understood .
We were firing at launcher crews in open spaces .
But it did n't take much to aim at schools , hospitals and such .
So I see I 'm firing literally into a built - up area .
I do n't know to what degree it was still inhabited because the army made considerable attempts to get people to leave .
But I understand that ... [ tails off ] . "

The testimonies appear to reinforce evidence from Human Rights Watch , Amnesty International and journalists who visited battle zones just after the war in January that white phosphorus was used for purposes other than " marking " , " range - finding " and " smoke screening " .
Those purposes included to ignite homes suspected of being booby trapped .
Houses that troops occupied were vandalised .
One testimony stated : " One of the soldiers ... opened the child 's bag ... he took out notebooks and ripped them .
One guy smashed cupboards for kicks out of boredom .
There were guys arguing with the platoon commander before we left the house why he would n't let them smash the picture hanging there ... "
A reservist soldier said that there was a " big difference between the way we treated the contents of the house and the way the regulars did .
The regulars would n't take care even of the most basic sanitary stuff like going to the toilet , basic hygiene .
I mean you could see that they had defecated anywhere and left the stuff lying round " .
A spokeswoman for the Israeli Defence Forces ( IDF ) , Lieutenant - Colonel Avital Leibovitz , sought to challenge the motives and credibility of the report .
She said " more than a dozen " military police investigations were under way into incidents that took place during Operation Cast Lead .
While the IDF continued to operate according to " uncompromising ethical values " , it was ready to investigate allegations of misconduct but not on the basis of anonymous testimonies which she could not be sure were from soldiers .
The Israeli human rights lawyer Michael Sfard said the report showed that the Gaza operation violated the " number one principle in international laws of war " : that of distinguishing between the civilian population and combatants .
Yehuda Shaul , a founder of Breaking the Silence , said the group had names and details for all the testimonies – all of which had been taped – and that anonymity was to protect the testifiers from any disciplinary or criminal proceedings .
The army already knew the name of at least one , he said .
Gaza invasion : Witnesses on the front line
On military briefings ahead of the invasion
" We talked about practical matters ... but the basic approach to war was very brutal , that was my impression ...
He said something along the lines of ' do n't let morality become an issue .
That will come up later ' .
He had this strange language : ' Leave the nightmares and horrors that will come up for later , now just shoot '...
The basic approach was that there were no chances taken .
If you face an area that is hidden by a building , you take down the building .
Questions such as ' who lives in the building ? ' are not asked . "
On problems with identifying targets for bombing
" It got to the point where we would try to report to field intelligence about a figure sticking out its head or a rocket being launched , and the girl [ at field intelligence ] would ask , ' Is it near this or that house ? '
We 'd look at the aerial photo and say , ' Yes , but the house is no longer there ' .
' Wait , is it facing a square ? '
' No more square .'...
Later I went in to the look - out war - room and asked how things worked , and the girl - soldiers there , the look - outs , resented the fact that they had no way to direct the planes , because all their reference points were razed ...
It 's highly possible that now the pilot will bomb the wrong house . "
On the rules of engagement
" [ The Brigade commander ] went so far as to say this was war and in war , no consideration of civilians was to be taken .
You shoot anyone you see .
I 'm paraphrasing here , not literally quoting , but the gist of the matter was very clear . "
On the rabbinate 's role in the conflict
" The rabbi said we are actually conducting the war of ' the sons of light ' against ' the sons of darkness ' .
This is in fact a statement with highly messianic language ...
It turns the other side as a generality into ' sons of darkness ' while we become ' sons of light ' .
There is no differentiation which we would expect to find between civilians and others .
Here is one people fighting another people , with all the messianic implications .
But that 's the point : this is also religious propaganda .
In other words , the army is not a revival meeting .
They do not put on a uniform in order to be Judaized . "
On soldiers ' responsibility
" Anything we did there , we 'd answer ourselves : there 's no other choice , but this is how we shirk our responsibility .
You bring yourself to this kind of deterministic situation , a moment that I have not chosen , where I no longer have any responsibility for my own actions .
Even if your choice is the right one , you must admit you chose it .
You have to admit you chose to go into Gaza .
As soon as you did , you 've brought people into a moral twilight zone , you 've forced them to handle dilemmas and part of that confrontation failed .
As soon as you say ' there is no other choice ' , you 're shirking your responsibility .
Then you do n't need to investigate , to look into things . "

U.S sales of video game hardware and software fell 31 % to $ 1.17 billion in June , Reuters reports , citing a study by NPD Group Inc .
The drop is the biggest since 2000 .
Sales of game software fell 29 % to $ 625.8 million , while hardware sales dropped 38 % to $ 382.6 million .
Sales of accessories declined 22 % .
Reuters : Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter blamed the decline in part on the high cost of video game consoles .
" The consumer is just not buying hardware at these prices ... clearly the consumer is just waiting for price cuts , " said Pachter , who expects industry sales to pick up in September with the release of new high - profile titles .
Indeed , it seems the higher - priced a console , the more its sales dropped last quarter .
Sales of Sony's ( SNE ) PS3 , the most expensive console at $ 399 dropped 59 % , and Nintendo 's Wii at $ 249 dropped 46 % .
Meanwhile , sales of Microsoft's ( MSFT ) cheaper , $ 199 Xbox 360 actually grew by 9.5 % .
While support for native video and audio has been dropped from the HTML 5 specification after cross - browser compatibility concerns and squabbling between big companies , plugin - free 3D acceleration still looks like a goer - at least , according to the Khronos Group .
As reported over on Electronista , the non-profit standards consortium has revealed a few details about its up - coming WebGL 3D acceleration standard - and it's turning into something that should please gamers no end .
The general principle behind WebGL is to offer a JavaScript binding to the group 's OpenGL ES 2.0 system , allowing code run within the browser to access the graphics hardware directly in the same way as a standalone application can .
As the technology would rely solely on JavaScript to do the heavy lifting , no browser plugin would be required - and it would be compatible with any browser which supports the scripting language alongside the HTML 5 ' Canvas ' element .
While there are obvious applications for the technology in web - based gaming , the system offers more than that : a high - quality , fast 3D rendering engine which can operate entirely within the browser could lead to far more impressive interfaces to websites , for instance - and possibly even threaten Adobe 's Flash technology as the " make my site pretty " standard .
The WebGL specification - which the Khronos group will be offering royalty - free - has some pretty heavy industry backing , too : the current working group includes graphics giants AMD and Nvidia , along with browser specialists Mozilla and Opera , and mobile manufacturer Ericsson .
Google is also a part of the group , pledging support within its Chrome browser for the new standard .
The WebGL technology is due for a public release some time in the first half of next year , with support in both Firefox and Chrome expected - presumably to be followed by alternative browsers once the system has seen enough demand .
Does WebGL sound like your dreams come true , or are you frightened by the thought that all those hideous Flash - only marketing pages will now have access to 3D acceleration ?

I wo n't put a cap on immigration vows the Home Secretary
Home Secretary Alan Johnson last night refused point blank to cap the number of immigrants coming to Britain .
And he said he does not ' lie awake at night ' worrying about the population hitting 70 million .
Official figures show at the current rate of increase the British population will hit the milestone within 20 years , with a further seven million immigrants placing a burden on public services .
Alan Johnson refused to cap the number of immigrants , but Immigration Minister Phil Woolas ( right ) has pledged the population will not grow to 70 million
Immigration Minister Phil Woolas has pledged that the Government will not allow the population to grow to that level .
But last night he was apparently undermined by his boss .
Speaking at the Home Affairs Select Committee , Mr Johnson said he would not bring in a cap because it would harm the economy , claiming the argument that immigration had made a contribution to the economy was ' irrefutable ' .
' I do not lie awake at night worrying about a population of 70 million , ' he told the cross-party group of MPs .
' I 'm happy to live in a multi-cultural society .
I 'm happy to live in a society where we not only welcome those coming to live and work in this country , but also where we can go and live and work in other countries . '
The Home Secretary did acknowledge the recession has made it more difficult for ministers to convince British workers who have lost their jobs that immigration is beneficial .
But his argument goes against evidence that the vast majority of jobs created in the private sector have gone to immigrants - meaning local workers have failed to feel the benefits .
In recent years , Labour has tried to head off the rise of the British National Party by giving the impression that it is talking tough on immigration .
The BNP won two seats in the European Parliament last month after it exploited fears in Labour 's white working class heartlands , taking tens of thousands of votes from the governing party .
In 2007 , Prime Minister Gordon Brown made his now infamous ' British Jobs for British Workers ' speech at the Labour party conference .
But the slogan has come back to haunt him - in particular during the dispute over the use of imported labour at the Total oil refinery in North Lincolnshire earlier this year .
A poll earlier this week found one in four Britons would like to see the population reduced by up to a third to ease overcrowding .
Seven out of ten said the best way to curb population growth was to cut immigration .
The population stands at around 61 million .
If it hits 70 million , with seven million immigrants making up most of the rise - it is the equivalent of adding the population of Sweden in just two decades , almost all of it in England .
Earlier this week campaign group MigrationWatch UK warned the balance of those settling in the country would have to be reduced to 50,000 from the current level of 237,000 every year .
The Government 's points - based system is likely to cut immigrant numbers by around 8 per cent to 217,000 .
Tory immigration policies are likely to bring about a drop of 27 per cent to 172,000 .
Last night MigrationWatch director Sir Andrew Green said : ' No wonder the political class is in such disrepute .
' Here is a new Home Secretary immediately riding roughshod over public opinion that is hugely opposed to the mass immigration which this Government is encouraging .
' For a start , how is a government that is broke going to pay for all the houses , schools and hospitals that an extra seven million immigrants will need in the next 20 years ? '
Former Labour Minister Frank Field , who runs a cross-party group called Balanced Migration , which campaigns to limit the number of immigrants to manageable levels , was dismissive of the Home Secretary 's claims not to lie awake at night .
He said : ' It must be a misquote because it should be . '

Frederick
Wood was sentenced to more than three years in prison
A Seattle man was sentenced to more than three years in prison Tuesday for using the Limewire file - sharing service to lift personal information from computers across the U.S .
The case highlights a type of identity theft that is probably more common than most people realize , said Kathryn Warma , assistant U.S. attorney in the Computer Hacking and Internet Crimes Unit of the U.S. Attorney 's Office .
The man , Frederick Wood , typed words like " tax return " and " account " into the Limewire search box , Warma said .
That allowed him to find and access computers on the Limewire network with shared folders that contained tax returns and bank account information .
Wood also searched specifically for forms that parents fill out to apply for college financial aid for their children , which include " exhaustive personal and financial information about the family , " Warma said .
He used the information to open accounts , create identification cards and make purchases .
" Many of the victims are parents who do n't realize that Limewire is on their home computer , " she said .
Wood was initially apprehended while executing an even more low - tech crime , the Attorney 's Office said .
He advertised an Apple computer for sale on Craigslist , and a Seattle resident responded to the ad and met Wood at a coffee shop to buy the computer .
After paying for the computer with a check and leaving the coffee shop , the man discovered that there was no computer in the box , only a book and a vase .
The victim helped police set up a similar deal with Wood , who was arrested when he handed over another computer box with no computer in it , this time to a police officer , the Attorney 's Office said .
Police later searched a computer they found in Wood 's car and discovered tax returns , bank statements and cancelled checks stolen from more than 120 people across the country .
He had also used the information retrieved through Limewire to make forged checks .
He used those checks to buy electronics gear , some of which he sold on Craigslist , said the Attorney 's Office .
Warma 's advice to people who want to avoid becoming victims of this kind of identity theft was to " get Limewire off your computers . "
Even the added security features in the most recent version can be circumvented , she said .
" I think it 's a horrible idea for people to have peer - to - peer software on their computers unless they 're a very sophisticated user , " she said .
During the investigation the authorities discovered that Wood was an associate of Gregory Kopiloff , the first person in the U.S. to be indicted for using file - sharing programs to steal personal information .
He was sentenced in early 2008 to more than four years in prison for fraud .
Wood was sentenced Tuesday to 39 months in prison and three years of supervised release for wire fraud , accessing a protected computer without authorization to commit fraud , and aggravated identity theft .
He was tried in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington .
Warma believes Wood and Kopiloff are the only two people to be convicted so far for using peer - to - peer networks to steal personal information .
In addition , nervousness on the part of major dollar holders could pressure the greenback and lead to a very worrying 2010 , Walter said .
Norbert said recently in research notes “ the world is in trouble . ”
“ I believe that the rescue packages brought on have been so costly for so many governments that the exit from this fiscal policy will be very painful , very painful indeed , ” he said .
“ Some of us are already talking about a W - shaped recovery .
I ’d probably talk about a triple - U - shaped recovery because there are so many stumbling blocks here to get out of this . ”
“ There are a few countries that have not dismissed people , they had a dramatic drop in their sales but they kept on people because they believed the recession would be very shallow , ” Walter said .
“ They now have to fire people .
That will increase unemployment and they therefore , of course , may be endangering retail sales in some countries . ”
If Australia hikes rates in September or October , markets “ will certainly shiver ” and cause zig - zagging at the bottom of the recession , Walter said .
In a historic change , noncelibate gays and lesbians can now lead parishes of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ( ELCA ) .
On a 559 - 451 vote taken Friday in Minneapolis at their biennial conference , delegates repealed the ELCA ban on gay clergy unless they agree to remain celibate .
It makes ELCA , with 4.8 million members nationwide and 830,000 in Minnesota , the largest denomination in the country to welcome gays into the pulpits without restriction .
The vote did not surprise Ryan Schwarz from Washington , a member of Lutheran CORE , a group that opposed the motion .
Nor did it dampen his interest in running for vice president , the highest lay position within the ELCA .
That vote will be taken today .
" I remain a candidate , " he said emphatically as he left the convention hall .
" We knew coming into this that we 'd probably lose , but I plan to speak out in my speech [ today ] about how the leadership has failed this assembly . "
As for Javen Swanson , the vote clarified a future that had been highly in doubt .
" The vote determined whether or not I was going to be able to continue through the ordination process , " said the St. Paul resident , a seminarian who recently wed his same - sex partner in Connecticut .
" It was incredibly emotional .
The weight of the decisions being made was palpable . "
The new rules , which likely will go into effect in November , allow the installation of gay pastors but let individual congregations and synods make their own decisions about whether to choose a gay pastor .
Reaction to the vote was muted by design .
Bishop Mark Hanson , the Minneapolis native who leads the ELCA , warned before the vote was taken that he wanted no overt reaction .
Instead , the voters immediately went into prayer .
When they finished , there was a rustle of discrete hugging and some wiping of tears in the visitors ' gallery , but the delegates quickly returned to business .
No real surprise
RAMSDELL , MO — A suicide note left by a local man demonstrated a remarkably poor understanding of syntax and grammar , according to authorities .
RAMSDELL , MO — A suicide note left by a local man demonstrated a remarkably poor understanding of syntax and grammar , according to authorities .
The single - sentence , handwritten note , found next to the man ’s charred remains , conveyed a perplexing farewell message : “ sumbuddy plez com fer help me wit liteing ferness . ”
Police identified the victim as Harvey Telassendry , 38 , a warehouse trainee for Goodwill Industries .
Investigators are still unsure of the manner in which Telassendry took his life , but Detective James Bannerhaus said the suicide note was a sad commentary on our education system .
“ Most people this dumb have trouble navigating through society , ” said Bannerhaus .
“ How this guy managed to finish high school and lead a productive , full - functioning life is beyond me . ”
Telassendry ’s high school teacher expressed her embarrassment upon reading the badly written missive .
“ It ’s disheartening that one of my former students would draft a letter with such lack of conciseness and coherency , ” admitted Arlene Nelson , who has taught special education classes for more than twenty years .
“ Had I been aware of his difficulty in forming a simple , cohesive sentence , I never would have let him graduate . ”
Despite the shock at Tellasandry ’s lack of proficiency in literary composition , Nelson said there are positive lessons to be learned from the ordeal
“ The next time a student asks me if ‘ spelling counts , ’ ” she said , “ I will remind them of the suicide of Mr. Telassendry , and how – because of his indecipherable message — we ’ll never know why he did it . ”

It may be hard to believe , but there once was a time when Neoliberal Globalized Corporate Capitalism ( NGCC ) was n’t the only economic model around–and even a time when NGCC did n’t even exist !
Our current era may seem like the “ end of history ” to some observers , but the fact of the matter is that economics is n’t an end in and of itself , but a means to the end of material comfort and prosperity .
When the social , technological , and environmental rules change , economic models change , too , taking advantage of new ways to achieve this goal .
The three possible economic models I suggested last week , and explore in a bit more detail below , should be considered speculations on what the world will look like in the coming decades as the emerging changes to environment , society , and technology take hold .
As before , I look forward to hearing your suggestions and alternatives .
One note before I start : if you ’ve read my stuff over the years , you might be surprised that none of the three future economic models are explicitly sustainability - focused .
That ’s because they all are –that is , environmental sustainability is intrinsic to all three of these models , as it will be intrinsic to whatever economic structures function successfully this century .
As the next few decades unfold , any economic behavior that does n’t take sustainability into account will fail .
These items are written in scenario form : call it the “ anticipatory future . ”
Resilience Economics Resilience Economics employs a mix of regulations and norms ( i.e. , non-regulated but expected behavior ) to shift standard business processes away from a focus on efficiency towards a focus on flexibility .
Resilience Economics ( RE ) emerged out of the realization that Neoliberal Globalized Corporate Capitalism made money hand - over - fist when everything was working right , but was like a rapidly - spinning top–seemingly stable , but if it hit too rough a patch , it went wildly out of control .
The RE world , conversely , is less - lucrative during growth periods , but weathers downturns so well that most folks do n’t even notice when “ recessions ” hit .
advertisement
Proponents of NGCC dismissed RE as unable to compete with the 20th century way of making money , and that appeared to be correct up until the Great Retreat of 2017 hit , the downturn that made the 2008 - 2010 recession pale in comparison .
Ironically , most folks figure that it was because we did n’t fix the problems in the first real 21st century recession , just offered bailouts and slaps on the wrist , that we got hit by the Great Retreat a decade later .
Three key characteristics of Resilience Economics shape the way we live : Polyculture markets means that no one economic ( or financial ) institution ever gets “ too big to fail , ” or so big that it distorts markets the way WalMart used to .
This was probably the most politically controversial set of rule changes , but the least visible for most everyday people .
Transactional Transparency upset some politicians and executives , too , but really worked to smooth out markets .
All along , economists said that capitalism depends on transparent markets , where buyers and sellers know all the relevant details , but that was always the one aspect of capitalism that most “ capitalists ” ignored .
Collaborative Flexibility , aka the “ Lego Economy . ”
The result of the previous two characteristics , really .
Lots of small companies , individual entrepreneurs , even part - time workers able to come together as necessary for big projects .
Is it perfect ?
No .
It ’s noticeably less efficient than the 20th century model , and a lot of older folks say that they do n’t feel as “ rich ” as they did a few decades ago , but it ’s hard to say how much of that is from RE , and how much is just that we ’re all trying to deal with adapting to a global environmental crisis .
advertisement
Just - in - Time Socialism Just - in - Time Socialism takes advantage of the increased power of digital information systems to provide much more effective demand projection and cost transparency , using just - in - time production and delivery systems to make an evolved form of socialism work .
While the U.S. went for Resilience Economics in the wake of the Great Retreat , Japan took a different path .
Two developments allowed Japan to try something radical–well , two developments plus a population already accustomed to heavy automation and a fledgling government desperate to push Japan in a new direction .
Of the two new technologies , the most visibly critical was the development of the Aoki-Marr Prediction Demand AI in 2016 .
By watching consumption patterns but also tracking demographic , culture , and design changes , Aoki-Marr could predict consumer demand up to a year in advance far better than any brand strategist or B - school graduate .
It was n’t perfect , but it was good enough to make Aoki and Marr very , very rich .
After the Great Retreat , Aoki and Marr offered the code to governments around the world ; Japan was one of a handful that took them up on it .
Only Japan has stuck with it , although the model ’s success there is causing some states to reconsider .
The other technology key to the success of Just - in - Time Socialism was ultra-rapid 3D printing , bordering on nano - manufacturing .
This gave the Japanese government the means to start undertaking production across a wide array of markets without having to nationalize industries .
More importantly , it allowed for extremely flexible manufacturing : the Demand Prediction AI could spot an emerging trend and get new products to market with remarkable speed .
Critics say that Japan is lucky , because it has a shrinking population .
Most folks still work in traditional jobs , but many of these companies are subsidized by the government .
The rate at which the just - in - time production system is pushing people out of jobs matches the rate at which the population as a whole is declining .
Young people have even fewer reasons to be ambitious–but Japan , as a whole , is pretty happy with the situation .
Robonomics Robonomics has digital systems doing much of the work , supporting a version of the Basic Income Guarantee model , where citizens are given a basic above - poverty income guarantee and are free to explore education , entrepreneurship , a life of indolence , or even a regular job , one that may pay much more than now in order to attract people who otherwise would n’t want the work .
advertisement
The U.S. slowed down , Japan took control , and Europe … well , Europe got wired .
Or got weird , depending on your perspective .
On the surface , you still have the same kinds of big companies , same kinds of consumption patterns , same kinds of advertising that you did a few decades earlier .
But the twist is that almost nobody works –maybe about 25 % of the population engages in income - generating employment , and at least half of that consists of educators , bureaucrats , and the self - employed .
Manufacturing , transportation , and most basic services are done with robots , semi-autonomous systems that nobody even pretends have real intelligence , but work well enough to keep the economy humming .
Personal service jobs remain in human hands , but those are often performed by recent immigrants , trying to earn the right to a BIG Card .
BIG : Basic Income Guarantee , a ticket to a happy life of reading , travel , playing World of Starcraft II , raising kids , or whatever , all on society ’s dime .
It would have seemed crazy to us at the beginning of the century , but it actually works .
In the aftermath of the Great Retreat , unemployment levels were outrageously high , and there were no signs that the reconstituted corporations were going to be able to employ even a fraction of the people looking for jobs .
It was the “ Uncanny Compromise ” ( it sounds better in the original French ) that solved the problem : the corporations paid huge tax rates instead of payrolls , and everyone got to live moderately - comfortable lives .
It turned out that the percentage of folks driven to start companies or invent new things remained more - or - less consistent –the people who were only looking to make piles of money , so moved away , were made up for by the people who had good ideas but had to spend too much time simply getting by to make them real .
Government employs a good fraction of people , some to keep things going , but quite a few as Climate Mitigation First Responders , dealing with building sea walls , restoring wetlands , installing air conditioning , and the like .
These folks are nearly always recent graduates , instilled with a sense of obligation to a society that keeps them fed and happy .
The big problem , though , is that everybody wants in .
The EU borders are effectively closed to migration ( with a few humanitarian exceptions , and basic “ keep the population steady ” immigration ) , patrolled by drones and the military .
Every year , at least a hundred people are killed trying to get in .
It ’s like the ultimate gated community , and nobody here likes it –but nobody has been able to figure out another solution .
advertisement
Some or all of these scenarios may seem unbelievable to you .
That ’s good–tell me why , and what you think will happen instead .
And what ’s happening in the rest of the world ?
Here are some useful basics .
The scenarios are set roughly in 2030 , so the world has had time to get over the Great Retreat .
The environment is worse , but not catastrophic .
No Singularity is on the horizon , but semi-autonomous AI are commonplace .
The Great Retreat hastened the end of the fossil fuel era , now moving swiftly to electric vehicles ( with biofuels as the transition in many places ) .
So … what ’s happening in China in this world ?
They ’re no longer the manufacturing powerhouse they once were –have they gone RE , JiT Socialist , or Robonomic ?
Or have they tried to stick with traditional NGCC ?
What ’s happening in India ?
In South Africa ?
In Brazil ?
In the Middle East ?
Where do you want to live ?

Teaser trailer for Alice in Wonderland .
From Walt Disney Pictures and visionary director Tim Burton comes an epic 3D fantasy adventure Alice in Wonderland , a magical and imaginative twist on some of the most beloved stories of all time .
Johnny Depp stars as the Mad Hatter and Mia Wasikowska as 19 - year - old Alice , who returns to the whimsical world she first encountered as a young girl , reuniting with her childhood friends : the White Rabbit , Tweedledee and Tweedledum , the Dormouse , the Caterpillar , the Cheshire Cat , and of course , the Mad Hatter .
Alice embarks on a fantastical journey to find her true destiny and end the Red Queen 's reign of terror .
Before Tim Burton was on board to direct Alice in Wonderland , Anne Hathaway was offered the titular role of Alice .
She turned it down as it was too similar to roles she had previously played .
However , she really wanted to work with Burton and when he subsequently boarded the project , she was cast as the White Queen .
The Mad Hatter asks Alice several times " Why is a Raven like a writing desk ? "
This is a line from Lewis Carroll 's original novel , and the author admitted he made the question up and there is no answer to it .
Alan Rickman was originally going to have his face composited onto Absolem the caterpillar , but this idea was scrapped .
Animators still tried to make the caterpillar 's facial expressions similar to that of Rickman .
Burton based the White Queen on British cooking show host , Nigella Lawson .
He said he likes the glint in Lawson 's eye that makes someone think she 's nuts , but in a good way .
Nobody does visuals quite like Tim Burton , so who better to bring to life Lewis Carroll 's weird , beautiful yet utterly crazy Alice in Wonderland ?
Of course , this being a Tim Burton film , Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp feature heavily , along with a fantastic cast .
This trailer really does serve as the perfect teaser , because it takes us into Wonderland , gives us just a glimpse at the strange , magical , and wonderful characters and creatures that await us and then it 's over .
Though the only person to speak is Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter , we know that Matt Lucas is Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee , Anne Hathaway is the White Queen , Helena Bonham Carter is the Red Queen , Mia Wasikowska is Alice , and Michael Sheen is the White Rabbit .
Carroll 's novel is packed full of amazing creations , which this trailer definitely hints at , but for me , it 's Depp 's Hatter that steals the whole movie .
When Depp wants to play a role he really throws himself into it and his dedication here is clear .
He embodies the part completely and I imagine he would have been wonderful to film with .
So the visuals , and the cast are there , and the trailer teases well .
A shame , then , that Alice in Wonderland falls a little short in its execution .
It 's not massively so , but it does bring the movie down from being something incredible to being a reasonably good film .
Winston Branko Churchill loved the purity of the outdoors .
He hated the materialism and greed that , in his view , prevented people from connecting with nature .
And he was frustrated that he could not change that .
So , in a story that has dark parallels to the book and film “ Into the Wild , ” this philosophical former Denver disc jockey and Silverton coffee - shop owner , went into the wilderness of western Colorado last summer to think through this quandary — or to die .
“ He could n’t figure out how to make people change so they were not so caught up in money and cars and big houses and all that , ” said his sister , Jovanka Mersman , of Colorado Springs .
“ He ultimately ended up checking out . ”
Churchill ’s emaciated body was found a month ago in a remote high - mountain valley northwest of Lake City , nearly a year after he disappeared .
He had set out in June 2008 to hike the Colorado Trail from Denver to Durango , but then left the trail and purposefully roamed the wilderness , slowly dying of starvation .
When two hikers came upon his body lying outside the door of an old miner ’s cabin , a small backpack still slung over the shoulder of his mummified corpse held no food , just a journal , camera , marijuana pipe and a vial of pills .
His clothing was inadequate for the wintry weather he would have encountered before he is believed to have died in late November or early December .
He was 41 .
Hinsdale County Coroner Jerry Gray determined he died of starvation and exposure .
His hands were badly frostbitten .
The journal he kept meticulously updated was soaked by the 20 feet or so of snow that had entombed his body through the winter .
The few decipherable words gave no clue to his thoughts .
His camera had a final , brief disturbing video he took of himself .
He was in a tent in an emaciated state .
He said he had gone 40 days without food and thought he would die on his birthday the next day — Oct. 13 .
Message alarms friends
On Aug. 27 , he had walked into Lake City , left his dog Townsend with a woman working at the Lake City Chamber of Commerce , and called two friends from a pay phone .
They periodically had been sending him food and gear , which he picked up in Lake City or Creede .
He told them he did n’t need any more care packages .
His message for Jonathan Wrobel of Chicago , was : “ Dude , thank you for everything .
I do n’t need anything else . ”
Wrobel and the other friend were disturbed enough by the messages and by the fact that he abandoned his dog to call Hinsdale County authorities .
Sheriff Ron Bruce quickly organized a search party and for the next two days they scoured the backcountry in places where other hikers had seen Churchill .
They found no trace of him .
“ Those mountains are very big .
It ’s very difficult to find anyone in those mountains who does n’t want to be found , ” Bruce said .
Whether Churchill ultimately wanted to be found or saved can only be guessed at from clues .
He had lined his trekking poles neatly at the top of his head .
One of those poles was bent at the tip and some who knew him take this as a sign that , in the end , Churchill wanted to live :
Maybe he was trying to pry open the door with the pole to get to the canned food inside .
Maybe he hoped to get enough sustenance to make his way back to civilization and help .
“ That is the hardest thing for everyone in Silverton who really cared about him , ” said friend Karen Hoskin .
“ Was there a moment when he would change his mind and choose life ? ”
His mother , Mirjana Chur chill of Alamosa , has a different idea .
“ My hypothesis is that he wanted his body to be found , ” she said .
“ My son wanted people to know that he died so that maybe they would hear his message . ”
Mirjana is blunt about that message : “ I do n’t understand what it was . ”
Rambling writings
Churchill previously had written a 600 - page manuscript explaining his philosophies of life , but those who tried to read it said it was rambling and disjointed .
Churchill was n’t that way in person .
Friends describe him as witty , friendly and “ cool ” in terms of being on top of trends .
“ He was the most genuine person I have ever met .
I do n’t think he was crazy or suicidal .
He just did n’t want to live in a society where people did n’t take care of each other .
In so many ways , he was n’t right for this world .
He saw things totally different from most of the rest of the world , ” Wrobel said .
“ He did n’t commit suicide per se , ” he added .
“ He just walked down that road and did n’t come back . ”
Churchill found the closest thing to the pure life he sought , friends and family say , when he found a home in the remote mountain town of Silverton from 2005 through 2007 .
As a child , he had moved frequently with his family after being born in Germany to a Serbian mother and an American soldier .
They divorced when he was 6 years old .
He attended high school in Colorado Springs and New Hampshire , where his father lived .
Later , he took creative writing courses at the University of Colorado , but his mother said he did n’t fit well in the structure of a college .
He became a disc jockey .
His performing name was DJ Verifine , and he amassed a huge collection of party dance music .
He got into raves and party drugs .
He worked as a bike mechanic and began the tome that would define his philosophy of life .
He did detailed research on the best places to live before he headed to Silverton .
He bought an old Victorian home there and opened a coffee - bicycle repair shop , Mobius Cycles and Cafe .
It was in a rented space that he turned from dilapidated to beautiful through months of sanding , painting and hammering .
His friends say the space highlighted his constant drive for perfection .
Popular hangout
Mobius became a favorite hangout with locals who appreciated the expensive top - of - the - line espresso machine he insisted on getting .
The New York Times took favorable note of the shop in a January 2007 travel piece .
Churchill fit easily in Silverton , a town that is funky rather than fancy .
Many residents shared his love of extreme snowboarding and mountain biking .
They say Churchill stood out in the extreme challenges .
He could skin or pedal up a mountain faster than just about anyone else .
He created a “ passing lane ” through the deep snow on at the Silverton Mountain Ski Resort because other skiers were too slow .
But his coffee shop was losing money .
He sold his home and moved into an apartment in the back of the shop .
He was near bankruptcy when he closed Mobius and left Silverton , saying that he would likely go to Moab , Utah , and start a new coffee shop there .
Instead , he went to Lakewood where his life began to unravel .
“ He was a recluse there , ” his sister said .
He tried to commit suicide by fasting for 40 days .
When he was still alive at the end of that time , he took an overdose of Townsend ’s epilepsy medicine .
He spent less than a week in the psychiatry unit of a Denver hospital .
He moved in with his sister for the next three months while deciding what to do next in life .
He also spent a few weeks with his mother .
During that time , he quizzed her about survival — something she knows about through her years as a refugee in post - war Europe .
She had seen a lot of death , suffered hunger and been surrounded by other desperate refugees who “ wanted so much to live . ”
That experience has made it very hard for her to understand why anyone , particularly her son , would want to die .
She can only link it to a family history of mental illness .
Her mother was schizophrenic .
When Churchill made the decision that he would hike the Colorado Trail to sort his life out , his mother and friends initially did n’t view it was a suicide mission .
He spent weeks preparing .
He hiked 30 miles a day to get in shape .
He was excited about the trek when he spoke to Wrobel about it .
Even after the September phone calls and when fall turned to winter without any sign of Churchill , some of his friends still had hopes that he would hike out .
John Allen , a Silverton friend , said Churchill also was quirky enough that some friends imagined him sitting on a beach in Mexico or the Caribbean working on his book .
Those friends recently gathered for a memorial for Churchill .
They played his disc - jockey tapes , told stories and wondered what that waterlogged journal might have told them .
“ At the end , I think he had just totally gone off - plot , ” Allen conjectured .
During the remembrance , a brilliant rainbow bowed from the mountains into downtown Silverton .
Hoskin said it felt like a conclusion of sorts to a story without a clear end .
“ And it was a beautiful conclusion , ” she said .

Facebook plans to increase staff by 50 % this year , Bloomberg reports .
CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Bloomberg that since no other companies were hiring in the recession , Facebook has benefited from the surplus of engineers available .
He added that the company was building its workforce much slower than typical startups .
Facebook currently has 1,000 employees .
Bloomberg : Zuckerberg said he ’s trying to keep a lid on costs , an effort to reach positive cash flow next year .
In May , Facebook moved into a decades - old building in Palo Alto , California , that he calls “ the bunker ” -- with unfinished cement floors and fading stickers on the front door .
“ The thing I want to remind people of is we ’re way closer to the beginning than the end , ” Zuckerberg said in the Aug. 20 interview .
“ A lot of times buildings can be a signal that you ’ve made it .
I would rather that our building feel much more like a very large garage . ”
Facebook is expected to make $ 550 million in revenue this year from advertising .

Duncan Kennedy reports .
By 1992 , the regulations and distortions the government had imposed on the healthcare and insurance industries had driven up the price of health insurance — which had been cheaply and widely available just a generation earlier to anyone who wanted it , in an era that already did n't have a free market — to the point that many people could n't afford it .
The economy was in recession , and President George H.W. Bush 's approval ratings had fallen below 50 % because of it ( or more likely due to the influence of mainstream media opinion makers ; the ruling elite had evidently decided for some reason that Bush had to go ) .
Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton , running for the Democratic nomination , made healthcare a key issue .
He promised to get health insurance for all Americans , reign in spiraling healthcare costs , and make HMOs ( which had been created by government in the 1970s ) more accountable for the care they provided .
In short , be promised to solve all of the problems caused by government with more government .
He outlined his plans in his 1992 campaign book , sappily - titled , “ Putting People First : How We Can All Change America . ”
After winning the election , the new president agitated throughout 1993 - 94 for a bill to force ( always the operative word with government ) all Americans to obtain health insurance , among many other edicts .
The result was a monstrous 1,342 page bill called the Health Security Act .
Among its provisions were to create a National Health Board , appointed by the president , that would have full control over all medical treatments , prices , and benefits ; create regional health alliances , through which all Americans would be required to obtain health insurance , and which would enforce the federal healthcare regulations at the local level ; and would mandate that all employers either offer all employees the standard government plan , or at least pay 80 % of the cost ; plus numerous other requirements .
In his 1994 State of the Union address , President Clinton outlined the plan , showed the I.D. card all Americans would be required to have to get healthcare , and promised to veto any legislation that did n't guarantee health insurance for all Americans .
Around this time , Republican strategist Bill Kristol circulated a private memo , advising Republicans to kill , rather than try to amend , the bill — not because of principled opposition , but because he felt it was their best strategy for picking up seats in the upcoming mid-term elections .
The public was largely hostile to the bill , to the point that many Democrats refused to back it , fearing for their political lives in the upcoming election .
The bill failed to come up for a vote before election day , when the drama culminated with the Republicans winning 54 seats in the House and eight in the Senate , giving the GOP control of both houses for the first time in 40 years .
Tom Foley became the first Speaker of the House since the Civil War to lose his seat ; two other powerful Congressmen , Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski and Judiciary Chairman Jack Brooks , also went down .
The GOP also won 12 gubernatorial races and 472 state legislative seats , taking control of 20 state legislatures from the Democrats ; this gave them control of the majority of governorships for the first time in 22 years , and the majority of state legislatures for the first time in 50 years .
No incumbent Republican lost his or her election .
Establishment anchorman Peter Jennings described all of this at the time as the voters throwing a “ temper tantrum . ”
In his 1995 State of the Union address , President Clinton — who had one year earlier proposed socializing the entire healthcare industry — knew which way the wind was blowing ; he looked into the camera , and said with a straight face , “ We know big government does not have all the answers .
We know there 's not a program for every problem .
We have worked to give the American people a smaller , less bureaucratic government in Washington .
And we have to give the American people one that lives within its means .
The era of big government is over ”
The socialized healthcare bill was dead .
But , because there 's really only one party , the Republicans changed nothing , and proceeded to pass much of the Hillary Care bill piecemeal .
Dead like Jason
Since then , technological advancement and competition in the market have driven down the prices of computers , flat - panel televisions ( which did n't even exist then ) , DVD players ( which did n't exist then ) , cell phones ( which did n't exist then like they do today ) , and numerous other goods by more than 90 % — and that 's without even factoring in the government 's theft known as inflation .
Meanwhile , in the insurance and technology - driven healthcare industries , which have been saddled with many thousands of more regulations and other impositions since then ( again , many put in place by the Republican Congress that gained power in response to the last bill , and which had a Republican president for eight years ) , and with government now spending about 50 % of all healthcare dollars , prices have mysteriously continued to climb .
In response , the new president and the Democratic Congress have begun agitating for a similar bill , again attempting to force all Americans to buy health insurance .
The resulting monstrosity is called H.R. 3200 , the America 's Affordable Health Choices
Act of 2009 ; it's also similar to its predecessor of nearly a generation ago because it 's 1,018 pages long .
( I have no idea how these bills get written so quickly to be so long , but I do know why : because of special interest pork , of course , but more importantly to ensure — along with being written in virtually indecipherable legalese — that no one — including the people in Congress voting for it — will read it , understand it , or even have any idea what 's in it . )
Fortunately , like its predecessor , this bill has met with a glorious public backlash .
During the past two months , people in Congress from districts all over the country have attempted to hold town halls back home with their constituents to sell them on the bill , only to be accosted and shouted down by angry mobs of protesters ; in numerous cases , they 've needed police escorts just to make it back to their cars safely .
And , although likely not just because of the healthcare bill , President Obama 's approval ratings have plummeted to around 50 % just seven months into his term , and the number of people who “ strongly disapprove ” of his performance has risen from around 10 % when he took office to about 40 % today .
Rationing
Sarah Palin pinpointed possibly the biggest concern with socialized medicine in a public statement against the bill , saying the government would wind up having “ death panels ” where bureaucrats cut costs by denying care to the elderly , disabled , and extremely ill .
On her Facebook page , she wrote , “ As more Americans delve into the disturbing details of the nationalized health care plan that the current administration is rushing through Congress , our collective jaw is dropping , and we 're saying not just no , but hell no !
“ The Democrats promise that a government health care system will reduce the cost of health care , but as the economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out , government health care will not reduce the cost ; it will simply refuse to pay the cost .
And who will suffer the most when they ration care ?
The sick , the elderly , and the disabled , of course .
The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama 's ' death panel ' so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their ' level of productivity in society , ' whether they are worthy of health care .
Such a system is downright evil . ”
You do n't need to worry
In response to Palin 's comments , President Obama said , “ I just lost my grandmother last year .
I know what it 's like to watch somebody you love , who 's aging , deteriorate , and have to struggle with that .
“ So the notion that somehow I ran for public office , or members of Congress are in this so that they can go around pulling the plug on grandma ?
I mean , when you start making arguments like that , that 's simply dishonest . ”
A recent piece in the New York Times asserted that “ There is nothing in any of the legislative proposals that would call for the creation of death panels or any other governmental body that would cut off care for the critically ill as a cost - cutting measure . ”
Former Democratic Party chairman Howard Dean said Palin “ just made that up . . .
There 's nothing like euthanasia in the bill . ”
John Rother , executive vice - president of the influential lobbying group AARP , said of the public 's reaction , “ I guess what surprised me is the ferocity ; it 's much stronger than I expected . ”
He went on to characterize such opponents of the bill as “ people who are ideologically opposed to Mr. Obama ” who are taking “ the opportunity to weaken the president . ”
MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann called Palin 's suggestion “ an absurd idea . ”
The next day , ABC's Bill Weir said on Good Morning America , “ There is nothing like that in the impending legislation . ”
The day after that , Washington Post reporter Cecil Connolly wrote , “ There are no such ' death panels ' mentioned in any of the House bills ; ” New York Times columnist David Brooks appeared on NBC's Meet the Press , calling Palin 's assertion “ crazy ; ” CNN 's Jessica Yellin said on their program , State of the Union , “ That 's not an accurate assessment of what this panel is ; ” and George Stephanopoulos said on ABC's This Week program , “ Those phrases appear nowhere in the bill . . ”
Even National Review asserted that Palin had attempted “ to leap across a logical canyon , ” adding that “ we should be against hysteria . ”
Well , that settles it .
Good thing we have a chorus of people who stand to profit from the bill and of economically - illiterate media hacks , all assuring us in unison that there 's nothing in the bill to establish “ death panels ” — as if that 's relevant , even if it 's true .
Never mind the fact that no one can possibly know how much this will cost .
Or that it 's guaranteed to cost far more than anyone projects .
Or that every other country with socialized medicine has responded to soaring costs by rationing and denying care , to which hundreds of documented horror stories can attest .
Or that no one even knows what 's in the bill .
Or that any of these people might be lying if they do know what 's in it .
Or that , even if it 's really not in the bill now — or even if the bill specifically prohibits it , that can be changed later .
Or that the language in enacted bills means whatever the government says it means .
Or that history is full of examples of the emptiness of government 's promises .
Never mind any of that .
Just take our word that there are no provisions in the bill for rationing or “ death panels ” as the final say on all of your worries and shut up .
The crowning touch on the media reaction was the recent piece in the Washington Post by Howard Kurtz , Post columnist and host of CNN's Reliable Sources , titled , “ Journalists , Left Out of The Debate : Few Americans Seem to Hear Health Care Facts , ” in which he catalogued many of the attempts of the Establishment 's opinion makers to assure people that the bill made no provisions for “ death panels , ” then complained about how so many people are n't listening .
“ Perhaps journalists are no more trusted than politicians these days , or many folks never saw the knockdown stories .
But this was a stunning illustration of the traditional media 's impotence . ”
Boo -hoo , the Establishment media is having a hard time telling people what to think .
People do n't read newspapers or watch network news anymore ; they no longer just swallow any propaganda the Establishment puts out ; they think for themselves too much .
For the sake of such contrary troublemakers , let 's examine the obvious objections to the bill — all of which the mainstream media are ignoring — in more detail , instead of ignoring them as our masters would like .
As we 'll see , the chant of virtually the entire Establishment in unison that provisions for “ death panels ” are n't in the bill is irrelevant — even if it 's true .
Socialism can't calculate
Flippant dismissals about rationing and denial of care aside , anyone who understands economics knows that such an outcome is n't just possible ; it 's guaranteed .
Government projections about costs are useless .
For one example , when Medicare was passed in 1965 , it 's projected cost for 1990 was $ 3 billion ( about $ 12 billion in 1990 dollars , thanks to the government theft of inflation ) .
The real cost to run Medicare in 1990 turned out to be $ 98 billion .
Spiraling costs are inherent with government programs for several reasons :
They obtain their funds through coercion , rather than voluntary payments , which means they 're not subject to the same profit and loss information as a business .
When a business fails to satisfy its customers , it goes bankrupt , and its assets are liquidated to others who can put them to profitable use serving others .
But people in government have no incentive to cut costs , because they 're not spending their own money — and they embrace the inevitable failures their programs bring in spite of their huge budgets , because they can use them as excuses for even bigger budgets , which will make the program work this time for sure .
And people who are dissatisfied with what they receive can't take their business elsewhere .
In fact , the people receiving the benefits are n't even the customers ; the “ customers ” who must be pleased are politicians and bureaucrats overseeing the program .
And when coercion is introduced into a situation , people do n't continue acting as they did before ; when healthcare becomes “ free , ” people will use more of it than they did before , further increasing costs .
And when costs start spiraling out of control — and they will , that 's when things really start to get ugly .
As we 've seen with every country that has had socialized medicine , such systems cut costs by denying care .
On the market , anyone with a need or a want is a potential customer , someone who can give you the money you want if you can figure out how to satisfy his need or desire .
But , with socialism , anyone who needs or wants anything is a burden , a drain on scarce resources .
Socialism without rationing and waiting lines is like dry water ; anyone who says their utopian socialist fantasies wo n't have such problems has no credibility ; they 're either lying or completely ignorant .
And the Establishment response to these concerns ignores five further points that should be obvious to anyone with any sophistication regarding history or how government functions — which , despite the best efforts of government schools and the mainstream media , is apparently a lot more people than the Establishment expected .
1 . The bill is more than 1,000 pages long .
Why should we believe that even one politician has read it all and knows everything that 's in it ?
This is exemplified by a prominent proponent of the bill , Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) admitting that he has n't read it , has no intention of reading it , would n't have time to read it before the scheduled vote next month even if he wanted to , and would have to rely on lawyers to explain it to him even if he did read it , because it 's written in such legalese .
2 . Even if they have read and understood it all , the people giving the assurances about what the bill does or does not contain could be lying .
“ How do you tell when a politician is lying ? ”
“ His lips move . ”
The problem with that old joke is it 's usually not a joke ; the suggestion that a politician “ could be ” lying is usually quite generous .
It 's especially generous for President Obama , given that numerous videos exist of him saying he 's a proponent of single - payer , “ universal ” healthcare .
In a June 15 speech to the AMA ( architect of coercive medical licensure in the 19th century ) , Obama said that that this bill is only intended to provide a “ public option ” for people without health insurance , and that concerns that it 's really a Trojan horse for a single - payer system are “ illegitimate . ”
But , at the March 24 , 2007 SEIU Healthcare Forum , Obama said , “ My commitment is to make sure that we 've got universal healthcare for all Americans by the end of my first term as president .
I would hope that we can set up a system that allows those who can go through their employers to access a federal system or a state pool of some sort .
But I do n't think we 're going to be able to eliminate employer coverage immediately ; there 's potentially going to be some transition process .
I can envision a decade out or 15 years out or 20 years out . ”
( Of course , employer coverage was created by the wage controls during WWII , and is maintained through subsequent distortions in the tax code .
So it should be eliminated — but by a free market , not by government replacing private insurance . )
And , in a 2003 speech before the coercive AFL - CIO labor union , Obama said , “ I happen to be a proponent of a single - payer , universal healthcare plan . ”
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) has also said , “ I think if we get a good public option , it could lead to single - payer , and that 's the best way to reach single - payer . ”
And , according to this summary of the bill posted at New Republic ( which also catalogues numerous other horrors and absurdities elsewhere in the bill ) , pages 425-430 give the federal government numerous provisions to determine what treatments people may receive at the end of their lives .
Surely none of those provisions could possibly be used to authorize “ death panels . ”
( About.com has a link that contains what is supposed to be the text of those pages ; while it 's written to dismiss concerns about the section as “ urban legends , ” it 's useful because it isolates the verbatim section of the bill , and because reading it shows the kind of nearly indecipherable legalese in which bills are written .
The entire bill in .
PDF form is available on the House.gov site . )
3 . Even if they 're telling the truth now , any part of a bill can be amended or repealed with future legislation .
This needs no further explanation , except to point out that it's one of the most obvious objections to the bill — and that it totally demolishes in one sentence the Establishment 's entire , unified rebuttal .
And , despite that , it 's another point that the mainstream media is basically ignoring .
4 . The government probably would n't even have to bother with amending or repealing anything , because the wording of laws and regulations means whatever the government says it means .
Comparing the constitution to the federal behemoth we have today should prove the futility of restraining political power with words .
All people interpret all words — no matter how objectively - written they may seem — subjectively .
The first amendment plainly makes any federal infringement on freedom of speech or the press illegal .
The second amendment plainly makes any federal infringement on any aspect of any weapon illegal .
( The constitution does n't give the federal government jurisdiction over common crimes , so real crimes — like murder — involving weapons are irrelevant here . )
The ninth and tenth amendments make easily 90 % of what the federal government does today illegal , given that there have been no amendments passed to authorize Social Security , federal drug laws , the very existence of the IRS , FBI , BATF , OSHA , the EEOC , etc , etc , etc .
Guess what ?
The courts do n't care .
And why should they ?
They 're also part of the government !
It 's like the daily reports we see of thuggish government police committing horrific assaults on citizens , which are invariably followed within a couple of months — unless a particular incident sparks sufficient outcry from the public — with the headline , “ Police Dept .
Investigates Itself ; Clears Itself of All Charges . ”
The Supreme Court — which was never even supposed to be the final , unchallenged arbiter of federal power — has more than 200 years of rulings behind it , consistently interpreting the language of the constitution in an expansive way when it comes to governmental power , and in a restrictive way when it comes to individual liberty .
In the case of the first and second amendments , they 've ruled numerous times that the word “ no ” actually means “ yes ; ” these are examples of why it would be meaningless even if the Obama healthcare bill specifically prohibited horrors like death panels .
( As we 'll see in the next point , the original Medicare bill contained language specifically forbidding governmental interference in doctors ' decisions . )
5 . History is riddled with examples irrefutably illustrating the emptiness of government 's promises .
When the income tax was passed in 1913 , it was only going to apply to the richest 1 % of Americans , those making at least $ 50,000 a year ( about $ 1 million today ) , and even the rate for them would never go above 6 % .
In 1918 — just five years later — the top marginal rate was 77 % .
It reached a high of 94 % in 1945 , and remained at 91 % from 1951 - 63 .
It has never been below 24 % since 1916 .
The Social Security tax started at 2 % , and the funds were saved .
Federal aid to education would never mean federal interference with education .
Federal highway funds would never mean attaching conditions to states receiving the money .
Medicare would never allow bureaucrats to interfere with doctors ' decisions ; in fact , the original Medicare bill contained language specifically prohibiting it .
The Pure Food and Drug Act would only require everything to be labeled , but would never restrict or prohibit what could be sold , or at what price .
The Civil Rights
Act would never force racial quotas on businesses .
RICO , asset forfeiture , and money laundering laws would only be applied to the mafia and major drug dealers .
The Dept. of Homeland Security and the TSA would only be focused on stereotypical , swarthy , towel - headed terrorists .
How many more examples do you need ?
Fool me once . . .
Given these facts , how can any proponent of this horrendous bill think they can alleviate such concerns by dismissively asserting that “ ' death panels ' ( or provisions for rationing or some other problem inherent in socialized medicine ) are n't in there ? ”
Do they really think people are going to be satisfied with that answer , that they 'll take that at face value and say , “ Oh , okay , ” and just sit down ?
Free market cure
The solution to the perpetual healthcare crisis is to get the government completely out of healthcare .
That would once again make patients the paying customers , and medical professionals , medical facilities , and pharmaceutical and insurance companies would have to earn their money by serving them .
In a real free market , competition , innovation and increasing technology would drive down prices , and charity hospitals , free clinics and doctors working pro bono would be available for the truly needy — just as they were until the 1960s , when government regulations drove them out of business .
So why do n't these people restore liberty to the healthcare industry ?
In a real free market , no one could rely on the force of government to artificially inflate their incomes by giving them licensure , monopolies , cartels , regulations forcing patients to pay for insurance provisions they do n't want before they get sick and for tests they do n't need when they do , patent protections , etc .
And , in a real free market , politicians and bureaucrats would have to go into that market and earn an honest living doing something productive that people pay them for voluntarily , instead of justifying the coercive power they presume to hold over us by touting endless “ reforms ” to the problems they caused in the first place , and which would disappear if they would just leave us all alone .
Further , if the mainstream media championed a real free market , they would alienate their government contacts — at least until the elites who employ them fired them and replaced them with people who will do as they 're told and further the elite 's system .
And , in the meantime , they'd have one less piece of “ serious ” news to discuss , shallowly discussing the government 's perpetual “ reforms ” that always make matters worse ; then they'd be left to fill even more idle hours covering Jon and Kate 's divorce , Michael Jackson 's death , or what in the world Michelle Obama was thinking wearing those shorts .
So I wonder why none of them promote a free market in healthcare — or in much of anything else ?
Trust us
Well , until we get one ( do n't hold your breath ) , pay no attention to the assurances of anyone in government or the media that the horrors inherent in socialized medicine wo n't happen here .
It matters not whether those assurances are given out of ignorance or deceit ; all that matters is they 're worthless .

Nur kurz .
Meine liebsten Passagen , ihr habt es ja sicher schon bei Heise Online gelesen :
Die Bundesnetzagentur hat einen Entwurf für die technische Richtlinie zur Umsetzung des Gesetzes zur Bekämpfung der Kinderpornographie in Kommunikationsnetzen erstellt .
Anders als bei vergleichbaren Regelwerken schließt die Regulierungsbehörde eine Kommentierung durch die Öffentlichkeit aus .
Im Amtsblatt 16/2009 wird die Richtlinie als nur für den Dienstgebrauch verwendbare Geheimakte eingestuft .
Eine Geheimakte zur Netzregulierung ?
Wie darf man diesen Absatz denn bitte missverstehen ?
War bisher vor allem von Sperrungen auf DNS - Basis die Rede , lässt obiges ja durchaus Luft für die ein oder andere gepflegte Verschwörungstheorie .
Was bitte könnte in einer solchen Richtlinie stehen , das nicht ohnehin bekannt ist ?
Ein Hinweis auf providerseitige Zwangs - DNS bzw .
( Hui , das würde nicht nur VPN - Nutzer freuen , die ja gerne mal auf Port 53 rumrutschen … ) ?
Die Empfehlung eines Cleanfeed - Modells nach britischem Vorbild , auf den das BKA hinzuarbeiten scheint ( PDF : Seite 5 , unten ) ?
Und warum / wie sollte sowas geheim bleiben ?
Da bin ich doch nun mal gespannt , was zum Beispiel Prof.
Dr. Thomas Hoeren oder die in der Anhörung vor dem Wirtschaftsausschuss befragten Experten zu dieser Entwicklung zu sagen haben .
Bereits die einfache DNS - Variante steht ja bekanntlich auf juristisch recht wackligen beinen .
Auf technischer Ebene tiefer ( zum Beispiel in die Kommunikation ) eingreifende Maßnahmen und / oder eine Verschleierung generell , dürften den Rahmen der verfassungsrechtlichen Unbedenklichkeit wohl endgültig sprengen .
Auch hübsch , aber wohl eher aus der Abteilung Kabale und Liebe im Wahlkampf :
Bundesjustizministerin Brigitte Zypries ( SPD ) hat Wirtschaftsminister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg ( CSU ) unterdessen vorgehalten , das „ Zugangserschwerungsgesetz “ zu hintertreiben .
Es wundere sie schon , dass der CSU - Politiker erst nach Abschluss des Gesetzgebungsverfahrens festgestellt habe , dass die Vorschriften der EU - Kommission vorgelegt werden müssten , sagte sie der Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung .
Das nun ist ein Vorstoß , den ich nicht so recht deuten kann ( Nicht etwa , dass ich Zypries ‘ Zickzackkurs der letzten Monate sonst hätte nachvollziehen können ) .
Zum einen natürlich , weil ja eigentlich schon früher einem der drei beteiligten Ministerien hätte auffallen können , dass man sich nicht einfach so Gesetze ausdenken kann .
Zum anderen , weil es meiner Meinung nach keinen Sinn macht , das Inkraftreten des Gesetzes bewußt bis nach der Wahl zu verschleppen .
Zypries ‘ Argument , „ der Wirtschaftsminister versuche das Sperr - Gesetz im Interesse der Telekommunikationsindustrie auf die lange Bank zu schieben “ , klingt für mich nicht sonderlich plausibel .
Es sei denn , man möchte der Industrie ein mehrstufiges Verfahren ( inkl. dem jeweils nötigen Technik- und Personalaufwand ) ersparen und gleich richtig sperren .
Aber das scheint mir , gerade auch angesichts des allgegenwärtigen Chaos bei der Gesetzgebung ein geradezu weitsichtiger Gedanke und daher unrealistisch .
Wie auch immer , schönes Wochenende .

Some kooky German artists are intent on showing how to ‘ stick it to the man ’ by avoiding having your face spotted on the ubiquitous CCTV cameras that record day - to - day life across many of the public and private spaces of our cities .
The URA / FILOART created I - R.A.S.C headset is little more than a circle of infra-red LEDs on an elastic headband , which cause CCTV cameras to flare out the wearer ’s face – as pictured here .
From the website : “ The URA / FILOART developed device promises to the citizens of a more reliable protection against security measures of the state ( and other Überwachenden ) .
IR .ASC bietet die Sicherheit vor der Sicherheit und weist somit auf die Asymmetrie der Kräfte zwischen dem Überwachenden und dem Individuum hin .
IR .ASC offers the safety and security has therefore to the asymmetry of power between the individual and Überwachenden . ”
While TechRadar is pretty sure you could easily knock one of these up in the shed , we remain to be convinced that wearing one is not going to attract more unwanted attention to you than not doing so .
Which kind of defeats the object .

To stop ecocide , we need to : stop human growth , reduce population , reduce unnecessary use of power — this requires telling Joe Sixpack he can’t have a giant pickup truck , Martha Upperclassuburbanwife that she can’t fly to Rio , and your average dumb liberal cubicle dwelling apartment voter that social welfare programs must cease so we stop breeding parasites .
That ’s socially unacceptable .
What is socially acceptable is telling people that they can be anything they want to be , and they ’re all included ( egalitarianism ) .
Instead , we get the faux solutions :
At the heart of much of the disagreement is that perennial struggle between rich and poor .
Developing countries want industrialized countries â€ “ whose populations are responsible the lionâ€™s share of greenhouse emissions â€ “ to lead the way by making the steepest reductions in emissions .
They also want money and technology to help them make their own emissions cuts and adapt to the impacts of climate change .
According to the Guardian , in Britain , European Union officials have proposed making an 80 percent to 95 percent reduction in greenhouse emissions by 2050 in exchange for developing countriesâ€ ™ reducing their emissions by 15 percent to 30 percent over the next decade .
They have not yet heard a reaction , but Rajendra Pachauri , chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , said that the developed world is unlikely to be impressed by the offer , which does not mandate any short - term cuts for rich countries .
â€ œUnless the developed world comes up with strong , clear targets for 2020 themselves , â€  Dr. Pachauri told the Guardian , â€ œI think it is unlikely the developing world will commit itself to reductions .
â€ CSM
First , I think we ’ll find when more accurate figures are available that the developing world — a euphemism for third world countries with average IQs below 98 — is creating as much carbon and worse pollution than the developed — a euphemism for industrialized countries with average IQs near or above 100 — world , through slash and burn agriculture , the burning of waste , deforestation and general disorganization .
Third world people outnumber first world people nine to one .
Second , I think they ask the impossible : the rich have spent a long time building an infrastructure and cannot simply reverse it ; that ’s like suicide .
So they propose a gradual de-escalation , but that ’s not enough for the third world , which wants to be under the illusion that it will be just like London and Munich tomorrow if “ just given a chance ” — like every dishwasher who ’s an aspiring rapper , and every pasty white cubicle dwelling apartment voter who does n’t understand why CEOs get paid more than workers .
It ’s just not fair , man !
Finally , let ’s look at this strategically .
We ’re asking humanity ’s most productive people to slow down and let others catch up , but the others are politically unstable , greater in population , and much higher in dysfunction .
Why stop ?
Let the best rise .
Environmentalists who hope a slowing global economy will mean big falls in greenhouse gas emissions are likely to be disappointed .
Because despite a gloomy economic forecast for 2009 , the annual growth in emissions of 3 % is only likely to slow modestly , and may even rise over the long term because of the downturn ’s impact on global climate talks and the funding of renewable energy projects .
The Guardian
The solutions are simple .
We ’re just not mentally mature enough to face them .
The system wo n’t self - regulate .
We ’ll actually have to fix it .
And that requires we come out of our comfort zones , face our fear of being judged inferior , and decide to cut ourselves back — and accept the results as they fall .
But that ’s socially unacceptable , because society is filled with the underconfident , the socially retarded , the immature , the fearful , the withdrawn , the neurotic … a bumper crop of stupid .
When will smarter people learn that dumber people ALWAYS oppress smarter people by blocking the path to necessary decisions ?

Update : March 21 , 2014 - We have an updated post after years of practice with these techniques .
Newer versions of Apple 's Safari web browser ( and Google Chrome , which is also based on Webkit ) support a vendor - specific implementation of the CSS3 Transition property .
CSS Transitions are a very powerful effect that can eliminate the use of JavaScript for many common effects .
Quick Overview
There are three properties that make up the transition : - webkit - transition - property , - webkit - transition - duration , and - webkit - transition - timing - function .
Additionally , there is a shorthand property that combines the three : - webkit - transition .
- webkit - transition - property : This specifies which properties of the element will be animated .
If it is set to all every available property will be animated , otherwise you can choose to animate one or more individual properties and leave the rest as they are .
- webkit - transition - duration :
The amount of time from the beginning of the transition to the end .
This is specified in seconds : 1s , 0.5s , etc .
- webkit - transition - timing - function :
There are a number of timing functions — mathematical models for how the transition takes place — that you can choose from .
These include ease , linear , ease - in , ease - out , and ease - in - out as well as the ability to create your own with cubic - bezier .
A detailed explanation of these modes is beyond this article , please experiment with them or see the article on The Art of Web for more detail .
- webkit - transition combines all three into a handy shortcut : - webkit - transition : all 1s ease ;
A Simple Example
a { background : # fff ; color : # aa0000 ; padding : 3 px ; - webkit - transition : all 1s linear ; } a:hover { background : # 220077 ; color : # fff ; }
This is a link
When you hover over the link above you will see the text fade to white and the background fade to purple .
( One of the great things about using Transitions in this way is that they degrade gracefully .
If you are using a browser other than Safari you will see a normal hover effect with no transition . )
Navigation
We can use CSS Transitions to create a very nice navigation menu without JavaScript ( well , maybe a little for Internet Explorer ) .
We will start off by creating the menu using the standard CSS properties , to be sure it will degrade nicely in browsers other than Safari .
HTML
< ul id =" trans-nav " > < li > < a href= " # " >
Home </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " > About </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " > Products </a> < ul > < li > < a href= " # " >
Widgets </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Thingamabobs </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Doohickies </a></li> </ul > </ li > < li >< a href= " # " >
Contact</a></li> </ul >
CSS :
# trans - nav { list - style - type : none ; height : 40 px ; padding : 0 ; margin : 0 ; } #trans - nav { list - style - type : none ; height : 40 px ; padding : 0 ; margin : 0 ; } #trans - nav li { float : left ; position : relative ; padding : 0 ; line - height : 40 px ; background : # 5a8078 url( nav - bg.png ) repeat-x 0 0 ; } #trans - nav li:hover { background - position : 0 - 40 px ; } # trans - nav li a { display : block ; padding : 0 15 px ; color : # fff ; text - decoration : none ; } # trans - nav li a : hover { color : # a3 f1d7 ; } # trans - nav li ul { opacity : 0 ; position : absolute ; left : 0 ; width : 8 em ; background : # 63867f ; list - style - type : none ; padding : 0 ; margin : 0 ; } #trans - nav li:hover ul { opacity : 1 ; } #trans - nav li ul li { float : none ; position : static ; height : 0 ; line - height : 0 ; background : none ; } # trans - nav li:hover ul li { height : 30 px ; line - height : 30 px ; } # trans - nav li ul li a { background : # 63867 f ; } #trans - nav li ul li a :hover { background : # 5a8078 ; }
Notice we have a nice drop - down menu under " Products " and hover state on the top level menu items .
Enhance It !
With just four lines of CSS and without changing anything in other browsers , we can now make the menu a little nicer in Safari .
# trans - nav li { - webkit - transition : all 0.2s ; } # trans - nav li a { - webkit - transition : all 0.5s ; } # trans - nav li ul { - webkit - transition : all 1s ; } # trans - nav li ul li { - webkit - transition : height 0.5s ; }
You might have noticed a few oddities in our original CSS .
For instance , instead of hiding the submenu by settings display : none we set the height of all the sub - menu items to 0 .
That was in preparations for our slide - down transition .
Since you can't apply a transition to display we need to find a workaround .
We are also animating the hover color on the links and the background image position to get the nice fade between the normal and " pressed " states .
If you want to learn more about the details of CSS transition , see the W3's specification .
There is a lot of room for creativity with this , so please share any unique transitions you come up with !
UPDATE !
Through a combination of extra css styles and JavaScript , you can make the menus work well in Internet Explorer , too !
First , for all versions , you will need to hide and show the sub - menus using display : none rather than by setting the height of the menu items to zero , which leaves an ugly block of the menu 's background color .
# trans - nav li ul { display : none ; } # trans - nav li:hover ul , # trans - nav li.over ul {display : block ; } # trans - nav li ul li { height : 30 px ; line - height : 30 px ; }
( Obviously , this should be in a separate stylesheet that is called with conditional comments , so it only affects IE . )
That will fix things for IE 7 and 8 .
Since IE 6 does n't support the : hover pseudo - element , we need a bit of JavaScript ( shamelessly stolen from the Suckerfish Dropdowns method ) to fake it .
startList = function ( ) { if ( document.all && document.getElementById ) { var navRoot = document.getElementById(" trans-nav " ) ; for ( i=0 ; i< navRoot.childNodes.length ; i++) { var node = navRoot.childNodes[i ] ; if ( node.nodeName== " LI " ) { node.onmouseover=function ( ) { this.className+= " over " ; } node.onmouseout=function ( ) { this.className=this.className.replace ( " over " , " " ) ; } } } } } window.onload=startList ;
And there you have it !
The above demos do n't work , in IE , since TinyMCE keeps messing with my code , but you can see the final version .
What a Soldier in Afghanistan Needs : Chow , Bullets , Mail ' It 's sad that I can say it , but I love getting shot at . '
FORWARD OPERATING BASE MIZAN , Afghanistan , July 29 , 2009  --
On this lonely little outpost , where the soldiers urinate into tubes stuck into the ground and there is only enough water to shower every couple of days , men call themselves " grunts " with pride .
The men -- and they are all men , all 40 or so of them– of Bravo Company , 1st Battalion , 4th Infantry Regiment , will live on this base for nine months , following three months of training .
There are no women , save an occasional visitor .
There are pictures of half naked girls on the walls .
There is a homemade basketball court , there are video games , there are guitars , there is poker ( though they 've tired of that of late ) , and there is lots of cracking up over YouTube clips on computers in the dining hall .
This story is part of an ABCNews.com series THE FIGHT FOR AFGHANISTAN , WHERE WE STAND .
The complete series so far can be found on this site 's NEWS page .
But mostly there is talk of war , of " destroying " the enemy .
These men are trained to kill , and while the battle is much more complex than that , in most of their minds , killing is the mission .
" I love stinking .
I love climbing mountains .
It 's sad that I can say it , but I love getting shot at .
It 's better than any drug , any alcohol , any fast car , anything .
It 's the adrenalin rush from heaven , " says 30 - year - old Specialst John Tuerck , looking up toward the sky which , at this particular moment , is blocked by the sandbag - covered roof just a few feet above his bed .
Click here for a map of Zabul province
" Some people say it 's kind of like a God - lite persona .
But for me , it 's just -- and I can probably say for a lot of guys -- it 's just something we 're good at .
You know , seek and destroy the enemy .
That 's what we were trained to do .
That 's what we came here to do .
It 's what we love to do .
Ca n't beat it . "
On and off the base , life is a mix of adrenalin and patience .
And while the soldiers are inspired by the former , they need heavy doses of the latter .
Platoons will usually conduct patrols three or four times a week , and so soldiers spend entire days inside the wire , trying to keep busy .
Home Away from Home
In Tuerck 's room , 19 - year - old Private Josh Rouse gives a tour of what the men who live here call " the submarine . "
From front to back the room is only 20 feet long and sleeps five men .
The walkway from the front door to the back of the room , flanked on either side by bunks , is no more than a foot or two wide .
A series of shelves in the middle of the room is the closest thing they have to a communal storage facility : ammunition on the bottom , remote control cars and planes on top , hygiene products in the middle .
" But it 's about to get knocked out because we 're getting an X - Box , " Rouse says with a smile .
Video games over hygiene ?
" An X - Box is well needed . "
Until the X - Box arrives , these men spend their nights playing what they spend their days doing for real : a war game called Battlefield .
" When we 're not working on trucks , when we have down time , that 's what we do , " Rouse says .
" Or we 'll sit here and make fun of each other . "
They call Rouse " the kid " because of his age .
Another member of the bunk is compared to an " out of shape action figure " because , well , he looks like an out of shape action figure .
Another is simply " giggles . "
In the chow hall , about 20 feet away , the Afghan interpreter everyone calls " Skeletor " laughs as he stares into a communal computer screen .
Yahoo Messenger chirps away in the corner but most of his attention is on a YouTube clip .
He is gawking at " Car Crashes 4 , " having watched the first three iterations over the last hour .
" This is the f'ing s# %t , " he says to no one in particular , using the English diction he often resorts to .
He calls a couple of the other translators over and they sit mesmerized as a criminal , now on foot after crashing his car , is tackled by police .
Nearby , five not - so - hot hotplates hold the night 's meal : fried chicken , which seems to be included in every meal , regardless of the time of day ; some pasta ; and the evening 's entrée , lobster .
The men do not seem to be worried that the closest sea is hundreds of miles away , on the other side of Iran .
Nor do they seem to be concerned that the only vegetables they consume come from cans of V8 .
" Chow , bullets , and mail .
It 's all they need , " quips the lead enlisted officer on the base .
He grabs the tongs and fishes out a lobster tail .
" Red Lobster right here !
Mizan 's finest ! "
In a quieter moment a few feet away , the man the soldiers call " Doc " ( he 's the chief medic on base ) logs on to Skype .
There are about 10 computers in the dining hall , all of which are attached to the Internet and have messenger programs connected to video cameras .
The military calls this part of the base " MWR " – morale , welfare , and recreation .
A Message from Home
On screen , Doc 's young son runs across the living room of his house , back in Hoensfeld , Germany , where these men are based .
His wife walks onto the screen and bounces a beach ball against their son's head .
All three laugh .
" It 's what keeps me going , " he says after disconnecting from his conversation .
" I know I got to get back to my son and back to my wife .
It keeps me pushing through the days and through all the rough stuff that they throw at me here . "
His deputy , Specialist Ryan Cuehlo , prefers the electric guitar .
After returning from a firefight in the valley immediately behind the base , he sits next to his bed and plugs into the amp .
Out comes Metallica , some blues , and an original song ( no name , though , since he says he does n't write lyrics . )
" It 's the best stress reliever I got out here , especially if it's a long day , " says Cuehlo , who is from New Jersey .
" Kills the time . "
The Americans share the base with four Romanian troops , about 75 Afghan police and soldiers , and a mascot : FOB Dog , or Forward Operating Base Dog .
The soldiers have raised her , and she meanders out with them on mission , seemingly unafraid during the firefights .
There are a dozen or so buildings here , surrounded by barbed wire , Hesco barriers , and tall mountain peaks .
The Mizan valley is a mostly completed bowl .
A crumbling and almost empty district center is attached to the base , and both are nestled into the side of a valley that is closed with mountains on three sides .
It is a beautiful corner of the country and one of the most austere .
Around the base there is nothing but the moon to obscure the stars .
There is no electricity , few roads , and the tallest structure is their 15 - foot - tall safe house .
The hills are rocky and jagged , but the stuff of postcards .
Small Afghan security outposts sit on the tops of most of the surrounding peaks ; desert and occasional orchards extend for hundreds of miles in each direction .
" This world is completely untouched , but it 's just absolutely beautiful , " says Lt. Patrick Higgins , the sole officer on this base .
Two years ago the 24 - year - old graduated from ROTC at the University of Colorado , Boulder .
Today he is virtually in charge of this district , where there is no national government representative or any American mentor for the Afghan troops , as there is in larger bases .
Mail for Morale
In his spartan bedroom , he shows off his bed , a map of the district on the wall ( so he can " dream up missions " ) , and a personal phone line .
" Other than that , just a few things I brought from home .
Keep myself entertained .
I got my guitar , " he says .
" It 's fairly simple living .
But infantrymen do n't require much . "
One amenity they cannot live without is mail call .
On one recent delivery day , among the Amazon.com boxes , the UPS packages and the Victoria 's Secret catalogues , an unmarked box was quickly opened by Specialist Gines .
His smile was immediate as he pulled out three cases of what may not seem too useful in a war zone : brand new , glittery Dolce & Gabanna sunglasses .
" Let me see them ! " yelled one of his friends .
" Put them on one more time ! "
The soldiers were practically bouncing with excitement .
" There it is !
Platinum status !
Peter Pan. Timbaland !
Never Never Land ! "
" Dolce and Gabanna .
Finest , " smiles Gines .
Apparently worried someone might think he had ordered fakes , he pulls out the monogrammed cleaning cloth that came with each set of glasses .
" Originals , " he smiles , carefully polishing the perfectly clear lenses .
" Mail brings up morale a lot .
A lot , " he says , carefully placing each pair of sunglasses back into their cases .
" If we not on a mission or something like that , mail comes in , everybody 's happy .
Chow may suck , but as long as we get mail , we good . "
Advocates of strict typing systems often tell the reliability bedtime story when explaining why looser type systems give them the howling fantods .
They 're not entirely wrong , either .
Quick , what 's the problem with this Perl code ?
no strict ' refs ' ; *{ $ classname . ': :' .
$ subname } = sub { ... } ;
Do n't worry if you do n't get it immediately .
It 's subtle : within the body of the anonymous sub , you have to enable strict reference checking or Perl will silently ignore any symbolic references .
Maybe that 's not a problem for the person who first wrote that code .
He or she knew exactly what to write and made no typos .
Great !
I wish I were that careful and fortunate .
I can think of very few reliable , maintained Perl 5 programs which do n't have strict enabled in the broadest scope .
Our community practices and our tooling and our default idioms ( whether enabled by language or convention ) shape the way we think and behave .
Now imagine what might happen six months later when someone else ( or the original developer ) needs to make a change to that code .
Would you remember that strict ' refs ' is off in that code ?
( I believe I owe credit to Joshua ben Jore for first mentioning this problem ; it 's an example of a poorly recognized problem from the Tower of Defaults . )
The solution in this case is to ensure that loosening strictures occurs in the smallest sufficient possible scope .
A similar principle exists for both physical and virtual security .
A better version of that code might be :
my $ subref = sub { ... } ; { no strict ' refs ' ; *{ $ classname . ': :' .
$ subname } = $ subref ; }
Not only does the tight scoping limit the effects of disabling strict references , it gives visual cues to maintainers that something different is happening .
Proceed with mindfulness .
This is even a user interface principle : make exceptions obvious .
Rafael believes that strictperl is a broken idea , so immediately obviously bad that it 's suitable only for a source filter .
One of his gripes is that it does not run the vars pragma nor Exporter unmodified .
He 's right .
It unrepentently does not .
Rafael says that the " very purpose [ of vars and Exporter ] is to manipulate symbols by name , which is exactly the kind of thing that strict prevents . "
He 's right about that too .
Follow those links , though .
Look at the implementations of Exporter and vars .
Count the lines of each that absolutely cannot run with all strictures enabled .
Count the remaining lines .
Done ?
Great .
Now tell me with a straight face that foundational core libraries that have been in Perl 5 for fifteen years are paranoid enough .
These modules do not have to break under strictperl .
They could run unchanged ( as far as everything else which uses them notices ) .
There are no backwards - incompatible changes by modifying them to disable strictures in the smallest necessary scopes .
If strict is useful enough that you use it in all programs you expect to maintain , if you believe it protects you against problems you did n't expect , even if you have a copious test suite , tell me that it 's not worth even asking if it 's useful for the more than 90 % of code in vars and Exporter ( just as examples ) that does not need to disable strictures .
You may believe that this is a silly , dumb , useless experiment I 've wasted my time writing C and portable Make rules when I could have written a frivolous little source filter .
You may be right .
Feel free to ignore it , mock it , file bug reports about it , whatever you like .
Yet I believe this stupid little experiment may be useful -- not just for people who want to practice exception - based strictures ( strict by default : exceptions as necessary ) but also for people who would like to make future problems even less likely to occur , especially in Perl 5 's core library itself .
( Is n't that one great way to measure maintainability ? )
Limiting the scope of loosened strictures is by no means the only way to improve the reliability and maintainability of serious programs , but why not take advantage of the possibility to do so ?
Crows often get a bad rap .
In many Western cultures , they 've historically been associated with death , disease , and bad omens ; reviled as crop -stealers by farmers , and condemned as nuisances by city dwellers .
But the birds are fascinating creatures , adaptable and brainy to an extent that 's almost scary .
Here are a few facts about these crafty corvids that might surprise you .
1 . All crows and ravens belong to the same genus .
Members of the genus Corvus can be found on every continent except Antarctica and South America ( although other close relatives live there ) .
To date , scientists have named 40 species .
Colloquially , some of them are referred to as ravens while others are called crows , rooks , or jackdaws .
Historically , the name raven has been given to several of the big - bodied Corvus birds with shaggy feathers on their necks .
Mid -sized members of the genus are usually called crows , while the very smallest species go by the name jackdaws .
There 's also a large - beaked outlier known as the rook , which was named after the unusual sound it makes .
But pervasive as these labels may be , they 're not scientific and do not reflect the latest research .
Despite its informal name , the so - called Australian raven is more closely akin to the Torresian crow than it is to the common raven .
In the U.S. , when people talk about crows and ravens , they 're usually referring to the American crow ( Corvus brachyrhynchos ) and the common raven ( Corvus corax ) .
Telling them apart can be tough , but it is possible for eagle - eyed birders .
One big indicator is size :
The common raven is much larger , about the size of a red - tailed hawk .
It also has a more wedge - shaped tail .
As Kevin J. McGowan of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology writes on his crow FAQ page , ravens soar longer than crows , and you can see through their wing feathers as they fly ( among other differences ) .
And the birds ' calls are substantially different .
" American crows make the familiar caw - caw , but also have a large repertoire of rattles , clicks , and even clear bell - like notes , " McGowan writes , whereas common ravens have " a deep , reverberating croaking or gronk - gronk .
Only occasionally will a raven make a call similar to a crow 's caw , but even then it is so deep as to be fairly easily distinguished from a real crow . "
You can hear crow vocalizations here and raven vocalizations here .
2 . Older crow siblings can help their parents raise newborn chicks .
Like a lot of intelligent animals , most crows are quite social .
For instance , American crows spend most of the year living in pairs ( they usually mate for life ) or small family groups .
During the winter months , they 'll congregate with hundreds or even thousands of their peers to sleep together at night in a sprawling communal unit called a roost .
Come nesting season , a mated pair of crows might be lucky enough to receive chick - rearing help .
Juvenile birds are frequently seen defending their parents ' nest from predators .
Other services they can provide include bringing food to mom and dad , or feeding their younger siblings directly .
One study found that 80 percent of American crow nests surveyed had a helping hand .
And some birds become regular nest assistants , providing aid to their parents for over half a decade .
3 . When a crow dies , its neighbors may have a funeral .
The sight of a dead crow tends to attract a mob of a hundred or more live ones .
During this ritual , the live crows almost never touch the dead one , which rules scavenging out as a motive .
Why do they do this ?
Some studies suggest that the mass gathering is part of a survival strategy :
The birds are learning about threats and seem hesitant to revisit any spot where they 've encountered a dead crow , even if food is plentiful there .
4. Crows have caused blackouts in Japan .
Since the 1990s , crows have experienced a population boom in Japan , where — not coincidentally — delicious garbage is more plentiful than ever before .
This is bad news for power companies .
Urban crows like to nest on electric transformers and will often use wire hangers or fiber - optic cables as building materials for their nests .
The result was an epidemic of crow - caused blackouts in major cities around Japan : Between 2006 and 2008 , the corvids stole almost 1400 fiber - optic cables from Tokyo power providers , and according to the Chubu electric company , crows are responsible for around 100 power failures per year in their facilities alone .
To fight back , Chubu started installing artificial " love nests " in 2004 .
Made with non-conductive resin , the nests are placed on company towers high above the power lines , where the birds are unlikely to cause any trouble .
The strategy seems to be working : 67 percent of the faux nests are currently in use , making life a lot easier for Chubu employees .
5. Proportionally , some crows ' brains are bigger than yours .
According to McGowan , crows are " smarter than many undergraduates , but probably not as smart as ravens . "
Crows are so smart and so good at improvising that some zoologists admiringly call them " feathered apes . "
And yet , from a primate 's perspective , crow brains might look puny .
The New Caledonian crow , for example , has a brain that weighs just 0.26 ounces .
But relative to its body size , that brain is huge , accounting for 2.7 percent of the bird 's overall weight .
By comparison , an adult human 's three - pound brain represents 1.9 percent of their body weight .
Of all the living birds , crows , ravens , and parrots have the biggest brain - to - body size ratios .
And in lab experiments , these avians show a degree of cognition that puts them on par with the great apes .
In fact , research has shown that they have a much higher density of neurons in their forebrains than primates do .
The amount of neurons in this region is thought to correlate with a given animal 's intelligence .
Theoretically , having more neurons translates to better cognitive reasoning .
A 2020 study looked at whether crows , like humans and great apes , can demonstrate consciousness .
Crow brains lack a cerebral cortex , where most of the primate brain 's conscious perception happens .
Researchers tracked the brain activity in two crows as they performed different tasks , and discovered that they could perceive sensory input — suggesting that there is much more to understand about the evolution of consciousness .
6. Crows have regional dialects .
Apart from the famous caw , caw noise , crows emit a number of other sounds .
Each one sends out a different message ; for example , cawing can be used as a territorial warning or a way for crows to signal their location to relatives .
This avian language is n't homogeneous ; two different populations of crows may have slight differences .
As ornithologist John M. Marzluff and author Tony Angell noted in their 2005 book In the Company of Crows and Ravens , the calls these birds use " vary regionally , like human dialects that can vary from valley to valley . "
If a crow changes its social group , the bird will try to fit in by talking like the popular guys .
" When crows join a new flock , " Marzluff and Angell wrote , " they learn the flock 's dialect by mimicking the calls of dominant flock members . "
7 . Some crows can read traffic lights .
In Japan , carrion crows ( Corvus corone ) use cars like oversized nutcrackers .
The birds have learned to take walnuts — a favorite treat — over to road intersections , where they put the hard - shelled snacks down onto the pavement .
The crow then waits for a passing vehicle to smash the nut , after which it will swoop down and eat the delicious interior .
It 's a risky trick , but the crows are n't usually run over because ( unlike some people ) they 've figured out what traffic lights mean .
Carrion crows wait until the light turns red before flying down to place the un-cracked nut on the road .
The second the light goes green , the crow takes off to watch the nut get run over from afar ; it will even wait for the next red to scoop up the nut 's insides .
This behavior is n't limited to just one corvid species : American crows have been observed doing the same thing in California .
8. Crows can recognize your face — and hold a grudge .
You do n't want a crow for an enemy .
In 2011 , a team from the University of Washington published a remarkable study about the brainpower of local crows .
The researchers ' goal was to figure out how well the birds could identify human faces .
So — in the name of science — they went out and bought two Halloween masks :
One resembled a caveman , the other looked like Dick Cheney .
It was decided that the caveman getup would be used to threaten the birds , while the Cheney mask was relegated to control status .
At the five sites , a scientist donned the caveman mask before catching and banding some wild crows .
Getting trapped is never a fun experience , and upon their release , the ex-captives loudly " scolded " their assailant with a threatening caw .
Seeing this , other birds who had been sitting nearby joined in the fray , swooping down to harass the neanderthalic visitor .
Over a period of several years , both masks were regularly worn by team members on strolls through all five test spots .
Without fail , the caveman mask was greeted by angry scolds and dive - bomb attacks from crows — including many who'd never been captured or banded — while the birds largely ignored the Dick Cheney mask .
Amazingly , the caveman disguise continued to provoke a hostile response five years into the experiment — even though the team had stopped trapping crows after those first few site visits .
And some of the birds who antagonized the mask - wearer were n't even alive back when the whole thing started .
The younger crows could n't possibly have seen the imitation caveman grab an acquaintance of theirs — but they scolded it anyway .
Clearly , the grudge had been passed on ; birds were still attacking the mask as recently as 2013 .
The moral of this story ?
Mind your manners around crows .
Because if you mistreat them , they wo n't forget you and neither will their friends — or the next generation .
9. New Caledonian crows make and use tools .
Lots of non-human animals , including chimpanzees and orangutans , create useful implements which help them survive in the wild .
The New Caledonian crow ( Corvus moneduloides ) is one of only two species on the planet that can craft its own hooks in the wild .
The other is called Homo sapiens .
The South Pacific avian uses the hooks — which are made from pliable twigs that the crows bend using their beaks and feet into a J - shape — to extract insects from tight crevices .
Another surprising attribute is this species ' bill .
Unlike virtually all other birds , the New Caledonian crow has a bill that does not curve downwards .
For years , the quirk went unexplained , but scientists now think that the avian 's unique beak evolved to help it grasp tools more easily , as well as to better see what the tool is doing .
The New Caledonian crow is n't the only implement expert in the corvid family .
In 2016 , scientists at the University of St. Andrews demonstrated that the ultra-rare Hawaiian crow , or ‘ Alalā ( Corvus hawaiiensis ) , is similarly adept at using and modifying tools .
10 . Crows fight off predators by ganging up on them .
Crows have to deal with a menagerie of predators , such as hawks , owls , coyotes , and raccoons .
To ward them off , the corvids exploit the fact that there can be strength in numbers .
Upon seeing a would - be attacker , crows are known to gather , with some groups consisting of a dozen birds or more .
Individual crows then swoop down to deliver passing blows with their beaks , often inflicting serious bodily injury in the process .
If all goes well , the target will back off — though it may kill a few of the dive - bombers before they retreat .
Corvids are by no means the only avians that mob would - be attackers .
Swallows , chickadees , and even hummingbirds have all been documented doing this .
In fact , crows are sometimes at the receiving end of mob violence as smaller songbirds often feel threatened by them and lash out collectively .
11 . Crows understand a thing or two about impulse control .
A 2014 study shows that at least some corvids can resist the urge for instant gratification — if you make it worth their while .
The research was led by University of Göttingen graduate student Friederike Hillemann , whose team assembled five common ravens and seven carrion crows .
Through careful note - taking , the scientists figured out what the favorite meal items of all 12 animals were .
Then the experiment began .
With an outstretched hand , one of the researchers gave each of their birds a morsel of food .
Then , the animals were shown a different piece of grub .
The corvids were made to understand that if they liked the second option better , they could swap snacks — but only if they were willing to sit patiently for a certain period of time first .
If a bird ate the original treat during that stretch , it forfeited the chance to trade it for a new one .
Hillemann 's results showed that the crows and ravens did n't mind waiting around for an improved snack option .
As such , a bird with a piece of bread was content to sit quietly if it knew that some fried pork fat would eventually be gained in the trade - off .
However , if that same bird 's second choice was another piece of bread , sitting tight would be pointless .
So understandably , corvids who were put in this kind of situation tended to go ahead and eat whatever they 'd been given .
Why wait for more of the same ?
12 . YOU CAN CALL A GROUP OF CROWS A MURDER , BUT SOME SCIENTISTS WOULD RATHER YOU DIDN'T .
According to the Oxford English Dictionary ( OED ) , the correct term for a group of crows is a murder , an expression bird - watchers and poets have been using since at least the 15th century , which the OED speculates may allude " to the crow 's traditional association with violent death , or … to its harsh and raucous cry . "
But maybe it 's time to come up with a replacement .
McGowan hates the phrase " murder of crows . "
To him , it only feeds the public 's negative outlook on the animals .
" These birds are n't a gang of nasty villains , " he wrote in the book Birdology .
" These birds are just birds . "
McGowan would also have you know that American crows rank among " the most family - oriented birds in the world . "
Be honest : have you ever responded to a spam e-mail ?
Do you know anyone who has ?
If you 're like most of us at Ars , you can't fathom why anyone would respond to most of the messages we get , but a new study released by the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group ( MAAWG ) shows that there are just enough people responding to make spamming worthwhile — especially since most spam these days is sent by botnets .
According to the group 's latest report , a disturbing number of e-mail users respond to spam , and not just because they 're dumb — some of them did so because they were actually interested in the product or service .
Shocking , we know .
Admitting the secret shame
The MAAWG conducted 800 interviews by phone and Internet across the US with people who had e-mail addresses not managed by a corporate IT staff .
It found that two - thirds of the group said that they were very or somewhat experienced with Internet security , and a majority used filters of some kind in order to avoid spam .
Eighty - two percent were aware of bots and botnets , though not many believed they were at risk of being victimized by one .
Slightly less than half ( 48 percent ) said that they have never clicked on a spam e-mail .
That 's the good news , but that means the other half have clicked on or responded to spam .
But why ?
The answers will undoubtedly horrify you .
A full 12 percent said that they were interested in the product or service being offered — those erection drug and mail order bride ads do reach a certain market , it appears .
Seventeen percent said that they made a mistake when they did so — understandable — but another 13 percent said they simply had no idea why they did it ; they just did .
Another six percent " wanted to see what would happen . "
( Interestingly , a larger percentage of people who were interviewed by phone said that they had never acted on a spam message compared to those who answered online .
Guess it 's true that users would rather not admit their foibles when speaking to a real person . )
" Although a small percentage of the computing population , these numbers still earn a significant enough return on investment to support a booming spam - driven underground economy , " wrote MAAWG .
Indeed , with spam making up a very large majority of all e-mail traffic —
Microsoft recently claimed it was at 97 percent — even low sellthrough rates are enough to make things very profitable .
With botnets supposedly sending more than 80 percent of that spam ( according to Symantec ) , there are now relatively few man-hours involved in making money from a spam - based business .
Just set it and forget it .
It 's hard to believe that so many people respond to spammers for any reason — much less because they actually want to buy something , but that 's human nature for you .
Glancing through my spam folder , the offers range from setting me up with a " lovely Russian woman TODAY !!!! " to " amazing " work from home opportunities ( joke 's on them — I already work from home ) .
Needless to say , I 'm not responding , but someone is .
Have you ever responded to spam ?
I ’ve always told friends to do something fun , document it , then repeat it the next day .
Stefan does exactly this , with his Stormtroopers 365 collection .

WASHINGTON , July 12 ( Reuters ) - The CIA withheld information from Congress about a secret counterterrorism program on orders from former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney , a leading U.S. senator said on Sunday .
Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told Fox News Sunday that CIA Director Leon Panetta disclosed Cheney 's involvement when he briefed members of Congress two weeks ago .
She said Panetta told them he had canceled the program .
President Barack Obama appointed Panetta to head the agency early this year .
The still - secret program , which The New York Times said never became operational , began after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States .
News of Cheney 's involvement , first reported by the Times late on Saturday , prompted an outpouring of criticism by Obama 's fellow Democrats and support by rival Republicans in Congress .
Feinstein , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said : " Director Panetta did brief us two weeks ago -- I believe it was on the 24th of June -- ... and , as had been reported , did tell us that he was told that the vice president had ordered that the program not be briefed to the Congress . "
Feinstein and Democrat Patrick Leahy , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , insisted no one should go outside the law .
Asked about Cheney 's involvement , Leahy told CBS 's Face the Nation : " I 'd like to know if it 's true or not .
I mean , nobody in this country is above the law ...
You can't have somebody say , well , if you 're vice president , you do n't have to obey the law . "
Feinstein said Congress " should have been told " about the secret problem and that the vice president should n't be above the law .
" This is a big problem , because the law is very clear .
And I understand the need of the day , which was when America was in shock " after Sept. 11 , she said on Fox .
" But ... I think you weaken your case when you go outside of the law . "
Cheney was a key advocate in the Bush administration of using controversial interrogation methods such as waterboarding on terrorism suspects and has emerged as a leading Republican critic of Obama 's national security policies .
Since Obama took over from President George W. Bush on Jan. 20 , Cheney has engaged in an increasingly contentious battle with the new administration over the CIA interrogation procedures that undermined the United States 's reputation around the world .
In one of his first acts as president , Obama ordered more humane treatment for terrorism suspects .
Panetta has vowed not to allow coercive interrogation practices , secret prisons or the transfer of terrorist suspects to countries that may use torture , a pledge seen as a break with the agency 's policies under Bush .
Republican Senator Jeff Sessions , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , told " Face the Nation " he said he believed the Cheney allegations will be investigated .
Asked if he expected the situation to be looked into , Sessions said : " Well , I 'm sure it will be . "
" I do n't know what the facts are .
But I believe that Vice President Cheney served his country with as much fidelity as he could possibly give to it .
And he tried to serve us in an effective way .
And I hope that nothing like this would impact on his outstanding record . "
Schizophrenic Man Terrifies Kids at Party
Usually I relegate PSAs to the sidebar , but this one is so good it needs more attention .
An anti-stigma message with a very clever twist .
This video , like all the PSAs ( public service announcements ) in my collection , is great for sharing in your blog , Facebook or MySpace profile , and anywhere you can paste embed code or links : help spread the word and fight mental health stigma and discrimination .
EDIT – also check out this talk by Austin Mardon , a person with schizophrenia who shares the effects of stigma on his life .
When Arne Hansen opened Solvang Restaurant in 1966 , he had two things going for him : a knack for cooking aebleskivers and a genius for marketing .
Today , when you drive through the small town just north of Santa Barbara , you can see the result .
The little Danish pastries are everywhere .
Aebleskivers are a type of pancake cooked in a special stove - top pan with half - spherical molds .
The center is soft and fluffy , almost creamy .
The crust is crisp and browned .
In Denmark , aebleskivers are traditionally plated in threes , dusted with powdered sugar , topped or filled with tart jams of Nordic berries and served with mellow Scandinavian coffee .
There , aebleskivers ( pronounced “ able- skEEvers ” ) have typically not been served in restaurants or for breakfast , but rather at the family table for afternoon coffee breaks .
On long and cold Nordic winter evenings , they are served with glogg .
In the wintertime , aebleskivers are often sold by street vendors .
A symbol of community and hospitality , they are very popular at Scandinavian charity and open - air events .

For Danish expatriates , they have a strong pull .
“ When I was little , my mother used to make them for me , after a recipe from her mom , ” reminisces Rikke Christensen , who now lives in Los Angeles .
“ Just the aroma brings back memories of quality time spent with my mom . ”
Christensen ’s mom , Judy Malmberg , still lives in Denmark .
Christensen fondly remembers cranking out many thousands of aebleskivers while volunteering at Lions Club fundraisers .
Today , aebleskivers can even be found in frozen form in some markets ( although purists scoff at the notion ) .

Quest for perfection
Advertisement
While mixing the batter is not difficult , the two most important keys to cooking aebleskivers are a good pan and the right technique .
Hansen , who lives near Solvang , is a master of both .
In fact , his home is a veritable museum to the humble pastry .
Displayed throughout the house and in lovingly preserved scrapbooks ( compiled by Hansen ’s wife , Telma ) are colorful postcards , letters , newspaper articles , an aebleskiver pan the size of a penny ( for decorative purposes only ) , a big one made from hammered copper and other mementos dedicated to the famous family treat .
Hansen immigrated to the U.S. five decades ago .
Affectionately known as “ Mr. Aebleskiver ” among his fans , he has been perfecting his tools and methods for more than 40 years , trying all kinds of pans and testing more recipes than he can recall .
But he really made his mark at his restaurant , where he turned out fresh aebleskivers for breakfast , lunch and dinner -- next to an open window , so that the scent would waft out into the street .
“ Soon the word spread and people lined up for them all day long , ” he remembers .
Advertisement
Hansen sold his restaurant 20 years ago and has since built a mini-empire of sorts around the aebleskiver .
Over the Internet and in neighborhood stores , he sells a huge selection of pans as well as jams and a ready - for - use aebleskiver batter mix .
There are many recipes for the batter , but they generally fall into two categories : those made with baking soda ( or baking powder ) as a leavening agent , or those made with yeast .
The batters vary in texture and flavor -- and yeasted batters take a bit more patience to prepare and will expand more in the pan -- and which you prefer is a matter of personal taste .

The pan ’s progress
Advertisement
The earliest known aebleskiver pans , Hansen says , are more than 300 years old and were made from hammered copper .
But bare copper proved to be far from ideal and was soon succeeded by cast iron , which distributes heat more evenly and forms a natural nonstick surface .
Today , pans are also made from aluminum with nonstick coating .
Treated properly , cast iron lasts for generations and produces a superior crust and texture .
Unlike aluminum , it also works on induction stoves .
“ If you do n’t want any hassle , if you want perfect results every time , if you are cooking on an electric stove , coated aluminum pans are your best choice , ” Hansen says .
“ But if you are cooking on gas and if you do not mind the special care involved with cast iron , a heavy iron pan will work for you . ”
Tested side - by - side , the differences were interesting .
Hansen ’s nonstick aluminum model worked well .
The aebleskivers were easy to turn and their crusts came out even , smooth and finely textured .
Controlling the temperature was easy as well .
Advertisement
By comparison , the Lodge cast - iron pan proved to be more temperamental and challenging .
But with practice , it did produce impressive results .
The iron pan created a more aromatic crust with a rustic quality and an enhanced contrast between the exterior and interior textures .
On the downside , cast - iron pans must be carefully seasoned , and one needs to pay close attention to timing and temperature , adjusting as needed .
This requires a bit of patience and practice .
But focusing too much on the details is a little beside the point .
Old iron or new aluminum , yeast or no yeast -- even Danes will disagree .
The one thing they can agree on , as Hansen found , is that when it comes to aebleskivers , what really matters is making them and sharing them .

Sex offender register breaches THEIR rights - paedophiles can apply to ' clean the slate ' , say judges
Paedophiles and rapists yesterday won the right to have their names removed from the Sex Offenders Register in a landmark human rights ruling .
Appeal Court judges ruled sex offenders who no longer pose a threat should be given the chance to have their names wiped off the police database .
The decision has outraged victims ' groups who fear sexual predators will commit further crimes without any restrictions or supervision of their movements .
The case comes after two convicted sex attackers , including a child rapist , went to the High Court arguing that being on the register for life was a breach of their human rights .
Landmark decision :
The Court Of Appeal ruled that sex offenders who no longer pose a threat will have their names removed from the police database
Currently those given a jail sentence of more than 30 months for sex crimes are placed on the register indefinitely .
That means they have to notify the authorities of any change of address or name and any foreign travel plans .
But Lord Justice Dyson said it was ' disproportionate ' to keep an offender 's name on it forever .
The court ruled the 2003 Sexual Offenders
Act was incompatible with a criminal 's right to a private and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights .
Yesterday the Home Office announced it would appeal against the ruling which legal experts predict will force Parliament to change the law .
Once that happens , thousands of sex offenders will be able to demand reviews of their cases and that their names be removed from the register and police databases .
There are currently 31,392 sex offenders on the register .
Furious campaigners last night blasted the decision .
Spokesman for the National Victims ' Association Neil Atkinson said : ' It 's an appalling decision .
' This is a category of crime that is tremendously difficult to monitor because the criminals themselves have been proven to lie to authorities about their possibility of reoffending .'
The test case was first brought before the High Court last year by a child rapist who argued his name should be taken off the register because it prevented him from going on family holidays .
The teenager from Wigan , identified only as ' F ' , was just 11 when he was convicted of raping a child under 13 and other sexual offences in 2005 .
He was handed a 30 - month youth custody sentence at Liverpool Crown Court and placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life .
But he complained he was unable to go on a family holiday in 2007 due to restrictions placed on foreign travel .
There were also concerns that having his name on the Sex Offenders Register would damage his career prospects .
Those on the register are allowed to keep their passports and travel abroad if they notify police about their plans .
Police would only impose a travel ban if they received specific intelligence to suggest the offender planned to commit offences abroad .
The High Court also considered the rights of another sex offender , Angus Aubrey Thompson , 51 , from Newcastle , who was jailed for five years in 1996 for indecent assaults on a girl .
He was released on licence in 2000 and has since suffered a series of heart attacks and is stricken by arthritis .
The court heard that the stress of being kept indefinitely on the Sex Offenders Register had contributed to his ill health .
The verdict concludes a case that began in December last year when High Court judges ruled that keeping offenders ' names permanently on the register without review violated their human rights .
Yesterday a Home Office bid to overturn the ruling was rejected in the Court of Appeal .

Alex Jones ’ highly anticipated documentary lifts the lid on how seductive tools of propaganda are being used to hypnotize the masses into accepting tyranny
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , August 25 , 2009
Alex Jones ’ highly anticipated upcoming documentary Fall of the Republic : The Presidency of Barack Obama boldly lifts the lid and unveils the fraud behind Brand Obama and how the globalists are using their newest , and slickest ever puppet to destroy the last vestiges of America ’s freedom , Constitution and economy , all while helping the bankers loot the country clean .
The film exposes the agenda that Obama was put in place to accomplish , a world government allied with a bank of the world run by globalist eugenicists hell - bent on destroying America ’s first world status and replacing it with a hollow shell of tyranny .
The mind control , the television programming , and all the media talking points that serve to reinforce the image of Brand Obama are laid bare , unveiling the naked ruth , as legendary author and documentary film maker John Pilger recently discussed , that Obama is nothing more than a corporate marketing creation , a skilled hypnotist using seductive tools of propaganda – race , gender and class – to hoodwink the masses into accepting his rhetoric while ignoring the contradiction of his actions .
The film exposes how Brand Obama says one thing – to make people buy into the brand – and then the real Obama does another .
The burgeoning police state , warrantless wiretapping , secret arrests , indefinite detention of citizens , torture , the war in Afghanistan , the war in Pakistan , have all been expanded under Brand Obama despite his promises to reverse them all .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The real question to ask is not which class Obama claims to represent or fight for , but which class Obama serves .
Fall of the Republic leaves no room for doubt that the class Obama serves is the elite and it is their agenda he is diligently following .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
In terms of focused research and factual content , Fall of the Republic dominates even The Obama Deception for hardcore evidence and documented material .
The film proves how Obama was put in power to cement the gains of tyranny and oppression achieved under Bush while the masses slept , lulled into a deep hypnosis with empty promises of change , hope and progress .
The movie picks up from where The Obama Deception left off , highlighting how Obama has continued and expanded the socialized financial takeover introduced by Bush and how the bankster gangster cronies have made off with trillions in taxpayer ’s money , bankrupting the future of the country for generations to come .
The hypocrisy and underlying deceit of people like Al Gore , John P. Holdren and Obama himself are displayed in plain view as the cap and trade hoax is demolished and revealed to be nothing less than a total takeover of the American economy , its infrastructure , and a mandate to micromanage every aspect of every citizen ’s private life .
Obama ’s role in converting American from a free market , free Republic , to a command and control state - run oligarchy controlled by offshore banking interests is explored at length in the documentary .
In order to make this the most hard - hitting documentary we have ever released , the biggest budget ever allocated to a single movie was made available , primarily for the purpose of traveling all over the country to conduct no less than 19 separate sit down interviews for the film .
Personalities who will appear in the movie include Gerald Celente , Alan Watt , Jesse Ventura , climatologist Tim Ball , economist John Perkins , the Oath Keepers , Dr. Sherry Tenpenny , Webster Tarpley , Bob Bowman , Wayne Madsen and George Humphrey .
Fall of the Republic is an unprecedented two hour romp through the highly concentrated and brazen levels of tyranny and corruption displayed by Obama and his administration in the short period since they took office .
The end of the movie is encapsulated by the idea that the fight to maintain and restore a free Republic is a constant struggle against those who harbor the virus of evil in their souls .
Fall of the Republic will be available first exclusively for Prison Planet.tv members on October 21st .
If you are not yet a member , click here to get your subscription and enjoy high quality streaming and download of the movie immediately upon its release .
Pre-orders for the DVD will be taken on September 21st at the Infowars shopping cart .

Avigdor Lieberman , Israel 's foreign minister , has triggered fresh controversy by urging diplomats abroad to use a 1941 photograph of a Palestinian religious leader meeting Hitler to counter protests against a planned Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem .
The hard right Mr Lieberman ordered the circulation to Israeli embassies of copies of the notorious wartime photograph of Hitler meeting the then Mufti of Jerusalem , an overt sympathiser with the Nazis who helped them raise an SS division in Bosnia .
The move has alarmed some experienced Israeli diplomats who believe it will be counterproductive .
It came after the US State Department expressed its disapproval to Michael Oren , the Israeli ambassador in Washington , over plans to build at least 20 apartments for Jewish settlers at the site of the old Shepherd 's Hotel building in the inner East Jerusalem district of Sheikh Jarrah .
The building was once used as a headquarters of the Mufti , a member of the one of the most prominent Palestinian families in Jerusalem .
The Palestinian nationalist Faisal al - Husseini , grand nephew of the Mufti , was a frequent interlocutor and strong advocate of peace moves with Israel in his later years until his death in 2001 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The plans for the Shepherd 's Hotel site have highlighted a continuing rift between much of the international community and Israel over the latter 's continued settlement building in East Jerusalem .
The site was bought in the 1980s by a company controlled by Irving Moskowitz , a major benefactor of of right wing settler groups .
While the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is deep in negotiations with US officials over the settlement freeze in the West Bank being demanded by President Obama , he made it clear this week he will not be deterred from sanctioning continued building for Jews in East Jerusalem .
Israel 's sovereignty over the whole of the city " cannot be challenged " , he said .
Israel unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem – unlike the West Bank which it did not seek to annex – after the 1967 Six - Day War and officially regards the city as the undivided capital of Israel .
But most Western governments do not recognise the annexation and back the Palestinians ' call for East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state .
One Israeli official in Jerusalem said of Mr Lieberman 's move : " If the issue here is sovereignty over Jerusalem then passing on a historical photograph like this completely misses the point ...
It has nothing to do with it . "
The Foreign Ministry confined itself to repeating Mr Lieberman 's explanation that the photograph had been sent out so that " the facts are known " .
George Mitchell , President Obama 's Middle East Envoy is due to meet Mr Netanyahu to discuss the settlement freeze issue early next week .
One Israeli official has predicted that the Prime Minister would go further than previous governments in ordering a moratorium on West Bank settlement building .
The US has demanded a freeze to help kick - start peace negotiations with the moderate Palestinian leadership in Ramallah .
The Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said he will not accept Mr Netanyhau 's invitation to talks without it .
But when it comes to East Jerusalem , Mr Netanyahu has made it clear he will follow previous governments – including that of his predecessor Ehud Olmert – by continuing to allow building there .
Ahead of tomorrow 's Cabinet meeting , he insisted that " residents of Jerusalem may purchase apartments in all parts of the city " .
He added : " In recent years hundreds of apartments in Jewish neighbourhoods and in the western part of the city have been purchased by – or rented to – Arab residents and we did not interfere ...
This is the policy of an open city , an undivided city that has no separation according to religion or national affiliation . "
Amid protests from other governments , the French foreign ministry summoned Israel 's ambassador Daniel Shek this week to re-state its opposition to settlement building , including in east Jerusalem .
Some Palestinian Jerusalem residents have rented apartments in some Jewish settlements in outer East Jerusalem .
A prominent anti-settlement Israeli lawyer Daniel Seidemann said this week that most land in West Jerusalem was state land which precludes those other than Israeli citizens – a category which includes Arab citizens of Israel – from purchasing property on it .
Most Palestinian Jerusalemites are legal residents but not Israeli citizens .
While Palestinian ID holders are not precluded from buying property on private land in West Jerusalem , Mr Seidemann did not know of any who had ; this was for " social cultural and economic reasons " .
The Mufti and the Fuhrer : A meeting of like minds
As the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem at the outbreak of the Second World War , Mohammad Amin al - Husayni was a powerful Nazi sympathiser – and an assassination target for the Allies .
The moment that ensured his permanent notoriety came in 1941 , when he was pictured with Adolf Hitler in Berlin .
Al - Husayni was there to lobby Adolf Hitler for a declaration in favour of Arab nationalism and against a Jewish homeland .
Hitler refused the request for tactical reasons , but the Mufti later recollected that he had sworn " the suppression of the Jewish national homeland is part of my battle " .
Few now dispute that he was an anti-Semite ; whether he is still relevant is debatable .
After he died , the hotel at the centre of the current dispute was bought by an American - Jewish millionaire .
When Marla Messing left her mark on the world stage a decade ago , it was not in the way she first imagined .
As a youngster , Messing was inspired by Olga Korbut and Cathy Rigby and envisioned a future as an Olympic gymnast .
Instead , burned out on gymnastics in her teens , she settled for being “ the Peter Ueberroth of the Women ’s World Cup . ”
That ’s how Messing , 45 , describes her role as CEO and president of the soccer spectacle that unexpectedly swept U.S. sports fans off their feet in the summer of 1999 .

The three - week tournament , which ended 10 years ago this week with the U.S. defeating China in the championship match at the Rose Bowl and Brandi Chastain famously stripping off her jersey , was history ’s most successful women ’s athletic event .
“ Beyond our wildest dreams , ” Messing says of the extraordinary interest that was generated that summer .
“ Remember , this was women ’s soccer . . . so we ’re talking about a women ’s event in sort of a marginal sport .
It was lightning in a bottle . ”
The event drew more than 650,000 fans , including Jack Nicholson and President Clinton , who were among the 90,185 on hand for the Rose Bowl finale .
Clinton rushed to the locker room to congratulate the winners after the championship match , which attracted nearly as many television viewers -- 40 million -- as the NBA Finals .
An obviously smitten David Letterman dubbed the team “ babe city ” and declared himself team owner .
Afterward , the event was featured not only on the cover of Sports Illustrated , which was surprising enough , but also on the covers of Newsweek , Time and People , the latter of which declared the U.S. team “ the pop culture story of the year . ”

Ten years later , Messing still seems to have a hard time digesting it all .
During a lunchtime interview at a Brentwood eatery near her home , she says of the hoopla inspired by the tournament , “ None of that was part of our planning . ”
Which is not to say Messing doubted the potential widespread appeal of the event .
It was she who ignored skeptics and led the push to turn it into a major happening .
“ She orchestrated it all , ” Julie Foudy , who captained the U.S. team , says in a phone interview .
“ It was phenomenal in a lot of different ways because there were a lot of people telling us to do it on a regional scale , do it in smaller stadiums , play it safe .
“ But Marla , thankfully , was of a mind - set that we could pull off something greater and that it should be done on a larger scale and that it deserved the world ’s attention . ”

FIFA , soccer ’s international governing body , wanted the event to be staged in small stadiums along the East Coast , Messing explains , but she believed its appeal was broader and that it could be sustained in larger stadiums from coast to coast .
That was due in part to her belief in Team USA , which was led by popular scoring sensation Mia Hamm and was a prohibitive favorite after winning Olympic gold three years earlier in front of an adoring , overflow crowd in Atlanta .
“ You could see that people connected with this team , ” says Messing , a lawyer .
“ First of all , they were great athletes , beautiful role models , All - American girls , attractive , intelligent , educated .
Plus , they loved the sport and were willing to give back to the fans . ”
A mother of three daughters , ages 8 , 10 and 12 , Messing admits that she too was enthralled by the U.S. team .

“ I feel tremendously proud to have been a part of it , in whatever small way that I was , ” she says of the watershed event she shaped , “ but that team owns that moment in history . ”
Sister - in - law of actress Debra Messing , the former CEO has devoted the last 10 years to reconnecting with her family .
Her husband , Brett , is a hedge - fund manager .
Though she tackles intermittent projects and sits on the board of the Southern California Committee for the Olympic Games , which bids to bring future Games to the region , Messing is “ primarily a stay - at - home mom , ” she says .
“ But I have three kids that play soccer , so I ’m sort of a soccer mom . ”
Still , after first leading the marketing push for the 1994 men ’s World Cup and then directing the three - year Women ’s World Cup effort , she seems to miss the nonstop action .
Advertisement
“ I do n’t think I ’ve replaced that , ” she says , “ but I will say that , in terms of the competition , there ’s nothing more exciting than watching my kids play soccer .
. . .
“ Those games are every bit as exciting as watching the Women ’s World Cup games 10 years ago or the men ’s World Cup games .
It might be hard to believe , but when you have such a personal stake in the kids out there on the field , it ’s tremendous . ”
Foudy calls it “ wonderful ” that Messing is a soccer mom , noting that Messing ’s undying passion and belief in the sport led to her producing a transcendent moment in women ’s athletics .
“ I remember walking into Giants Stadium for that first game , ” the former captain says .
“ We walked out to a standing ovation from 85,000 people and I thought to myself , ‘ Thank goodness Marla and her team had the courage to go bigger . ’ ”

Messing says she would n’t have had it any other way .

David Brooks as usual , is wrong on just about almost everything that comes out of his mouth in this segment .
Health care reform is popular .
This mess that looks like it 's going to be a sell out to the insurance industries is losing popularity .
Obama 's numbers are going down among his base and with independents as this thing plays itself out and it appears that not only was single - payer not on the table , but the public option was n't either .
It 's not losing popularity because the President did n't look like he showed enough love to the Grassley 's and Blue Dogs of the world .
And the democratic process has not made Chuck Grassley do anything .
Chuck Grassley is out to destroy the chances of anything meaningful being done with reforming our current system , and listening to his constituents at town halls has not changed that one way or the other .
From The Newshour with Jim Lehrer Aug. 21 , 2009 .
JIM LEHRER : What would you add to that or subtract ?
DAVID BROOKS : Yes , I 'm not sure it was inevitable .
JIM LEHRER : You do n't think it was inevitable ?
DAVID BROOKS : No , I mean , he 's lost the independents , a group I do n't think he had to lose .
If he had taken a stimulus package of $ 400 billion instead of $ 787 billion , I think he would have held the independents , held a lot of the Republicans .
If he had taken sort of a more moderate version of health care reform , I think he could have held on to -- there 's a Wyden - Bennett plan that he , I think , would have held on to some of those independents .
I mean , the major reason he 's falling down now -- the secondary reason is the economy is still not -- you know , unemployment .
But the major reason is health care reform .
His major domestic initiative is unpopular .
The majority -- a slight majority of the American people disapprove of it , and there 's no sign that that 's let up .
And so he really is in a sort of not freefall , but a serious slide .
You know , Charlie Cook , who knows more about congressional elections than just about anybody , has a memo out today saying there 's as much of a chance the Democrats will lose more than 20 seats in the next House elections than fewer than 20 seats , and that 's a pretty serious thing .
That 's a terrible climate in which to try to enact health care .
Myshkin mice can develop severe seizures Scientists have prevented epilepsy caused by a faulty gene from being passed down the generations in mice .
The key gene , Atp1a3 , regulates levels of chemicals such as sodium and potassium in brain cells .
It has long been suspected that an imbalance of these chemicals may cause some cases of epilepsy .
The University of Leeds study , which appears in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , raises hopes of new treatments for the condition .
Lead researcher Dr Steve Clapcote said : " An imbalance of sodium and potassium levels has long been suspected to lead to epileptic seizures , but our study is the first to show beyond any doubt that a defect in this gene is responsible . "
Our study has identified a new way in which epilepsy can be caused and prevented in mice , and therefore it may provide clues to potential causes , therapies and preventive measures in human epilepsy
Dr Steve Clapcote
University of Leeds Much work is needed to determine whether the same mechanism is in play in humans .
But the human ATP1a3 gene is more than 99 % the same as the mouse version .
Epilepsy is a common neurological condition that affects almost one in every 200 people .
However , the causes are unknown in the majority of cases .
Current drug treatments are ineffective in around one third of epilepsy patients .
The Leeds team worked on Myshkin mice , which have a tendency to develop seizures .
Scan showing epilepsy activity in a mouse brain
They showed that those animals who did develop seizures carried a specific defective version of Atp1a3 .
These mice responded when treated with the common anti-epileptic medication valproic acid - proving that they did indeed have a form of epilepsy .
To try to counter this , the researchers bred the epileptic mice with animals that carried an extra copy of the normal Atp1a3 gene .
The addition of the normal gene counteracted the faulty gene in the resulting offspring - which were completely free from epilepsy .
Very promising Dr Clapcote said : " Our study has identified a new way in which epilepsy can be caused and prevented in mice , and therefore it may provide clues to potential causes , therapies and preventive measures in human epilepsy . "
" Our results are very promising , but there 's a long way to go before this research could yield new antiepileptic therapies . "
Dr Clapcote said his team had started to screen DNA samples from epilepsy patients to investigate whether Atp13a gene defects were involved in the human condition .
Delphine van der Pauw , of the charity Epilepsy Research UK , said : " These results are promising .
" If the findings can be repeated in human studies , new avenues for the prevention and treatment of inherited epilepsy will be opened . "
Simon Wigglesworth , of Epilepsy Action , stressed the research was at an early stage - but agreed that it was encouraging .
He said : " At the moment there is no treatment to cure epilepsy , other than surgery , which is only effective for small numbers . "

Researchers at Georgia State University have found that diets high in fructose — a type of sugar found in most processed foods and beverages — impaired the spatial memory of adult rats .
Amy Ross , a graduate student in the lab of Marise Parent , associate professor at Georgia State 's Neuroscience Institute and Department of Psychology , fed a group of Sprague - Dawley rats a diet where fructose represented 60 percent of calories ingested during the day .
She placed the rats in a pool of water to test their ability to learn to find a submerged platform , which allowed them to get out of the water .
She then returned them to the pool two days later with no platform present to see if the rats could remember to swim to the platform 's location .
" What we discovered is that the fructose diet does n't affect their ability to learn , " Parent said .
" But they can't seem to remember as well where the platform was when you take it away .
They swam more randomly than rats fed a control diet . "
Fructose , unlike another sugar , glucose , is processed almost solely by the liver , and produces an excessive amount of triglycerides — fat which get into the bloodstream .
Triglycerides can interfere with insulin signaling in the brain , which plays a major role in brain cell survival and plasticity , or the ability for the brain to change based on new experiences .
Results were similar in adolescent rats , but it is unclear whether the effects of high fructose consumption are permanent , she said .
Parent 's lab works with Timothy Bartness , Regents ' Professor of Biology , and John Mielke of the University of Waterloo in Waterloo , Ontario , Canada to examine how diet influences brain function .
Although humans do not eat fructose in levels as high as rats in the experiments , the consumption of foods sweetened with fructose — which includes both common table sugar , fruit juice concentrates , as well as the much - maligned high fructose corn syrup — has been increasing steadily .
High intake of fructose is associated with numerous health problems , including insulin insensitivity , type II diabetes , obesity and cardiovascular disease .
" The bottom line is that we were meant to have an apple a day as our source of fructose , " Parent said .
" And now , we have fructose in almost everything . "
Moderation is key , as well as exercise , she said .
Exercise is a next step in ongoing research , and Parent 's team will investigate whether exercise might mitigate the memory effects of high fructose intake .
Her lab is also researching whether the intake of fish oil can prevent the increase of triglycerides and memory deficits .
Results from that research will be presented by her graduate student Emily Bruggeman at the 2009 Society for Neuroscience meeting in Chicago this fall .
I know this shopping season you might have brought one or looking to buy one soon around Christmas .
Buying an HDTV is no kid ’s place , you need to get your concepts right before you jump in .
Who Should buy one – Are you a movie freak ?
You love HD content or you are a hardcore gamer ?
You may be a passionate laptop guy that needs a bigger rich screen , LCD HDTVs are for you .
When buying a LCD / LED HD TV , there are few things you should look for in the Specs :
1. Contrast Ratio : Contrast ratio , by definition , is a measure of a display system , defined as the ratio of the luminance of the brightest color ( white ) to that of the darkest color ( black ) that the system is capable of producing .
A high contrast ratio is a desired aspect of any display , but with the various methods of measurement for a system or its part , remarkably different measured values can sometimes produce similar results .
The problem lies in the fact that most manufacturers mention the Dynamic contrast .
Dynamic contrast can come out to be much higher than actual contrast .
For good contrast , a value of 60,000 or above is what you should look for .
2. Screen resolution :
There are large no. of TVs in the market with different resolutions .
the most common names you will hear are HD Ready and FullHD .
In simple words , HD ready says i can play 720 p video .
FullHD says I can play 1080 p .
Infact , FullHD is the highest you will get in the market .
Knowing the fact that most TV channels and movie content from BluRay DVDs will be 1080 p , go for FullHD TV sets .
3. Response time : Response time refers to the time that it takes to change the state of on an individual LCD pixel .
Response times can specify the time it takes a pixel to change state from black - to - white - to - black or from one gray level to the next gray level .
There is no real industry standard on how or what to report as response time , so take this number with a grain of salt ( unless you know the measurement specifies of this value ) .
Typical older LCD response times had been around 4 ms .
Many of the newer LCD TVs now incorporate faster 2 ms pixels .
Response times also affect motion blur and jitter .
Do n’t buy a TV with response time > 5 ms .
4. Refresh rates :
It refers to the number of times per second a TV screen is updated with a new image .
The typical refresh rate for US TVs has been 60 times per second ( 60 Hz ) and for Europe and India is 50 Hz .
LCD TVs suffer from motion blur .
One technique used to help reduce motion blur is to increase the refresh rate to 120 times per second ( 120 Hz ) or 100 times ( 100 Hz ) .
Look for a TV that has TruMotion or equivalent technology running @ 100 Hz or 120 Hz or above .
5. Look for Features : Some TVs gives you good no .
of features like plugging in your USB and playing DIVX video , audio , photos .
Also , LG provides Bluetooth for 2 way streaming of the audio. , etc .
6. Inputs & ouput ports :
This is important consideration before you decide upon a LCD .
If you want to hookup your LCD HDTV with home audio and video sources / outputs you need to consider them .
Here is what you should look for :
– Multiple HDMI ports ( 3 preferred )
– RGB ( also called VGA port , used to conenct to PC )
– Audio video ports
– Component ports
7 . Power saving / consumption : Most LCDs in market are NOT energy efficient , as we move to a more greener world , we need gadgets which are more energy efficient .
Look for a panel which consumes peak power not more than 200 Watts .
some of the decent nes consume 150 watts during normal usage .
Some of the good brands even have power saving technicques embedded like auto dimming and switching off when not being used actively just like your notebook LCD .
These were some of the things you should look .
Now
Here is the list what you should NOT look for in LCD TV :
1. Screen Brightness & Illuminance :
When you visit a showroom , you will often see people choosing the display which the most vibrant .
Stop right there .
Its not about illuminance and brightness of the display , rather its about the crispness and the detail of the picture you get on the screen .
Look for the panel which displays colors naturally rather then saturating them .
Try to adjust screen contrast / brightness to bring them down to a level that you will use in your daily life .
And then compare the detail and clarity .
2. Audio :
You must be wandering I ’m talkin about LCD TV for home entertainment and i didnt even mention about Audio ?
That ’s true .
you do n’t need to consider this .
Do n’t be surprised but when you are buying a LCD TV , dont look for TV which has better audio .
Most LHDTVs that i see in market are labelled 10 +10 Watts RMS. , which is sufficient for them .
The reason being , you can always extend the audio to the levels you expect by adding good home audio solutions .
But if you sacrifice of image quality once , You are stuck !
3. Contrast ratio : Contrast ratio is one point which you should look for and Not look for .
Sounds confusing ?
Earlier , I explained why contrast ratio can be a misnomer for choosing “ better quality ” of picture .
The rule of the game is that “ Trust your eyes ” rather than the quoted ratio by the manufacturer .
Play some good vibrant FullHD content on the displays and try to figure out the difference between the contrasts .
Figure out which screen has better darkness for showing Black color .
which pscreen shows better red , which screen has better vibrance , etc .
All in all , if you follow these guidelines , I ’m sure you will come home with a decent LCD HDTV !
Happy shopping

The Cause of the Disaster
Are governments doing enough to fight this financial and economic crisis ?
Is it a good thing that central banks have cut interest rates essentially to zero and have increased the base money supply dramatically to support the financial sector ?
Will depression be prevented if governments across the world run up huge deficits in an attempt to strengthen demand , production , and employment ?
To answer these questions truthfully , we need to diagnose the causes of the debacle and then formulate the proper way out of it .
The diagnosis can be stated in just one sentence : Governments have caused the financial and economic debacle by suppressing the free market .
And the recipe for ending the debacle reads as follows :
Only the free market , and not the government , can end it .
An Analysis of the Debacle
To see this , one has to analyze the causes of the credit market debacle using sound — that is , Austrian — economics .
The debacle is the outcome of the government - controlled fiat money system .
State - owned central banks hold a monopoly over the money supply , and they increase it out of thin air by extending circulation credit .
Such a monetary regime inevitably creates disequilibria .
The rise in circulation credit lowers market interest rates below their natural levels — that is , the levels that would prevail had the credit supply not been artificially increased .
The downward - manipulated interest rate induces additional investment and , at the same time , provokes a rise in consumption out of current income at the expense of savings .
As a result , the increase in the money supply makes the overall monetary demand outstrip the economy 's resource capacity ; the economy starts living beyond its means .
A rising money supply pushes up prices sooner or later , be it the prices for consumer goods or those for assets ( such as , for example , stocks , bonds , houses , real estate , etc. ) .
Indeed , rising prices are the characteristic feature of the notoriously inflationary , government - sponsored fiat money system .
What is more , the artificially suppressed interest rate shifts scarce resources increasingly into the more time - consuming production processes for capital goods — at the expense of production processes for consumer goods .
While the increase in the money supply initially stimulates economic activity , the ensuing boom is , rather tragically , economically unsustainable and must be followed by bust .
If the injection of additional credit and money out of thin air was a one - off affair , it presumably would n't take long for the boom to unwind .
Market agents would restore their desired relation between consumption , savings , and investment — which was distorted by the expansion of credit and money — and this would reveal malinvestment .
Market demand would fall short of firms ' expectations , and unprofitable investment would have to be liquidated .
Jobs created in the illusionary economic expansion phase would have to be axed .
Unfortunately , under today 's government - sponsored fiat money systems , the increase in credit and money out of thin air is not a one - off affair .
As soon as free market forces herald a correction process — that is , signal an approaching recession — public opinion calls for countermeasures .
This , in turn , wo n't be lost on central banks .
Monetary policy makers increase the credit and money supply even further , thereby bringing interest rates to even lower levels .
In other words , monetary policy fights the correction of the debacle by taking recourse to the very action that has caused the debacle in the first place .
Such a strategy may work occasionally .
An approaching recession ( bust ) can , by means of lowering interest rates , be reversed into a recovery ( boom ) .
Murray N. Rothbard explained why
the boom is kept on its way and ahead of its inevitable comeuppance by repeated and accelerating doses of the stimulant of bank credit . [ 1 ]
However , as soon as credit expansion really stops , the inevitable adjustment will unfold , and firms liquidate unsound investments and axe uneconomic jobs .
The longer the failing boom was kept going , the greater will be the malinvestments that have to be corrected , and the higher will be output and employment losses .
To be sure , the monetary policy of suppressing the interest rate is widely hailed by mainstream economists as paving the way towards economic recovery .
It is this very creed that lends intellectual support to governments and their central banks for continuing the policy that caused the disaster in the first place .
Ludwig von Mises knew of the public 's ideological aversion to raising the interest rate , and he put the ensuing tragic chain of events as follows :
In the opinion of the public , more inflation and more credit expansion are the only remedy against the evils which inflation and credit expansion have brought about . [ 2 ]
But Mises was well aware that pushing down interest rates to ever - lower levels would not solve the problem .
He wrote ,
The wavelike movement affecting the economic system , the recurrence of periods of boom which are followed by periods of depression , is the unavoidable outcome of the attempts , repeated again and again , to lower the gross market rate of interest by means of credit expansion .
There is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion .
The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion , or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved . [ 3 ]
The Danger of Destroying the Free Market Altogether
As noted earlier , a truthful diagnosis of the causes of the malaise is indispensable for seeking solutions .
If one subscribes to the — in effect , irrefutably true — diagnosis of the malaise provided by Austrian economics , two conclusions must be drawn .
First , more credit and money at lower interest rates will not , and cannot , prevent the ultimate disaster that has been caused by too much credit and money .
Second — and this aspect may not attract peoples ' attention right away — governments ' attempts to fight the correction will destroy what little is left of the free market order .
This becomes clear when taking a look at the role of private ownership of commercial banks in the current credit market turbulence .
Commercial banks are the main producers of money , as they extend loans to private households , firms , and public entities .
However , bank owners have become increasingly concerned that borrowers might fail to service their debt as promised .
As a result , they tell their bank managers to refrain from rolling over loans falling due — let alone expand the bank 's credit exposure .
If banks insist on having borrowers repay their loans , the stock of money declines , and this sets into motion the adjustment that is so much loathed by majority opinion .
To sustain the current level of credit and money supply , the government may want ( and may find ) public support to nationalize large parts of the banking industry .
It could then force the nationalized banks to extend credit and money to firms , households , and governments — in a way that is politically desirable .
Needless to say , this development spells trouble on the grandest possible scale .
It puts the government in charge of deciding who gets credit , and on what terms , and such an economy would ( sooner or later ) turn into a command , or planned , economy .
The ( Only ) Way Out
Against this backdrop , one must conclude that government interventionism in the field of monetary affairs has actually caused gruesome damage .
In fact , the latest credit market turmoil is par excellence evidence that interventionism does n't reach the goals it sets out to achieve .
As Mises wrote , " Interventionism is not an economic system , that is , it is not a method which enables people to achieve their aims .
It is merely a system of procedures which disturb and eventually destroy the market economy .
It hampers production and impairs satisfaction of needs .
It does not make people richer ; it makes people poorer . " [ 4 ]
The only way out of the debacle is a return to sound money — that is , free - market money — by privatizing the state - run monetary system .
The free - market order , where people freely decide on the universally accepted means of exchange , would presumably be anchored by gold , but possibly also by other media ( for example , silver , platinum , etc. ) .
The need for a return to sound money is not , as some hysterical antagonists and mainstream economists might wish to maintain , ideologically motivated .
On the contrary , it can be logically deduced from Mises 's praxeology , or the science of the logic of human action ; only free - market money is compatible with maintaining the free market order .
This global monetary debacle is a testimony to the truth of what Mises and his followers have stated on the basis of praxeology , namely , that government - controlled fiat money must fail .
It signals to us that it is high time to seek a fundamental monetary reform : the return to free - market money , for protecting and maintaining peoples ' freedom and economic well - being .

HTML5 +RDFa
The first public Editors Draft of RDFa for HTML5 was published earlier today .
You can view the draft in two forms :
The blog post explains how this draft came to be , how it was published via the World Wide Web Consortium , and what it means for the future of RDFa and HTML5 .
Background
For the better part of a year , the RDFa Task Force has been attempting to convince Ian Hickson , the Editor of the HTML5 specification , to merge RDFa into HTML5 .
While we failed to convince Ian that RDFa merited a mention in the HTML5 specification , we were able to convince him that the problem was important enough for him to go to the trouble of creating a solution of his own .
An amalgamation of RDFa , Microformats and some secret HTML5 sauce was combined to form Microdata — the only problem is that it does n’t work for all of the use cases that RDFa solves ( watch Mark Birbeck ’s blog for more on that in the next few days ) .
RDFa is an official W3C Standard which has been adopted by Yahoo , Google , Creative Commons , The UK Government , Drupal , Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVG ) , The Open Document Format ( ODF ) , Digital Bazaar , and Slideshare ( to name a few ) .
It is enjoying rapid adoption and deployment and is becoming an integral part of the Web .
The W3C decided to not re-new the XHTML2 workgroup ( XHTML2 WG ) charter last week .
Since RDFa was chartered under the XHTML2 WG , this announcement led many people to believe that RDFa was in danger of being shut down .
This could n’t be further from the truth – there are several of other workgroups that would support the RDFa work and there is now talk of a separate RDFa Interest Group that would help other workgroups to integrate RDFa into their languages .
RDFa is here to stay .
The release of the HTML5 +RDFa draft is proof positive that work will continue to unify the RDFa syntax and processing rules so that the technology will continue to work across an increasing number of languages ( HTML4 , XHTML , HTML5 , SVG , ODF , etc ) .
The HTML5 +RDFa draft was primarily edited by Manu Sporny with input from the entire RDFa Task Force as well as members from the HTML Working Group ( HTML WG ) .
Today , we open the HTML5 + RDFa Editor ’s Draft up for public comments .
Publishing HTML5 +RDFa via the W3C
Some might wonder how an Editors Draft of the HTML5 specification can be created without the express permission of Ian Hickson , and what a separate HTML5 Editors Draft means to the overall relationship of WHAT WG ( who have editorial control over the base HTML5 specification ) and HTML WG ( who are tasked with working with WHAT WG to standardize HTML5 via the W3C ) .
To date , all text that made its way into the HTML5 document had to be approved by Ian .
That meant that if he did n’t agree with your reasoning , then your feature was n’t added to HTML5 .
HTML5 also operates on an edit cycle called “ commit - then - review ” , while W3C operates on an edit cycle called “ review - then - commit ” .
Basically , with HTML5 , Ian figures out some text to solve a particular problem ( with help from the community to identify the problem and use cases ) and then places it into the HTML5 specification .
In the W3C , a group of Invited Experts ( with help from the community to identify the problem and use cases ) discuss the various solutions over a long period of time and then , when there is consensus on the solution to the problem , the agreed upon text is added to the specification .
Both approaches have their benefits and drawbacks .
Sometimes you need one person to make the decision on particular problems , at other times you do n’t want to standardize on something that has n’t undergone the proper due diligence required for Web Standards .
We ’ve been asking Ian to be the central figure in HTML5 through our actions for a very long time .
It started out as his specification and he has put an enormous amount of time and energy into ensuring that HTML keeps moving forward .
He is criticized daily for his actions and is under a great deal of stress to produce the best possible specification for the future of the Web .
It is wholly unfair for us ( people that use the Web , yes , this means you ) to continue to ask him to bear that editorial burden alone .
Most open source projects operate under the “ commit - then - review ” edit cycle , but then again , most open source projects have more than one person committing .
When Sam Ruby was brought on to co-chair the HTML WG , he outlined a mechanism where more people could contribute text directly to the HTML5 specification , without the need for Ian ’s review or approval .
This HTML5 +RDFa Editors
Draft is the first specification to take advantage of this new publishing cycle .
Sam has re-iterated that the HTML5 + RDFa Editors Draft will be given equal consideration in relation to Ian ’s HTML5 + Microdata specification .
The HTML WG will consider both approaches and merge the agreed - upon text when consensus is reached .
What this means for the future of HTML5 and RDFa
Just to be clear , this is not a fork of the HTML5 specification .
It contains alternate language to the HTML5 specification that we intend to merge into the official HTML5 specification in time , via the W3C ’s HTML Working Group .
I specifically did not remove the Microdata section from the HTML5 +RDFa specification because it provides competition for RDFa – competition is a good thing .
It forces the RDFa Task Force to re-think some assumptions we ’ve made and to see if we can provide both backwards - compatibility and some of the features provided via Microformats as well as Ian ’s Microdata proposal .
In this release , we focused on ensuring backwards compatibility with XHTML documents and providing rules for use of RDFa in HTML5 .
We specifically did not add new features or extend RDFa ’s functionality , even though we are nearing solutions to some of the more long - standing requests to ease expression of RDF triples in RDFa .
Expect these extensions to be announced in the coming months and to be integrated into HTML4 and HTML5 as they are integrated into XHTML .
We will continue to work with Ian , the WHAT WG and HTML WG to ensure that integration of this technology is a smooth process .
Flavor Flav may think that 911 is a joke , but you ’re unlikely to be laughing if you need emergency services in a foreign country .
Perhaps it ’s the “ it ’ll never happen to me ” syndrome why many of us travelers are n’t as prepared as we should be .
If you ’re in Thailand , Spain , or Bolivia , would you know what number to dial to get some emergency service ?
Some history
In 1937 , London became the first city to introduce a system where callers could dial a short 3 - digit number to get immediate help .
They chose 999 as it was difficult to accidentally dial on the old pulse - dial phones .
Calling 999 alerted a switch - board operator by sounding a buzzer and flashing a red light .
The first 911 system in North America was set up in Winnipeg , Canada in 1959 and , nine years later , Alabama and Alaska followed suit to bring it to the US .
It was n’t until the 1980s that 911 became a standard under the North American Numbering Plan .
There were many obstacles to overcome such as being routed to the wrong jurisdiction , but with switching technological advances , almost every single location in North America has an accurate 911 service today .

Emergency service on your mobile phone
Maybe the most useful thing to have in any country during an emergency is a mobile telephone .
The GSM network uses 112 as a world - wide emergency number .
When 112 is dialed from a GSM phone , the network will automatically redirect you to the local emergency dispatch , if it ’s available .
In addition , many countries allow emergency calls to be made from phones without a SIM card ( Latin America , however , requires one ) .
Those who ca n’t function particularly well in an emergency might feel more at ease knowing this : dialing an emergency number from most mobile phones does n’t require the keypad to be unlocked .
Since 80 % of the global mobile market uses GSM technology , it ’s well worth the few bucks to get your hands on one when traveling , if your current mobile is n’t GSM .
Local emergency numbers around the world
Even if you ’re traveling with a mobile phone , and definitely if you are n’t , you need to know the local “ 911 ” number of your destination .
Write it down , memorize it , stamp it on your forehead .
Hopefully you wo n’t need it .

Airport prank
Some pranksters at an airport wrote down foreign looking names that when read over the public address system sound like something else entirely .
This is the story as told by the pranksters .
Having six hours to kill in any airport is murder .
So we decided to liven it up .
Whilst waiting for our flight back to Sydney , we'd go and sit on the balcony at Terminal 3 at Heathrow , directly under one of the speakers where the roof is low for maximum acoustic effects .
We put a digital tape recorder in our bag with the microphone poking out of the top .
We 'd look for a flight that had arrived in the last 40 minutes from somewhere where you 'd expect foreign names , then write a letter saying , " Pick up passenger so and so , from flight etc , destination etc . "
That way , it looked like the limo had been arranged in advance as the flight arrival details and the motel name was written on the note .
We wore an ID - style badge that we 'd received at a recent conference so that we 'd looked like limo drivers .
One of us would ask airport administration to make an announcement calling for our passenger and then the other did the second .
We 'd pretend to be unable to pronounce it and then hand them the bit of paper with the name written on it to administration .
Long winded , but well worth it !

An hour before our flight left , the pomms had finally caught on .
About time .
They actually threatened to arrest us as apparently they 'd actually had complaints !
We look forward to do it again , only this time out of Hong Kong Airport .
Now that one should be funny !
Neil Young Archives , Vol. 1 : 1963-1972 on Blu-ray is truly the most impressive hunk of pop culture multi-media I ’ve ever seen .
A massive and hefty THING , it forever raises the bar for rock gods with deep catalogs and treasure troves of unreleased rarities .
Bob Dylan , Paul McCartney , Led Zeppelin and Prince pay attention , because from now on Archives is the box set by which the others will be judged for some time .
It ’s an entirely new way of providing deep fan access to an important recording artist ’s life ’s work , more a multi-media autobiography than mere box set .
The user interface forces you to really contemplate Neil Young as you poke around and you become deeply immersed in all things Neil as a result .
Obviously that ’s the goal and Archives absolutely succeeds on that level .
Young ’s attention to audio fidelity is legendary — some of his classic 70s albums have never come out on CD due to his dislike of the way they sounded — and the 24bit / 192 KHZ PCM audio possible with the BD format showcases his music as never before .
There are some very , very high fidelity audio discs out there , but none of them sound as good as the material on Archives .
It is as if one was present in the actual studio ( or audience ) when the performances were recorded .
High quality transfers were made directly from the original analog tapes — or at least with the shortest signal path possible — and it shows .
FM radio classics like Cinnamon Girl and The Loner have never sounded better , but on the more intimate folkie material covered in the set , the audiophile qualities of the BD format really shines .
The size of the room the songs were recorded in , the space around the voice and guitar , the buzzing vibrations of a single guitar string — all of this is quite audible on Archives .
The sound quality is magnificent .
I ’ll say it again , I ’ve never heard better .
For sound quality alone it would win the gold medal , but that ’s not the half of it .
There are a gazillion nooks and crannies on the set .
The box is full of physical goodies , too , like a mass - produced facsimile of a hand - carved leather - covered 237 page color scrapbook loaded with amusing ephemera like one of his sports writer father ’s columns about then 11 - year old Neil ’s “ chicken business ” and contracts
Young ’s mother signed on behalf of her minor son so he would be paid BMI royalties on his Buffalo Springfield compositions .
The cover letter tells Mrs. Young that she should “ be very proud of your son .
He is not only talented but a young gentleman . ”
Young ’s parents must have kept every notebook and scrap of paper he ever wrote on .
Young ’s father was convinced of his son ’s genius at a young age .
I loved reading his account of seeing his son perform in Carnegie Hall in the early 70s and how proud he was .
( Hell , I ’d be proud if I was Neil Young ’s father , would n’t you be ? ) .
There are scads of handwritten lyrics and reviews cut from endless magazines and newspapers .
In terms of the books one usually finds in a major artist box set , this one also goes right to the head of the class .
I ’ve never seen another even half as good .
All in all the packaging is attractive ( if not necessarily that durable ) and it ’s a gorgeous thing to unwrap .
It ’s a shoe - in for several Grammy awards ( not that anyone cares , but still … )
There are 128 tracks , nearly 60 of them never heard before spread across the ten discs .
The old metal file cabinet user interface is nothing that innovative , but it ’s probably the most appropriate considering the depth and archival purpose of the set .
There is a nice looking “ timeline ” that displays photos , video clips and hidden tracks along the way .
The set contains the first release of Young ’s 1973 documentary Journey Through The Past and twenty video clips .
Some of them are totally wonderful ( like Young walking out of a record store with bootlegs of his music , the mind - blowing CSNY live performance , an appearance on The Johnny Cash Show and a 1970 performance at the Finjan Folk Cafe ) but this is where my first problem with Archives comes in .
The video content , whilst containing several gems , is n’t nearly enough .
Not enough to justify the price , the fan expectations and not nearly enough to satisfy the wide open spaces of the storage available on Blu-ray ( could n’t most of this material fit on like TWO Blu-ray discs ? ) .
Where , for instance is the amazing BBC “ In Concert ” performance from 1971 or more of the CSNY performance ?
My biggest problem with Archives , though , is not what is or is n’t on the set ( Blu-ray owners will get updates from Blue - ray Live as long as their players are hooked up to the Internet , so Young could always add things later as he pleases ) rather it ’s the list price .
This is where I become deeply ambivalent about Archives .
An Amazon reviewer hit the nail squarely on the head when he described how absolutely floored he was by the box , but that it had been given to him as a gift .
Had he paid the full $ 349.99 list price , he ’s not sure sure he ’d have the same opinion .
I felt the same way .
I ’ll admit it felt like Christmas day when the package — the HEAVY package — arrived from Warner - Reprise .
And I ’ll admit that I was grinning from ear to ear watching a young Young sing “ Mr. Soul ” on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour with the Buffalo Springfield and even that I danced around the apartment in my socks to The Loner like a stoned fool .
But I got a review copy .
Like the Amazon reviewer , had I paid for this … well , I ’d have felt ripped off .
So here is my dilemma as a reviewer .
On one hand , I am giving this puppy a RAVE REVIEW .
Truly , it is ( unnecessarily skimpy video content aside ) the best box set of any major recording artist ever assembled .
On so many levels it is out of the ball park amazing , but with a $ 350 price tag , being a good value for the money just is n’t one of them .
$ 35 a disc ?!?!
I mean come on , dude !
Neil
Young owns all of this material , or the vast majority of it .
He ’s not paying out much in sync rights , that ’s for sure .
How much cost can there be , when you get right down to it , associated with remastering these recordings for Blu-ray , scanning in the photos and the rest of it ?
I ’m sure it was n’t cheap , but $ 35 a disc seems a tad greedy , I ’m sorry to say .
Do n’t get me wrong , I love Neil Young and I ’m wild about the set , but someone needs to explain to him that there is a major recession going on and not everyone ’s got a spare $ 350 laying around these days .
Still , the first run of Neil Young Archives Vol. 1 sold out entirely , so what do I know ?
Here is a very detailed review of Neil Young Archives Vol 1 ( 1963-1972 ) .
Here is a negative review .
The other day , I wrote this :
Leo Igwe is a Humanist and Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Humanist Movement .
He recently returned from a conference run by the British Humanist Association , having also given an interview about superstition in his country to the BBC .
He was ready to attend a conference he helped organize on “ Child Rights and Witchcraft . ”
The conference took place in Calabar , in southeastern Nigeria .
It ’s an important topic because accusations of witchcraft could ( and have ) lead to the accused being killed .
As the conference began , 150 - 200 religious protestors raided the conference and started disrupting the proceedings .
Chaos ensued .
Leo ’s glasses were broken and his bag , phone and camera were stolen .
It took 90 minutes for cops to arrive .
“ Recently we learned of a malicious desecration of a photo of the Governor and baby Trig that has become an iconic representation of a mother ’s love for a special needs child . ”
– Sarah Palin spokesperson Meghan Stapelton , on a Photoshopped image of her boss .
It ’s been a year since Sarah Palin was a candidate for vice president of The United States , and even her abrupt resignation is now old news .
So as usual I ’m well behind the curve with my posts , but so are many of the artists featured here ; even now more “ desecrations ” of Palin are being produced .
After the jump I ’ve posted a full bounty of Palin - inspired artwork , along with some thoughts on why she makes such an enduring ( endearing ? ) target …
Political choices , especially in the US , tend to be more about voting for “ people like us ” , or “ people who we imagine ourselves to be ” , or “ people we aspire to be ” , than about selecting the best leaders for our respective causes .
But there is usually at least some kernel of substance behind our leaders .
Palin artwork works , and is so widespread , not just because she ’s a colorful character , but because she ’s nothing else .
Palin ’s entire appeal is who she is .
Identity and personality completely trump ideology and accomplishment .
Palin is all image , and she takes that image very seriously , as shown by the quote at the beginning of this post .
No other American politician in my memory has held their visage to be quite so sacrosanct .
This is , ultimately , what makes her such a great target for art and parody .
Here ’s Sarah Palin is cast as the devil in a street art poster by Frightening Prospect :
Another street poster is a take on the iconic Obama HOPE poster , designed by Shepard Fairey .
If you do n’t already know what MILF stands for I wo n’t ruin the surprise .
Just make sure you do n’t Google the term from work .
Even Palin ’s fans are ca n’t resist the lure of her image , as in this fantasy nude by Chicago bar owner and Red-Stater Bruce Elliott .
Elliot is n’t the only one to imagine Palin in the buff .
Penelope Tuesdae of Trigger Happy shows us her beaver :
Dan Lacey , self - styled “ Painter of Pancakes ” , had his way with the Alaskan ’s famous wink .
I think she looks just stunning with a buttered hotcake for a bonnet , do n’t you ?
The softer side of Palin is sewn onto this pillow by Lauren F. Adams :
Perhaps this is n’t exactly how McCain felt the morning after his defeat , but Zina Saunders , who also created the image of Palin riding a dinosaur at the beginning of this post , seems to have captured something :
Beth Newell is even more blunt about the results of the Palin - McCain hookup :
In the months before their daughter was born in 2007 , Deborah and Ariel Levy worried the baby might have Down syndrome .
They say a doctor at the Legacy Center for Maternal - Fetal Medicine assured them that a sample of tissue taken from the placenta early in the pregnancy ruled out the developmental disability , despite the results of later testing that showed the fetus might have it .
But within days of the birth of their daughter , the Southwest Portland couple learned the baby did have Down syndrome .
Had they known , they say , they would have terminated the pregnancy .
Now they 're suing in Multnomah County Circuit Court , seeking more than $ 14 million to cover the costs of raising her and providing education , medical care , and speech and physical therapy for their daughter , who turned 2 this month .
The suit also seeks money to cover her life - long living expenses .
The Levys declined to be interviewed .
Their attorney , David K. Miller , said the toddler is as dear to them as their two older children but they fear being perceived as " heartless . "
Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania , said fewer than 10 such suits -- for disabilities ranging from spina bifida to severe retardation -- are filed in the U.S. each year .
" The reason they 're rare is you are forced to take a position that 's very awkward , " Caplan said .
" Parents do n't like arguing it , and courts do n't like hearing it . "
Parents must be willing to declare " we feel burdened to have this child , " Caplan said .
And in order for the suits to succeed , courts must be willing to rule that " it 's better not to exist and give damages for having to exist , " Caplan said .
Miller said his clients are " committed to the best possible life for their daughter . "
He said one of their role models is Karen Gaffney , a 31 - year - old Portland woman with Down syndrome who earned a regular high - school diploma and an associate of science degree from Portland Community College and travels the nation as a renowned speaker .
" They feel very strongly that what happened to them was wrong , " Miller said .
" They were given incorrect information , and their lives have changed because of it . "
The 1973 decision Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door for such suits because parents generally must claim that they would have aborted the fetus .
The " wrongful birth " and " wrongful life " lawsuits are controversial .
High courts in roughly two - thirds of states have allowed the suits .
Some states -- including Michigan , Georgia and Utah -- have banned them .
One director of a national Catholic organization praised the prohibition of such suits , saying " it is never wrongful for a baby to be born . "
But others say the bans strip families of the right to seek compensation for medical malpractice .
Susan Wolf , a professor of law and medicine at the University of Minnesota , said suing for a botched prenatal test is no different than suing for a botched knee surgery .
Answering the essential question , if a child would have been better off never being born , is a tough one , she said .
Help for parents
" So many courts have resisted compensating the child directly , " Wolf said .
" But most of them have found a way to compensate the parents . "
In 1994 , the Oregon Supreme Court ruled that two Eugene parents could sue for the costs of raising their child and for providing a college education after they claimed that a doctor failed to perform a requested tubal ligation during the C- section delivery of the mother 's second child .
Jonni Zehr found out she was pregnant with a third child seven months later .
The number of wrongful birth lawsuits is expected to grow as an increasing number of women give birth over age 35 , when the probability of chromosomal birth abnormalities such as Down syndrome rises .
Rapidly advancing technology , especially in the past decade , means prenatal tests can now identify hundreds of conditions although the vast majority of these tests are n't given to women who are n't deemed a specific risk .
In some cases , testing allows doctors to treat conditions before birth .
In other cases , test results give parents time to prepare for the challenges of raising a special - needs child .
It also provides information that prompts some parents to terminate the pregnancies .
Ethical questions
The decision to get an abortion , experts say , is less difficult for many parents when the disability is a condition such as Tay - Sachs disease , which in its most common form kills most children before age 4 .
Ethicists wonder about the morality of such a decision when the condition is deafness , blindness , a cleft lip , obesity or a propensity to develop breast cancer or have a heart attack later in life -- all of which can be identified in the womb ,
One decade - long study referenced in a policy brief by the Washington State Department of Health found that 28 percent of women who knew they 'd give birth to a baby with a cleft lip or mouth deformity chose to end their pregnancies .
Increasing numbers of pregnancies are being screened for Down syndrome .
Doctors formerly reserved the test largely for women age 35 and older , but in 2007 , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that all pregnant women be offered the screenings .
Several studies show 90 percent or more of women who discover they 'll give birth to a baby with Down syndrome choose to have an abortion .
Deborah Levy , who was 34 when she was pregnant with her third child , was given a chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) during her first trimester , and the results came back negative for Down syndrome .
The couple 's suit claims that they were repeatedly told that the test had " definitively ruled out " Down syndrome .
The test is reported to be more than 99 percent accurate .
The suit contends that the clinic bungled the test .
A Legacy spokeswoman declined to comment because of the litigation .
In addition to seeking money for the child 's future care , the couple ask compensation for the depression and emotional distress Deborah Levy has suffered and for her inability to go back to work as a dental hygienist .
Ariel Levy , a civil engineer , also seeks compensation for the effect his daughter has had on his relationship with his wife .
Society offers help
The Northwest Down Syndrome Association in Portland encourages doctors to send parents expecting a baby with Down syndrome to her organization , said Executive Director Angela Jarvis - Holland , because it is equipped to answer questions about what life will be like .
" Because what constitutes a good life ? " Jarvis - Holland said .
" I do n't think doctors can answer that in a two - minute conversation . "
Prenatal tests can't discern the severity of Down syndrome , and it varies widely by individual .
Jarvis - Holland said involved parents with the right resources can greatly improve their child 's development .
She said the ability to test for a growing array of conditions means many more women will be faced with the question of whether they want to be tested for everything from autism to an alcoholism gene ( tests are in the works ) , and what they 'll do if the results come back positive .
" Down syndrome is really the canary in the coal mine , " Jarvis - Holland said .
" It will be everybody 's question before we know it . "
Jarvis - Holland , who has a 10 - year - old son with Down syndrome , worries about what she calls the " tyranny of perfection " if parents one day will be able to test for virtually every conceivable disadvantage facing their fetus .
" If you keep growing the list , where and when do we grow uncomfortable about that list ? " Jarvis - Holland said .
" I 'm not sure where this is taking us . "

Television industry must act soon or face losing control of its online presence to brand such as Apple , says Highfield
The TV industry has as little as two years to create viable digital businesses or face a version of the " iTunes moment " that saw the music business cede the online future to Apple , according to Ashley Highfield .
Highfield , the the managing director of consumer and online at Microsoft UK , said he believed the reluctance advertisers feel to advertise on sites such as Facebook will soon be a " non-issue " , putting more pressure on broadcasters ' advertising revenues .
" Once this happens the shift of spending from TV to web will accelerate even more , " he said , giving the Futureview address at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival today .
" So realistically I think the industry has about two to three years to adapt or face its iTunes moment .
And it will take at least that long for media brands to build credible , truly digital brands .
But , importantly , I do believe TV does have a small two to three year window in which to respond . "
Highfield also said he believed that despite the growing popularity of online TV viewing it will be at least three years until it reaches a scale to win over media agency advertising buyers and generate significant revenues .
" The traditional television business has to aggressively move its content online , build a critical mass of content that the traditional buyers of airtime will understand and buy into , " he added .
" They want to see TV - like reach and impact " .
Highfield argued that there are still barriers preventing online TV from generating revenue .
" On current projections , we are three years away from the reach and the volume of online video being un -ignorably attractive to TV advertising buyers , " he said .
" We are two to three years away from having the ad sales systems and Barb - like measurement systems to enable really easy purchase across TV and web . "
To drive revenues from web video , media companies need to embrace controversial targeted advertising techniques , such as behavioural targeting based on users ' web viewing habits , with the ad inventory going into an auction - style model similar to the system Google operates , according to Highfield .
He also suggested a possible solution to the thorny issue of getting broadband into rural areas in the UK after Lord Carter 's plan of a £ 6 - a - year tax on landlines to raise the funds fell out of favour with new business minister Stephen Timms .
Highfield said a solution , which in the US market has been called the " white space initiative " , would be to use the leftover unused transmission spectrum between , for instance , BBC1 and BBC2 to provide broadband capacity to rural communities .

Warner Bros.
Interactive on Wednesday confirmed the official U.S. release date for the highly anticipated puzzle - action game Scribblenauts .
The DS - exclusive project will launch on September 15 of this year stateside , according tot he publisher .
Says Warner :
In Scribblenauts , players use the Nintendo DS touch - screen to help their character Maxwell acquire the Starite in each level by solving a series of puzzles armed with their stylus , notepad and imagination .
With more than 200 puzzle and action - themed challenges , players can combine unlimited objects , create completely new situations and create their own interactive experience .
In honor of today 's announcement , the publisher released two new screenshots of Scribblenauts , which we 've included in this story .
Paul Krugman just posted a piece defending deficit spending .
In it , he argues that while $ 9t seems like a big number , it ’s very manageable as a percent of GDP .
In his words :
“ Right now , federal debt is about 50 % of GDP .
So even if we do run these deficits , federal debt as a share of GDP will be substantially less than it was at the end of World War II . ”
A chart like this seems to support his case at first :
There are two glaring flaws with Mr. Krugman ’s argument , however .
The first is that total US debt has increased dramatically , and is far higher than any other time in history .
At the end of WWII , consumers did n’t have $ 50 k credit card balances and underwater mortgages worth 20 x their annual salary .
Companies were n’t nearly as highly leveraged as they remain today .
Is GDP Indicative of a Country ’s Ability to Pay off Debt ?
Krugman states , “ What you have to bear in mind is that the economy — and hence the federal tax base — is enormous , too .
Right now GDP is around $ 14 trillion . ” ( added 8/24/09 for clarity ) .
But does GDP really indicate federal tax base ?
How much does a debtor country ’s GDP really say about their financial health ?
Fifty years ago , GDP included our strong manufacturing base .
Today it includes massive government entitlement programs , war , and financial products that provide zero real value to the economy .
In 2007 financial services represented 40 % of corporate profits in America .
Will medicare , social - security , the War on Terror , CDS , and CMBS increase productivity and pay the bills ?
Hell no .
Examine this chart showing Government Spending as a % of GDP :
The trend is clear .
Government spending has steadily increased as a percentage of GDP .
The picture will worsen considerably as baby - boomers retire , putting pressure on Medicare , Social Security , pensions , etc. QE and bailouts have really only just begun .
Inflation seems inevitable with this much debt , and a full pipeline .
We ’re reflating the bubble temporarily , and if it works , the Fed ’s job is to reign in all the money that “ saved ” us .
They wo n’t , ca n ’t .
Those who think we ’re going to get out of this mess by cutting expenditures and raising taxes will be proven wrong , I think .

Team Liquid : Final Edits
But I am constant as the northern star ,
Of whose true - fix'd and resting quality
There is no fellow in the firmament .
The skies are painted with unnumber 'd sparks ,
They are all fire and every one doth shine ,
But there 's but one in all doth hold his place :
So in the world ; 'tis furnish'd well with men ,
And men are flesh and blood , and apprehensive ;
Yet in the number I do know but one
That unassailable holds on his rank ,
Unshaked of motion : and that I am he
- Julius Caesar , Act III , Scene I
Long ago , when Broodwar had just been birthed , a boy named Lim looked out through a computer screen and saw a universe .
Where others saw wasted hours and childish games , Lim saw potential .
Lim saw a dream .
Now , a decade later , we know him not as a boy but as The Emperor , the brightest star in the Starcraft universe and a man whose name is synonymous with the game itself .
Above all , however , we remember Lim Yo Hwan as the creator of a dynasty of destruction , and the leader of a group of legends we today call SK Telecom T1 , the most successful franchise in all of Broodwar .
Looking at these titans now , and indeed , looking at them this August weekend in the Proleague Grand Finals in Pusan , it is quite difficult to remember their roots .
Indeed , as Boxer and Iloveoov sat on the SKT bench and watched their proteges sweep through the season 's biggest event with a ruthlessness that sent shivers of fear through progaming circles , perhaps their minds would have wandered back to the days when they first took their team to the big leagues .
The year was 2003 , and a newly founded Orion coached by Joo Hoon or as Boxer called him Hoon - hyung was trying hard to find a sponsor , and thereby become a real team .
Months before , Boxer had met future Coach Hoon just a little while before departing his then team IS , and thereby inadvertently formed one of progaming 's most important friendships .
Ironically , the team which Boxer left is also the team SKT faced this weekend in Pusan .
That 's right , IS became K - TEC Plus , which in turn went on to become Plus , Lecaf OZ and now , as we know them Hwaseung OZ .
It is said that Boxer 's father had a major influence in his son's move from the team .
Arguing that the team he was on was mismanaged , and that the players did n't even have adequate quarters , he convinced a young Lim Yo Hwan to cut contract with IS and start his own outfit .
Lim did not leave alone however , he took with him a young Protoss player who would soon be know for his amazing reaver control .
Yes , Boxer 's first recruit was none other than InToTheRainbow .
Over the next few years the Hwan - Hoon partnership would not only form a progaming team , but would go on to find a high profile sponsor and lay the foundation of one of Starcraft 's most vibrant dynasties .
It was a partnership that would continue until Boxer left for the air force in October 2006 .
When Boxer and Hoon first met each other , they'd have scarcely thought that
they'd be leading a sponsored pro team in a little over two years .
Slowly but surely Orion came together .
From Kingdom , to Zerglee and [ z - zone ]
kOs , many of SKT 's most well known names were recruited by the Hwan - Hoon partnership during the months following Boxer 's departure from IS .
The biggest news however was the recruitment of the three young rookies , including Sigamari and [ Blaze ] Hiroko , two promising young Zerg players .
It was also during this time that the emperor to be made one of his most important decisions - playing against and recruiting a Terran that would later become his pupil , friend and confidante .
Orion 's final member for the time being , and indeed , its most important addition to date , was none other than the monster we now call Iloveoov .
In retrospect , the name they chose for their outfit was perfect for a team that would soon be one of the brightest constellations in the Broodwar universe .
Finally , a sponsor was found for Orion in the form of Tongyang , snack food makers and owners of OGN at the time , and Boxer 's dream was officially under way .
He was leading his first progaming team .
Unlike IS , this was his team , a factor which played a major part in how they worked , and indeed , played .
As Lim Yo Hwan and Choi Yun Sung sat on the bench and watched Fantasy struggle with Jaedong , maybe they remembered for a moment their first Proleague finals , when they , just like Fantasy , walked on stage on an August evening to represent their team at the 2003 OnGameNet KTF EVERCup ProLeague .
Unlike this most recent Proleague finals though , Boxer 's team was not the favourite to win .
No , SKT T1 was only a glimmer in The Emperor 's eye , and any hope of future domination still remained a distant dream .
They were facing Hanbit Stars , which sported a lineup that included H.O.T - Forever , [ Oops ] Reach , Sync and Junwi_[ saM ] .
Though they had dispatched a KTF magicNs led by Yell Ow and Nada , they were not expected to win against a team like Hanbit , not by a long shot .
The rain come down hard in Olympic Park Peace Square in Seoul as fans gathered for the first team league finals in Professional Starcaft .
It was a historic occasion , and the fans knew it .
Wearing raincoats , they sat there for hours in what was perhaps one of Broodwar 's earliest and most rabid displays of fanboyism .
Maybe they just loved Starcraft , but maybe , just maybe they sensed a touch of magic in the air and knew instinctively that if they braved the clouds they would get to see history being made .
Do n't tell my mother I 'm at Olympic Park .
It was in such a setting that Boxer led his men out against Hanbit , and it was in such a setting that Orion showed their opponents that when it rains , it pours .
Boxer , Kingdom and sigamari dispatched Sync , Silent_Control and Reach respectively , and did in style .
The score was 3 - 0 , and the young men of Orion had tasted victory for the first time .
In August 2003 , Orion took the first team league title Starcraft history ,
and Hwan - Hoon were there , leading from the front .
- Lim Yo Hwan ,
" It was for this victory cup that we spent our time at the quarters eating , sleeping , and sweating while we practiced .
Others only saw our outward appearance and did not see our true appearances .
The secret to our team ’s victory was that our players had the endless potential and the hope that our dream would come true , as long as we never gave up .
We will shine brighter tomorrow than today , and even brighter the day after . " -
Lim Yo Hwan , Crazy as Me
There is a magic in those words , because as we all know , they are not just words .
History tells us that 2003 was only the beginning for Orion .
Although the KTF EVERCup Proleague was the team 's last title as Orion , it was an important one , for it was for all intents and purposes the first step they took on a walk to glory that illuminated progaming for the better part of the next few years .
Although Tongyang dropped their sponsorship of Boxer 's boys in late 2003 , the kids fought on , coming together as 4U or 4 Union to fight it out and stay competitive .
Funded by Boxer and other individuals , this was SKT 's troubled era in which they funded themselves while looking for a sponsors and trying to stay competitive at the same time .
Their days of want were short lived though .
On the 4th of March 2004 , they were signed by South Korea Telecom , and received the name by which we now know them .
SK Telecom T1 , aka living legends , aka Masters of the Universe .
To say that SK Telecom T1 is the Manchester United or the Yankees of progaming completely undermines their role in its history .
SK Telecom is not simply the most successful progaming franchise .
No , they are also its most influential , in every sphere from ones as trivial as merchandising to the far more influential metagame and strategy arenas .
Fielding half of the Bonjwas to have graced the Starcraft scene , they destroyed Broodwar for much of its existence , leaving in their wake crushed hopes and broken teams .
4U , having been signed by SK Telecom , celebrate the fact that
their Ramen eating days are over .
By 2006 , Professional Starcraft had seen 16 team league finals .
Boxer 's team had won seven of them .
Their nearest competitor was GO , who had won four , leaving two to Hanbit and single titles to the likes of Pantech EX and a few other teams .
There was no question , these were the times of SKT , and they were glorious .
Five days after their late August victory against Hanbit , Iloveoov set out to win the 2nd TGSambo ( TriGem ) MBCGame Starleague , something which he managed with ease , going 2 - 0 against YellOw , his master 's nemesis .
Over the next few years , he would be at the helm of SKT 's dominance , and bag 3 MSL and 2 OSL titles respectively in the individual leagues .
For those three years , if T1 was not at the very top of progaming , they were at all times at least in very close proximity to its summit , and made sure that anyone who tried to surpass them was given a good run for their money .
In fact , SKT 's last Proleague victory was not at a Grand Finals .
It was a R1 finals win over a MBC who would soon come back to avenge it .
On July 29th 2006 SK Telecom T1 dispatched them 4 - 1 and secured the last victory of their era of dominance .
On that summer evening , Orion 's deep glow , the glow that had given light to the galaxy for years , was strong , and bright , and fans would remember it with fondness as they stepped into an era of uncertainty with their team .
The old SKT bring it in for the last time at SKY 2006 .
2007 was a year of change for Starcraft .
On the third of March , a young Protoss Revolutionist was to destroy a Zerg king using a technique that would completely change the way PvZ would be played in the years to come .
Although perhaps less significant to the casual surveyor of Broodwar history , something far greater happened just a few months prior to this event .
On the 20th of January of that year , SK Telecom T1 appeared at SKY 2006 in a Proleague Grand Finals for the last time for many years .
Meeting a MBC in final in which our good friend Sea took out GoRush , and Pusan and July dispatched Midas and Iloveoov respectively , SK Telecom T1 lost on the grandest of stages , and thereby failed to retain the Proleague title .
Boxer had left for the air force the previous October , and although it 's difficult to peg the entire team 's performance on this issue , the psychological effect of seeing their leader leave would no doubt have influenced them at least a little .
Orion 's brightest star was on a hiatus , and the constellation dimmed considerably for the first time since the dawn of the Broodwar universe .
This was the beginning of the end for Joo Hoon , who struggled valiantly to keep his team going .
It was only a matter of time , however , and SKT 's terrible Proleague performance over the next few seasons prompted a complete change in management .
A little over a year later , on the 27th of February 2008 , all SKT coaching staff were let go , and MBC's Coach Park was hired , with Iloveoov and Kingdom retiring to take on coaching roles as well .
This proved to be a turning point in the history of T1 .
What is most ironic about SKY 2006 however is that it was Coach Park was responsible at least in part for the fall of SKT .
Leading MBC against them and defeating them convincingly , he had ridden the momentum of a R2 win against CJ Entus to seal the deal for MBC .
Upon winning Proleague that year , his team 's first title after their name change from POS or Pirates of Space to MBC HERO , Head Coach Coach Hae Tae Gi remarked
- Naver Interview .
" meeting coach park was the luckiest thing that happened in my life " .
MBC had lost to SKT in R1 , and come back a few months later to take the Grand Finals away from them , and although Park was not head coach , he was certainly an up and coming star in Starcraft coaching circles .
Coach Park , living by his personal motto - I pwn you ezpz .
It was only fitting , therefore , that he would eventually gravitate towards Broodwar 's most famous constellation when the time was right .
Coach Park and SKT were made for each other , a fact which this last final proved beyond a shadow of a doubt .
Under a year and a half after his arrival at SKT as Head Coach , Park has taken them to a title , something which the team could not manage for many seasons before that .
In congratulating him though , one must not forget that when Park does something , he does it in style .
One of these men is a trained assassin .
The other likes hotdogs .
At the opening ceremony of the 2008 - 09 Grand Final , he delivered some serious trash talk , and politely challenged the Coach Cho of Hwaseung to a bet , saying that the losing coach would shave their head .
Cho declined , and SKT was already up in terms of mind games .
On day two , he good naturedly urged Hwaseung fans to cross over to SKT if their team lost before saying he was joking , and saying he thought that all teams needed hardcore fans .
Indeed , Park 's behaviour at both pre-game interviews clearly demonstrates his style of coaching .
This is a coach who believes in himself , and above all , believes in his team .
Both Park and Cho came to Pusan with a Proleague title each , but from the moment they were interviewed on day one , it was obvious who was walking away with another one .
The irony of SKY 2006 does n't stop at Park , however .
There was another player on that MBC team in 2007 , a young Protoss who played against them here , and though by losing to InToTheRainbow did not actually actively help in their defeat , was without a doubt involved at least by proxy .
Yes , fans of Broodwar , Kim Taek Yong was there when SKT fell , and he was there this weekend when they rose again .
In many ways , it was this Protoss who steered Boxer 's team through this season of Proleague .
From a less than stellar performance in the opening rounds of this season , Bisu played strong , consistent Starcraft , bagging wins throughout the season and eventually falling just one short of MVP .
Netting the most personal wins however would have been the farthest thing on his mind as he stood with his team mates on that stage in Pusan .
Although he missed his day one game due to SKT going 4 - 0 , he played his day two opener with panache , and danced circles around Perfectman to give SKT a great start by delivering yet another win .
Having enjoyed the pomp of a Proleague victory many moons ago as a rookie with MBC , he was now here , leading Boxer 's team back to stardom .
Kim Taek
Yong may be out of the OSL this year , and that no doubt pains him .
In the long run though , he has no doubt realised that his role at SK Telecom T1 is far bigger than all his individual league wins put together .
He is the modern SKT 's boxer , their tireless workhorse and their unwavering ace who goes out there time and time again to net them wins .
He is young , experienced , and is to modern SKT what Boxer was to Orion - a man who leads from the front , delivering not speeches , but cold , calculated wins .
SKT frontmen of two eras share some lulz after looking at the Grand Finals ' lineups .
Coach Park and Bisu were acquired by SKT T1 in 2008 in separate deals , but combined they are probably the most important decision made by the team 's management in the last quarter decade .
Park is a winner , there 's no denying that .
While Joo Hoon may have netted Orion their first win , and then moved on to crush everything in his path for early part of SKT 's history , after SKY 2006 he fell , and there was no coming back .
While he will always remain a vital part of the team 's legacy , the important thing is that the legacy of SKT continues , and if there is a man who can make sure that happens it 's Park .
The mantle has passed , and Orion 's three original stars have all but faded away .
Coach Hoon is gone , and Boxer and oov may never play again .
In the very least , they most likely will never play the way they did back then .
What they have done this past season however outweighs the sum of any of their personal accomplishments , or medals , or trophies .
Over the course of Proleague R5 , and indeed , in these finals played out over two days in sunny Pusan , they have shown that they are not just kings , but kingmakers .
Lim Yo Hwan and Choi Yun Sung did what they had to do for the team .
They played hard , they played long , and SKT prospered .
Now , many years later , they 're still batting on , not from the booth but from the bench , a bench from where they looked on expectantly as their newest protege took the stage against the current overmind .
When Fantasy stepped out on Friday to lead his team into battle , he did n't carry with him dual starleague titles , or a thousand B word threads .
All he had was two silver medals , and the backing of two of Broodwar 's greatest Terrans .
Indeed , as the countdown threw him into what was perhaps the most important game of his life , and as the first minutes of the said game unfolded , SKT fans everywhere closed their eyes , unable to look on .
Jung Myung
Hoon was being schooled , nay crushed by a master of the game .
Or was he ?
We do n't know what was ringing in Fantasy 's ears under the SPL soundblock he was wearing .
We do n't know how hard his heart was beating , or how fast his hands were moving .
We do n't know what we was thinking , but we know this - as his mentors looked on from the bench , they looked at him with a confidence , a confidence that they had gained on a similar August evening many years ago when they first tasted glory .
As he stuck it out , getting flanked , and dropped in what can only be described as a Jaedong horror house , he displayed an unquenchable spirit that we saw many years ago in EVER04 as Boxer and Iloveoov took the series to five games in what has been called the greatest OSL finals to date .
In weathering the Zerg hurricane , and sticking it out , Fantasy showed a maturity far beyond his years .
This was not some individual title he was fighting for .
This was Proleague , the biggest gaming tournament in the world , and he was representing his team , and in doing so stepping out to honour a dynasty that he had grown up with .
Now , he was here , living the dream , and yet getting massacred by the greatest player in the world .
He held .
He held , he held , he held .
He lost vessels , people laughed , his bionic army got slaughtered and there were calls for him to gg .
Yet he held , and with one defiler snipe and a quick siege of tanks , a hatchery went down , and marines marched in to raze the swarm .
It was over .
The series continued , however , and his biggest test awaited him on day two .
With SKT going 3 - 3 with OZ and the game being taken to ace , Coach Park decided to send him out again , against the same opponent , on the same map where had had lost Game 5 of the OSL finals .
As he 8raxed and took the fight to Jaedong , and as an ovie died , and a bunker was built , in every aspect of his game the young Terran showed complete and utter control .
Although people screamed starsense when Jaedong 9pooled without seeing Fantasy 's 8rax , the real sense of star was displayed by the Terran himself , who executed what can only be described as the perfect counter to Jaedong 's two hatch muta .
As sunkens went down , and lings popped like zits , a control group of marines and SCVs walked into the Zerg main and for a moment we were back in time and watching Boxer serve up a perfect build to some hapless son of the swarm .
Some may call it cheese , and get angry about it , but in those intense minutes of battle , in those moments of conflict , Fantasy stepped up and showed that medals , titles and prize money aside , he was , is and always will be a Terran to contend with .
SKT needed a win , and their Terran lineage delivered once again .
A home grown T1 destroyer , Jung Myung Hoon has been called a hybrid of Hwan - Sung , a perfect mix of creative micro based play and intense , mechanical , mind blowing macro .
Here at Team Liquid , we named him the
A few months ago , when speaking of the SKT T1 Terran dynasty , I said the following .
- A Deadly Dynasty
If Boxer and Iloveoov invest in this new breed of Terran , and spend the hours , days and weeks needed to truly develop him into a player of their calibre , the world of Starcraft just may see another titan emerge in the seasons to come .
The future of this dynasty of death , then , lies in the dexterous hands of a Terran , who having been robbed of the honour twice , is now battle hardened , and ready to reach for the stars with a firmer resolve than ever before .
This weekend , Fantasy did not just reach for the stars , he became one .
In defeating Jaedong on day one , and beginning the momentum that would lead his team to 4 - 0 their opponents on Day 1 , Jung Myung Hoon established himself as a player capable of putting away one for the team .
What he did on day two , however , was unthinkable .
Playing in what was perhaps the biggest of his young career , and carrying his entire team on his shoulders as he did so , Fantasy stepped up and executed a micro intensive tactic that was reminiscent of none other than Lim Yo Hwan himself .
He not only delivered a perfect 8rax build , but did so with a cold , calm determination that should be feared by anyone who plays him from now on .
Lee Jaedong may have taken the last OSL from him , but this weekend , on a starry night in Pusan , Fantasy crushed his opponent on a far grander stage .
While Jung Myung Hoon was always a star in the SKT constellation , tonight he was its brightest , and rightly so .
Along with Bisu , he is the hope of T1 , and a vital weapon in their arsenal as they look to the future .
Of course , Boxer and Iloveoov had also done their part , and this showed clearly as they sat on the bench , looking on like proud parents as their protege took down the gas and spawning pool of the world 's most feared Zerg .
As Jaedong typed out and Fantasy exited his booth , their smiles said it all - this kid would do just fine .
He was like them .
Just like them .
Angered easily by TvT trash talk , Iloveoov spent much of this
Proleague season losing money games to his young protege .
These past few months have been hard for the old Terrans .
They 've played very few televised games , and Iloveoov had medical problems to boot .
In the end though , this weekend , and in retrospect , the whole of R5 showed just where their time was going .
From Orion , through 4U and the early days of SKT , Boxer and Iloveoov were not just players , but strategists .
This was not something they were taught , or schooled in , it was something they were born with , and something they brought to their team .
Indeed , this weekend in Pusan it was their years of experience that shone brighter than the spotlights or fireworks , as players they had taught and trained walked all over their opposition .
As a team , T1 has really developed in the past year .
With the Bisu / Best powerhouse chugging along fine , albeit with some lacklustre performance by the latter Protoss in recent months , and Canata coming back from a nap that spanned many seasons to get to the Ro8 in both individual leagues this season , it 's no surprise that SKT T1 went all the way this year .
In fact , one can even say that the Boxer / oov / Kingdom triple crown team of 2005 has been revived in the form of Fantasy / Canata / Bisu , with Best taking InToTheRainbow 's spot as Protoss number two .
While the team 's Zerg lineup badly needs a boost , this is an issue that the coaching staff are no doubt aware of , and are fully capable of handling .
If this weekend 's games are any indication though , Hyuk may be redeemable .
Although we can't say that he was n't handed his day two game by Jaedong , he did what was needed on both days by securing wins for his team .
We live in a time of turmoil , the post - Bonjwa era even , where dominance is hard to come by , and competition is at the toughest it has ever been .
Therefore , it is with hope that we looked to Pusan this week , and it is with hope that we were rewarded , as one of the original constellations in the Broodwar universe shone brighter than it had in a long time .
Orion , though we no longer refer to them by that name , has always had three main stars .
In its early years , Joo Hoon , Lim Yo Hwan and Choi Yun Sung were at the heart of the constellation and devoured with fire anything that dared come close .
Now , many years later , those luminous orbs of deadly plasma have begun to fade , and yet from within them , a new breed of stars have emerged .
Drawing energy from the past , and powered by the vibrancy of the years gone by , multiple young stars went nova this weekend in Korea , and as people stood on the beach and looked up at a beautiful night sky in Pusan , three shone brighter than the rest .
As the shadows fell , and fans went crazy , Park Young Woon , Kim Taek Yong and Jung Myung Hoon glowed with the light of an era long lost , an era that they rekindled with careful strategy , diligent practice , and an unquenchable desire to achieve excellence .
They are the new stars of Orion , and as the team heads into another incarnation of Proleague , they will be shining brighter than ever before .
This week , many months after SKY 2006 , this banner now holds true once again .
We do n't know what next season will hold .
We do n't know what the next year will be like .
When we look back on this season of Proleague however , we will be able to say that in August 2009 , Orion shone as bright as they did six years prior , and that though the same stars were not emitting energy , the ones that glowed were as bright and glorious as their predecessors , and that the constellation is as much alive today as it was all those years ago .
Many seasons ago , when Broodwar was young , Lim Yo Hwan left IS to form Orion .
Today , Orion left IS in the dust to take to the skies like before , and establish themselves once again as the true masters of the universe .
After many years of cloud cover , the Broodwar canvas is now clear and dark , and in its very center shines the belt of a hunter who , having once ruled the very sky itself has now returned to seek vengeance for a time when he became the hunted .
Long ago , when Broodwar had just been birthed , a boy named Lim looked out through a computer screen and saw a universe .
Where others saw wasted hours and childish games , Lim saw potential .
Lim saw a dream .
Now , a decade later , we know him not as a boy but as The Emperor , the brightest star in the Starcraft universe and a man whose name is synonymous with the game itself .
Above all , however , we remember Lim Yo Hwan as the creator of a dynasty of destruction , and the leader of a group of legends we today call SK Telecom T1 , the most successful franchise in all of Broodwar .
Looking at these titans now , and indeed , looking at them this August weekend in the Proleague Grand Finals in Pusan , it is quite difficult to remember their roots .
Indeed , as Boxer and Iloveoov sat on the SKT bench and watched their proteges sweep through the season 's biggest event with a ruthlessness that sent shivers of fear through progaming circles , perhaps their minds would have wandered back to the days when they first took their team to the big leagues .
The year was 2003 , and a newly founded Orion coached by Joo Hoon or as Boxer called himwas trying hard to find a sponsor , and thereby become a real team .
Months before , Boxer had met future Coach Hoon just a little while before departing his then team IS , and thereby inadvertently formed one of progaming 's most important friendships .
Ironically , the team which Boxer left is also the team SKT faced this weekend in Pusan .
That 's right , IS became K- TEC Plus , which in turn went on to become Plus , Lecaf OZ and now , as we know them Hwaseung OZ .
It is said that Boxer 's father had a major influence in his son's move from the team .
Arguing that the team he was on was mismanaged , and that the players did n't even have adequate quarters , he convinced a young Lim Yo Hwan to cut contract with IS and start his own outfit .
Lim did not leave alone however , he took with him a young Protoss player who would soon be know for his amazing reaver control .
Yes , Boxer 's first recruit was none other than InToTheRainbow .
Over the next few years the Hwan - Hoon partnership would not only form a progaming team , but would go on to find a high profile sponsor and lay the foundation of one of Starcraft 's most vibrant dynasties .
It was a partnership that would continue until Boxer left for the air force in October 2006 .
Slowly but surely Orion came together .
From Kingdom , to Zerglee and [ z - zone ]
kOs , many of SKT 's most well known names were recruited by the Hwan - Hoon partnership during the months following Boxer 's departure from IS .
The biggest news however was the recruitment of the three young rookies , including Sigamari and [ Blaze ]
Hiroko , two promising young Zerg players .
It was also during this time that the emperor to be made one of his most important decisions - playing against and recruiting a Terran that would later become his pupil , friend and confidante .
Orion 's final member for the time being , and indeed , its most important addition to date , was none other than the monster we now call Iloveoov .
In retrospect , the name they chose for their outfit was perfect for a team that would soon be one of the brightest constellations in the Broodwar universe .
Finally , a sponsor was found for Orion in the form of Tongyang , snack food makers and owners of OGN at the time , and Boxer 's dream was officially under way .
He was leading his first progaming team .
Unlike IS , this was his team , a factor which played a major part in how they worked , and indeed , played .
As Lim Yo Hwan and Choi Yun Sung sat on the bench and watched Fantasy struggle with Jaedong , maybe they remembered for a moment their first Proleague finals , when they , just like Fantasy , walked on stage on an August evening to represent their team at the 2003 OnGameNet KTF EVERCup ProLeague .
Unlike this most recent Proleague finals though , Boxer 's team was not the favourite to win .
No , SKT T1 was only a glimmer in The Emperor 's eye , and any hope of future domination still remained a distant dream .
They were facing Hanbit Stars , which sported a lineup that included H.O.T - Forever , [ Oops ] Reach , Sync and Junwi_[ saM ] .
Though they had dispatched a KTF magicNs led by Yell Ow and Nada , they were not expected to win against a team like Hanbit , not by a long shot .
The rain come down hard in Olympic Park Peace Square in Seoul as fans gathered for the first team league finals in Professional Starcaft .
It was a historic occasion , and the fans knew it .
Wearing raincoats , they sat there for hours in what was perhaps one of Broodwar 's earliest and most rabid displays of fanboyism .
Maybe they just loved Starcraft , but maybe , just maybe they sensed a touch of magic in the air and knew instinctively that if they braved the clouds they would get to see history being made .
It was in such a setting that Boxer led his men out against Hanbit , and it was in such a setting that Orion showed their opponents that when it rains , it pours .
Boxer , Kingdom and sigamari dispatched Sync , Silent_Control and Reach respectively , and did in style .
The score was 3 - 0 , and the young men of Orion had tasted victory for the first time .
There is a magic in those words , because as we all know , they are not just words .
History tells us that 2003 was only the beginning for Orion .
Although the KTF EVERCup Proleague was the team 's last title as Orion , it was an important one , for it was for all intents and purposes the first step they took on a walk to glory that illuminated progaming for the better part of the next few years .
Although Tongyang dropped their sponsorship of Boxer 's boys in late 2003 , the kids fought on , coming together as 4U orto fight it out and stay competitive .
Funded by Boxer and other individuals , this was SKT 's troubled era in which they funded themselves while looking for a sponsors and trying to stay competitive at the same time .
Their days of want were short lived though .
On the 4th of March 2004 , they were signed by South Korea Telecom , and received the name by which we now know them .
SK Telecom T1 , aka living legends , aka Masters of the Universe .
To say that SK Telecom T1 is the Manchester United or the Yankees of progaming completely undermines their role in its history .
SK Telecom is not simply the most successful progaming franchise .
No , they are also its most influential , in every sphere from ones as trivial as merchandising to the far more influential metagame and strategy arenas .
Fielding half of theto have graced the Starcraft scene , they destroyed Broodwar for much of its existence , leaving in their wake crushed hopes and broken teams .
By 2006 , Professional Starcraft had seen 16 team league finals .
Boxer 's team had won seven of them .
Their nearest competitor was GO , who had won four , leaving two to Hanbit and single titles to the likes of Pantech EX and a few other teams .
There was no question , these were the times of SKT , and they were glorious .
Five days after their late August victory against Hanbit , Iloveoov set out to win the 2nd TGSambo ( TriGem ) MBCGame Starleague , something which he managed with ease , going 2 - 0 against YellOw , his master 's nemesis .
Over the next few years , he would be at the helm of SKT 's dominance , and bag 3 MSL and 2 OSL titles respectively in the individual leagues .
For those three years , if T1 was not at the very top of progaming , they were at all times at least in very close proximity to its summit , and made sure that anyone who tried to surpass them was given a good run for their money .
In fact , SKT 's last Proleague victory was not at a Grand Finals .
It was a R1 finals win over a MBC who would soon come back to avenge it .
On July 29th 2006 SK Telecom T1 dispatched them 4 - 1 and secured the last victory of their era of dominance .
On that summer evening , Orion 's deep glow , the glow that had given light to the galaxy for years , was strong , and bright , and fans would remember it with fondness as they stepped into an era of uncertainty with their team .2007 was a year of change for Starcraft .
On the third of March , a young Protoss Revolutionist was to destroy a Zerg king using a technique that would completely change the way PvZ would be played in the years to come .
Although perhaps less significant to the casual surveyor of Broodwar history , something far greater happened just a few months prior to this event .
On the 20th of January of that year , SK Telecom T1 appeared at SKY 2006 in a Proleague Grand Finals for the last time for many years .
Meeting a MBC in final in which our good friend Sea took out GoRush , and Pusan and July dispatched Midas and Iloveoov respectively , SK Telecom T1 lost on the grandest of stages , and thereby failed to retain the Proleague title .
Boxer had left for the air force the previous October , and although it 's difficult to peg the entire team 's performance on this issue , the psychological effect of seeing their leader leave would no doubt have influenced them at least a little .
Orion 's brightest star was on a hiatus , and the constellation dimmed considerably for the first time since the dawn of the Broodwar universe .
This was the beginning of the end for Joo Hoon , who struggled valiantly to keep his team going .
It was only a matter of time , however , and SKT 's terrible Proleague performance over the next few seasons prompted a complete change in management .
A little over a year later , on the 27th of February 2008 , all SKT coaching staff were let go , and MBC's Coach Park was hired , with Iloveoov and Kingdom retiring to take on coaching roles as well .
This proved to be a turning point in the history of T1 .
What is most ironic about SKY 2006 however is that it was Coach Park was responsible at least in part for the fall of SKT .
Leading MBC against them and defeating them convincingly , he had ridden the momentum of a R2 win against CJ Entus to seal the deal for MBC .
Upon winning Proleague that year , his team 's first title after their name change from POS or Pirates of Space to MBC HERO , Head Coach Coach Hae Tae Gi remarked MBC had lost to SKT in R1 , and come back a few months later to take the Grand Finals away from them , and although Park was not head coach , he was certainly an up and coming star in Starcraft coaching circles .
It was only fitting , therefore , that he would eventually gravitate towards Broodwar 's most famous constellation when the time was right .
Coach Park and SKT were made for each other , a fact which this last final proved beyond a shadow of a doubt .
Under a year and a half after his arrival at SKT as Head Coach , Park has taken them to a title , something which the team could not manage for many seasons before that .
In congratulating him though , one must not forget that when Park does something , he does it in style .
At the opening ceremony of the 2008 - 09 Grand Final , he delivered some serious trash talk , and politely challenged the Coach Cho of Hwaseung to a bet , saying that the losing coach would shave their head .
Cho declined , and SKT was already up in terms of mind games .
On day two , he good naturedly urged Hwaseung fans to cross over to SKT if their team lost before saying he was joking , and saying he thought that all teams needed hardcore fans .
Indeed , Park 's behaviour at both pre-game interviews clearly demonstrates his style of coaching .
This is a coach who believes in himself , and above all , believes in his team .
Both Park and Cho came to Pusan with a Proleague title each , but from the moment they were interviewed on day one , it was obvious who was walking away with another one .
The irony of SKY 2006 does n't stop at Park , however .
There was another player on that MBC team in 2007 , a young Protoss who played against them here , and though by losing to InToTheRainbow did not actually actively help in their defeat , was without a doubt involved at least by proxy .
Yes , fans of Broodwar , Kim Taek Yong was there when SKT fell , and he was there this weekend when they rose again .
In many ways , it was this Protoss who steered Boxer 's team through this season of Proleague .
From a less than stellar performance in the opening rounds of this season , Bisu played strong , consistent Starcraft , bagging wins throughout the season and eventually falling just one short of MVP .
Netting the most personal wins however would have been the farthest thing on his mind as he stood with his team mates on that stage in Pusan .
Although he missed his day one game due to SKT going 4 - 0 , he played his day two opener with panache , and danced circles around Perfectman to give SKT a great start by delivering yet another win .
Having enjoyed the pomp of a Proleague victory many moons ago as a rookie with MBC , he was now here , leading Boxer 's team back to stardom .
Kim Taek
Yong may be out of the OSL this year , and that no doubt pains him .
In the long run though , he has no doubt realised that his role at SK Telecom T1 is far bigger than all his individual league wins put together .
He is the modern SKT 's boxer , their tireless workhorse and their unwavering ace who goes out there time and time again to net them wins .
He is young , experienced , and is to modern SKT what Boxer was to Orion - a man who leads from the front , delivering not speeches , but cold , calculated wins .
Coach Park and Bisu were acquired by SKT T1 in 2008 in separate deals , but combined they are probably the most important decision made by the team 's management in the last quarter decade .
Park is a winner , there 's no denying that .
While Joo Hoon may have netted Orion their first win , and then moved on to crush everything in his path for early part of SKT 's history , after SKY 2006 he fell , and there was no coming back .
While he will always remain a vital part of the team 's legacy , the important thing is that the legacy of SKT continues , and if there is a man who can make sure that happens it 's Park .
The mantle has passed , and Orion 's three original stars have all but faded away .
Coach Hoon is gone , and Boxer and oov may never play again .
In the very least , they most likely will never play the way they did back then .
What they have done this past season however outweighs the sum of any of their personal accomplishments , or medals , or trophies .
Over the course of Proleague R5 , and indeed , in these finals played out over two days in sunny Pusan , they have shown that they are not just kings , but kingmakers .
Lim Yo Hwan and Choi Yun Sung did what they had to do for the team .
They played hard , they played long , and SKT prospered .
Now , many years later , they 're still batting on , not from the booth but from the bench , a bench from where they looked on expectantly as their newest protege took the stage against the current overmind .
When Fantasy stepped out on Friday to lead his team into battle , he did n't carry with him dual starleague titles , or a thousand B word threads .
All he had was two silver medals , and the backing of two of Broodwar 's greatest Terrans .
Indeed , as the countdown threw him into what was perhaps the most important game of his life , and as the first minutes of the said game unfolded , SKT fans everywhere closed their eyes , unable to look on .
Jung Myung
Hoon was being schooled , nayby a master of the game .
Or was he ?
We do n't know what was ringing in Fantasy 's ears under the SPL soundblock he was wearing .
We do n't know how hard his heart was beating , or how fast his hands were moving .
We do n't know what we was thinking , but we know this - as his mentors looked on from the bench , they looked at him with a confidence , a confidence that they had gained on a similar August evening many years ago when they first tasted glory .
As he stuck it out , getting flanked , and dropped in what can only be described as a Jaedong horror house , he displayed an unquenchable spirit that we saw many years ago in EVER04 as Boxer and Iloveoov took the series to five games in what has been called the greatest OSL finals to date .
In weathering the Zerg hurricane , and sticking it out , Fantasy showed a maturity far beyond his years .
This was not some individual title he was fighting for .
This was Proleague , the biggest gaming tournament in the world , and he was representing his team , and in doing so stepping out to honour a dynasty that he had grown up with .
Now , he was here , living the dream , and yet getting massacred by the greatest player in the world .
He held .
He held , he held , he held .
He lost vessels , people laughed , his bionic army got slaughtered and there were calls for him to gg .
Yet he held , and with one defiler snipe and a quick siege of tanks , a hatchery went down , and marines marched in to raze the swarm .
It was over .
The series continued , however , and his biggest test awaited him on day two .
With SKT going 3 - 3 with OZ and the game being taken to ace , Coach Park decided to send him out again , against the same opponent , on the same map where had had lost Game 5 of the OSL finals .
As he 8raxed and took the fight to Jaedong , and as an ovie died , and a bunker was built , in every aspect of his game the young Terran showed complete and utter control .
Although people screamedwhen Jaedong 9pooled without seeing Fantasy 's 8rax , the real sense of star was displayed by the Terran himself , who executed what can only be described as the perfect counter to Jaedong 's two hatch muta .
As sunkens went down , and lings popped like zits , a control group of marines and SCVs walked into the Zerg main and for a moment we were back in time and watching Boxer serve up a perfect build to some hapless son of the swarm .
Some may call it cheese , and get angry about it , but in those intense minutes of battle , in those moments of conflict , Fantasy stepped up and showed that medals , titles and prize money aside , he was , is and always will be a Terran to contend with .
SKT needed a win , and their Terran lineage delivered once again .
A home grown T1 destroyer , Jung Myung Hoon has been called a hybrid of Hwan - Sung , a perfect mix of creative micro based play and intense , mechanical , mind blowing macro .
Here at Team Liquid , we named him the Terran Revolutionist for his amazing vulture valkyrie build that has become the bane of Zerg players on every known Starcraft ladder .
A few months ago , when speaking of the SKT T1 Terran dynasty , I said the following .
This weekend , Fantasy did not just reach for the stars , he became one .
In defeating Jaedong on day one , and beginning the momentum that would lead his team to 4 - 0 their opponents on Day 1 , Jung Myung Hoon established himself as a player capable of putting away one for the team .
What he did on day two , however , was unthinkable .
Playing in what was perhaps the biggest of his young career , and carrying his entire team on his shoulders as he did so , Fantasy stepped up and executed a micro intensive tactic that was reminiscent of none other than Lim Yo Hwan himself .
He not only delivered a perfect 8rax build , but did so with a cold , calm determination that should be feared by anyone who plays him from now on .
Lee Jaedong may have taken the last OSL from him , but this weekend , on a starry night in Pusan , Fantasy crushed his opponent on a far grander stage .
While Jung Myung Hoon was always a star in the SKT constellation , tonight he was its brightest , and rightly so .
Along with Bisu , he is the hope of T1 , and a vital weapon in their arsenal as they look to the future .
Of course , Boxer and Iloveoov had also done their part , and this showed clearly as they sat on the bench , looking on like proud parents as their protege took down the gas and spawning pool of the world 's most feared Zerg .
As Jaedong typed out and Fantasy exited his booth , their smiles said it all - this kid would do just fine .
He was like them .
Just like them .
These past few months have been hard for the old Terrans .
They 've played very few televised games , and Iloveoov had medical problems to boot .
In the end though , this weekend , and in retrospect , the whole of R5 showed just where their time was going .
From Orion , through 4U and the early days of SKT , Boxer and Iloveoov were not just players , but strategists .
This was not something they were taught , or schooled in , it was something they were born with , and something they brought to their team .
Indeed , this weekend in Pusan it was their years of experience that shone brighter than the spotlights or fireworks , as players they had taught and trained walked all over their opposition .
As a team , T1 has really developed in the past year .
With the Bisu / Best powerhouse chugging along fine , albeit with some lacklustre performance by the latter Protoss in recent months , and Canata coming back from a nap that spanned many seasons to get to the Ro8 in both individual leagues this season , it 's no surprise that SKT T1 went all the way this year .
In fact , one can even say that the Boxer / oov / Kingdom triple crown team of 2005 has been revived in the form of Fantasy / Canata / Bisu , with Best taking InToTheRainbow 's spot as Protoss number two .
While the team 's Zerg lineup badly needs a boost , this is an issue that the coaching staff are no doubt aware of , and are fully capable of handling .
If this weekend 's games are any indication though , Hyuk may be redeemable .
Although we can't say that he was n't handed his day two game by Jaedong , he did what was needed on both days by securing wins for his team .
We live in a time of turmoil , theera even , where dominance is hard to come by , and competition is at the toughest it has ever been .
Therefore , it is with hope that we looked to Pusan this week , and it is with hope that we were rewarded , as one of the original constellations in the Broodwar universe shone brighter than it had in a long time .
Orion , though we no longer refer to them by that name , has always had three main stars .
In its early years , Joo Hoon , Lim Yo Hwan and Choi Yun Sung were at the heart of the constellation and devoured with fire anything that dared come close .
Now , many years later , those luminous orbs of deadly plasma have begun to fade , and yet from within them , a new breed of stars have emerged .
Drawing energy from the past , and powered by the vibrancy of the years gone by , multiple young stars went nova this weekend in Korea , and as people stood on the beach and looked up at a beautiful night sky in Pusan , three shone brighter than the rest .
As the shadows fell , and fans went crazy , Park Young Woon , Kim Taek Yong and Jung Myung Hoon glowed with the light of an era long lost , an era that they rekindled with careful strategy , diligent practice , and an unquenchable desire to achieve excellence .
They are the new stars of Orion , and as the team heads into another incarnation of Proleague , they will be shining brighter than ever before .
We do n't know what next season will hold .
We do n't know what the next year will be like .
When we look back on this season of Proleague however , we will be able to say that in August 2009 , Orion shone as bright as they did six years prior , and that though the same stars were not emitting energy , the ones that glowed were as bright and glorious as their predecessors , and that the constellation is as much alive today as it was all those years ago .
Many seasons ago , when Broodwar was young , Lim Yo Hwan left IS to form Orion .
Today , Orion left IS in the dust to take to the skies like before , and establish themselves once again as the true masters of the universe .
After many years of cloud cover , the Broodwar canvas is now clear and dark , and in its very center shines the belt of a hunter who , having once ruled the very sky itself has now returned to seek vengeance for a time when he became the hunted .

Los 12 obispos del estado de México , entre ellos Carlos Aguiar Retes , arzobispo de Tlalnepantla y presidente de la Conferencia del Episcopado Mexicano ( CEM ) , expresaron ayer en un documento emitido con motivo de las próximas elecciones , que el abstencionismo es señal inequívoca de subdesarrollo democrático , por tanto instaron a los electores a acudir a las urnas .
En el escrito , los prelados también destacan que en muchas ocasiones llegan al poder personas que no han sido idóneas , justamente porque los votantes no acuden a las urnas , y con ello facilitan el acceso a puestos de elección popular de quienes no son los más capaces .
“ Si tan noble es la política y la vocación de los políticos es tan sublime , ¿por qué entonces nos quejamos de nuestros políticos ? , tal vez porque nosotros tenemos la culpa , porque no hemos sabido elegir con responsabilidad a nuestros gobernantes o , lo que es peor , con nuestra indiferencia o abstención en el ejercicio de nuestro voto hemos permitido que lleguen al poder algunas personas que no han sido idóneas .
Agregan que renunciar al derecho al voto equivale a entregar el país a los criterios a veces no correctos de unos cuantos , por eso todo ciudadano tiene obligación moral de votar .
Añaden en el escrito que para ejercer correctamente este derecho al sufragio el ciudadano debe conocer el ideario de cada partido político y estar al tanto del programa de gobierno de los candidatos .

Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis present a satirical review of the week 's news , with help from Jon Holmes , Laura Shavin , Mitch Benn and Marcus Brigstocke .
T.S. Eliot was wrong .
August is the cruelest month .
As we head toward next month ’s congressional face - off on a national healthcare bill , the news media are infatuated with town hall meetings .
Over and over , we see angry citizens screaming about a Big Government takeover of the healthcare system , shouting that they will lose their insurance or be forced to give up their doctors and denouncing “ death panels ” that will euthanize old people .
Of course , none of this is even remotely true .
These are all canards peddled by insurance companies terrified of losing their power and profits , by right - wing militants terrified of a victory for the president they hate and by the Republican Party , which has been commandeered by the insurance industry and the militants .
But the lies have obviously had their effect .
Recent polls show that support for healthcare reform -- reform that would insure more Americans , would force insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions and prevent them from capriciously terminating coverage , and would provide competition to drive down costs -- is rapidly eroding .
Maybe Americans should know better .
Maybe they should n’t fall for the latest imbecilic propaganda and scare tactics .
Maybe .
But a citizenry is only as well - informed as the quality of information it receives .
One ca n’t expect Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck or Sarah Palin or the Republican Party or even the Democrats to provide serious , truthful assessments of a complex health plan .
Truth has to come from somewhere else -- from a reliable , objective , trustworthy source .
That source should be the media , and there has been , in fact , some excellent coverage of healthcare , especially by our better newspapers and especially lately when the untruths have become a torrent , rousing reporters to provide a corrective .
But overall , the coverage has not been exactly edifying .
According to the Pew Research Center , 16 % of the stories in its media sample last week were devoted to healthcare , but three - quarters of that coverage was either about legislative politics or the town halls .
Tom Rosenstiel , who heads Pew ’s Center for Excellence in Journalism , said that if the healthcare debate is a potential teaching moment , that “ moment is passing us by . ”

Television particularly has been remiss , even without mentioning cable news , which may be the greatest source of disinformation .
ABC took some heat from Republicans for giving President Obama a prime - time forum to answer questions about healthcare in June .
But as far as I can tell , it is the only prime - time special that any broadcast network has devoted to the healthcare debate .
Even so , rather than merely host the president , ABC should have had a variety of experts and qualified reporters assessing exactly what the proposed bills will and will not do and who is and is not telling the truth -- a difficult but not impossible task .
To look at this in a larger context , journalists would no doubt say that it is n’t really their job to ferret out the “ truth . ”
It is their job to report “ facts . ”
If Palin says that Obama intends to euthanize her child , they report it .
If Limbaugh says that Obama ’s healthcare plan smacks of Nazism , they report it .
And if riled citizens begin shouting down their representatives , they report it , and report it , and report it .
The more noise and the bigger the controversy , the greater the coverage .
This creates a situation in which not only is the truth subordinate to lies , but one in which shameless lies are actually privileged over reasoned debate .
Do n’t think the militants do n’t know this and take full advantage of it .
They know that the media , especially the so - called liberal mainstream media -- which are hardly liberal if assessed honestly -- refrain from attempting to referee arguments for fear that they will be accused by the right of taking sides .
So rather than be battered , the media -- and I am talking about the respectable media , not the carnival barkers on cable -- increasingly strive for the simplest sort of balance rather than real objectivity .
They marshal facts , but they do n’t seek truth .
They behave as if every argument must be heard and has equal merit , when some are simply specious .
That is how global warming , WMD and “ end of life ” counseling have become part of silly reportorial ping - pong at best and badly misleading information at worst .
All of this is even more relevant given the death of media oracle Walter Cronkite several weeks ago .
He achieved his legendary status , as many have observed , not because he was the reassuring avuncular voice of America , blandly reading the news , but because he was often its truth teller , upsetting our complacency .
It was Cronkite who visited Vietnam and declared it a stalemate when nearly everyone else in the news media was gung - ho .
And it was Cronkite who decided to take the Washington Post ’s reporting on Watergate and devote 14 minutes of his broadcast to it , thus dragging it from the sidelines into the national conversation .
The truth is also relevant in light of a recent online poll that showed Jon Stewart as the nation ’s most trusted newsman .
Stewart is , of course , a comedian , and the news media ’s incapacity to tell the truth , along with the idiocies and hypocrisies of our political leadership , are his running joke .
What he does to politicians and to the media is exactly what the media should be doing to politicians and to one another .

It was because we did n’t have a committed , truth - telling media that the country marched happily into Iraq , with tragic consequences that should have been foreseen .
As media analyst Michael Massing discovered in his study of the prewar coverage , virtually the entire media , except for the McClatchy papers , reported the administration ’s rationale without devoting more than a few sentences or minutes to dissenting voices , much less doing their own analysis .
It was because we did n’t have a committed , truth - telling media that the country plunged off the economic cliff with so little warning .
And it may very well be because we do n’t have a committed , truth - telling media that we will fail to get the healthcare reform we so desperately need .
Why do n’t we get the truth ?
Part of it , as I ’ve said , is fear -- fear that if journalists dispel the rumors they will be bashed by the right , which is implacably against the president ’s reforms no matter how much sense they make .
Part of it is a lack of expertise .
Most reporters are not equipped to quickly and authoritatively tell truth from spin on an issue such as healthcare .
And part of it , frankly , is sheer laziness .
Telling the truth requires shoe leather .
It requires digging up facts that are n’t being handed to you , talking to experts , thinking hard about what you find .
This is n’t easy .
It takes time and energy as well as guts , especially when there are conflicting studies , as there are on healthcare .
But finally , we may not have a journalism of truth because we have n’t demanded one .
Many of us are invested in one side of the story ; we are for Obama or against him , for healthcare reform or against it .
These are a priori positions .
Truth wo n’t change them .
Yet the danger of not insisting on the truth in a brave new world of constant lies is that it subjects our policies to whichever side shouts the loudest or has the most money to spend to mislead us .
That is likely to lead to disastrous governance : a needless war , a great recession , a continuation of a failing healthcare system .

What it comes down to is that sometimes the media have to tell the truth not because anyone really wants them to but because it is the right thing to do -- the essential thing to do -- for the sake of our democracy .
Christine Gerzon is the epitome of a kindergarten teacher : warm and wise , quick to get down on her knees to wipe a tear or bandage a boo - boo .
She can rhapsodize for hours about a single leaf and philosophize convincingly about the pedagogical uses of papier - mache .
“ I teach because it ’s my calling , ” she says .
“ It ’s my life purpose . ”
Yet two years ago , after 38 years as an educator , she threw up her hands and retired .
( Her last job was at the Harrington School in Lexington . )
She could n’t stand the pressure .
Pressure ?
This is kindergarten , the happy land of building blocks and singalongs .
But increasingly in schools across Massachusetts and the United States , little children are being asked to perform academic tasks , including test taking , that early childhood researchers agree are developmentally inappropriate , even potentially damaging .
If children do n’t meet certain requirements , they are deemed “ not proficient . ”
Frequently , children are screened for “ kindergarten readiness ” even before school begins , and some are labeled inadequate before they walk through the door .
This is a troubling trend to an experienced educator like Gerzon , who knows how much a child can soak up in the right environment .
After years of study and practice , she ’ll tell you that 5 - year - olds do n’t learn by listening to a rote lesson , their bottoms on their chairs .
They learn through experience .
They learn through play .
Yet there is a growing disconnect between what the research says is best for children -- a classroom free of pressure -- and what ’s actually going on in schools .
Take the example of a girl who was barely 5 when she entered Gerzon ’s classroom .
She did n’t know her ABCs , but one day in class she made up a song and taught it to the other children .
But because of new requirements , “ I had to send a letter to her parents saying that [ she ] is not proficient , ” says Gerzon .
“ You tell me that [ she ] is not proficient in language skills ! ”
The Concord resident , who usually exudes a gentle presence , bristles .
“ It ’s destructive , even abusive .
That ’s a pretty strong word , but what do you call it when you take a group of children and you force them to do something that they are not developmentally ready to do ?
What do you call that ?
It ’s abusive . ”
Psychologist and early childhood expert David Elkind , author of The Hurried Child and The Power of Play , echoes Gerzon .
When children are required to do academics too early , he says , they get the message that they are failures .
“ We are sending too many children to school to learn that they are dumb , ” says Elkind , a professor emeritus at Tufts University .
“ They are not dumb .
They are just not there developmentally . ”

Sarkozy 's punishing diet and fitness regime blamed for collapse as he tries to keep up with Carla
As president , he has to keep up with international affairs , domestic politics and the economic crisis .
And then there 's Carla .
So perhaps it's no surprise that friends of Nicolas Sarkozy say the gruelling fitness regime he started soon after his wedding to model Carla Bruni was a disaster waiting to happen .
The 54 - year - old French president looked pale and a little shaken as he left the Val - de - Grace Military Hospital in Paris with his wife yesterday .
Checking out : Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni leaving hospital today
He had spent the night there having undergone a series of cardiovascular tests after falling ill while jogging .
Close friend and MP Patrick Balkany said : ' Recently the president has looked very honed .
He looks more like a Tour de France rider .
' The president is going to have to take more care , work a little less hard and eat a little bit more . '
Mr Sarkozy started dieting within a few days of his wedding to 41 - year - old Miss Bruni last year .
She introduced him to a fitness instructor who told him to lose 9lb and two trouser sizes -- a change which many would consider unhealthy for a man who stands a mere 5 ft5ins .
Out went Mr Sarkozy ’s chocolate and cheese snacks , and he has also tried to cut out puddings .
Going home :
The President waves as he gets into a car outside the hospital
The increasingly diminutive head of state staggered , appeared to faint , and then fell to the ground on Sunday while jogging in parkland surrounding the Palace of Versailles .
He may have pushed it too far in his bid to keep up with the glamorous Miss Bruni , 41 , according to allies .
Since marrying Miss Bruni last year following a whirlwind romance of just 80 days , Mr Sarkozy has been desperately trying to appear as youthful and trendy as the former supermodel - turned - pop star .
Rest : Officials say Mr Sarkozy will take some time out to relax
Yesterday as he left hospital Mr Sarkozy insisted : ' I feel fine . '
Miss Bruni , who was by his side throughout the scare , told medical staff : ' Thank you so much - you 've been wonderful ' .
An Elysee Palace spokesman confirmed ' intense physical exercise ' was to blame for his collapse and said tests had not revealed any underlying heart problems .
Meanwhile the President ’s increasingly frenetic workload has included accompanying Miss Bruni to the theatre and to concerts - events he seldom bothered with in the past .
Last weekend , he paid a lightning visit to New York to watch his wife perform at a charity gig celebrating Nelson Madela ’s 91st birthday .
Doctors at Val de Grace conducted neurological , blood and cardiological tests as well as an electroencephalogram which tests the electrical activity of the brain .
Close advisers visited the President while he was in the hospital to keep him up to date on state business and he was kept in overnight .
Strict regime : Mr Sarkozy and his wife out jogging together in New York
The Elysee Palace has played down the President ’s collapse , blaming it on a ‘ vasovagal episode ’ caused by the dilation of the body 's blood vessels in response to stimulus from the vagal nerve - something which often happens during exercise .
It is the second time during his presidency that Mr Sarkozy has been rushed to hospital .
On Oct 21 2007 - the day after his divorce from second wife Cecilia - doctors at treated him for a high fever and a throat abscess .
The president underwent surgery to remove infected material , was given antibiotics through a catheter , and then discharged .
Economics minister Christine Lagarde was replacing the President at a signing ceremony at the Elysee Palace today .
A planned visit to the Mont St Michel Abbey in Normandy tomorrow has also been cancelled as he rests up .
However , he hopes to chair the last cabinet meeting before the summer holidays on Wednesday .
Mr Sarkozy is due to leave for a long holiday on the Riviera during the French parliamentary summer break .
When he returns he is expected to cut down his exercise regime .
The “ Real Time ” host takes exception to American exceptionalism , the idea that Americans are unique and superior despite a penchant for poisoning , imprisoning and killing each other just to make a buck .
“ We do it all to each other — the killing and the keeping people sick and poor and in jail and destroying their habitat — because a generation ago Ronald Reagan and Gordon Gekko told us greed was good . ”
Real Time :
In order to harness Scotland ’s immense marine energy resources and achieve a renewable energy target of 50 % of electricity generated through renewable sources by 2020 , the country has put its money where its mouth is .
The Saltire Prize is a Â£ 10 million prize challenge for advances in wave and tidal energy in Scottish waters , and is expected to pave the way for the development of a commercially viable marine renewable energy sector in the country .
In order to qualify for the challenge , entries will need to produce a minimum electrical output of 100GWh over a continuous 2 year period , using only the power of the sea .
The best overall technology that is best commercially deployable ( after the consideration of environmental sustainability , cost , and safety ) will win the prize .
The Saltire Prize Grand Challenge will focus on the conversion of power from waves and tidal streams into electrical output from single or mixed arrays ( or individual units ) using tidal or wave technology .
Some forms of ocean - based energy systems are excluded from the competition , such as marine biomass , offshore wind , ocean thermal , osmotic power , and tidal barrage .
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_ybHulp2n8
“ Achievement of these targets will require the development of radical and innovative solutions .
No Member State can tackle today ’s energy and climate change targets on its own and the Saltire Prize is a global call to action .
This prize provides an important platform to seek out the important technological breakthroughs that can help unlock the enormous potential of marine renewable energy . ”
– Andris Piebalgs , EU Energy Commissioner
Estimates of potential wave energy for Scotland are 21.5 GW of commercial capacity , and the country has fully 25 % of Europe ’s offshore wind and tidal power potential .
In addition to the economic benefits from its clean energy possibilities , the Scottish government has a number of other reasons for putting forth the challenge and prize money :
To reduce the country ’s carbon emissions by 80 % by 2050
To inspire the innovation necessary to hit the country ’s target of 50 % of its electricity generated by renewables by 2020
To accelerate technological developments in the global marine renewable sector
To further promote science and technology in Scotland
To engage the Scottish public with science and engineering achievements
The government has incorporated some features into the challenge structure in order to create an optimum environment for reaching the goal , including simplicity of design , open competition ( entries from around the world ) , an easily communicated message , an impartial judging process , an improvement process for cost , reliability and sustainability , and an educational package .
The Saltire Prize challenge will run from the summer of 2009 until December 2014 , but if no entry achieves the minimum output set by guidelines , the challenge will be extended for another two years .

Separate brain regions firing in unison may be what keeps us focused on important things while we ignore distractions .
A deluge of visual information hits our eyes every second , yet we 're able to focus on the minuscule fraction that 's relevant to our goals .
When we try to find our way through an unfamiliar area of town , for example , we manage to ignore the foliage , litter and strolling pedestrians , and focus our attention on the street signs .
Now , researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have discovered that the brain 's control center syncs up to its visual center with high - frequency brain waves , directing attention to select features of the visual world .
" It 's been known that the prefrontal cortex plays an important role in focusing our attention , but the mystery was how , " said neuroscientist Robert Desimone , who led the study , published in * Science * Friday .
" Now we have some insight into how it has that focusing role — through this synchrony with our sensory systems . "
This novel understanding of attention may inform future studies on disorders like schizophrenia and ADHD , in which patients are easily distracted and the prefrontal cortex is thought to be impaired .
The region 's newly discovered role as a source of synchronized brain activity may be crucial to understanding these diseases .
Previous research showed that when something important ( such as a street sign ) catches our attention , the sign - processing neurons in the visual region begin to fire in unison .
The rest of the neurons in the region fire too , stimulated by other information that hits the eye , but they chatter out of sync with one another .
The synchronized firing of neurons carrying the important aspects of the visual field is thought to focus our attention to these features .
" If there 's a group of people that 's chanting in the middle of a large crowd having random conversations , the chanters stand out , " Desimone said .
What was n't known is what gets the chanters going in the first place .
Neuroscientists knew the control center , known as the prefrontal cortex , was involved , but it is on the opposite side of the brain from the visual center , so it was unclear how such long - range interactions might actually operate .
First , Desimone 's team recorded the activity of neurons in two monkeys while the animals focused on images on a computer screen .
They found that , as expected , neurons in the visual area began firing together when the monkeys looked at the images .
But they discovered that neurons in a region of the prefrontal cortex were also firing in unison , and at the same frequency as those in the visual area .
When they took a closer look at their data , they found that the prefrontal region started firing 80 milliseconds after the monkeys were cued to focus on the image , while the visual cortex started firing after 130 milliseconds .
The two regions , on opposite sides of the brain , then fired at a high frequency in synchrony with one another .
The waves were offset by 8 to 13 milliseconds , which the authors believe may be the time it takes for a signal to travel between the two regions .
" Imagine a spring between your two hands , and you 're vibrating your hands back and forth , " said Desimone .
" If you time it just right , your hands are going to have a spring bouncing back and forth at a certain resonance .
The neural equivalent of that is a very strong signal in the brain . "
Neurons in the prefrontal cortex were essentially directing the neurons in the visual cortex to pay attention by firing with them , Desimone said .
He believes this type of synchronization may be a mechanism for communication between separate brain regions .
" [ The results ] provide a possible explanation for how attention - dependent synchrony might be brought about by the [ prefrontal cortex ] , and how the communication between distant neurons might be facilitated by attention , " said Tirin Moore , a neurobiologist at Stanford University who was not involved with the study .
" This is an important step indeed . "

In comparison to classical physics , quantum physics predicts that the properties of a quantum mechanical system depend on the measurement context , i.e. whether or not other system measurements are carried out .
A team of physicists from Innsbruck , Austria , led by Christian Roos and Rainer Blatt , have for the first time proven in a comprehensive experiment that it is not possible to explain quantum phenomena in non-contextual terms .
The scientists report on their findings in the current issue of Nature .
Quantum mechanics describes the physical state of light and matter and formulates concepts that totally contradict the classical conception we have of nature .
Thus , physicists have tried to explain non-causal phenomena in quantum mechanics by classical models of hidden variables , thereby excluding randomness , which is omnipresent in quantum theory .
In 1967 , however , the physicists Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker proved that measurements have to be contextual when explaining quantum phenomena by hidden variables .
This means that the result of one measurement depends on which other measurements are performed simultaneously .
Interestingly , the simultaneous measurements here are compatible and do not disturb each other .
The physicists led by Christian Roos and Rainer Blatt from the Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information ( IQOQI ) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the University of Innsbruck have now been able to prove this proposition and rule out non-contextual explanations of quantum theory experimentally .
In a series of measurements on a quantum system consisting of two ions they have shown that the measurement of a certain property is dependent on other measurements of the system .
Technological headstart
The experiment was carried out by the PhD students Gerhard Kirchmair and Florian Zähringer as well as Rene Gerritsma , a Dutch postdoc at the IQOQI .
The scientists trapped a pair of laser - cooled calcium ions in an electromagnetic trap and carried out a series of measurements .
„ For this experiment we used techniques we had previously designed for building a quantum computer .
We had to concatenate up to six quantum gates for this experiment " , explains Christian Roos .
„ We were able to do this because , it is only recently that we can perform a quantum gate with high fidelity . "
Only last year , a team of scientists led by Rainer Blatt realized an almost error - free quantum gate with a fidelity of 99 % .
With this technological headstart , the scientists have now proven comprehensively in an experiment for the first time that the experimentally observed phenomena cannot be described by non-contextual models with hidden variables .
The result is independent of the quantum state – it was tested in ten different states .
Possible measurement disturbances could be ruled out by the experimental physicists with the help of theoreticians Otfried Gühne and Matthias Kleinmann from the group led by Prof .
Hans Briegel at the IQOQI in Innsbruck .
Randomness cannot be excluded
In 1935 already , Albert Einstein , Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen questioned whether quantum mechanics theory is complete in the sense of a realistic physical theory – a criticism that is now well know in the scientific world as the EPR paradox .
In the mid 1960s , John Bell showed that quantum theory cannot be a real and at the same time local theory , which , in the meantime , has also been proven experimentally .
Kochen and Specker 's results exclude other theoretical models but until now it was difficult to provide a convincing experimental proof .
Following a proposition by the Spaniard Adán Cabello , the Innsbruck scientists have now successfully proven this point and produced unambiguous results experimentally .
The physicists are supported by the Austrian Science Funds ( FWF ) , the European Union , the Federation of Austrian Industry Tyrol , and Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity ( IARPA ) .
Andrew Binstock interviews Alexander Stepanov and Paul McJones , the authors of The Elements of Programming , on their new book , decomposing software , why C++ was their choice for the book , and their perspectives on OO and generic programming .

Andrew Binstock : Alex , people know you for your work on the Standard Template Library ( STL ) in C ++.
I suspect most readers have not heard much about your subsequent work .
Could you update us on what you ’ve been doing ?
Alexander Stepanov : I have been searching for principles to decompose software into components since the late 1970s .
STL was an example of that .
While intended to be a useful library , it was also intended as a model for others to build such components .
After the STL became successful , I realized that people were using it without attempting to design their own software using the same principles .
Fortunately I was given the opportunity at SGI to spend several years teaching very experienced compiler engineers these techniques .
When I came to Adobe I was again asked to focus on teaching engineers ( specifically Photoshop and the advanced graphics development team ) these programming techniques .
While not everyone liked the approach , many — I would even say the majority of engineers — told me that it changed their view of programming .
It was rewarding for me that programmers with advanced degrees and years of experience were willing to attend the lectures and do challenging homework for a year or even more in addition to their busy product development schedule .
Therefore when Adobe management suggested I write a book , it seemed a worthwhile undertaking .
Andrew :
What are you currently working on at Adobe ?
Alex : I ’ve been teaching advanced programming classes and developing an overall curriculum for Adobe engineers .
Now I ’m in transition to a new role .
Andrew : Paul , I suspect you ’ll be less familiar to readers than Alex .
Your site , mcjones.org / paul , presents your long history of working with operating systems and language tools , especially Modula 2 and Modula 3 .
Can you fill that in a little and tell us how you came to be Alex ’s co-author ?
Paul McJones : After attending Alex ’s course at Adobe for a few months , I realized that he was developing rigorous answers to questions about how to decompose software that had concerned me since I worked with John Backus in the mid 1970s on functional programming .
It turns out that John ’s work on FP was one of the major inspirations for Alex in the late 1970s .
Alex ’s original intuition was to associate specific functional forms ( for example , reduction ) with algebraic properties of specific functions ( such as associativity ) .
In retrospect , there are interesting parallels on the one hand between my conversations with John , and my earlier attempts to extend APL operators while working on an APL virtual machine at U.C. Berkeley , and on the other hand between Alex ’s insights about John ’s work , and with Alex ’s discussion with Iverson about defining new operators .
Thus it was an honor when Alex invited me to coauthor the book with him in early 2007 .
While I had no STL and little C++ experience before taking his course , my work specifying Modula - 3 library interfaces gave me some confidence that I could contribute to the effort .
While Alex makes effective use of stories in his lectures , I was uncomfortable with the somewhat self - indulgent , conversational style in Alex ’s written lecture notes .
I advocated the impersonal style used in the mathematics and computer science books from my college courses in the 1960s .
Alex quickly agreed , and we evolved a style that we both find appropriate .
Andrew : I see that in addition to being a co-author , you manage the collection of Alex ’s papers .
Is there a Boswellian element to your work with him ?
Do you work together on a regular basis at Adobe ?
If so , what do you work on together ?
Paul : I have been interested in the history of software for some years .
( See for example my collection of the original IBM 704 Fortran compiler at the Computer History Museum . )
When I began attending the course Alex was teaching at Adobe , I became interested in how his work had evolved since the late 1970s , leading me to organize the Collected Papers web site .
I learned from Alex ’s lectures how his study of the history of mathematics , extending back to the Greeks and before , is integral to his view of mathematics and programming .
So both of us could be called historically informed computer scientists .
While we removed all the historical anecdotes that appear in Alex ’s lectures , we still feel the book is grounded in thousands of years of mathematics and some 60 years of computer science history .
Andrew :
What are you currently working on at Adobe ?
Paul : Before Elements of Programming , I was one of the designers and implementers of Adobe ’s Pixel Bender language .
Now I too am in transition to a new role .
Andrew :
Your new book , Elements of Programming , appears to be an attempt to map programming logic to principles of mathematics and formal logic and thereby establish the correctness of various code elements .
Why did you write this book and what need does it fill ?
Alex :
We do not need to map programming to mathematics .
Programming by its nature is a mathematical discipline , since programs manipulate abstract mathematical objects such as integers , shapes , sequences , etc .
Paul :
We take well - known programs such as min and max , greatest common divisor , and binary search , and show their true mathematical settings .
As mathematics helps mechanical engineers build bridges that do not collapse , mathematics helps programmers build dependable software .
Andrew :
The book , while short , is a very difficult read and requires considerable a priori schooling in formal logic and abstract algebra .
What benefit does a practitioner derive from working through it ?
How would a working programmer ’s way of thinking change as a result of reading the book ?
Alex :
The book is difficult ; there is no easy road to programming .
Everything that goes beyond high school mathematics ( elementary geometry and algebra ) is defined in the book .
Paul : Working through the book teaches how to reason about code , how to find sets of useful interfaces , and how to design powerful and efficient components that can work together .
Andrew :
Were you concerned that developers , even those with extensive computer science backgrounds , might be flummoxed by sentences such as “ A discrete Archimedean semiring lacks additive inverses ... ” ( p. 86 ) .
This quotation and others suggest that the real audience for this book is mathematicians rather than computer scientists .
Whom do you have in mind as the intended reader ?
Alex :
As we say in the preface , the book must be read sequentially .
Taken out of context that sentence might scare someone , but a reader will have previously learned that a semiring is a type combining addition and multiplication and that the Axiom of Archimedes allows division with remainder .
While some mathematicians might benefit from the book as a way to learn about programming , the book is primarily targeted at programmers .
Paul :
The evidence from the courses at SGI and Adobe is that determined programmers with computer science degrees can work through this material .
But , yes , it does require an effort .
On a personal note , I forgot the little abstract algebra I learned in college , but had no difficulty relearning the material .
Andrew : I am surprised that you did not include a glossary for these definitions .
Do you not view this as a book that might be used for subsequent reference ?
Or should we infer from this aspect and from the exercises that you intended this to be primarily or exclusively used as a textbook ?
Paul : Mathematicians have created a large taxonomy of concepts .
The purpose of this book is to demonstrate how to adapt part of the taxonomy to organize software components .
The book is not intended to be a reference book ; for example , it does not define fields ( such as reals ) , multidimensional structures , and stops just a bit short of defining Quicksort .
Alex :
It is , as it were , a prolegomena to any future reference on software components .
Paul :
And rather than a glossary , we have a detailed index .
Andrew :
You say , “ The purpose of this book is to demonstrate how to adapt part of the [ mathematician ’s ] taxonomy to organize software components . ”
Of the many things one hears developers needing , organizing software components is not often listed .
How is this need apparent ?
And how does this book answer that need ?
Alex :
A colleague of ours at a prominent software company recently reviewed a complex piece of code .
He observed that it was equivalent to a call of find_if followed by a call of rotate ; it took him a week to convince the other programmers of this equivalence .
If those programmers had read our book they would recognize this fact .
Paul :
In general , programmers should avoid inventing components or taxonomies , for that matter , but should recognize the well - known ones , just as mathematicians have been building on their predecessors ’ work for centuries .
Andrew :
Are the answers to the exercises available on - line ?
If so , where ?
Alex :
It might be valuable to have an edition containing proofs of all the lemmas and answers to all the exercises , but we do not have immediate plans to work on it .
Paul :
Note that eop.h on the website has many additional algorithms mentioned in the text or assigned as exercises .
Andrew :
In working on the code for the book , how did you test it ?
Paul : First , we used “ pair programming ” ; both of us read and reread every line of every program many times .
Second , we wrote unit tests , which are available along with the code from the book on http://www.elementsofprogramming.com.
We used gcov to check the coverage of our unit tests .
Alex : Sadly , we are sure there are still some undiscovered bugs .
We keep the errata up - to - date on the web site .
AB : Paul , you ’ve implemented several languages on several platforms .
In this book , you and Alex chose C++ as it had the capabilities needed to demonstrate the techniques you were illustrating .
What aspects of C++ made it your choice for this book ?
Paul :
The ability to overload functions and operator symbols allows us , when defining a particular concept , to specify the signatures of the operators and functions that must exist for any type modeling the concept .
The ability to define new types with copy constructor , assignment , and equality modeling the regular concept means types defined by the programmer behave the same way as built - in types like int .
The ability to pass arguments by reference means that we can work with regular types efficiently .
Alex : I ’d like to remind you that C++ is not an object - oriented language , but a multi- paradigm language with features that supports object - oriented style of programming : inheritance and virtual functions .
We do n’t use these features .
To summarize , we know how to say what we want in C++ but do not know how to say it in other languages .
It helps that C++ is a language familiar to programmers at Adobe , where most products are implemented in it .
Note , however , that the fundamental concepts we define come from mathematics , not from C++ or any other programming language .
Andrew :
Alex , you ’re known in part for your strong negative opinions about OO “ I find OO technically unsound , methodologically wrong , etc . ”
Yet you still chose a subset of C++ for the code .
Does this choice reflect any change in your feelings about OO ?
Alex :
The book is about programming as algorithms and data structures viewed as a mathematical activity , not about language techniques .
A small subset of C++ that does not include any object - oriented features allowed us to say what we wanted .
There are cases where object - oriented features are useful , but they are often oversold .
Paul : I should add I entered the project without extensive C++ experience , and found our subset to be natural and powerful .
Andrew :
In the book , preconditions are integrated into many of the code snippets .
The explicit use of preconditions is reminiscent of design by contract ( DBC ) .
Were you tempted at all to use a language such as Eiffel in which you could have stated pre- and post - conditions , as well as the “ contract terms ” or a Knuth - like solution of inventing your own language for purpose of illustrating code ?
Paul :
We spent a lot of effort on everything from selecting a small set of control statements , expressing pre- and post - conditions , and specifying the requirements ( concepts ) on the types used by an algorithm .
We are happy with the result : a small subset of C++ extended with informal but consistent conventions for defining concepts and using them to specify type requirements .
The code all compiles and runs ; we find it quite readable .
Alex :
While it is possible that in the future there will be a language that could better support this style of programming , we think that language design should follow , rather than precede , learning this style and applying it to components and programs .
An appropriate programming language needs to be distilled from a large body of programs .
But we do not need to wait for the creation of such a language .
Scientists and engineers have been able to apply mathematics to physics , chemistry , civil engineering , and so on without creating a formal language .
Instead , the informal but rigorous approach to definitions , theorems , and proofs used by mathematicians since Euclid provided a very solid foundation for many areas of science and engineering .
Andrew : Alex , the book , it seems , extends your work with generic programming using as illustration small , discrete algorithms .
How would a developer use these techniques for attacking more - complex tasks ?
Alex : First I need to clarify the term “ generic programming . ”
Dave Musser and I introduced it in the late 1980s to mean a style of programming based on decomposing software into highly reusable and efficient components .
Now , the term often signifies a set of techniques that are neither highly reusable nor efficient .
Therefore , Paul and I decided not to use the term in the book .
Moreover , both of us believe this is not just a style of programming , but programming as it must be : always trying to get to the essence of every algorithm .
A reader of the book will learn that even a task as simple as defining min and max is difficult — I got it wrong in STL , and nobody noticed !
There are more difficult tasks than min and max , but the same reasoning applies to them .
The book also demonstrates how to decompose complicated algorithms into simple steps .
Paul : Consider , for example , writing the two - line sort_n at the end of chapter 11 without any of the algorithms developed before that point .
Andrew :
Is there a design - level equivalent to generic programming ?
That is , at the level of designing modules and their interaction ?
Paul :
We follow Wirth in believing that algorithms and data structures constitute the essence of programming .
I have n’t seen any barriers to this approach .

Plus I ’m sure there are some inevitable syntax niceties ( choosing when to display in GADT syntax for example ) , but using this approach , they ca n’t be perfect , only pretty - good .
( The approach is similar to going through Template Haskell except we found out that TH / Convert had some problems , such as producing RdrNames rather than Names , so I wrote the equivalent function to go directly from TyThing to HsDecl Name ) .
So:(tyThingToHsSyn :: TyThing -> LHsDecl Name ) is done ( except probably for a few corner cases ) — it compiles and works !
( under 6.11.something and 6.10.3 ; I just failed to install ghc - paths for 6.8.2 [*] )
Paste of my working module here :
[ *] cabal install –with-compiler=ghc - 6.8.2 ghc- paths
/tmp/ghc-paths-0.1.0.522545/ghc-paths-0.1.0.5/Setup.hs:7:7 :
Could not find module ` Distribution .
Simple.PackageIndex ’:
Important remaining corner cases include :
– It seems that TyCon needs to export a new function ( tyConParent :: TyCon -> TyConParent ) , because there ’s no way to get that info presently !
– ( isFunTyCon tc || is PrimTyCon tc ) : how the heck am I supposed to represent these in a TyClDecl ? 🙂
– When the HsDecls tree contains something of type HsDoc , do I just leave it empty ?
Will Haddock - code need to / already does fill that in ?
I guess I ’ll find that out once I test my code on more things …?
or what ?
– it looks like I neglected to implement class ATs yet .
Also , ( parseName “ Prelude . -> ” ) crashed GHC with “ isDataOcc : check me -> ” , so I was n’t able to test it yet 🙂 … or is it one of those syntaxes that ’s so fixed that you ’re not even allowed to export or import it , perhaps ?
***
Also I succeeded at integrating it into Haddock .
Well , almost .
For module List , I have the English documentation being displayed where it should be , and I have the signature displayed : all the signatures are “ ( ) -> ( ) ” , 😛 .
I still need to finish threading the Ghc monad through Haddock .
Interface .
Create so that I can call lookupName at the right times .
– foible : I needed to convert Installed Interface ’s ( HsDoc DocName ) to ExportDecl ’s ( HsDoc Name ) , so I had to essentially write fmap for HsDoc , because it ’s lamely not an instance of class Functor .
Where should that fmap - code be put ?
( can it be derived yet ? )
– In Haddock .
Interface .
Create :
-* Under what circumstances is ( Map.lookup ( nameModule t) instIfaceMap ) == Nothing ?
Is it if we haddock a package for which its dependencies are compiled , but not , themselves , haddocked ?
-* I did n’t figure out where to get ExportDecl ’s expItemInstances from ( but I did n’t really look around for it yet )
okay that ’s enough for the day !
I need some sleep !
And some feedback would be good .
Besides that , I do have a plan : Integrate the two pieces I just did ;
Test on lots more examples than just haskell98 - List ; fix the things that I obviously neglected ;
Make the code a bit more presentable .
Any big pieces I ’m leaving out that we have to do before starting to integrate my code ?
( well , hoping that there are n’t any more big unexpected things that break along the way , anyway )

Denis MacShane attacks the British left for defending Hugo Chávez , the Venezuelan president , against an onslaught from the media , " new cold warriors " , and rightwing demagogues throughout the world .
His rhetorical trick is to tar the left with a new media law currently being debated in the Venezuelan congress , which he says " would impose prison sentences of up to four years for journalists whose writings might divulge information against ' the stability of the institutions of the state ' . "
Of course this is a bad law .
There are a number of bad laws on the books in Venezuela , and in fact numerous countries in the region have desacato ( pdf ) laws that make it a crime to insult the president .
Do MacShane 's targets – he mentions Ken Livingstone and Richard Gott – support such laws ?
I would bet serious money that they do not .
So his main line of attack is misleading if not downright dishonest .
MacShane also misrepresents the reality of press freedom in Venezuela .
In fact , there is a much more oppositional media in Venezuela than in the US , and a much greater range of debate in the major media .
This can be seen simply by looking at the most important media in both countries .
In the US , for example , not even the most aggressive rightwing commentators such as Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity would present the idea that the president should be lynched .
But Globovision , one of the largest - audience TV networks , had a show where a guest did just that .
This is not an isolated example in Venezuela .
Its media routinely broadcasts reporting and commentary that would not be allowed under FCC rules in the US .
And the vast majority of the media in Venezuela is still controlled by the rightwing opposition .
This fact was buried in a footnote in a highly prejudiced and misleading 230 - page report by Human Rights Watch .
The footnote acknowledged that RCTV , which lost its broadcast licence for a long list of offences that would have landed its owners in jail in the US , still has a cable audience that is bigger than all the Venezuelan state television combined .
If the US had a media like Venezuela's , Barack Obama could never have been elected president .
That 's because the majority of Americans would have believed , as those beholden to some rightwing sources do , that he is a Muslim who was not born in the US .
Think of Fox News and the Washington Times as the vast majority of the US media – that is the reality in Venezuela , only the media is more political and less accurate than America 's biggest rightwing outlets .
What happens when our major media threaten to step over the line and become political actors ?
They almost never do it , but in 2004 , two weeks before the 2004 US election , the Sinclair Broadcast Group of Maryland , which owns the largest chain of TV stations in the US , decided to broadcast a film that accused candidate John Kerry of betraying US prisoners in Vietnam .
Nineteen Democratic senators sent a letter to the FCC calling for an investigation , and some made public statements that Sinclair 's broadcast licence could be in jeopardy if it carried its plans through .
Sinclair backed down and did not broadcast the film .
The Venezuelan media is not so restricted .
Of course that does not justify this new proposed law , which is terrible .
But neither does it justify the widespread misrepresentation of the reality of press freedom in Venezuela .
( Even if this new law were to pass , it would have little or no effect , since it would not be enforced and would probably be ruled unconstitutional by the country 's supreme court . )
Venezuela is not Colombia , where journalists have to flee the country in fear of their lives when the president denounces them .
MacShane is taking advantage of the fact that after 10 years of media misrepresentation with no significant countervailing force , anyone can say anything about Venezuela and Chávez and it will not be challenged .
A group of Latin America scholars recently bought a full - page ad in the Columbia Journalism Review to call attention to outright fabrications by the Associated Press .
My congratulations to the British left for not caving in to this crude McCarthyism .
We need more courage like that in the world .
Purple People Vote Iran Focus
As the main stream media 's focus drifts away from Iran , the internet has become the predominant source for news out of Iran .
As this is still an active news story , PurplePeopleVote.com will be focusing on events and news stories coming out of Iran .
This is a major news story , as well as historic event .
We hope that individuals will press media outlets to cover these events , and not let the stories of those who are peacefully fighting for their freedom be forgotten just because information is becoming more difficult to gather .
Purple People are those of us who are neither Republican Red nor Democrat Blue ; we find ourselves in between .
The internet often represents those on the far left or the far right ; this site is for those of us in the middle , or looking for a centrist 's perspective .
Since there are a variety of non-conformists that consider themselves Independents , here 's a clarification .
The point of view of this blog is basically Realist / Libertarian light ...
- Pro Small Government , bureaucracies tend to be wasteful and inefficient .
- Government should not be the morality police .
- Less waste , lower taxes .
Taxes are okay if spent wisely .
Roads and schools need funding .
Be smart with my money and I wo n't complain .
- Government should n't babysit adults .
Help kids and assist people who have serious problems , but stop trying to protect everyone from themselves .
- Foreign policy should be conducted by people with brains and experience .
Think , do n't be reckless and do n't be politically motivated .
Remember that the U.S. is not the only country in the world .
- Tone down the rhetoric and remember your manners .
Play nicely and do n't belittle people who disagree with you .

Thunder 's practice facility will be THE place for players
A year from now , Oklahoma City ’s NBA team will feature what team chairman Clay Bennett has promised — a training facility that will rival any in the league .
The Thunder will break ground on a new practice facility Thursday morning .
When fans hear terms such as " finest facilities , ” some probably envision Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban providing his players with personal laptops , flat screen TVs and a plush locker room .
The Thunder ’s new facility will provide perks for players , but a training facility ’s primary role is to provide practice courts and weight training equipment to assist players during a grueling 82 - game season .
" I 'm afraid ... that ... simply will not do . "
There are just so many factors to consider .
And so many of them can be deal - breakers .
If you care enough .
A public or shared restroom will optimally be large , clean , cool , free of odors and insect life , and unoccupied .
Extra points for soothing music and / or waterfalls .
When Greg Hare looked into putting solar panels on his ranch - style home in Magnolia , Tex. , last year , he decided he could not afford it .
“ I had no idea solar was so expensive , ” he recalled .
But the cost of solar panels has plunged lately , changing the economics for many homeowners .
Mr. Hare ended up paying $ 77,000 for a large solar setup that he figures might have cost him $ 100,000 a year ago .
“ I just thought , ‘ Wow , this is an opportunity to do the most for the least , ’ ” Mr. Hare said .
For solar shoppers these days , the price is right .
Panel prices have fallen about 40 percent since the middle of last year , driven down partly by an increase in the supply of a crucial ingredient for panels , according to analysts at the investment bank Piper Jaffray .

Hare recently installed solar panels on his home that he hopes will cover between 50 and 80 percent of his electrical bills in Magnolia , Texas .

The price drops  coupled with recently expanded federal incentives  could shrink the time it takes solar panels to pay for themselves to 16 years , from 22 years , in places with high electricity costs , according to Glenn Harris , chief executive of SunCentric , a solar consulting group .
That calculation does not include state rebates , which can sometimes improve the economics considerably .

Nowadays Common Lisp is rather a niche language , so there is small interest in best practices .
This is a shame because the language standard was quite carefully thought out in many areas .
However , in the late eighties and early nineties lisp was widely adopted among AI researchers and there was more interest in its intricacies .
I repeatedly came across a set of papers from this time by Richard C. Waters , including Macroexpand - All : An Example of a Simple Lisp Code Walker ( 1993 ) .
As far as I know all existing portable code walkers for Common Lisp are similar to this one and have a small non-portable kernel called augment - environment , or something like that , which actually does the hard work of deciding whether or not a new lexical definition shadows another one .
This means that the code walker described by Waters cannot operate on modern Lisp environments ( unless this small kernel is adapted to call into the host Lisp 's environment augmenter ) .
The requirement for porting is obviously rather undesirable .
Why should it be so hard to write a code walker that is portable across standard - conformant Common Lisp implementations ?
I guess Waters was writing at a time when full ANSI compliance was still a little sketchy .
Maybe I was suffering a little from Scheme envy , but I became curious about the challenge .
Now my first idea was to create a structure describing the lexical environment as witnessed by the code walker , which would only fall back to the host 's treatment of a binding if the binding was unknown to the walker .
This would work for most simple code .
However , macros themselves can control the order of macroexpansion by explicitly calling macroexpand or macroexpand - 1 .
They would do so without knowledge of the walker 's portable environment and therefore get incorrect results .
To solve this , one might think that it would suffice to override the * macroexpand - hook * .
That , however , opens up a new subtlety , as the hook would have to deal with the fact that a macro might explicitly macroexpand a form that itself explicitly macroexpanded another form in a new augmented environment .
It should be possible , but would be a little fiddly .
Then it occurred to me that , by analogy with the trick of implementing the functionality of compiler - let with macrolet , it should be possible to get the host environment to do all the expansion by itself , without meddling with the * macroexpand - hook * .
In essence , the code would be transformed to return a quoted , macroexpanded version of itself .
The work is much simpler than building up a portable representation of the lexical environment , and the result is equally ( or even more ) powerful .
I also wanted to strip out all the irritating macrolets that tend to clutter up the output of most non-portable macroexpands and to do compiler - macroexpansion .
Thus macroexpand - dammit was born — the first really portable macroexpand - all for Common Lisp ?
I 'd be very interested to hear about others .
For example ,
( macroexpand - dammit:macroexpand - dammit '( symbol - macrolet ( ( m ( random ) ) ) ( macrolet ( ( m ( m &optional ( b m ) ) `(+ , b , m ) ) ) ( defun m ( n ) ( m m n ) ) ) ) ) =>
( DEFUN M ( N ) (+ N ( RANDOM ) ) )
UPDATE 20090809 — fixed a few annoying compiler warnings by eliding more details of the flets and labels emitted in the expansion that generates the quoted result .
UPDATE 20100301 — fixed the utterly broken macrolets as reported by mathrick , and added ccl : compiler - let for Clozure CL .
Do n't be fooled into thinking that H1N1 swine flu has disappeared completely , even if it is attracting less media interest .
The virus is still at large in the UK .
On the morning of 19 August , there were 263 people in hospital in England with the virus , 30 of them in intensive care .
That is exceptional for the time of year .
Having said that , there is much less swine flu about .
Sir Liam Donaldson 's weekly briefing to journalists is extremely helpful and has allowed us to track the progress of the virus in England and Wales .
Here are a few of the main points :
• estimated number of cases of swine flu in England in the past week : 11,000 ( possible range : 6,000 - 25,000 )
• weekly GP consultation rate for influenza - like illness in England and Wales in the week ending 16 August : 21.1 per 100,000 people
• weekly consultation rate has fallen by 37 % from last week to this week
• deaths related to swine flu in England now 54 with five in Scotland , giving a UK total of 59
Now for some graphs .
Above you can see the weekly consultation rate for influenza - type illness .
The red line ( the current rate ) continues to show a sharp decline .
The other lines show activity from flu in previous years .
The pie chart above needs careful reading .
For the small number of people who have died , it shows what their health had previously been .
As you can see , 52 % had severe underlying medical conditions , and 21 % had been previously healthy .
The rest had some kind of health problem , mild or moderate .
Remember , though , that the percentages are based on very small numbers .
The 21 % figure suggests that , so far , 11 entirely - healthy people have died in England after contracting swine flu .
What everyone wants to know is when the next peak will come .
Two graphs presented by Sir Liam illustrate how difficult this is to predict :
This shows the path of the 1957 - 58 pandemic in the UK .
You can see that the peak happened in the first autumn , just after pupils had returned to school .
That could be what happens next month .
This shows the 1968 - 70 pandemic .
By contrast , there was a small peak at the end of the first winter , but a far larger peak in the following flu season , a full 18 months after the first case in the UK .
So perhaps that could happen this time as well .
Clearly , it would be better if the second scenario happened this time , as it will enable immunisation of at - risk groups to be completed .
Update 1534 : Finally , some interesting guidance from the World Health Organization on antiviral use .
It says that otherwise - healthy people who get infected and have uncomplicated illness do not need oseltamivir ( often sold as Tamiflu ) and zanamivir ( Relenza ) .
The difficulty , of course , is that in order to be effective , antivirals need to be taken soon after the onset of symptoms - usually well before people know whether they have are going to get complications .
The UK government 's policy is to make antivirals available to anyone who is suspected of having H1N1 swine flu .
The WHO guidance will add to the debate about whether antivirals should be so freely available .
A Department of Health spokesman has said :
" We believe a safety - first approach of offering antivirals , when required , to everyone remains a sensible and responsible way forward .
However , we will keep this policy under review as we learn more about the virus and its effects . "
Conspiracy fever :
As rumours swell that the government staged 7/7 , victims ' relatives call for a proper inquiry
Today almost four years on , the images of that dreadful morning are etched into our minds : the woman in the haunting white burns mask being helped to safety ; the shell - shocked businessman in a suit with his hair and shirt matted with blood ; the crippled No 30 bus with its roof blown off ; the mangled wreckage of smouldering Tube trains .
The country 's worst - ever terrorist atrocity during London 's morning rush hour on July 7 , 2005 , shattered for ever the heady euphoria in which the capital was basking the morning after winning the bid for the 2012 Olympics .
That afternoon , Tony Blair - who was hosting the G8 summit on global poverty in Gleneagles , Scotland - returned to Downing Street to pronounce that the attack was an act in the ' name of Islam ' .
Fateful day :
The iconic image of a 7/7
Tube victim wearing a burns mask
Later , at a meeting of the Government 's national emergency committee COBRA , London 's anti-terror police chief Andy Hayman told senior ministers that he suspected suicide bombers .
And so the story of 7/7 that we have come to accept was pieced together : four British Muslims - Mohammad Sidique Khan , 30 , Shehzad Tanweer , 22 , Jermaine Lindsay , 19 , and Hasib Hussain , 18 - blew themselves up using home - made explosives , killing 56 and injuring 700 on three Tube trains and a double - decker bus .
They had travelled on a mainline train from Luton into King 's Cross Thameslink Station in London , each carrying a heavy rucksack of explosives .
It is a version of events that has been endorsed by a high - level Parliamentary inquiry and a government report , both published in May 2006 ten months after the event , based on 12,500 statements , a police examination of 142 computers and 6,000 hours of CCTV footage .
The report insisted that the bombers acted on their own , constructing explosives from chapatti flour and hair bleach mixed in the bath at a flat in Leeds , Yorkshire , where all four had family and friends .
It concluded that the Muslim bombers were not controlled by a terrorist mastermind , but inspired by Al Qaeda ideology picked up on extremist websites .
But families of the dead victims and an increasing number of 7/7 survivors claim there are inconsistencies and basic mistakes in the official accounts that need explanation .
And they are demanding a full public inquiry to answer key questions about what the Intelligence Services and the police did and did not know before the bombings .
Meanwhile , the Government 's determined refusal to meet their demands is having a very dangerous side - effect - fuelling myriad conspiracy theories about 7/7 .
Books , blogs and several video documentaries point to oddities in the official accounts .
Messages left for the victims of the London bombings at the site of the bus explosion in Tavistock Square
Alarmingly , some of the conspiracy videos are being hawked around mosques throughout the country to whip up anti-British sentiment .
For the most outlandish and offensive of them suggest that the attacks were not the work of Muslim terrorists at all , but were carried out by the Government to boost support for the Iraq war .
The survivors are so intent on an independent inquiry that they are now taking legal action in the High Court to try to force the Home Secretary Alan Johnson to authorise it .
Campaigner Diana Gorodi , whose sister Michelle Otto , 46 , was one of those killed , explains : ' It 's just very hard for us to believe four people got up in the morning , put bombs together on the basis of information from the internet and managed to throw London into chaos and to create a tragedy .
It 's impossible for me to believe those four individuals acted on their own . '
Rachel North , a 39 - year - old strategy director who survived the King 's Cross Tube bombing , adds : ' We need a public inquiry .
It was the public , after all , not the politicians , who were attacked .
Let the public know what risks they run and tell them why there are those living among them who seek to kill for an ideal . '
Central to the puzzle is which train the four Muslims caught from Luton to London on the morning of the bomb blasts - bearing in mind that the three separate Tube explosions at Edgware Road , Aldgate and King 's Cross occurred together at exactly 8.50 am , followed by the red bus an hour later near Tavistock Square .
Tavistock bombing :
The remains of the bus after the terrorist attack
The official reports said the bombers got on the 7.40 am train from Luton which would have arrived at King 's Cross in good time for them to board the Tube trains .
However , the 7.40 am train never ran that morning .
It was cancelled .
The Government has since corrected this information - but only after the error was raised by survivors - saying the bombers actually caught an earlier train , the 7.25 am from Luton , for the 35 - minute journey to King 's Cross .
It was due to arrive in the capital at 8 am .
Yet this throws up more questions than it answers .
For this train ran 23 minutes late because of problems with the overhead line which disrupted most of the service between Luton to King 's Cross that morning .
It arrived in London at 8.23 am , say station officials .
According to the July Seventh Truth Campaign - another group calling for a public inquiry - this again places the official version of the bombers ' travelling times in doubt .
A still CCTV photo of the four bombers arriving at the station in Luton is the only one of the four men together on July 7 .
Controversially , no CCTV images , either still or moving , of them in London have ever been released .
The Luton image is also contentious : the quality is poor and the faces of three of the bombers are unidentifiable .
The conspiracy theorists say it could be a fake .
This photo is timed at four seconds before 7.22 am .
But if this were the case , the men would have had just three minutes to walk up the stairs at Luton , buy their £ 22 day return tickets and get to the platform , which was packed with commuters because of the earlier travel disruptions .
Blown up : A Circle Line train between Liverpool Street and Aldgate stations
The Truth Campaign group is equally sceptical about the bombers ' supposed arrival time at King 's Cross .
They say it takes seven minutes to walk from the Thameslink line station to the main King 's Cross station , where there is an entrance to the Tube network .
Police say the four men were seen on the main King 's Cross concourse at 8.26 am , although no CCTV footage has ever been made public .
But is this possible ?
How had the men got there in three short minutes after getting off the Luton train at 8.23 am ?
And it is such inconsistencies that are fuelling the deepening concerns .
This week , a television documentary on BBC2 called Conspiracy Files 7/7 revealed the existence of a conspiracy theorist 's 56 - minute video called Ripple Effect .
It accuses Tony Blair , the Government , the police , and the British and Israeli Secret Services of murdering the innocent people who died that day to stir up anti-Islamic fervour and create public support for the ' war on terror ' .
Fact or fiction ?
Some theories suggest Mohammad Sidique Khan 's video was a forgery
It alleges that the four British Muslims were tricked by the authorities into taking part in what they were told would be a mock anti-terror training exercise .
What they were n't told , the video alleges , was that the Government was going to blow them up , along with other passengers , then pretend the four were suicide bombers .
Without any evidence , the Ripple Effect video accuses government agents of setting off pre-planted explosives under the three Tube trains and on the bus .
It suggests that the four Muslims were not , in fact , on any of the Tube trains , claiming that they missed them altogether because of the train delays on the Luton to London line .
It adds , astonishingly , that because the four did not get onto the Tube on time , three of them were murdered by police at Canary Wharf later that morning and the fourth - the bus bomber - ran off .
Outrageous though these claims are , the video has become an internet hit .
More worryingly , it is playing on the fears of Britain 's Muslim community .
Even some senior Islamists believe the events of 7/7 were fabricated .
As Dr Mohammad Naseem , the chairman of Birmingham 's Central Mosque , says in the BBC2 documentary : ' We do not accept the government version of July 7 , 2005 .
The Ripple Effect video is more convincing than the official statements . '
Mr Naseem , a well - educated man , had made 2,000 copies of Ripple Effect for members of his mosque .
Research has revealed that even before the contentious video came out , one in four British Muslims thought the Government or the Secret Services were responsible for the 7/7 atrocities .
Now the number of doubters is growing .
At Friday prayers recently , Dr Naseem asked the congregation to raise their hands if they did not accept the government version of events .
Nearly the entire gathering of 150 men and boys did so .
He then urged his audience to collect free copies of Ripple Effect at the back of the mosque .
A victim is taken away from King 's Cross station by emergency personnel
The respected chairman has since said that the identities of the bombers were discovered by the police suspiciously quickly .
' When a body is blown up , it is destroyed .
How is it that the identification papers found at the bomb scenes of these men were still intact ?
Were they planted ?'
That is another suggestion in Ripple Effect .
So who is behind this dangerous video ?
He is 60 - year - old Yorkshireman Anthony John Hill who lives in Kells , County Meath , Ireland .
He is currently under arrest there and fighting extradition to Britain .
Police here want to interview him on a charge of perverting the course of justice after he sent a copy of his video to a jury member in a terrorist case .
Mr Hill made Ripple Effect at his own home and is the narrator .
In many ways , it is an amateurish affair : the dialogue is jumbled and hard to understand .
But that begs the question , why is Ripple Effect having such an impact ?
The answer is that muddled in with the wild theories of a government plot are some questions that are hard to ignore .
Why did the four bombers get return tickets to London if they were on a one - way suicide mission ?
Why are there no CCTV images of the four together in London even though the city has thousands upon thousands of such cameras in public places ?
Why did so many survivors of the Tube bombings say that the explosions came upwards through the floor of the trains , not down , as would be the case if a backpack blew up inside ?
And why do no passengers on the London - bound Luton train clearly remember the four bombers with their huge rucksacks on that fateful morning ?
Some sources say the Government planned the attack
By the most extraordinary coincidence - Ripple Effect says it is a billion - to - one chance - there was a mock terrorist exercise going on in London that day .
This was revealed by the organiser and former Scotland Yard officer Peter Power on BBC Radio 5 in the early evening after the atrocity .
He said : ' At half - past nine this morning we were running an exercise for a company of over a thousand people in London based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning , so I still have the hairs on the back of my neck standing up . '
And what of the menacing suicide videos that Khan and Tanweer made before the bombings , which were released on the internet after the attacks ?
The Ripple Effect video has an answer for this , too .
Mr Hill explains on it : ' The oldest would be asked to make a " suicide video " prior to the mock training exercise in order to make it as realistic as possible ... the second oldest would also be asked to make a similar video , as a back - up , just in case anything went wrong or the oldest pulled out of the exercise before the date . '
Fact or fiction , it does not matter .
The impact of the video is swaying Muslim feeling .
The BBC2 documentary shows worshippers in the Birmingham mosque commenting on 7/7 after seeing Ripple Effect .
One elderly man states : ' There can be little doubt that the Government did this themselves to these four young men . '
Another adds : ' We have been deceived by the British authorities , and Muslims have been framed for these attacks .
They are lying from A to Z . '
Few are more concerned than Rachel North , the King 's Cross Tube bomb survivor , about Ripple Effect and the discontent it is stirring up : ' If people in mosques think the Government is so antagonistic towards them , that they 're actually willing to frame them for a monstrous crime they did n't commit , what does that do to levels of trust ?
That is a problem for everybody in this country . '
She says the video's central tenet - that 7/7 was faked to demonise Muslims and sway public opinion in favour of the ' war on terror ' - is like throwing petrol on a fire .
Like her , many responsible people - and they include former Scotland Yard deputy assistant commissioner Brian Paddick , former anti-terror chief of London police Andy Hayman ( who oversaw the police response to 7/7 ) and David Davis , until recently Tory Shadow Home Secretary - now support the call for an independent investigation into the bombings .
Paddick himself said this week , the torrent of rumours about 7/7 was harming relations between Muslims and the rest of Britain : ' Hopefully there will be people in the police service , the security service and Whitehall who will realise how important it is that every attempt is made to counteract these conspiracy theories . '
As the fourth anniversary of the London bombings approaches next Tuesday , they are words the Government would be wise to heed .
Security updates released
In accordance with our security policy , today the Django project is issuing a set of releases to remedy a vulnerability reported to us .
This announcement contains a description of the vulnerability , a description of the changes made to fix it , and pointers to the patches for each supported version of Django .
Also covered here is an unrelated issue which , though security - related and resulting in changes to future Django releases , is not being treated as a vulnerability in Django itself .
Description of vulnerability Django includes a lightweight , WSGI - based web server for use in learning Django and in testing new applications during early stages of development .
For sake of convenience , this web server automatically maps certain URLs corresponding to the static media files used by the Django administrative application .
The handler which maps these URLs did not properly check the requested URL to verify that it corresponds to a static media file used by Django .
As such , a carefully - crafted URL can cause the development server to serve any file to which it has read access .
By default , the development server does not listen on interfaces other than the local IP v4 loopback , and Django 's documentation has and will continue to have stern warnings against the use of the development server in other situations ( e.g. , listening on a publicy - or network - accessible interface ) , and stating that the development server is not considered secure or performant enough for such use .
Affected versions Django development trunk
Django 1.0
Django 0.96
Resolution
The development server 's admin media handler has been patched to verify that the requested URL corresponds to a static media file which should be served , and to properly emit an HTTP 404 ( " File Not Found " ) response when the URL does not correspond to such a file .
Patches were applied in the following changesets : Django development trunk : changeset 11351
Django 1.0. X release series : changeset 11353 .
Django 0.96.X release series : changeset 11354 .
The following releases are being issued immediately : Django 0.96.4 ( download | checksums )
Django 1.0.3 ( download | checksums )
These releases are strongly encouraged upgrades for all users of affected versions of Django .
The final release of Django 1.1 , due within hours of these releases , will include the above patch from the development trunk .
Secondary issue
A common deployment strategy for Django in some types of hosting environments involves placing the server which handles Django behind some other web server , which then acts as an HTTP proxy .
In such situations , the REMOTE_ADDR environment variable is typically the IP address of the proxy .
For convenience , Django includes an optional middleware class -- django.middleware.http.SetRemoteAddrFromForwardedFor -- which updates the value of REMOTE_ADDR based on the HTTP X - Forwarded - For header commonly set by some proxy configurations .
It has been demonstrated that this mechanism cannot be made reliable enough for general - purpose use , and that ( despite documentation to the contrary ) its inclusion in Django may lead application developers to assume that the value of REMOTE_ADDR is " safe " or in some way reliable as a source of authentication .
While not directly a security issue ( since relying on REMOTE_ADDR or similar values is widely known to be a worst practice ) , the Django team has decided to deprecate and begin the process of removing this middleware with the Django 1.1 release .
This middleware class will be left as - is in the 1.0 and 0.96 release series , but in the 1.1 release series it will be replaced with a class which takes no action other than raising a deprecation error .
It is expected that this placeholder warning class will be removed in the Django 1.2 release series .
THE comforting thing about each “ national conversation on race ” is that the “ teachable moment ” passes before any serious conversation can get going .
This one ended with a burp .
The debate about which brew would best give President Obama Joe Six - Pack cred in his White House beer op with Harvard ’s town - and - gown antagonists hit the front page of The Wall Street Journal .
Had Obama picked a brand evoking an elitist whiff of John Kerry  Stella Artois , perhaps ?
 we ’d have another week of coverage dissecting his biggest political gaffe since rolling a gutter ball at a Pennsylvania bowling alley .
You ca n’t blame Obama if he ’s perplexed about the recent events .
He answers a single , legitimate race - based question at the end of a news conference and is roundly condemned for “ stepping on his own message ” about health care .
It was the noisiest sector of the news media that did much of the stepping .
“ Health care is bad for ratings , ” explained one cable anchor , Dylan Ratigan of MSNBC , with refreshing public candor .
What a relief , then , to drop dreary debates about the public option and declare a national conversation about black - white fisticuffs .
Especially when this particular incident is truly small beer next to the far more traumatic national sea change on race that will keep sowing conflict and anger long after Henry Louis Gates Jr. finishes his proposed documentary on racial profiling .
I ’ll return to the larger picture , but before the battle of Cambridge fades entirely , let ’s note that the only crime Obama committed at his news conference was honesty ( always impolitic in Washington ) .
He conceded he did not know “ all the facts ” and so wisely resisted passing judgment on “ what role race played ” in the incident .
He said , accurately , that “ separate and apart from this incident ” there is “ a long history ” of “ African - Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcing disproportionately . ”
And , yes , the police did act “ stupidly in arresting ”  not to mention shackling  “ somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home . ”
If Obama had really wanted to go for the jugular , he might have added that the police may have overstepped the law as well .
I enjoy much of the work that the Tax Foundation does , but I find this stuff ( which has been picked up here , here , here and elsewhere ) almost entirely irksome and unhelpful :
Newly released data from the IRS clearly debunks the conventional Beltway rhetoric that the " rich " are not paying their fair share of taxes .
Indeed , the IRS data shows that in 2007 -- the most recent data available -- the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid 40.4 percent of the total income taxes collected by the federal government .
This is the highest percentage in modern history .
By contrast , the top 1 percent paid 24.8 percent of the income tax burden in 1987 , the year following the 1986 tax reform act .
[...]
We are definitely overdue for some honesty in the debate over the progressivity of the nation 's tax burden before lawmakers enact any new taxes to pay for expanded health care .
I 'm pretty sure this is what 's called a " lie of omission . "
The perfectly obvious and uncontroversial reason why the top 1 % of taxpayers paid more in 2007 than at any other time " in modern history " ( whatever that means ) is because the top 1 % of taxpayers are taking home a much greater share of total income .
I do n't want to spend a lot of time on this ( and I 've written about this subject many times before ) but if you head to the Congressional Budget Office 's " Data on the Distribution of Federal Taxes and Household Income " page you can learn all about this stuff .
( The data runs through 2006 -- it 's updated slowly and is one year off the Tax Foundation 's numbers -- but this does n't change the basic picture . )
You can learn , for example , that while the share of individual income tax liabilities paid by the top 1 % has increased from 18.3 % to 39.1 % between 1979 and 2006 , the share of total pretax income has increased at the same rate , from 9.3 % to 18.8 % .
John Ensign , the Promise Keeper who broke all his promises , resides there .
As The Washington Post reported , Senator Tom Coburn , who lives there , had an emotional meeting about forgiveness at the house with Doug Hampton , the husband of Ensign ’s mistress .
( Forgiveness plus bribery can often do the trick . )
Coburn says he would not talk to a court or the Senate ethics committee about the episode because he was counseling Ensign partly as a doctor .
( Coburn is an ob - gyn . )
Last week ,
The Associated Press revealed that the estranged wife of a former Republican congressman , Chip Pickering of Mississippi , had filed an alienation of affection lawsuit seeking damages against her husband ’s gal pal , a wealthy former college sweetheart named Elizabeth Creekmore Byrd .
The suit charges that as a lawmaker , Chip used C Street as a divine love nest .
“ Ultimately , ” it says , “ Creekmore Byrd gave Pickering the option to remain a public servant or become a private citizen and continue relations with her . ”
Republican hypocrisy fell flat at the Sotomayor hearings .
After railing all week against the “ empathy standard , ” as Senator Jeff Sessions called it , the Republicans tried to play the empathy card by calling in two New Haven firefighters , one white and one Hispanic , who were on the losing end of Sonia Sotomayor ’s ruling .
Wearing their dress uniforms , the pair told their heart - tugging tales of studying for an exam that got thrown out after they scored high .
Frank Ricci , who studied hard to overcome his dyslexia , used his finger to trace under the words as he read his testimony .
But the Republican complaint against Sotomayor in that case boiled down to wanting her to be more activist .
They were upset that she sided with elected officials and precedent rather than intervening to strike down a result that many people , including me , found unfair .
Sotomayor ’s syntax was unfathomable , but the Republicans ’ language sounded positively archaic : dire warnings against activist judges , when the conservative majority on this Supreme Court has ignored or upended precedent in a slew of cases .
Though the open source FreeBSD operating system has changed in many aspects over the last 16 years of its life , one item that has remained relatively static is its underlying network routing architecture .
No more :
It 's getting an overhaul with the upcoming FreeBSD 8.0 release .
FreeBSD 8.0 , due out next month , will include a new routing architecture that takes advantage of parallel processing capabilities .
According to its developers , the update will provide FreeBSD 8.0 with a faster more advanced routing architecture than the legacy architecture .
It 's an important change for FreeBSD , which has emerged as a key open source operating system for networking vendors , with players like Juniper , Coyote Point , Blue Coat and others offering their own network operating systems that are based on FreeBSD .
The new routing architecture was written Qing Li , senior architect at Blue Coat , as a way to give back to the open source community .
" Blue Coat 's ProxySG networking kernel was partially derived from the FreeBSD kernel , " Li told InternetNews.com .
" Blue Coat is a sponsor of my open source development work , so this is a good way to contribute to the open source community . "
Blue Coat 's ProxySG is a WAN optimization device that relies on network intelligence to accelerate traffic .
The new routing architecture in FreeBSD 8 is also about optimization , as it reduces data dependencies across networking layers .
The end result is a routing architecture that can take better advantage of multi-core , parallel processing CPUs .
" The new routing technology works on both multi-core as well as single - core CPUs , " Li said .
" The performance gain is most visible in the multi - core situation , though . "
But making changes also has important implications for BSD 8.0 , since a key goal of the release is about ensuring a degree of compatibility with prior releases and the existing software ecosystem .
" Since the rewrite affects fundamental packet processing and the operation of protocols within the networking kernel , I had to ensure regression risk was low and compatibility was high , " Li said .
" For example , those applications that are part of the ports , which interact with the kernel ( e.g. retrieving the routing information , waiting for notification about routing table changes ) will continue to compile and operate semantically correct . "
The Role of Amplifiers in Science
The ability to amplify signals , objects , and mathematical properties plays a key role in all of science
Andy Yao is a Turing Award winner , a long time friend , a co-author , and one of the great theorists of all time .
He has solved many open problems , and helped create many important new areas of complexity theory .
Today I want to talk about one of Andy ’s famous results , the XOR Lemma , while placing it in a larger context .
Throughout science one of the recurrent themes is the power of methods that are able to amplify something : the “ thing ” can be a physical object or a signal , or can be a mathematical property .
In all cases , amplification methods often lead to great progress and create new insights .
Andy spent many years , as I did , at the computer science department at Princeton .
One of his great traits was the ability to focus on one problem , usually until he solved it .
Many of us try to think in parallel about many things at once , but in my opinion , Andy is a serial processor .
A very powerful serial processor .
I once went , years ago , to see Andy about a new result of mine : the fact that the permanent has a random self - reduction .
I told him the result and added that I felt it could be important .
He listened politely and checked his calendar , and told me that he would be available at a certain time in ten days hence .
That ’s the way he operated : focused and steady .
You could also guess that this was his style just from looking at his desk .
Typically it either had nothing on it or perhaps at most one sheet of paper .
One sheet .
Some desks in the department looked like a bomb had recently gone off and scattered papers everywhere ; others were less disordered .
But Andy ’s was special .
One December the graduate students came to me to ask about trying to create some fun event for the upcoming holiday party .
I came up with the “ whose - desk- is- it- contest ? ”
They took an aerial photograph of each faculty member ’s desk .
At the party each guest was given a sheet and their task was to match the picture of the desk with the faculty member .
It was a silly game , that we all seemed to enjoy , and besides the winner got a fun prize .
I believe out of almost one hundred entries no one missed matching Andy ’s desk to Andy .
Let ’s turn now to talk about the main topic on amplifiers in the spirit of the XOR Lemma for Yao .
Physical Amplifiers
There are countless examples of amplification techniques .
Here are some that work with physical systems :
The lever .
This is the familiar system that can be used to amplify a force .
The famous Archimedes of Syracuse once said , “ Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it , and I shall move the world . ”
The microscope .
The first microscope was apparently made in the late 1500 ’s in the Netherlands .
Hans Lippershey , Sacharias Jansen , and Zacharias Jansen are usually credited with the invention .
One repeating theme in all these amplifier inventions is that it is often hard to be sure who invented them first .
This is true of older amplifiers , like the microscope , and as you will see of more modern ones too .
I am not sure why this is the case ; perhaps someone can shed some light on why ?
The telescope .
Like the microscope the telescope seems to have come from the Netherlands also in the early part of the 1600’s .
The great Galileo Galilei did not invent the telescope , but improved it ; and also was perhaps the first to really understand it value .
The inventors are usually listed as Hans Lippershey , Zacharias Janssen , and Jacob Metius .
The relay .
Joseph Henry invented the first relay in 1835 .
The reason it is an example of an amplifier is a small current can control a larger current .
You all probably know well how a basic relay works : a small current flows through a coil that moves an arm .
The arm when moved allows another circuit to be completed and a larger current can then flow .
The vacuum tube .
In 1907 Lee De Forest is credited with creating the basic vacuum tube .
He had a grid that could be charged negatively or positively , and in this way control a current that flowed across the tube .
In his version there was not a true vacuum in the tube , that improvement was made later on GE scientists .
The transistor .
This is perhaps the most important of all amplifiers , without which the entire base of modern technology would be impossible .
Try building a iPhone with vacuum tubes .
It was invented on 17 November 1947 John Bardeen and Walter Brattain , at AT&T Bell Labs .
Quickly , William Shockley saw the vast potential and is often viewed as the father of the transistor .
Physical and Algorithmic Amplifiers
The PCR method .
Kary Mullis won the Nobel Prize in 1993 for his discovery of this method that allows the amplification of even one strand of DNA .
It is an amazing result for several reasons .
Of course without PCR modern TV shows like CSI would be impossible .
Even more important PCR is one of the central tools in all of bio-technology .
There is some controversies over who invented what when .
I have no insider information , but I have an opinion .
What makes PCR so different for the biologists is that PCR needed no new biology .
From a theory point of view what Mullis did was use existing ideas to create a new “ algorithm . ”
PCR uses basic facts about DNA that was long known : the double strands break apart when heated ; they tend to pair up A - T and G - C when cooled ; there is an extension process that uses an enzyme called DNA polymerase .
It was discovered by Arthur Kornberg who won the Nobel Prize in 1953 .
Mullis ’s contribution , I believe , was putting together the pieces to form the PCR algorithm .
An analogy for us is any famous algorithm .
Typically , such an algorithm only uses the operations that any computer can perform , but there order is critical .
And moreover understanding there effect is what makes the algorithm new and exciting .
Algorithmic Amplifiers
The XOR lemma .
This is the famous result of Yao that shows how to amplify the hardness of a boolean function .
Roughly his result shows that if is a boolean function that is weakly predictable , then
is almost completely unpredictable , provided is large enough .
Like the other amplifiers this one also has an interesting history .
The first published proofs were by others — no doubt that Andy had a proof , but the details were done later on .
The parallel repetition method .
This is the famous result of Ran Raz on showing that winning games in parallel decreases exponentially in .
This result also has an interesting history .
Is there something about amplifiers that makes for complex history ?
The result was first stated by Lance Fortnow and Mike Sipser , who thought that playing in parallel was the same as playing serially .
Quickly , it was realized that this was not obvious , and the search began for a proof .
After many partial results , including some work I did with Anne Condon and Jin- Yi Cai on a special case , Ran resolved the whole problem .
His proof is quite hard and there are now better proofs .
The matrix block trick .
This is a folk idea — I believe — that can be used in various contexts to amplify the effect of some theorem about matrices .
Here is a simple example : suppose that is an matrix that you want the value of the permanent of .
Create the matrix which consists of copies of as diagonal blocks : here ,
Then , it is easy to see that the value of the permanent of is the value of the permanent of to the power .
This shows that if there is a way to approximately compute the value for , then there is a way to get a much better approximation to the value of .
This trick can be used for many other matrix valued problems .
The repetition method .
This is perhaps the most basic amplification method .
In order to increase something , just do the same thing many times .
This works for error correcting codes , for example .
Sending the message many times will increase the probability of getting all the bits of a message .
One of the problems is that it is not very efficient , but it is very useful precisely because it relies on no structure of the problem .
Another nice example of the method is to amplify the correctness probability of a BPP computation .
If the computation has a probability of of being correct , then repeats of the computation with independent coin flips will have an error probability that is at most .
One of the major thrust in this area , of course , is to do better than this simple repetition method .
The Tensor Power Trick
This is a trick that is explained beautifully in Terry Tao ’s great blog .
See his post for the details , but here let me try to hopefully explain what is up .
The trick — he calls it that — is to amplify an inequality and eventually get a better one .
He uses the following transformation : take a and replace it by
He shows that using this transformation can often improve an inequality .
In his hands this simple amplification idea can work wonders .
Take a look at his post .
Look at all of his posts .
Direct Products
I have to stop somewhere , so I will stop with a recent paper by Russell Impagliazzo , Valentine Kabanets and Avi Wigderson on “ Direct Product Testing ” from STOC 2009 .
This is really another type of repetition amplification , note the similarity to the last idea .
The direct product code of a function gives its values on all possible - tuples — the direct product code consists of - tuples .
This is used to amplify hardness in many constructions .
They prove some beautiful new results on how to test how close a set of - tuples is to a direct product .
Open Problems
One simple open problem is to create a list of methods that fall under this umbrella .
I know I have just listed some of the amplification methods .
I did not , for example , discuss the zig - zag graph product or other graph products .
What are some others that I should have included ?
Please help .
The other problem is to create new method that are currently missing .
Here are a couple of potential ones :
Can we make a PCR like amplifier for other types of molecules ?
In particular what about an amplifier for proteins ?
I do not believe that one is known .
There are very indirect methods to make more of a protein , but that is not an amplifier .
If I am right there is a Nobel lurking here — but proteins have none of the neat properties of DNA so it probably is a very tough problem .
One the top open problems today in computational game theory is finding good approximations to various game / economic problems .
One approach , perhaps , is to try and create an amplifier here .
Suppose that is a bi-matrix game .
Can we construct another game so that an approximate strategy for yields an even better strategy for ?
One must be a bit careful since there are hardness results , so the amplifier must not be in conflict with these results .
Another of my favorite problems is the edit distance problem .
There are many very good approximation methods for this famous problem .
Can we build an amplifier here that could help improve these results ?
More precisely , given two strings and can we construct new strings and so that a good approximation to the edit distance between and yields an even better one between and ?
Neighbours said parents Kazumi and Neil lived for Sam A five - year - old boy whose body was found at Beachy Head with those of his parents had died from meningitis at his home four days earlier , police said .
Sam Puttick , who was discovered in a rucksack at the East Sussex beauty spot on Monday , was discharged from hospital on Friday and died later .
His parents Kazumi and Neil Puttick wanted Sam , who was quadriplegic , to die at home in Westbury , Wiltshire .
Police said they were satisfied the couple had " taken their own lives " .
Mr Puttick , 34 , and his 44 - year - old wife lived with Sam at Wishing Well Farm in Brokerswood in Westbury .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Sam had been paralysed from the neck down following a car crash in July 2005 .
Friend Sue Capon , who owns Brokerswood Country Park opposite Mr and Mrs Puttick 's house , said they both lived for Sam .
She added : " Sam was adorable , a delight and I feel privileged to have been close to him during his short life .
He never complained , he was always happy and full of smiles .
He loved tractors and the chickens .
" Neil and Kazumi gave 110 % to Sam , they used to come to the park , feed the ducks and enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside . "
Mrs Capon said : " Their life was Sam and without him their life did not mean anything to them .
They were devoted to one another as well as to their child and it's just such a sad ending . "
Sam needed equipment to help him breathe and a website called " stuff4sam " was created to help raise funds for his care .
A statement posted on the website on Tuesday said : " It is with great sadness we have to share the terrible news about Neil , Kazumi and Sam .
" Sam died from meningitis on Friday and it seems that Neil and Kazumi took their own lives shortly after that . "
We are all better for knowing them and Sam could not have wished for better parents
Statement on stuff4sam website
It continues : " We are all very shocked at this terrible news and thinking of everyone who cared for Sam or were close to Neil and Kazumi who are dealing with this tragic situation .
" We are all better for knowing them and Sam could not have wished for better parents . "
Det Insp Ian Williams , of Sussex Police , said : " I am satisfied that Samuel 's grieving parents Neil and Kazumi appear to have taken their own lives .
" This is a tragic incident and we extend our sympathies to their family and to the large number of friends and carers affected . "
Sam had been receiving treatment for pneumococcal meningitis at the Paediatric Intensive Children 's Unit at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children .
A spokesman for Bath and North East Somerset NHS said : " When it became clear that Sam had no hope of recovery from his severe infection , he was discharged to his family home at his parents ' request . "
He was certified dead at the family home by a doctor at about 2000 BST .
The spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage .
The deaths will be the subject of an extensive investigation and inquest .
The NHS said the discharge to home of seriously ill children was an accepted part of the palliative withdrawal of treatment to support the families of dying children .
Rescuers found a second rucksack , full of toys , near the bodies .
A silver Volkswagen camper van was recovered from a roadside car park about 200 yards ( 183 m ) from the cliff edge .
Coastguards on routine patrol first spotted what they thought were two bodies 400 ft ( 120 m ) down the cliff face on Sunday evening .
The two rucksacks were discovered on Monday and the bodies recovered by 1400 BST .

Meat of this post is here : skip or link to this bit .
If you read my blog for my self - indulgent inner voyages of auto - exploration , read on :
Good news : I stumbled upon an exhaustive and self - consistent set of economic and political explanations , together with deeply - documented statistics and examples that instinctively match my own observations and gut - instincts about how the world works !
Bad news : the conclusions reached are shared about a few thousand other obscure eccentrics , most of whom hover around my age , gender and social demographic , profoundly lowering the chances that we are right about anything !
Good news : I ’ve been in this position before : at the birth of the popular Internet .
Hence I do not feel so bad !
1
More good news : Simultaneously in my field of view , I note lots of people are pondering the same broad topic area : the size of the corporation , regulatory transaction costs , and the true level of corporate economies of scale .
We near a trend .
Bad news : that means you will be bored of this topic , and snarkily saying so , on MetaFilter in a matter of hours .
Soon , your closest friends will link to an insightful Clive Thomas piece they have read on the subject .
Doug Rushkoff will claim he invented it .
Time passes .
A Newsweek cover story appears .
Good news : you still have a few minutes to be ahead of the curve !
Here is my new Question of the Moment , together with the book you should read :
What if the Firm is The Wrong Size ?
More leadingly , what if the libertarians and the lefties are both right ?
What if big faceless corporations are the primary benefactors of the misalignment of power relationships in our modern world ; but those warped power relationships have largely been created by , and lopsidedly benefit from , the coercive intrusions of the State ?
And what if those intrusions — sometimes at the behest of capitalists puffing on big cigars , sometimes well - meaning Fabians — have led to an oligopolistic growth in corporate size that is way beyond the point of maximum efficiency that they would naturally shrink to in a freed market ?
What if all those suspicions you harboured about how horrendously inefficient any major corporation , or government department , you ’ve ever worked for , were actually vindicated and documented by research ?
That ’s the delicious and dangerously self - confirming pleasure I gained from reading Organization Theory by Kevin Carson , a doorstop of a book that assembles a wide - ranging selection of literature , from Keynesians to Austrians , Benjamin Tucker to Galbraith , econometric studies to Marx , Wobblies to Murray Rothbard to argue that Big Capitalism has been feeding off Big Government for centuries , and that it is way past time we liquidated them both .
Carson is a left - libertarian , which is sort of like saying you ’re a whale - hunting Greenpeace supporter .
In polite company , it gets you a lot of pointed questions , followed by a distinct lack of future polite company .
I stumbled on this book , because , like many people my age , I ’ve been jamming my tongue onto the very same two - pronged fork at dinner parties for years .
I ’m old enough to remember the stultifying mouldiness of socialist dogma and managed markets consensus in the seventies and early eighties , as well as the cold heartless vacuum of Thatcherite / Reagan economics that gutted it .
I like free markets because they remind me of all the best new ideas in my lifetime : decentralised , individualist - driven and reciprocal .
On the other hand , the distance between that fast - moving , can - do solution space and the defensive flailing of the fat - catted , smug , Tessier - Ashpool plutocrat - run oligopolies you see on CNBC implies to me that free markets are about as far from the real world as the communist utopia was from East Germany , 1988 .
Carson manages , as no other author I ’ve read , to mesh these left and libertarian together .
To do so , he has to stitch and mend much of the traditional narrative of both .
Organization
Theory reads , in parts , like one imagines the rest of Emmanuel Goldstein ’s Book in 1984 might read : a rapid and abbreviated account of an centuries - long ahistorical and ongoing atrocity where no - one is quite on the side you imagined .
But this is no secret conspiracy .
Carson , as the book ’s title implies , is a theorist of the self - defeating nature of conspiracy : of organizational reaching too large to survive on a human scale , but too big to fail .
Here , history is a repeated farce of correct economical instincts overridden by the temptation to take a coercive shortcut .
Merchants commandeer the state and force land - enclosure as the quickest method to leverage labor and capital into the free market , thus guaranteeing the decrepit market inefficiency of both their labor exploitation and land use .
Free trade globalists use military power to pry open up international markets , thereby subsidising trade with one - sided externalities that benefit only crony corporations .
Progressive reform shores up the very cartels they seek to unseat , just at the point that those monopoly ’s internal contradictions have begun their own demise .
Well - meaning bureaucrats devastate working - class self - organization by their professionalization of social welfare .
Management fads take obvious truths about incentive and sabotage in the workplace and turn them into saccharine parodies of real reform .
To list this out makes the book sound obvious , so let me point you to Sean Gabb ’s better attempt to summarise at the UK ’s other Libertarian Alliance2 .
Far more than the precis though , note the impact of the book on Gabb ’s own opinions , as a relatively “ mainstream ” libertarian :
…its overall theme was a revelation to me .
As said , many libertarians recognise that big business is inherently exploitative .
But we have also assumed that it is reasonably productive within its own terms .
It is not .
As already mentioned , Mr Carson believes that large firms show many of the weaknesses long since indentified in centrally - planned economies .
He says : Individual human beings make optimal decisions only when they internalize the costs and benefits of their own decisions .
The larger the organization , the more the authority to make decisions is separated both from the negative consequences and from the direct knowledge of the results .
And in a hierarchy , the consequences of the irrational and misinformed decisions of those at the top are borne by the people who are actually doing the work .
The direct producers , who know what ’s going on and experience directly the consequences of decisions , have no direct control of those decisions .
[ p. 193 ]
The results of this are an obsession at the top with targets that can be measured and an indifference to local understandings of how work may best be done .
Profitability crises are managed by thinly - veiled attempts to make people work harder for less , by “ downsizings ” that cut measurable costs while destroying intangible patterns of human capital , greater incentives to management to restore profitability , and an interest in fad management theories that talk of “ empowerment ” and decentralised control , but are just shifts in legitimising ideology to jolly the workers along .
Strikes and other forms of industrial action should not be seen as mindless wrecking , or attacks on property or violations of contract .
Rather , they are often attempts by the workers to claw back some of the humanity stolen by them .
( Emphasis mine ) .
You see ?
This is a book that can turn even die - hard libertarians wobbly .
Like Gabb , I do n’t necessarily agree with every pinion that Carson meshes together to form his argument .
The problem with being a left - libertarian is that it ’s pretty much idiosyncracy squared , so Organization Theory ’s conclusions are almost guaranteed to have something you ’ll disagree with : worker - owned production , free contracting , steroidically strong unions , no public transport subsidy , land property reform , FidoNet ( yes , FidoNet ) .
But for all its sprawl , Organization
Theory is the first book I ’ve read in a long while that , while it only occasionally tangentially touches my domain knowledge , nonetheless manages gets the facts and policy implications right every time .
I ’ve read technical articles that have got both the details and the gist of the United State ’s IP provisions in its Free Trade Agreements wrong ( hint : they have nothing to do with free trade ) .
And rarely have I seen anyone make the link between DeCSS and the lack of innovation in the DVD market since its introduction , let alone in the same volume as a detailed discussion of soil management ( a gardener of my acquaintance says he got that right too ) .
It ’s one of those books where , if you disagree , you start scribbling in the margin .
And when you agree , you start cutting and pasting into the top of your quotes file , and the bottom of your email sig .
And you ’d be perfectly free to do so .
Let me also point you to the draft PDFs of the book itself , which is copyrighted under the “ Woody Guthrie license ” ( “ anybody caught quoting or copying this book without our permission will be mighty good friends of ours ” ) .
I ’m still processing what I ’ve read , and I ’m sure I ’ll end up re-processing and critiquing it here .
In the mean time , I hope Carson ’s book gets many more good friends , and worthy opponents .
We ’ve all had these thoughts about the inefficiency and the cruelty of the modern firm and the modern state .
Perhaps instead of blindly picking one to support , we should consider the ties that bind them together .
1 Truly , the emotional rewards one can extract from having been proven undeniably correct in a strongly - held position of dweebishly low popularity are not to be underestimated .
Simply closing my eyes now and seeing the redoubled horror in the eyes of A.A. Gill , restaurant critic of the Sunday Times , as he wakes to a new day in the 21st century and realises , once again , that his radio co-guest from 1994 was n’t the idiot he claimed and the Web did go on to be of pivotal importance to literature , is precious beyond compare .
Screw you , successful author and racist A.A. Gill !
May you continue to be cursed with a million young angry competitors , all with the face of me !
2 There are two Libertarian Alliances in the UK , with the same logo and early history ; both LA ’s have the slogan “ Let A Thousand Libertarian Alliances Bloom ! ” .
Unlike the left , British libertarians appear to factionalise with some eventual good humour .
High - Tech for the Kitchen Scientists Develop Intelligent Coffee Mug
Materials to keep drinks cold or hot for longer have been around for quite a while .
Now a pair of German scientists has come up with a high - tech mug they claim keeps coffee at the perfect temperature .

Each of us believes , quite unconsciously of course , that we alone pursue the truth , which the rest are incapable of seeking out and unworthy of attaining .
This madness is so deep - rooted and so useful that it is impossible to realize what would become of each of us if it were someday to disappear
I often see people holding forth regarding “ kink orientations ” in an effort to understand others .
People often pose questions like :
“ What is up with these people who want to be told what to do ? ”
“ If I do not want to be told what to do , but I enjoy pain , am I not submissive ? ”
“ What if I love obedience but have NO DESIRE to feel pain ? ”
And lots more very provocative , evocative queries and ponderments .
I have ruminated on many of these questions for years , and have learned about BDSM from a WHOLE lot of people with dozens and dozens of books and writing credits , and decades of experience under their worn leather belts .
I ’ve been able to learn directly from people who are actually professional Kink thinkers .
I owe lot of who I am today in the Leather Scene to these folks .
I cannot and do not EVER , EVER presume to tell people what to do , how to think , etc .
I can express my opinion , explain it , and hope something of it makes sense to SOMEbody .
To that end I am gonna riff a bit on what I see as the variations between dominants , tops , owners , bottoms , slaves and submissives .
Take it or leave it , but please do feel free to comment either way .
These are thumbnail sketches , blurbs , if you will , designed to open discussion .
Anyway , that is how I use ‘em in my classes and my life .
Labels can be helpful so long as they are magnetic and written in dry - erase , and you can use as many or as few as you like !
Usually .
My take on bottoming
A bottom is someone who enjoys receiving sensation .
It might be intense sensation , or it might be a light fun sensation .
It might have an emotional component , as in playing a pony or “ little boy ” or “ little girl ” in an age play scene .
They usually are in their “ bottom space ” for a delineated period of time : the length of a date , a scene , a weekend , etc .
they are very aware of boundaries , of keeping their options available when it comes to the type of play they desire , and how those needs are going to be met .
Negotiation constantly takes place , as to insure that all needs are being met .
My Take on topping .
A top is someone who enjoys giving sensation .
It might be intense sensation , or it might be a light fun sensation .
It might have an emotional component , as in playing a pony trainer or playing “ mommy ” or “ daddy ” in an age play scene .
They usually are in their “ top space ” for a delineated period of time : the length of a date , a scene , a weekend , etc .
They are very aware of boundaries , of keeping their options available when it comes to the type of play they desire , and how those needs are going to be met .
Negotiation constantly takes place , as to insure that all needs are being met .
My take on submitting .
Submissives gain their chief kink from the psychological aspect of sublimating their desire to that of another .
Submission can be in a physical manner , in an emotional manner , and any combination of both .
A submissive submits to a scene , to an act , to a person , for an established period of time , from a few minutes to a lifetime commitment .
The content of the “ play ” is less critical , to most submissives , than the reward of “ being pleasing ” to their dominant other .
The submissive person might , under some circumstances , even submit to situations that are not to their immediate liking , but with the knowledge that they are pleasing their dominant .
That is then their mode of gratification .
My take on dominating .
Dominants gain their chief kink from the psychological aspect of asserting their desires over those of another .
Domination can be in a physical manner , in an emotional manner , and any combination of both .
A dominant takes control of a scene , an act , a person , for an established period of time , from a few minutes to a lifetime commitment .
The content of the “ play ” is less critical , to most dominants , than the reward of “ being pleased ” by their submissive other .
The dominant person might , under some circumstances , subject their submissive to situations that are not to the immediate liking of the submissive , but is gratified by the submissive “ enduring ” the treatment for their pleasure .
That is then their mode of gratification .
My take on slavery .
People who identify as slaves have , as their core kink , the need to be owned .
The desire to be the absolute property of a master or mistress or owner .
The slave submits ONCE and completely , to their partner .
From that point on , all decisions are the ultimate purview of the owner .
While there might be an “ Emergency Escape Clause ” , there may not , and she slave may be bound for life to the owner .
Free will is not an option , as the owner is the mind in the relationship .
The slave brings themselves , and is sublimated to the personality , the will and the whim of the owner .
There is no time delineation : the slave is always a slave .
Their satisfaction is drawn from providing themselves as property , as chattel , to one who will use them as they see fit .
My take on ownership .
People who identify as master / mistresses and owners have , as their core kink , the need to owned a human being .
The desire to possess , absolute , human property .
The owner takes possession , ONCE and completely , their partner .
From that point on , all decisions are the ultimate purview of the owner .
While there might be an “ Emergency Escape Clause ” , there may not , and she slave may be bound for life to the owner .
Free will is not an option , as the owner is the mind in the relationship .
The owner controls all aspects of the slave , and the slave ’s will is sublimated to the personality , the will and the whim of the owner .
There is no time delineation : the owner is always the owner .
Their satisfaction is drawn from owning human property , as chattel , and using them as they see fit .
In my world view , I do n’t see a hierarchy .
I think hierarchy is fucking stupid .
Because it sets up everyone to look with a jaundiced eye on everyone else .
Feh .
The slaves turn their noses up at the bottoms as “ weekend warriors ” , the submissives roll their eyes at the doormat nature of the slave , the dominants are vexed when they say that want a slave … and then get one , and the tops do n’t want to be bothered with “ high maintenance ” subs .
To me , the MOST IMPORTANT THING IS : describe yourself TO yourself .
DO it well .
DO it thoroughly .
Find the words you need to express who you are , and be ready to explain it to a potential partner .
Anyway … yeah .
Hope this makes some sense to someone .
And I am happy to discuss anything further , to clarify , or to deny I ever wrote such a thing in the first place

Martin Parr is a self - proclaimed " aficionado of the British seaside " .
Since his controversial project of 1985 , The Last Resort : Photographs of New Brighton , in which the documentary photographer captured the highs and lows experienced by residents and day - trippers at a run-down resort on the Wirral Peninsula , Parr has braved the wind - beaten shores of beaches across the country .
For his latest project , Playas , the 57 - year - old and his wife Susie went a little further afield .
The couple spent several years visiting some of the biggest resorts in South America , travelling between Brazil , Uruguay , Mexico , Argentina and Chile in the process .
Be it home or abroad , Parr explains , there is something endlessly appealing about the beach .
" The seaside has to be one of the most fascinating places for people - watching , " he says .
" It is a place where we relax and lose our inhibitions , and that 's when true personalities come on display . "
The fact that revellers of all shapes and sizes are physically exposed , in various states of undress , means that they enjoy a shared sense of community as they meet people who they would n't otherwise encounter in their everyday life – " that in itself is revitalising , " says Parr .
The photographer views the beach as a microcosm of society which allows us to observe the habits and tendencies belonging to particular cultures .
" If you 're in Mar del Plata , Argentina 's largest resort , for example , " says Parr , " you are very likely to be drinking ' mate ' , a local green tea .
Elsewhere in South America , beer and cola is more common .
Another telling little difference is that , in Mexico 's Acapulco , you 'll find that people wear lots of clothes at the beach , which reflects the more reserved character of the locals " .
Compare this to Salvador 's Barra beach – where people hardly wear anything .
Parr was particularly taken with Mar del Plata , " Argentina 's answer to Blackpool , " he says .
" It 's very big , very busy and slightly polluted .
It 's rather like how Coney Island was in the 1960s , too : a little bit dirty and therefore one of the best in the world to photograph . "

Burning Man survives suit by burned man LEGAL AFFAIRS
If you approach the flames at the Burning Man festival , you 're taking your chances of getting burned .
That was the verdict Tuesday from a state appeals court in San Francisco , which refused to reinstate a festivalgoer 's damage suit against the promoter of the annual celebration in the Nevada desert .
Anthony Beninati , a Los Angeles - area resident , was badly burned at the September 2005 event in Black Rock City , Nev . A college - educated real estate manager , he was making his third visit to the weeklong festival , which culminates with the incineration of a 60 - foot wood sculpture .
Once the Burning Man topples , participants are invited to throw objects into the bonfire .
Beninati planned to contribute a photo of a friend who was supposed to come with him but had recently died in a motorcycle accident .
He walked 7 to 10 feet into the burning embers , with flames on either side of him , threw in the photo , then took a few more steps forward , tripped and fell into the fire .
Beninati's hands were burned and one arm was permanently injured , said William Kronenberg , a lawyer for Black Rock , the San Francisco company that promotes the festival .
He said paramedics flew Beninati in a company - supplied helicopter to be treated .
Beninati's suit accused Black Rock of negligently allowing people to approach the fire without safe pathways .
But the First District Court of Appeal , upholding a judge 's dismissal of the case , said anyone who takes part in an event with obvious dangers - downhill skiing , mountain climbing or walking up to a bonfire - knowingly risks injury .
" By continuing to walk into the fire , Beninati assumed the risk that he might trip and fall , " presiding Justice Ignazio Ruvolo said in the 3 - 0 ruling .
" The risk of falling and being burned by the flames or hot ash was inherent , obvious and necessary to the event . "
Ruvolo said such suits have been barred in California since 1992 , when the state Supreme Court dismissed damage claims by a participant in an office touch - football game .
Beninati's lawyers were unavailable for comment .
Palin lawyer threatens to serve papers at kindergarten , then balks ImmoralMinority blogs breaks Palin divorce story By Dennis Zaki Thomas Van Flein , Sarah Palin 's lawyer , threatened Saturday to serve libel papers at a kindergarten to the owner of the highly trafficked " ImmoralMinority " blog for a divorce story on the Palins .
The blog was given until 3 pm Saturday to remove the story and post a retraction .
The blogger stands by the story .
This is now the fourth threat on behalf of Sarah Palin , including one to AlaskaReport.com , that Van Flein has made to bloggers in Alaska in the past few weeks .
None of which he has carried out .
" Gryphen " , the owner of the blog , laughed off the threat and told AlaskaReport - " Nothing that I wrote in my post was meant to be malicious .
I trust my source and simply reported what I had been told .
Threatening to serve legal papers to an educator in a room full of five year olds ?
Now that is malicious . "
The blogger posted a story , most of which has been confirmed by AlaskaReport , about a possible divorce between former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and her husband Todd .
Palin quit Alaska last week after complaining about 21 ethics complaints that have hounded her since she was found guilty in the Troopergate scandal .
See Thomas Van Flein threat to the " Immoral Minority " blogger .
Sarah Palin on " hurt feelings " Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin says politicians need to have thick skin " Just as I 've got "
Which of course is hilarious since she quit as Alaska 's governor complaining about her hurt feelings from Alaska 's bloggers reporting on her numerous ethics violations .

In what is being described as a masterstroke of media synergy , Fox News Channel and the Sci Fi Channel , also known as SyFy , announced today that they would merge their operations .
Rupert Murdoch , whose News Corporation owns Fox , said the merger would achieve significant cost savings : " We will be sharing content , which , quite frankly , we were already doing . "
Roger Ailes , chairman of the new combined network known as SciFox , said that it would roll out a slate of new shows in the fall , including Bill O'Reilly 's " Galactica Factor . "
Mr. Ailes said that he was also looking to sign the woman whom Rep.
Barney Frank excoriated at a health care town hall this week : " We want to find out what planet she spends most of her time on and have her do a show from there . "

The President spoke for a few minutes , then took about 15 minutes of direct questions .
In his opening remarks , he said that now was a critical time for the bill , and that we 're closer to passage than we 've been in the last 50 years .
Those who are opposing have offered no credible alternative but the status quo , which he termed " unacceptable " .
He hoped that the blogs would help him in " debunking myths , " for example the notion that this bill , which is entirely paid for as a package , would spread record deficits .
He said that the default position in Washington is one of inertia , and that pressure must be kept on members of Congress - not Republicans , but members of Congress - to move the process forward .
He made sure to highlight - as did David Axelrod in a short Q&A afterwards - the words of Sen. Jim DeMint , calling health care Obama 's " Waterloo . "
Clearly that will be used by the White Hosue as a badge of honor and a rallying cry in the weeks ahead , because it evokes the same concept as the leader of the GOP Rush Limbaugh saying he hopes Obama fails .
With that , the President took questions , and it was truly unlike most press conferences you 'd see by the heavily pancaked White House press corps .
Bloggers wanted to know about two things - the tactics for getting a bill through , and the substance of that bill .
For example , John Amato from C&L asked if the President would call on Congress to forego the August recess if they did n't reach a floor vote by the deadline , which the President pretty much dodged .
He acknowledged that we cannot delay any further and that we 've been debating this for 50 years , and that those who are calling for delay are doing so deliberately in order to kill any hope of passage , but he would only commit himself to working as hard as we can to see " serious forward motion " by the recess , and never fully answered what I think could be a good tactic Amato brought up , to ask the Congress to finish their work and keep reform on track .
In a similar kind of question about reconciliation , Jonathan Singer from MyDD asked at what point we move to using budget reconciliation if a Senate bill stalls , and the President kept that stick of reconciliation in his back pocket , saying that they expect a bill by mid-October , but failing that , " we 'd look at all options including reconciliation . "
He admitted that reconciliation was n't the preferred option but that the status quo cannot continue .
That speaks very well to the probability that something will pass this year .
What I wanted to ask about was something that Robert Reich wrote about today .
The White House and Congress have made all these deals with key stakeholders , which do provide for hospitals , drug companies and doctors to give back some profits , but preserve additional costs that could be wrung from the system .
And these " legacy costs " are making it very hard to provide the kind of controls that reformers seek and Blue Dogs pay lip service to .
Big Pharma , for example , is in line to get just what it wants .
The Senate health panel ’s bill protects biotech companies from generic competition for 12 years after their drugs go to market , which is guaranteed to keep prices sky high .
Meanwhile , legislation expected from the Senate Finance committee wo n't allow cheaper drugs to be imported from Canada and wo n't give the federal government the right to negotiate Medicare drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies .
Last month Big Pharma agreed to what the White House touted as $ 80 billion in givebacks to help pay for expanded health insurance , but so far there 's been no mechanism to force the industry to keep its promise .
No wonder Big Pharma is now running " Harry and Louise " ads -- the same couple who fifteen years ago scared Americans into thinking the Clinton plan would take away their choice of doctor -- now supportive of Obamacare .
Private insurers , for their part , have become convinced they 'll make more money with a universal mandate accompanied by generous subsidies for families with earnings up to 400 percent of poverty ( in excess of $ 80,000 of income ) than they might stand to lose .
Although still strongly opposed to a public option , the insurance industry is lining up behind much of the legislation .
The biggest surprise is the AMA , which has also now come out in favor -- but only after being assurred that Medicare reimbursements wo n't be cut nearly as much as doctors first feared .
But all these industry giveaways are obviously causing the healthcare tab to grow .
And as these long - term costs rise , the locus of opposition to universal health care is shifting away from industry and toward Blue Dog and moderate Democrats who are increasingly worried about future deficits .
I asked the President about this tension between these buyoffs to stakeholders and his goal to " bend the cost curve " and make health care cheaper and more effective in this country , and here 's a paraphrased version of his answer .
I cannot expect the hospital association , for example , to sign up for something they do n't think is right for hospitals and exepct them to back reform .
So I understand what they 're doing to protect their interests .
I think we can negotiate and find a good way to go about this .
In theory we could cram down additional savings , but to have the American Medical Association , the American Nurses Association , the drugmakers , the insurance companies , all of them on our team , that does help us move the process forward .
Theoretically , there should be enormous savings inside the system .
We all know that we pay more for health care than we should , and we should n't need additional revenue .
But that 's harder to do in practice , because all these powerful interests block the efforts .
What I think is that we can get a framework where reform begins , one with an insurance exchange , and a robust public option , concrete reductions in cost , prevention , health IT , comparative effectiveness research , and it will be possible to achieve greater savings with a more efficient system down the road .
And we can revisit the policy 10 years from now and possibly see even more savings than what was scored and anticipated .
I found that to be both a decent and a deeply unsatisfying answer .
I understand that you do n't want the stakeholders bringing in the Howitzers and seeding massive attacks against any reform , so keeping them on the same side is important .
At the same time , with these groups bought off , and indeed knowing that they will get an ultimately good deal from Washington , the transition from the broken system we have to that theoretical one that Obama discussed gets delayed .
I agree about getting a framework in place , something to tweak down the road .
But we spend so much time in our politics bowing to powerful interests that it 's very frustrating to concede that as a political reality .
Especially when drugmakers and insurance companies are pretty reviled in the populace ( though doctors really are not ) .
Obama seems to know that there 's an easy path for real reform , but it 's complicated by a real control from special interests of the levers of the political debate .
So we keep the dogs at bay , but in the process , we do n't reform health care to the extent that we could .
That animates the " if you like what you have , you can keep it " mantra ( even if what you have is ultimately inefficient ) , and these deals with stakeholders .
Then the fiscal scolds can talk about how the bill costs too much even while resisting those cost control methods because they would hurt these same stakeholders !
It 's maddening .
There is a bright spot , however .
Obama went pretty far in support of a public option , a fairly tangible reform effort , on the call .
He doubted the evidence that a co-op plan like that pushed by Kent Conrad would work , citing past experience that showed them having trouble getting off the ground .
And he then said that the House and Senate bills would not be identical , that a conference committee would certainly be required .
And at that point , the White House would engage in serious negotiations , with the President 's fundamental principles and benchmarks in place .
The House and Senate bills would not match up exactly , but that would not mean that the final bill would n't include certain elements , he essentially said .
The President was basically saying : get it to conference , and we 'll straighten it out .
That probably does n't mean that the President gets everything he wants , but it means that the big issues will be at his determination and discretion , almost certainly .
I think that 's an important reminder .
Past White Houses have used the conference committee very effectively to make sure bills matched preferences .
Obama signaled his willingness to do that .
Which means that , while we can have a role in getting this bill through each chamber , the White House will be able to make their presence felt to a degree at the finish line .
In effect , he will take ownership of the policy and ensure it beats the status quo .
Paul McCartney says “ goodbye ” to touring
You ca n’t fault the guy can you ?
Sir Paul McCartney began performing live with the Quarrymen — the band that would soon become the Beatles — over 50 years ago .
Since then , he ’s had his hand in the most popular band of all time , churned out well - received albums with Wings in the 70s , and has remained relevant and active as a solo rock artist , classical composer , and live act .
Thus , it ’s fitting for the man that has done it all to cap off his prolific touring career next year with one last jaunt across the globe .
Unfortunately , if you ’re a guy like me who ’s listened and tried to play his songs for years instead of catching him live , it looks like McCartney wo n’t be covering as much ground in the U.S. as he has done in the past .
Instead , as The Sun in the U.K. reports , he ’ll opt for gigantic arenas and odd locations such China ’s famous Tiananmen Square and the historical Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin .
A source tells the publication , “ Paul wants to go out with a bang .
He ’s played countless stadiums over his 50 - year career and is on the hunt for the most unusual locations he can find .
He realizes that the older he gets , the less his body will be able to cope with the demands of extended periods on the road .
He might play the odd benefit gig – but other than that he ’ll be putting his feet up and enjoying retirement .
McCartney will be close to 70 when the tour kicks off next year .
If you ’ve seen him recently on “ The Late Show ” or at Coachella , it ’s evident he ’s much more vibrant than your typical 60s rock icon .
It ’d be great not to have to travel hours to catch McCartney on his exit from the stage .
If so , might as well travel to China , right ?
Right ?
Patrick Clayton has been a Toronto Maple Leafs fan for as long as he can remember .
Growing up in Drumbo , Ont. , just north of Woodstock , the 27 - year - old remembers the excitement of the 1993 playoffs , when the team came within a game of the Stanley Cup final , before being felled by the Wayne Gretzky - led Los Angeles Kings .
Despite being too young to have watched the team during its Original Six heyday , he 's aware of the Leafs ' history , and he wants to bring some of it back : he 's backing a petition , started by another young fan , to replace their current logo with the one they wore during their glory days .
The logo – a 35 - pointed maple leaf , with rounder edges than the current , 11 - point leaf – graced the team 's jerseys as they won nine Stanley Cups , before being replaced at the end of the 1967 regular season .
The team has n't won the Cup since .
" When I look at it , I think of Johnny Bower , George Armstrong and those guys hoisting the Cup , " he said .
" There 's always been a lot of feeling for the old logo , a lot of people identifying with it a bit more . "
The idea for the petition was hatched on an Internet hockey message board , where many of the users felt the same way as Clayton .
Another young user on the board set the petition up on its own website ( www.leafslogo.com) and created a Facebook page .
So far , the petition has gathered more than 300 signatures .
The petition 's backers have been using the Internet to promote their cause , but they 're also considering holding a rally to attract attention to their efforts .
But Hall of Famer Red Kelly , a Stanley Cup champion with the Leafs , does n't think changing the logo will make any difference .
" It 's not the logo or the number on the back , it 's the player that 's going to do the winning , " said Kelly , who won four Cups during his stint with the Leafs from 1959 to 1967 .
" I think the key is the maple leaf , regardless of the shape it 's in .
If it 's a maple leaf , then it 's a Toronto team . "
Rajani Kamath , communications director with Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment , would not comment on the petition , but notes the company has preserved the old logo on the team 's alternate jerseys .
Clickjacking or , more formally , user interface redressing , is a class of security vulnerabilities similar to phishing scams .
The technique uses web standards to trick unsuspecting victims into performing actions they were not intending to .
Clickjacking does not rely on bugs in any software .
Instead , the technique is simply an abuse of the growing graphical capabilities that advanced web standards like CSS provide to web browsers .
A good introduction to clickjacking is provided by Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte on their Security Now ! podcast .
As far as I ’m aware , only Firefox when combined with the NoScript add - on and Internet Explorer when combined with the GuardedID product provide any measure of protection against clickjacking attacks .
To date no other browser can detect , alert , or otherwise help you to avoid or mitigate the risks of clickjacking attacks .
That said , there ’s gotta be something users of other browsers can do .
Well , it may not be as much as what NoScript can do , but there is something : use a user style sheet to help expose common clickjacking attack attempts .
clickjane.css helps detect clickjacking attacks for all browsers
Until browser manufacturers provide built - in protections against clickjacking attacks in their software ( which is arguably the best place for such logic in the first place ) , I ’ve started putting together a user style sheet I ’m calling clickjane.css that attempts to instantly reveal common clickjacking attempts .
Since it ’s a CSS user style sheet , this approach should be cross - browser compatible so that users of any browser including Safari , Opera , and other browsers that do n’t have other means of protecting against clickjacking attacks can use it .
I ’ve only recently learned about this class of exploits and so I ’m not supremely well - informed on the topic .
As a result , the clickjane.css file is relatively sparse and currently only reveals what I ’m sure is a small set of clickjacking attmpts .
However , as I research the topic further and learn more about the actual underlying HTML and CSS that clickjacking uses , I ’ll be updating the clickjane.css code to reveal those attempts as well .
Naturally , contributions and assistance in any form are most welcome !
Learn more about clickjane.css as well as how to use it at the Clickjane CSS Github wiki .
Before and after clickjane.css
Here are two example screenshots of a benign clickjacking demo .
Good habits you should get into to mitigate clickjacking risks
Here is a list of behaviors that you should make habitual while you browse the web .
Engaging in these behaviors can dramatically reduce the likelihood that you will be victimized by a clickjacking attack .
Explicitly log out of any service you have logged in to when you are done .
That log - out button is there for a reason : use it !
Avoid providing your browser with “ Auto - Complete ” information for critical sites , such as your bank .
Make sure you are running Flash Player 10 or greater , which mitigates this vulnerability for Adobe Flash content .

Translations of this article :
As I noted in the first of these articles , I plan to dive right in rather than teach Scala from scratch as if to new programmers .
So I 'll begin with a translation of a simple , real - world development problem from Java to Scala , just to give the flavor of the language and highlight a few key capabilities & differences from Java .
The problem , taken from an old unit test suite , is to generate a web application directory on the fly for use by an embedded servlet container .
We 'll focus on one aspect , the creation of web.xml .
Our code will allow a test suite to specify servlet context parameters , servlet classes and URL bindings , and return the appropriate web.xml file as a string .
Here 's how it 's used :
WebXmlGen gen = new WebXmlGen ( ) ;
gen.addParam (" initConfig " , " WEB -INF / myconfig.xml " ) ;
gen.addServlet(" main " , " myapp.tests .Mainervlet " ) .bind ( " / " ) ;
gen.addServlet(" test " , " myapp.tests.TestServlet " ) .bind ( " / test " ) ;
new FileWriter ( " WEB -INF / web.xml " ) .write(gen.webXml ( ) ) ;
For the Java code , we 'll need a list to hold the servlet configurations , another list for the context parameters , and helper classes for each we 'll call ParamInfo and ServletInfo .
import java.io.IOException ;
import java.io.
StringWriter ;
import java.util.ArrayList ;
import java.util .
List ;
import org.jdom.DocType ;
import org.jdom .Document ;
import org.jdom .
Element ;
import org.jdom .
Text ;
import org.jdom.output.XMLOutputter ;
public class WebXmlGen1
{
private List < ServletInfo > servlets = new ArrayList < ServletInfo >( ) ;
private List < ParamInfo > params = new ArrayList < ParamInfo >( ) ;
The webXml method will use JDOM for generating the XML , and will delegate to XML - generating methods in ParamInfo and ServletInfo :
public String webXml ( ) throws IOException
{
Element root = new Element ( " web-app " ) ;
Document doc = new Document ( root ) ;
doc.setDocType(new DocType ( " web-app " ,

" http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/web-app_2_3.dtd " ) ) ;

return output.toString ( ) ;
}
The helper class for holding parameter information is straightforward , just a place to stash the parameter name & value .
Its addXml ( ) method adds the < context - param > element to the JDOM Document .
private class ParamInfo
{
String name ;
String value ;
ParamInfo( String name , String value ) {
this .name = name ;
this .value = value ;
}
void addXml( Element root ) {
Element paramName = textElement ( " param - name " , name ) ;
Element paramValue = textElement ( " param - value " , value ) ;
Element param = new Element ( " context - param " )
.addContent(paramName).addContent(paramValue ) ;
root.addContent( param ) ;
}
}
Given this definition , here is the addParam method :
public void addParam ( String name , String value ) {
params.add ( new ParamInfo( name , value ) ) ;
}
Next , there is the ServletInfo class ; it holds the name and class of the servlet , a list of URL patterns to map to the servlet :
private class ServletInfo
{
String name ;
String klass ;
List < String > patterns = new ArrayList < String >( ) ;
ServletInfo( String name , String klass ) {
this .name = name ;
this .
klass = klass ;
}
void addServletXml( Element root ) {
Element servletName = textElement ( " servlet - name " , name ) ;
Element servletClass = textElement ( " servlet - class " , klass ) ;
Element servlet = new Element ( " servlet " ) .addContent( servletName )
.addContent(servletClass ) ;
root.addContent( servlet ) ;
}
void addMappingXml( Element root ) {
for ( String pattern : patterns ) {
Element servletName = textElement ( " servlet - name " , name ) ;
Element urlPattern = textElement ( " url - pattern " , pattern ) ;
Element mapping = new Element ( " servlet - mapping " ) .addContent (
servletName ).addContent(urlPattern ) ;
root.addContent( mapping ) ;
}
}
}
Here is the addServlet method .
To avoid exposing the ServletInfo class to callers , we define an interface that supports the bind ( ) method shown earlier , and return an anonymous class instance that implements the interface .
public interface UrlBinder {
UrlBinder bind( String pattern ) ;
}
public UrlBinder addServlet ( String name , String klass ) {
final ServletInfo info = new ServletInfo( name , klass ) ;
servlets.add ( info ) ;
return new UrlBinder ( ) {
public UrlBinder bind( String pattern ) {
info.patterns.add( pattern ) ;
return this ;
}
} ;
}
Finally , there is a convenience method for building elements containing a single text node .
private Element textElement ( String name , String text ) {
return new Element ( name ) .addContent( new Text ( text ) ) ;
}
Easy enough .
Let 's begin the translation and introduce some of Scala 's improvements .
Here are the first few lines of the class as expressed in Scala :
import java.io.
StringWriter
import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
import scala.xml.XML
import scala.xml.dtd.{DocType , PublicID}
class WebXmlGen2
{
private var servlets = new ListBuffer [ ServletInfo ] ( )
private var params = new ListBuffer [ ParamInfo ] ( )
The class definition is familiar enough ; it works the same way as in Java , however the default modifier is public .
As you also may have guessed , type parameterization uses square brackets , not angle brackets , so you write ListBuffer [ ParamInfo ] rather than ListBuffer < ParamInfo > .( ListBuffer is one of Scala 's collection classes ; you can also use java.util collections . )
What 's clearly missing here is the " double declaration " boilerplate found in Java .
Because of Scala 's type inferencing , you need n't declare the type of a field or method if Scala can intuit it from an initializer or a return value ; just use " var " or " val " to indicate whether the field is mutable or not ( can change after assignment . )
Also missing are explicit line terminators ; it 's hardly ever necessary to put a semicolon in Scala code .
Next we 'll translate the addParam and addServlet methods .
These also are straightforward :
def addParam ( name : String , value : String ) =
params += new ParamInfo( name , value )
trait UrlBinder {
def bind ( pattern : String ) : UrlBinder
}
def addServlet ( name : String , klass : String ) = {
val info = new ServletInfo( name , klass )
servlets += info
new UrlBinder {
def bind ( pattern : String ) = {
info.patterns += pattern
this
}
}
}
New concepts :
Names and types in declarations are reversed , a la " name : type " rather than " type name " .
Instead of interfaces , Scala uses traits , which can express both function contracts and behavior .
More on this in another post ; in this case , our use of a trait is the same as the use of an interface in Java .
Functions are introduced using the def keyword .
Braces are optional around functions because the body of a function is simply an expression , and in Scala a block of statements is also an expression .
It can be used anywhere , not just for lexical structuring purposes as in Java .
The value of a block expression is the value of the last contained expression , so a return statement is optional in this case .
Note again that we have n't declared the return type of these functions : Scala has inferred them from the return values .
OK , nothing too revolutionary so far ; next we redo the webXml ( ) method :
def webXml = {
val nodes =
< web -app >
{params.map(p => p.toXml ) }
{ servlets.map(s => s.servletXml ) }
{ servlets.map(s => s.mappingXml ) }
</web-app>
val out = new StringWriter ( )
XML.write ( out , nodes , " utf - 8 " , true ,
DocType ( " web-app " , PublicID (
"-// Sun Microsystems , Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN " ,
" http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/web-app_2_3.dtd " ) , Seq ( ) ) )
out.toString ()
}
Whoa ... this is different .
Lines 38 - 41 are just serialization code from Scala 's standard XML library , but what about lines 32 - 36 ?
This is Scala 's support for XML literals at the language level .
Writing XML from Scala means ... just writing XML .
The compiler checks the XML for well - formedness and converts it to an internal runtime representation .
You can interpolate application data in elements or attributes using curly braces , as shown here .
Inside the braces , we see the use of function literals , a great source of flexibility that was regrettably , along with closures , dropped from Java 7 .
Function literals allow function definitions to be used as values and passed around just like instances of built - in and user - defined types .
The syntax of function literals is
( arg1 : type , ... , argN : type ) => expression
Parentheses may be left off the arg list if there is only one argument whose type can be inferred .
So the expression
params.map(p => p.toXml )
is the same as
params.map(( p : ParamInfo ) => p.toXml )
because Scala knows the argument list of a function passed to ListBuffer [ T ] .map is of type ( T ) .
What this says , then , is " Take each element of params , apply the toXml method , and return a sequence of the results . "
Since the type of each sequence member is in turn inferred to be an XML node ( because ParamInfo.toXml returns XML )
Scala will add those elements as children of the < web - app > element ; likewise with the XML for the servlet definitions .
Continuing on , you will now probably not be surprised by the definition of the ParamInfo class :
private class ParamInfo( name : String , value : String )
{
def toXml =
< context - param >
< param - name>{name}</param-name >
< param- value >{value} </param - value >
</context - param >
}
Or maybe you will be ... where 's the constructor ?
It 's created automatically by appending an argument list to the class name as shown .
More boilerplate gone ; no need to populate member fields by hand .
Finally , there 's the updated ServletInfo , and no new surprises this time :
private class ServletInfo( name : String , klass : String )
{
val patterns = new ListBuffer [ String ] ( )
def servletXml =
< servlet >
< servlet- name>{name}</servlet-name >
< servlet-class>{klass}</servlet-class >
</servlet >
def mappingXml =
patterns.map ( pattern =>
< servlet - mapping >
< servlet- name>{name}</servlet-name >
<url - pattern>{pattern}</url-pattern>
</servlet - mapping >)
}
What have we accomplished so far with Scala ?
We 've eliminated useless boilerplate at several points , because the Scala compiler will intuit information that the Java compiler forces the programmer to specify .
We 've used expression - oriented syntax to describe operations on collections more concisely than in Java .
We 've generated XML in the most natural way possible : using XML syntax , instead of through an API .
We 've reduced the code size by about a third .

Marijuana use associated with significantly reduced risk of head and neck cancers More clinical evidence that marijuana is an anti-cancer plant .
Of course none of the mainstream media will care , I wonder why .
I think it 's time people open their eyes to the most useful plant on earth .
For some 35 years the United States federal government has been well aware that cannabis possesses potent anti-cancer and anti-tumor properties .
And for the past three years , government - funded researchers have speculated that these qualities may offer protective effects against the onset of various types of cancer in humans , including lung cancer .
Yet to date , virtually no investigators have taken the time to assess marijuanas potential anti-cancer effects in humans  until now .
In a clinical abstract just published online on the Cancer Prevention Research website , a team of U.S. investigators report that marijuana use , even long - term , is associated with a significantly reduced risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma .
--- A Population - Based Case - Control Study of Marijuana Use and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cannabinoids , constituents of marijuana smoke , have been recognized to have potential anti-tumor properties .
However , the epidemiologic evidence addressing the relationship between marijuana use and the induction of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) is inconsistent and conflicting .
Cases ( n = 434 ) were patients with incident HNSCC disease from nine medical facilities in the Greater Boston , MA area between December 1999 and December 2003 .
Controls ( n = 547 ) were frequency matched to cases on age ( +/- 3 years ) , gender , and town of residence , randomly selected from Massachusetts town books .
... After adjusting for potential confounders ( including smoking and alcohol drinking ) , 10 to 20 years of marijuana use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of HNSCC [ odds ratio ( OR ) ( 10 - < 20 years versus never users ) , 0.38 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.22-0.67 ] .
Among marijuana users moderate weekly use was associated with reduced risk ( OR ( 0.5 - < 1.5 times versus < 0.5 time ) , 0.52 ; 95 % CI , 0.32-0.85 ) .
The magnitude of reduced risk was more pronounced for those who started use at an older age ( OR ( 15 - < 20 years versus never users ) , 0.53 ; 95 % CI , 0.30 - 0.95 ; OR ( >/=20 years versus never users ) , 0.39 ; 95 % CI , 0.17-0.90 ; P( trend ) < 0.001 ) .
Our study suggests that moderate marijuana use is associated with reduced risk of HNSCC .
Ive said this before but it bears repeating .
What possible advancements in the treatment of cancer could have been achieved over the past 35 years had U.S. government officials , or for that matter members of the mainstream media , chosen to advance  rather than to suppress  clinical research into the anti-cancer effects of cannabis ?
It s a shame we have to speculate ; its even more tragic that tens of thousands of families must needlessly suffer while we do .

Conservatives are now on fertile ground .
Still enraged by the ignominy of having been trounced , they are most likely feeling marginalized , ignored and afraid .
For them , it has been less about clarifying health care reform and more about a clarion call to resistance .
And the deceptions have worked .
According to an NBC
News poll released this week , 76 percent of Republicans believe that the health care plan will lead to a government takeover of the health care system ; 70 percent believe it will allow the government to make decisions about when to stop providing medical care to the elderly ; and 61 percent believe it will allow the use of taxpayer dollars for abortions .
Conservative lawmakers should be delirious .
Not only is this stoking the passions of their dwindling base , it is opening the spigot of money from the health care industry and conservative groups .
According to a report on Wednesday by OpenSecrets.org ’s Center for Responsive Politics , health services and H.M.O. ’s increased their campaign donations by 37 percent from the first to the second quarter this year .
Republican and conservative advocacy groups increased their contributions by a whopping 237 percent over the same time period .
For comparison , donations by Democratic and liberal advocacy groups declined .

( FSB Magazine ) --
When John Trupiano and I co-founded our software company Smartlogic Solutions in 2005 , we were college students who knew a lot about writing code but nothing about running a tech consulting business .
Then a client took advantage of our ignorance , which taught us some valuable - and expensive - lessons .
This early client was a staffing agency that wanted to beef up its
Web site with an online recruiting application .
Its owners were impatient to get started , and John and I were enthusiastic about landing a big project , so we dived right in .
When they began adding and removing features and asking us to do extra work , we quickly agreed .
This was our first big account , and we wanted them to be happy .
We kept sending invoices , but we allowed them to accumulate without requesting payment .
And then one day they said , " This is taking too long and costing too much .
We 're not paying you a cent until it 's done . "
They were n't clear about the meaning of " done , " and at this point they owed us $ 12,000 .
Nothing in our computer science classes had prepared us for this .
It took two months before they were willing to sit down with us and an additional week of meetings and phone calls to hammer out a detailed contract .
By then we were so worried about cash flow and the reputation of our new company that we made our biggest mistake yet : agreeing not to bill for the additional time it would take to finish the project .
We spent three weeks making all the final changes on their list - three weeks of working for free so that we would be paid for all the work we had already done .
We presented the finished product and asked for our $ 12,000 .
The client replied that because it had taken us so long to build an application that met its requirements , it was n't going to pay us in full .
Its final offer was $ 4,000 - take it or leave it .
We had a written agreement stating that the client would pay us in full if we met its conditions .
I was furious !
So I took them to court .
To my shock , the judge said the staffing agency did n't have to pay us a cent because the contract was " subjective . "
We had done all that work for nothing and now had to pay a lawyer too .
Belatedly John and I realized that we needed a process to protect ourselves from outcomes like this one .
Today we help clients clarify their functionality , timeline and budget requirements .
We put everything in writing well before we start coding , and we check our progress against the agreement at every step .
That clarity is our added value .
And it 's working - we have better clients , bigger projects and more referrals .
As a result , we passed $ 1 million in revenue last year .
We want to satisfy our clients , but we 're done working for free .

By By Carol Forsloff Jul 1 , 2009 in World According to Algerian militant Abu Bacir El Assimi , Islamic terrorists rape young men as a means of recruitment for suicide bombings .
Rape creates a social stigma and fear , according to reports , that leave Muslims prepared to die .
" The sexual act on young recruits aged between 16 to 19 was a means to urge them to commit suicide operations . "
Both rape and homosexual acts under Sharia law are punishable by death .
News sources say an autopsy revealed a suspected terrorist bomber killed during an attempted terrorist attack on a security installation in Algeria may have been raped .
The report presents the autopsy as finding : " a large tear in the anus of the terrorist , which confirms the If reports are true about sexual coercion of males or male rape being used to recruit young men to die in acts of terrorism , the concerns about how men are treated after
The victim immediately reported the crime , but reports say the police doctor “ seemed " intent on proving there was no rape , just a consensual sexual act between three men and a 15 year - old gay boy . "
The report goes on to say " Homosexuality is against the law in the UAE , where anyone found guilty of sodomy faces years in jail .... the French consul , was so worried a case was being built against Alex as an illegal homosexual he advised the boy and his mother to flee Dubai before he was arrested .
"
In this case someone claiming male rape was threatened with punishment , showing how harsh rape victims are treated .
USC University Professor Stanley Harris MD writes in his treatise Military Male Rape , Homophobia , and Gay History that “ during the past 3500 years , the traumatic rape of Judaeo - Christian military men by their enemies may have contributed to the development of cultural homophobia . ”
Rape , according to this author , was done as a way of punishment , torture , coercion and a host of indignities that brought about an abhorrence and fear of homosexuality .
So not only Islam has had strong aversion to homosexuality and has perpetrated violence against gays , Not all leaders and their followers of Islam believe homosexuality should be treated negatively .
Male rape , which in Dubai has been treated only as homosexuality and not accorded the fact it can be non consensual , remains a topic seldom discussed in either the Islamic or Western world to the same extent female rape is reviewed in the news .
Male terrorists drafted into suicide bombing by rape reveals the fear some feel about homosexuality and male rape , according to the Sun article .
Education and reason , in both Islamic and the Judaeo - Christian communities , as Harris and Hendricks underline , may make a difference in how people view male rape and homosexuality .
In that way terrorists could lose rape as an effective weapon against young men in recruitment , if indeed that ’s what they do .
The Sun quotes Algerian militant Abu Baçir El Assimi as saying , " The sexual act on young recruits aged between 16 to 19 was a means to urge them to commit suicide operations .
" Both rape and homosexual acts under Sharia law are punishable by death .
News sources say an autopsy revealed a suspected terrorist bomber killed during an attempted terrorist attack on a security installation in Algeria may have been raped .
The report presents the autopsy as finding : " a large tear in the anus of the terrorist , which confirms the sexual abuse .
In addition , semen analysis is underway to determine the perpetrator . ”
The victim of the alleged abuse was 22 years old who was said to have joined a terrorist group in March 2008 .
If reports are true about sexual coercion of males or male rape being used to recruit young men to die in acts of terrorism , the concerns about how men are treated after male rape indicate the level of shame and indignities suffered .
It was reported in Dubai in 2007 a very young French boy , Alex , age 15 , who was kidnapped and sexually assaulted .
The victim immediately reported the crime , but reports say the police doctor “ seemed " intent on proving there was no rape , just a consensual sexual act between three men and a 15 year - old gay boy .
" The report goes on to say " Homosexuality is against the law in the UAE , where anyone found guilty of sodomy faces years in jail .... the French consul , was so worried a case was being built against Alex as an illegal homosexual he advised the boy and his mother to flee Dubai before he was arrested .

Imam Muhsin Hendricks maintains contemporary Muslim scholars should revisit the Quran and the teachings and laws of Islam and examine the context in which the texts were written , He declares the “ prophet Muhammad never dealt with homosexuality in a direct way .
Neither did he call for the punishment or persecution of homosexuals .
” Male rape , which in Dubai has been treated only as homosexuality and not accorded the fact it can be non consensual , remains a topic seldom discussed in either the Islamic or Western world to the same extent female rape is reviewed in the news .
One reporter / professor examines the phenomenon in the United States , underlining the statistics of male rape to be 3 % according to crime reports and yet the belief among many is male rape occurs predominantly among homosexuals .
For that reason it often goes unreported or unpunished .
Male terrorists drafted into suicide bombing by rape reveals the fear some feel about homosexuality and male rape , according to the Sun article .
Education and reason , in both Islamic and the Judaeo - Christian communities , as Harris and Hendricks underline , may make a difference in how people view male rape and homosexuality .

DICK Cheney ‘s daughter , Mary , acted like a diva with the Secret Service , a new book claims .
According to “ In the President ’s Secret Service ” by Ronald Kessler , when Mary demanded the Service shuttle her friends out to restaurants , the agent in charge objected and she had him removed from her detail .
The former veep ’s daughter also allegedly complained about the Secret Service vehicle assigned to her .
“ She saw that her sister [ Elizabeth ] had a brand - new Suburban , ” an agent who was on her detail tells the author .
“ Mary had an older vehicle .
She was like , why ca n’t I have one ?
Next thing you know , within a day or two , she has a brand - new Suburban from the Secret Service sitting out there in front of her house . ”
But Mary told Kessler , “ These stories are simply not true , and I have nothing but the utmost respect for the men and women of the Secret Service . ”

Road to Ruin : Bernanke ’s Reappointment is just the status quo
I was n’t sure whether to bother writing about Bernanke ’s reappointment .
Why ?
Because it ’s just the status quo .
But perhaps it ’s worth spelling out the status quo .
Bernanke bailed out the banks and the rich .
You know this , but what is not clear to many people is that bailing out the banks and fixing the banking system were not connected at the hip .
It was possible to fix what was wrong with the banks by taking the big banks into receivership and then using them to lend directly .
Wipe out the shareholders , write down the bondholders to the actual value of the banks , but keep lending to the real economy , and indeed increase lending and capital flows , by , say , deciding to refit every single building in America for energy efficiency and generation , and to take every clunker off the road .
The banking class , and the rich as a group , tanked the system .
They committed what amounted to systematic fraud , and earned billions of dollars of bonuses for themselves by crashing out the system and daring Bernanke and other politicians ( and Ben is nothing if not a pol ) to do something about it .
Bernanke folded , and threw trillions of dollars at them .
Despite what Bernanke ’s , Paulson ’s , Bush ’s and yes , Obama ’s , apologists say , this was not necessary .
It resulted from a deep confusion of banks with what banks do , and a deep desire to keep the same class of people in charge of the economy , despite their manifest failures .
Ben Bernanke , Paulson , Geithner , Bush , Obama and so on could not imagine taking out their friends — could not imagine letting them suffer the consequences of their results — could not even understand that their friends were parasites who were not necessary for the continuation of the system but were instead the people who had caused it to collapse .
The end result of this is going to be two things .
First – a lost decade or more , just like Japan ( I prefer the phrase “ bright depression ” . )
Second – another collapse , even worse than this one .
The books have not been cleared , the garbage has been left on them , just like in Japan , but the US is not Japan , it is not a suprlus society which sells more than it consumes .
It is , itself , a parasitical society which needs blood from donors to survive .
Furthermore the American ruling elite left in place by this decision is much sicker and more shameless than the Japanese one ( where people comitted suicide in shame over what had happened ) .
Having gotten away with it once , they will do it again , indeed the huge bonuses they are paying themselves indicates they still think of themselves as the smartest people in the room , and they ’re right in a sense .
They sold America a pig - in - a - poke , and took America for trillions of dollars .
Rule number one of running scams is never give a sucker ( that ’s you ) an even break .
They are n’t going to , and the end result will be another crisis , which is even worse .
Japanification is not a stable solution set given the realities of America ’s deep structural deficit and the essential con-artist nature of its elites .
All Bernanke ’s reappointment tells you is that the game is still on .
While Bernanke did save the rich , they still lost a lot of money .
They want it back .
And they ’re going to get it back , even if it means they suck the last drop of America ’s blood and the host drops dead .
Welcome the new American century .
Unless you ’re in the charmed circle of con artists and grifters , you are n’t going to enjoy it much .

It ’s true — and this week ’s issue of Entertainment Weekly goes on the set with Jerry Seinfeld , Jason Alexander , Julia Louis - Dreyfus , and Michael Richards , who joined old pal Larry David for the new season of HBO ’s Curb Your Enthusiasm .
Over the last six seasons , viewers have come to expect the outrageous from Curb , Larry David ’s comedic exploration of a man named Larry David .
For season 7 , the co-creator of Seinfeld decided it was finally time to reunite the gang from his old , pathologically revered NBC sitcom , who up until now had resisted the urge to re-emerge .
The story line , which starts in episode 3 , is sprinkled over five of the season ’s 10 episodes as Larry recruits the cast , then plans and tapes the big Seinfeld reunion ( viewers will see a few scenes of the Seinfeld reunion episode on Curb ) .
David is cagey on plot details , and will only hint that “ Larry attempts to get [ his estranged wife ]
Cheryl back , and the Seinfeld reunion figures prominently in that . ”
Adds Louis - Dreyfus , “ It ’s the anti-reunion reunion , and I ’d like to copyright that . ”
When David approached Seinfeld about a reunion plot on Curb in spring 2008 , the comedian was n’t terribly worried about mucking around with the legacy of his beloved nine - season show .
“ The idea of working with Larry was just too overwhelmingly appealing to me , and [ Curb ] is such a great show , ” he says .
“ There was a little part of me that said , ‘ Do we really want to tamper ?
’… But to hell with it .
How much damage can you really do ? ”
The first scene that the Seinfeld gang shot required them to immediately slip back into their old characters .
“ Just before we shot that scene , I said to Jerry and Julia , ‘ I do n’t know if I can be George .
I have n’t tried him on in a while , ’ ” recalls Alexander .
“ And it was freaky how it just came right back out . ”
Richards , meanwhile , dove in feet first .
“ I ’d always kept Kramer ’s shoes , ” he notes .
“ Once I got those shoes on , and I ’m standing behind the door of Jerry ’s apartment , I was ready . ”
Being surrounded by the original sets also helped them get back in the mood :
The Curb producers tracked down Jerry ’s apartment and Monk ’s coffee shop in a nearby warehouse .
( Some home improvements were required , including replacing Jerry ’s apartment door , which Seinfeld had taken as a souvenir . )
While this strange trip may not be the reunion scenario that fans expected , both Seinfeld and David agree that it ’ll be the only one viewers will ever get .
“ As far as I ’m concerned , we did do it , and in a better way than I ever imagined , ” says Seinfeld .
“ This exceeded my expectations , so there ’s no chance I would revisit it now . ”
And there ’s plenty of other action in Curb ’s seventh season : Look for appearances by Meg Ryan , Rosie O’Donnell , Elisabeth Shue ( who scores a part in the Seinfeld reunion ) , Sherry Stringfield , Christian Slater , and Sharon Lawrence , as well as the return of Ted Danson , Mary Steenburgen , and Richard Lewis .

An awful lot of journal articles supposedly written by medical researchers are actually written by pharmaceutical company PR departments .
Someone is finally starting to do something about it :
With a letter last week , a senator who helps oversee public funding for medical research signaled that he was running out of patience with the practice of ghostwriting .
Senator Charles E. Grassley , an Iowa Republican who has led a long - running investigation of conflicts of interest in medicine , is starting to put pressure on the National Institutes of Health to crack down on the practice .
… . The full scope of the ghostwriting problem is still unclear , but recent revelations suggest that the practice is widespread .
Dozens of medical education companies across the country draft scientific papers at the behest of drug makers .
And placing such papers in medical journals has become a fundamental marketing practice for most of the large pharmaceutical companies .
“ Just three days ago , I got a request to be the author of a ghostwritten article about the effectiveness of a cholesterol - lowering drug , ” Dr. James H. Stein , professor of cardiology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine , said this month .
“ This happens all the time . ”
He declined to attach his name to the paper .
In the cycling world , the name “ Calfee ” evokes images of upscale , featherweight carbon - fiber road bikes , produced by California designer - manufacturer Craig Calfee .
But bamboo now constitutes one leading edge of his portfolio , in part because the bikes , he notes , have “ the lowest carbon footprint on the planet . ”
Bamboo ’s versatility is no secret .
Certain varieties are fast growing yet extremely rugged .
There are bamboo bridges , dams , boats , even airplanes [ see “ Bamboo Boom , ” by Michelle Nijhuis ] .
And thanks to its shape and remarkable vibration damping , bamboo practically begs to be made into bicycles .
“ Look at nature , ” Calfee says .
“ A lot of my work ’s already been done .
Here are these straight , resilient tubes growing out of the ground . ”
Today about a third of the 400 bikes that Calfee ’s Santa Cruz factory makes are bamboo and getting strong reviews .
At four pounds , the bamboo frames are heavier than Calfee ’s signature carbon - fiber models but lighter than standard metal .
They are priced at a hefty $ 2,500 for the frame , but otherwise their only drawback might be the nagging attention of curious passersby .
Calfee ’s commitment to this new material goes beyond well - heeled cycling enthusiasts and professional racing teams .
After he visited the West African nation of Ghana , Calfee established an outreach program and microindustry there to manufacture bamboo bicycles for local sale .
With his training and logistical support , Ghanaians have begun to produce serviceable cargo bikes , using their local bamboo , which sell at very modest prices .
Calfee plans to expand such operations beyond Ghana .
Meanwhile he ’s brought some jobs and optimism to the country ’s poor .
“ My hope , ” he says , ” is that this will become a self - sustaining project . ”
Note :
This article was originally printed with the title , " Bamboo Bikes Grow . "
The US President and UK Prime Minister fancy a war .
But not everyone agrees that war is a good thing .
The US General Miller does n't think so and neither does the British Secretary of State for International Development , Simon Foster .
But , after Simon accidentally backs military action on TV , he suddenly has a lot of friends in Washington , DC .
If Simon can get in with the right DC people , if his entourage of one can sleep with the right intern , and if they can both stop the Prime Minister 's chief spin-doctor Malcolm Tucker rigging the vote at the UN , they can halt the war .
If they do n't ... well , they can always sack their Director of Communications Judy , who they never liked anyway and who 's back home dealing with voters with blocked drains and a man who 's angry about a collapsing wall .

Update 2 : Stack Overflow Architecture Update - Now At 95 Million Page Views A Month
Update : Startup – ASP.NET MVC , Cloud Scale & Deployment shows an interesting alternative approach for a Windows stack using ServerPath / GoGrid for a dedicated database machine , elastic VMs for the front end , and a free load balancer .
Stack Overflow is a much loved programmer question and answer site written by two guys nobody has ever heard of before .
Well , not exactly .
The site was created by top programmer and blog stars Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky .
In that sense Stack Overflow is like a celebrity owned restaurant , only it should be around for a while .
Joel estimates 1/3 of all the programmers in the world have used the site so they must be serving up something good .
I fell in deep like with Stack Overflow for purely selfish reasons , it helped me solve a few difficult problems that were jabbing my eyes out with pain .
I also appreciate their no-apologies anthropologically based design philosophy .
Use design to engineer in the behaviours you want to encourage and minimize the responses you want to discourage .
It 's the conscious awareness of the mechanisms that creates such a satisfying synergy .
What is key about the Stack Overflow story for me is the strong case they make for scale up as a viable solution for a certain potentially large class of problems .
The publicity these days is all going scale out using NoSQL databases .
If you need to Google scale then you really have no choice but to go the NoSQL direction .
But Stack Overflow is not Google and neither are most sites .
When thinking about your design options keep Stack Overflow in mind .
In this era of multi-core , large RAM machines and advances in parallel programming techniques , scale up is still a viable strategy and should n't be tossed aside just because it 's not cool anymore .
Maybe someday we 'll have the best of both worlds , but for now there 's a big painful choice to be made and that choice decides your fate .
Joel boasts that for 1/10 the hardware they have performance comparable to similarly size sites .
He wonders if these other sites have good programmers .
Let 's see how they did it and you be the judge .
Site : http://stackoverflow.com
The Stats
16 million page views a month
3 million unique visitors a month ( Facebook reaches 77 million unique visitors a month )
6 million visits a month
86 % of traffic comes from Google
9 million active programmers in the world and 30 % have used Stack Overflow .
Cheaper licensing was attained through Microsoft 's BizSpark program .
My impression is they pay about $ 11 K for OS and SQL licensing .
Monitization strategy : unobtrusive adds , job placement ads , DevDays conferences , extend the software to target other related niches ( Server Fault , Super User ) , develop StackExchange as a white label and self hosted version of Stack Overflow , and perhaps develop some sort of programmer rating system .
Platform
Microsoft ASP.NET MVC
SQL Server 2008
C #
Visual Studio 2008 Team Suite
JQuery
LINQ to SQL
Subversion
Beyond Compare 3
VisualSVN 1.5
Web Tier

A fourth server was added to run superuser.com .
All together the servers also run Stack Overflow , Server Fault , and Super User .
QNAP TS - 409U NAS for backups .
Decided not to use a cloud solution because the bandwidth costs of transferring 5 GB of data per day becomes prohibitive .
Hosting at http://www.peakinternet.com/.
Impressed with their detailed technical responses and reasonable hosting rates .
SQL Server 's full text search is used extensively for the site search and detecting if a question has already been asked .
Lucene.net is considered an attractive alternative .
Lessons Learned
This is a mix of lessons taken from Jeff and Joel and comments from their posts .
If you ’re comfortable managing servers then buy them .
The two biggest problems with renting costs were : 1 ) the insane cost of memory and disk upgrades 2 ) the fact that they [ hosting providers ] really could n’t manage anything .
Make larger one time up front investments to avoid recurring monthly costs which are more expensive in the long term .
Update all network drivers .
Performance went from 2 x slower to 2 x faster .
Upgrading to 48 GB RAM required upgrading MS Enterprise edition .
Memory is incredibly cheap .
Max it out for almost free performance .
At Dell , for example , upgrading from 4G memory to 128G is $ 4378 .
Stack Overflow copied a key part of the Wikipedia database design .
This turned out to be a mistake which will need massive and painful database refactoring to fix .
The refactorings will be to avoid excessive joins in a lot of key queries .
This is the key lesson from giant multi-terabyte table schemas ( like Google ’s BigTable ) which are completely join - free .
This is significant because Stack Overflow 's database is almost completely in RAM and the joins still exact too high a cost .
CPU speed is surprisingly important to the database server .
Going from 1.86 GHz , to 2.5 GHz , to 3.5 GHz CPUs causes an almost linear improvement in typical query times .
The exception is queries which do n’t fit in memory .
When renting hardware nobody pays list price for RAM upgrades unless you are on a month - to - month contract .
The bottleneck is the database 90 % of the time .
At low server volume , the key cost driver is not rackspace , power , bandwidth , servers , or software ; it is NETWORKING EQUIPMENT .
You need a gigabit network between your DB and Web tiers .
Between the cloud and your web server , you need firewall , routing , and VPN devices .
The moment you add a second web server , you also need a load balancing appliance .
The upfront cost of these devices can easily be 2 x the cost of a handful of servers .
EC2 is for scaling horizontally , that is you can split up your work across many machines ( a good idea if you want to be able to scale ) .
It makes even more sense if you need to be able to scale on demand ( add and remove machines as load increases / decreases ) .
Scaling out is only frictionless when you use open source software .
Otherwise scaling up means paying less for licenses and a lot more for hardware , while scaling out means paying less for the hardware , and a whole lot more for licenses .
RAID - 10 is awesome in a heavy read / write database workload .
Separate application and database duties so each can scale independently of the other .
Databases scale up and the applications scale out .
Applications should keep state in the database so they scale horizontally by adding more servers .
The problem with a scale up strategy is a lack of redundancy .
A cluster ads more reliability , but is very expensive when the individual machines are expensive .
Few applications can scale linearly with the number of processors .
Locks will be taken which serializes processing and ends up reducing the effectiveness of your Big Iron .
With larger form factors like 7U power and cooling become critical issues .
Using something between 1U and 7U might be easier to make work in your data center .
As you add more and more database servers the SQL Server license costs can be outrageous .
So by starting scale up and gradually going scale out with non-open source software you can be in a world of financial hurt .
It 's true there 's not much about their architecture here .
We know about their machines , their tool chain , and that they use a two - tier architecture where they access the database directly from the web server code .
We do n't know how they implement tags , etc .
If interested you 'll be able to glean some of this information from an explanation of their schema .
Discussion
As an architecture profile candidate Stack Overflow has earned two important HighScalability badges : the Microsoft Stack Badge and and the Scale Up Badge .
Both controversial and interesting topics of discussion .
Microsoft Stack Badge
The Microsoft Stack Badge was earned because Stack Overflow uses the entire Microsoft Stack : OS , database , C# , Visual Studio , and ASP .NET .
People are always interested in how MS compares to LAMP , but I do n't have many case studies to show them .
Markus Frind of Plenty of Fish fame is often used as a Microsoft stack poster child , but since he explicitly uses as little of the stack as possible he 's not really a good example .
Stack Overflow on the other hand is brash in proclaiming their love for MS , even when that love is occasionally spurned .
It 's hard to separate out the Microsoft stack and the scale up approach because for licensing reasons they tend to go together .
If you find yourself in the position of transitioning from scale up to scale out by adding dozens of cores , MS licensing will bite you .
Licensing aside I personally find C# , Visual Studio , and .
Net a very productive environment .
C# /.
Net is at least as good as Java / JVM .
ASP .NET has always been a confusing mess to me .
The knock against SQL Server is you have to pay for it and if that does n't bother you then it's a solid choice .
The Windows OS may not be as solid as other alternatives but it works well enough .
So for a scale up solution a Microsoft stack works , especially if you are already Windows centric .
Scale Up Badge
This wo n't be a reenactment of the scale out vs scale up vs rent vs buy wars .
For a thorough discussion of these issues please take a look at Scaling Up vs. Scaling Out and Server Hosting — Rent vs. Buy ?.
If you are n't confused and if your head does n't hurt after reading all that then you have n't properly understood the material :-)
The Scale Up Badge was awarded because Stack Overflow uses a scale up strategy to meet their scaling requirements .
When they reach a limit they scale vertically by buying a bigger machine and adding more memory .
Stack Overflow is in the sweet spot for scale up .
It 's not too large , but with an Alexa ranking of 1,666 and 16 million page views a month it 's still a substantial site .
Not Google scale , and probably will never have to be , but those are numbers many sites would be thrilled to have .
Yet they are n't uploading large amounts of media .
They are n't dealing with billions of tweets across complex social networks with millions of users .
Their number of users is self limiting .
And there are still directions they can take if they need to scale ( caching , more web servers , faster disks , more denormalization , more memory , some partitioning , etc ) .
All - in - all it's a well done and very useful two - tier CRUD application .
NoSQL is Hard So should Stack Overflow have scaled out instead of up , just in case ?
What some do n't realize is NoSQL is hard .
Relational databases have many many faults , but they make a lot of common tasks simple while hiding both the cost and complexity .
If you want to know how many black Prius cars are in inventory , for example , then that 's pretty easy to do .
Not so with most NoSQL databases ( I 'll speak generally here , some NoSQL databases have more features than others ) .
You would have program a counter of black Prius cars yourself , up front , in code .
There are no aggregate operators .
You must maintain secondary indexes .
There 's no searching .
There are no distributed queries across partitions .
There 's no Group By or Order By .
There are no cursors for easy paging through result sets .
Returning even 100 large records at time may timeout .
There may be quotas that are very restrictive because they must limit the amount of IO for any one operation .
Query languages may lack expressive power .
The biggest problem of all is that transactions can not span arbitrary boundaries .
There are no ACID guarantees beyond a single record or small entity group .
Once you wrap your head around what this means for the programmer it's not a pleasant prospect at all .
References must be manually maintained .
Relationships must be manually maintained .
There are no cascading deletes that act correctly during a failure .
Every copy of denormalized data must be manually tracked and updated taking into account the possibility of partial failures and externally visible inconsistency .
All this functionality must be written manually by you in your code .
While flexibility to write your own code is great in an OLAP / map - reduce situation , declarative approaches still cover a lot of ground and make for much less brittle code .
What you gain is the ability to write huge quantities of data .
What you lose is complacency .
The programmer must be very aware at all times that they are dealing with a system where it costs a lot to perform distribute operations and failure can occur at anytime .
All this may be the price of building a truly scalable and distributed system , but is this really the price you want to pay ?
The Multitenancy Problem With StackExchange Stack Overflow has gone into the multi-tenancy business .
They are offering StackExchange either self - hosted or as a hosted white label application .
It will be interesting to see if their architecture can scale to handle a large number of sites .
Salesorce is the king of multitenancy and although it 's true they use Oracle as their database , they basically use very little of Oracle and have written their own table structure , indexing and query processor on top of Oracle .
All in order to support multitenancy .
Salesforce went extreme because supporting a lot of different customers is way more difficult than it seems , especially once you allow customization and support versioning .
Clearly all customers can't run in one server for security , customization , and scaling reasons .
You may think just create a database for each customer , share a server for a certain number of customers , and then add more servers as needed .
As long as a customer does n't need more than one server you are golden .
This does n't seem to work well in practice .
Oddly database managers are n't optimized for adding or updating databases .
Creating databases is a heavyweight operation and can degrade performance for existing customers as system locks are taken .
Upgrade issues are also problematic .
Adding columns locks tables which causes problems in high traffic situations .
Adding new indexes can also take a very long time and degrade performance .
Plus each customer will likely have specializations that makes upgrading even more complicated .
To get around these problems Salesforce 's Craig Weissman , Chief Architect , created an innovative approach where tables are not created for each customer .
All data from all customers is mapped into the same data table , including indexes .
The schema for that table looks something like orgid , oid , value0 , value1...value500 . " orgid " is the organization ID and is how data is never mixed up .
It 's a very wide and sparse table , which Oracle seems to handle well .
Hundreds and hundreds of " tables " and custom fields are mapped into the data table .
With this approach Salesforce has no option other than to build their own infrastructure to interpret what 's in that table .
Oracle is left to handle transactions , concurrency , and deadlock detection .
The advatange is because there 's an interpreted layer handling versions and upgrades is relatively simple because the handling logic can be baked in .
Strange but true .

Playing the Game of Spiritual Chicken
These questions came to me as I listened to the words of Adyashanti , one of my favorite teachers , from his CD
It seems that the longer we follow our spiritual impulses , the more our ego dares us to play a game of " Chicken , " like Buzz in the famous racing scene with James Dean in
Will we have the nerve to make the jump to complete awakening , or bail out before we get there ?
I ask this question because I see this doubt reflected back to me from many practitioners of Busting Loose .
Can you really never worry about money or taxes ?
Can you really create anything you want and do whatever you want to do without limitation ?
Can you really always be in a state of bliss ?
The ego is betting that we wo n't have the nerve to go all the way to find out , and it 's got a lot riding on the outcome .
But what is the ego , exactly ?
That gets tricky .
Robert Scheinfeld would probably say that it 's simply another false construct we 've created in the hologram and given power to .
And he would be right .
In Adyashanti's words , it 's the false sense of self that we carry within us .
It 's the aggregator of all the beliefs , opinions , concepts and thoughts that make up our identity , which manifests in a body at a particular point in space .
And he would be right .
Our ego likes the body .
It gives the ego a sense of solidity and reality that the mind alone could not .
And by collapsing the wave form into this one possibility , it keeps us from all the other possibilities .
In truth , we are everything and everywhere .
The ego just makes us seem separate .
As we 've learned , beliefs , thoughts and bodies are illusory .
The ego knows that , too .
Its answer is to just keep us thinking , worrying about the future and trying to make itself indispensable .
To do that , our ego ditches our true self in line to make sure it gets first crack at filtering and interpreting everything we experience .
" When we hear someone speaking , we actually hear what we think about what they 're saying . "
Adyashanti states .
We do n't actually hear what is , until maybe two weeks later when we have that V - 8 moment of realization .
When we feel ourselves losing our sense of reality , the first thing we usually grasp for is a thought , like " This ca n't be happening , I'm Donald Trump . "
A thought .
Think about that .
That 's as ridiculous as the Donald 's combover .
When we have doubt , that 's the ego speaking to us .
Even Robert relates his " dark nights of the soul , " when the ego let him know in no uncertain terms that the journey was way too challenging , intense and overwhelming .
Fortunately , he persevered .
As Adyashanti describes it , enlightenment -- the extended version of awakening -- is no longer believing what you think .
By extension , if you are no longer believing what you think , then ego disappears , and light can enter , at least until we believe another thought .
But do that enough times and ego really gets upset .
That 's why we seem to engender obstacles as we get closer to breaking through the cloud cover .
What does unbelief look like ?
How can we remain undefined by thought and still live ?
Do n't look at me .
I know that at this point in my Phase 2 journey , no matter how many experiences I have of the process having an effect , I still want another one .
I still want to be convinced .
I still do n't trust .
I 'm still grasping on to old beliefs .
The ego's got me right where it wants me , for now .
But I always know there is hope .
I remind myself of what Robert says , that we 're not here to exchange beliefs , but to exchange beliefs for the truth , by doing the process .
In the meantime , we can't do anything wrong , no matter what the ego tells us , and some day , I 'll just sit back and marvel at what a great creation the ego was .
Adyashanti has a slightly different take .
" Part of being awake is being willing to be crucified , " he says .
" The threat of death can't control an enlightened being . "
Either way , we have to be fearless , or we 're just going through the motions .
Speaking of V - 8 moments , perhaps this scene from the end of
Just how far are you willing to go on your journey of awakening ?
Are you ready to relinquish your life as you know it ?
These questions came to me as I listened to the words of Adyashanti , one of my favorite teachers , from his CD " The End of Your World . "

Speaking of V - 8 moments , perhaps this scene from the end of " Thelma and Louise " of the girls going over the cliff in their Thunderbird is closer to the spirit of what I 'm talking about .
After all , Buzz did n't really want to take the leap .
His sleeve got stuck .
Suddenly she was overcome with emotion as she contrasted that environment with the student - led atmosphere in Ms. Atwell ’s class .
“ It makes me sad that my students ca n’t have this every day , ” she said , wiping away tears .
“ These children are so fortunate . ”
Ms. Atwell reminded the teachers that she had once taught in a public school and faced strict requirements .
“ There is nothing that we are doing here that ca n’t be done in any public school , ” she said .
“ The question is , how do you tweak these hidebound traditions of the institutions ? ”
Choice as a Motivator
Literacy specialists say that giving children a say in what they read can help motivate them .
“ If your goal is simply to get them to read more , choice is the way to go , ” said Elizabeth Birr Moje , a literacy professor at the University of Michigan .
Ms. Moje added that choices should be limited and that teachers should guide students toward high - quality literature .
Though research on the academic effects of choice has been limited , some studies have shown that giving students modest options can enhance educational results .
In 11 studies conducted with third , fourth and fifth graders over the past 10 years , John T. Guthrie , now a retired professor of literacy at the University of Maryland , found that giving children limited choices from a classroom collection of books on a topic helped improve performance on standardized reading comprehension tests .
“ The main thing is feeling in charge , ” he said .
Most experts say that teachers do not have to choose between one approach or the other and that they can incorporate the best of both methods : reading some novels as a group while also giving students opportunities to select their own books .
But literacy specialists also say that instilling a habit is as important as creating a shared canon .
“ If what we ’re trying to get to is , everybody has read ‘ Ethan Frome ’ and Henry James and Shakespeare , then the challenge for the teacher is how do you make that stuff accessible and interesting enough that kids will stick with it , ” said Catherine E. Snow , a professor at the Harvard University Graduate School of Education .
“ But if the goal is , how do you make kids lifelong readers , then it seems to me that there ’s a lot to be said for the choice approach .
As adults , as good readers , we do n’t all read the same thing , and we revel in our idiosyncrasies as adult readers , so kids should have some of the same freedom . ”
Ms. McNeill returned to Jonesboro determined to apply what she had observed .
She knew she was luckier than some of the other teachers in the Edgecomb program , who were saddled with large classes and short periods .
She had no more than 20 students in any class , for 100 minutes every day .

Matthews said , “ I think it is an old nasty trick to de-Americanize a guy who has a different name , like Barack Obama .
To de-Americanize a guy like Mike Dukakis , who is a totally American guy .
To try to build the notion that there is the American party , the Republican Party , and there is the un-American party , the Democratic Party .
It ’s nasty terrible divisive politics .
It ’s not e pluribus unum .
It ’s not us all getting together and agreeing to argue politics , which we should do .
It ’s saying some of us are n’t even eligible to argue politics .
They ’re not even eligible to run for office .
It ’s nasty un-American business . ”
I think Matthews has nailed the Republican reasoning for fueling these loony conspiracy theories .
The Republicans are trying to delegitimize Obama .
The more they keep the Internet conspiracy theories going , the better chance they have to play into the fears of Republicans about Barack Obama .
It is a sleazy smear job .
If Barack Obama ’s skin was white , would people be spreading these conspiracy theories about his birth certificate ?
I have always thought that it is n’t just that Obama has a different name , but that his skin is a different color from all the previous presidents .
It is clear that the Republicans are still trying to play post 9/11 politics by trying to de-Americanize Obama .
Read this section only if you need to flash the AT91SAM7S64 microcontroller by yourself .
If you have purchased a kit from us , we have already done this for you .
Modern microcontrollers , such as the Atmel AT91SAM7S64 have highly - packed footprints , making it difficult to find traditional programmers supporting them .
That 's why ISP ( In - System Programming ) has developed very rapidly in the recent years .
ISP allows for assemble the entire circuit board first , and then flash the firmware , often using very simple tools .
The AT91SAM7S64 implements a very convenient ISP solution , based on the built - in USB module .
It 's called the SAM - BA ( SAM Boot Assistant ) , and requires only a USB cable and a few simple jumpers .
To run SAM - BA on your Wireless Keylogger mini-boards , first download the AT91 ISP tool .
Then , follow the steps below to complete firmware flashing on the transmitter and receiver unit .
Step 1 : Applies for the transmitter unit only .
Prepare a USB cable with a type A male plug on one side , and isolated wires on the other side .
Solder the USB lines VCC , GND , D+ , and D- to the appropriate pads on the PCB .
This step is not necessary for the receiver , as it already has a USB connection .
Step 2 : Prepare a few short wires for short - circuiting the SAM - BA pins : TST , ERASE , PA2 , PA1 , PA0 , 3.3 V .
Solder one end of each wire to the SAM - BA pads on both boards .
Alternatively , you may prepare special jumpers as seen on the pictures .
The results of the stress test are due to be released at 5:00 PM to ensure minimum news cycle impact , and the Feds have released a statement on what to expect .
By this point , there 's been so much leaking and throat clearing , it almost seems like an old story at this point .
The pre-announcement reminds people that this is not a solvency test -- they really like to hammer that home -- and that the point of building up a capital buffer is not to ensure their survival , but to ensure that the banks will lend and support the economy .
( Check out the CEO Graveyard of bosses who 've been blown out by the financial crisis . )
As has been leaked ( of course ) the banks will have 30 days to come up with a plan once the results are made public .
One very interesting note , which David Zaring picked up on , is that in this 30 day period " ... firms will need to review their existing management and Board in order to assure that the leadership of the firm has sufficient expertise and ability to manage the risks presented by the current economic environment . "
In other words , if you 're on the least - favored CEO list -- we 're looking at you Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit and Bank of America ( BAC ) CEO Ken Lewis -- it 's time to start talking about succession , planning for the future and resignation .
Is peak oil real ?
The BP Statistical Review of World Energy provides the data needed to answer this question .
Using the 2009 edition , I have compiled a list of all oil producing countries and regions in the world , along with the production status of each , ordered by year of peak production .
BP groups minor producers into categories like " Other Africa " , and " Other Middle East " , and that notation is used here .
All production numbers are quoted in thousands of barrels / day .
Only 14 of the 54 oil producing nations in the world are still increasing their oil production .
The era of cheap oil is definitively over , as shown below .
Country Peak Prod. 2008 Prod. % Off Peak Peak Year United States 11297 7337 - 35 % 1970 Venezuela 3754 2566 - 32 % 1970 Libya 3357 1846 - 45 % 1970 Other Middle East 79 33 - 58 % 1970 Kuwait 3339 2784 - 17 % 1972 Iran 6060 4325 - 29 % 1974 Indonesia 1685 1004 - 41 % 1977 Romania 313 99 - 68 % 1977 Trinidad & Tobago 230 149 - 35 % 1978 Iraq 3489 2423 - 31 % 1979 Brunei 261 175 - 33 % 1979 Tunisia 118 89 - 25 % 1980 Peru 196 120 - 39 % 1982 Cameroon 181 84 - 54 % 1985 Other Europe & Eurasia 762 427 - 44 % 1986 Russian Federation 11484 9886 - 14 % 1987 * Egypt 941 722 - 23 % 1993 Other Asia Pacific 276 237 - 14 % 1993 India 774 766 - 1 % 1995 * Syria 596 398 - 33 % 1995 Gabon 365 235 - 36 % 1996 Argentina 890 682 - 23 % 1998 Colombia 838 618 - 26 % 1999 United Kingdom 2909 1544 - 47 % 1999 Rep. of Congo ( Brazzaville ) 266 249 - 6 % 1999 * Uzbekistan 191 111 - 42 % 1999 Australia 809 556 - 31 % 2000 Norway 3418 2455 - 28 % 2001 Oman 961 728 - 24 % 2001 Yemen 457 305 - 33 % 2002 Other S. & Cent.

Only 14 out of 54 oil producing countries and regions in the world continue to increase production , while 30 are definitely past their production peak , and the remaining 10 appear to have flat or declining production [ 1 ] .
Put another way , peak oil is real in 61 % of the oil producing world when weighted by production .
Since 2008 capped a record run for oil prices , most countries and oil companies were trying all - out to increase production .
While a handful of producers ( think Iraq ) might be limited by above - ground factors , the majority of producers simply could n't do any better in 2008 [ 2 ]
The evidence of the demise of the cheap oil era has become insurmountable .
In the face of the highest oil prices on record , the great majority of the world 's oil producers were incapable of taking advantage and producing more oil .
Many nations including the US saw their oil production peak decades ago - there simply is no turning the clock back .
This list shows that we are relying on a small number of countries to keep providing cheap oil .
We need to move faster to alternatives and greater energy efficiency , before the last fourteen peak as well .
More information on these countries :
Russian Federation - Russia 's oil production collapsed by the early 90's as the Soviet Union collapsed , but despite a decade of growth , Russia 's own oil execs do n't think the old peak can be surpassed .
India 's production appeared to plateau in 1995 , and has stayed within a steady range since .
The EIA forecasts Indian oil production to remain flat or decline slightly in the near future .
Republic of Congo ( Brazzaville ) hit a production plateau in 1998 , though current production is still very close to 1999 peak levels .
Other Central & South America -
The remaining countries of the Americas hit a production peak in 2003 , though it 's still too soon to know if this will be final peak .
Malaysia has been on a production plateau since 1995 , and the EIA projects flat or falling production .
Other Africa -
Oil production in much of Africa is potentially impacted by above - ground constraints , so it 's definitely possible that production will rise here .
It will rise from a low base of only 50,000 bpd however , and may not have much impact on total world production .
Nigeria is impacted by domestic insurgencies in its oil - producing regions , and may be able to lift production if the political situation improves .
Chad 's oil production history is too short to definitively identify a peak in production , but the drop - off since 2005 has been dramatic .
Italy has been on a production plateau for over 10 years , and it 's unlikely that a mature economy is significantly under - exploiting its resource potential .
Ecuador 's production grew rapidly until 2004 , but has leveled off and declined somewhat since then .
[ 1 ]
To be considered past - peak , a producer 's current ( 2008 ) production has to be at least 10 % less than its best year , and the best year must have occurred prior to 2005 .
Some countries ' production has been artificially constrained by political and other non-geological considerations .
But in some of these cases , it will be difficult to pass an old peak because decades of depletion have occurred since that peak .
Iraq peaked in 1979 , making it all the more difficult to pass that now .
[ 2 ]
While OPEC maintains formal production quotas , it is widely believed that only Saudi Arabia had true spare capacity in 2008 , while all other OPEC nations were producing at capacity .
The truth is unclear , since OPEC nations do not provide detailed reserve statistics for their oil fields .
Total has created its own short list of oil producers past peak , and Wikipedia has a list here .
Kim Kardashian has practically made a living off her curvaceous figure .
But the E !
network celeb was looking a little less shapely in Complex magazine in April , her body reduced about a dress size , her legs smoothed to near - perfection .
How did readers know ?
Complex accidentally posted a pre-Photoshopped image of Kardashian on its website -- before her thighs , arms and waist had been digitally sculpted .
In a matter of hours the photo was gone .
But in that brief time span , those who spotted it got a little reminder that we should think twice about taking photographs at face value .
“ My belief , ” says Scott Kelby , president of the Florida - based National Assn. of Photoshop Professionals , “ is that every single major magazine cover is retouched .
I do n’t know how they could n’t be . ”
But do n’t stop there .
Aside from U.S. newspapers , most of which do not permit photos to be manipulated , it ’s quite possible that the vast majority of images seen in the public arena have been altered .
Photoshop , the go - to graphics editing program that got a foothold in the 1990s , has become so ubiquitous that most of us gaze at faces , bodies and landscapes , not even registering that wrinkles have been diminished , legs lengthened and the sky honed to a dream - like shade of blue .
And , unlike its predecessor , airbrushing , anyone can use it .
But Photoshop ’s popularity has proven to be divisive .
While some laud it for its ability to allow people -- and things -- to look their best in a photograph , others see it as a vehicle for feeding our culture ’s desire for uber - perfection .
“ I think the perfect bodies we ’re seeing in magazines that are Photoshopped have a terrible effect on how women feel about their own bodies , ” says Montana Miller , assistant professor in the department of popular culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio .
One theory about retouching in advertisements is that it ’s done to create an aspirational concept of beauty that inspires women to buy more products .
Miller ’s heard another : that the goal of showing perfect images is to make women feel bad about themselves -- also making them buy more beauty products .
Kelby , who also writes a blog on Photoshop , does n’t believe it ’s a malevolent force ; in fact , he sees it as practical and cites the example of singer Faith Hill .
In 2007 , the fashion website Jezebel posted unaltered images of Hill that were shot for a Redbook magazine cover .
In comparing them to the finished product , it appeared that Hill got a makeover , including erased crow ’s - feet , excised back fat and a slimmer arm .
The fallout was huge -- the Jezebel post generated more than 1.3 million views , and was picked up by ABCNews.com , VH1.com , TMZ.com and a number of blogs .
Many commenters were angry that an already attractive woman had her image altered to appear on the cover of a national magazine .
( Redbook declined to comment for this story . )
“ If you met Faith Hill in person , ” Kelby says , “ you would think she ’s absolutely beautiful .
And when you take her picture , you will see every flaw that you never saw in person .
Those flaws not only become visible , but magnified .
. . .
“ If I were talking to someone , I ’d look at their eyes , not at the blemish on the side of their face .
But as soon as you open up that photo on a 30 - inch monitor , you ’d say , ‘ Oh my gosh , where did that come from ? ’ ”
What the brain perceives in a still photo is vastly different from what it perceives in real life , according to Dr. Dale Purves , director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke University in Durham , N.C.
Up close and personal , “ every second you ’re getting a series of images of a person that you ’re kind of blending together , and that would be a little more forgiving . ”
What we ’re taking in , he adds , is a load of stuff , including clothing , personality and smells -- elements that can evaporate in two dimensions .
When it comes to editorial photos for magazines , it ’s common for several different people -- photographers , professional retouchers , photo editors , art directors , publishers -- to have a say about an image .
Although some editors insist celebrities do n’t have final say on how images will be altered , “ If they ’re big enough , they do get [ final approval ] ” says Howard Bragman , chairman of the Fifteen Minutes publicity and media company and author of “ Where ’s My Fifteen Minutes ? ”

Retoucher Amy Dresser sits at a computer monitor in her home office scanning a portrait of an auburn - haired model to demonstrate how she uses Photoshop .
She deftly zaps a few small moles and then peers at a small white patch just below the model ’s eye before obliterating that too .
“ I think one of my main objectives , ” she says , “ is to erase distractions .
When you look at an image , sometimes people can’t focus on what they ’re supposed to focus on because there ’s something going on in the background . ”
She adds , “ I do n’t have a rule that a mole near her armpit equals bad .
It ’s really case by case .
I do n’t think anything is universally bad . ”
Dresser is considered one of the top freelance retouchers in Los Angeles .
Her portfolio includes work on celebrity , advertising and model photos ( Britney Spears , Gwen Stefani , Kat Von D , Lil Wayne , Dita Von Teese ) for editorial work , and promotion , as well as big - budget ad campaigns .
For editorial portraits , Dresser says she does n’t take liberties , such as over - softening facial features and turning subjects into plastic - like dolls , a look often seen in rookie Photoshop work .
She abhors that style , leaving in freckles and moles and sometimes drawing in stray hairs to retain a person ’s humanness .
“ When it comes to notable people , ” she says , “ I feel like embracing the details of that person ’s face is what I ’m supposed to do .
Obviously a person wants to have a nice picture of themselves , and the photographer does n’t want to look bad , and I do n’t want to look like a lazy retoucher , and the magazine wants an appealing image , so you have to find that middle ground . ”
People may not think too much about Photoshop when scanning the magazine stand , but they do notice immediately when altered images of notable people go awry .
Comedian and actor Dane Cook went off on his blog about his Photoshopped image for the movie poster for “ My Best Friend ’s Girl . ”
“ Whoever photoshopped our poster must have done so at taser point with 3 minutes to fulfill their hostage takers deranged obligations .
. . . ”
Tennis player Andy Roddick was digitally enhanced for a cover of Men ’s Fitness in 2007 , and posted this on his blog : “ Little did I know I have 22 - inch guns and a disappearing birth mark on my right arm .
. . .
I walked by the newsstand in the airport and did a total double take .
I can barely figure out how to work the red - eye tool on my digital camera .
Whoever did this has mad skills . ”
Kardashian blogged that Complex ’s slip - up did n’t faze her : “ So what , ” she wrote , “ I have a little cellulite .
What curvy girl does n’t !?
How many people do you think are photoshopped ?
It happens all the time !
I ’m proud of my body and my curves and this picture coming out is probably helpful for everyone to see that just because I am on the cover of a magazine does n’t mean I ’m perfect . ”
At Complex magazine , editor - in - chief Noah Callahan - Bever says he tries to sit in on every cover shoot to ensure what ’s seen on set is accurately translated into a two - dimensional image .
“ I want to make sure that person is represented in a fair way , ” he says .
“ If their flesh tone ends up looking flat and dead , and it does n’t look true to who they are , then it goes back for more retouching . ”
Ask Ladies ’
Home Journal creative director Jeffrey Saks if magazines are consciously manipulating images to foster readers ’ poor self - images and he firmly denies it .
“ We ’re not trying to make women feel bad , ” he says .
“ We ’re trying to show women looking like real people , and whatever cleaning up we do is basically about the quality of the photograph more than trying to do plastic surgery . ”
Gigi Durham , associated professor of media studies at the University of Iowa , does n’t buy into the argument that Photoshop helps people regain what they lose when going from real life to a flat page .
“ We do see who people are in real life , ” Durham says .
“ We can actually see blemishes and weight and body shape , and most of the time we love them anyway .
I think manipulated images are far from that , and have impacts that are more negative because they ’re subject to far more scrutiny than we ’d give them in real life . ”
She ’s referring to the fact that young women , especially , pore over magazine photos , comparing themselves to the images .
“ When I ’ve talked to young adolescents about this , ” she says , “ they ’re not aware of the extent of the manipulation . ”
Even those who are more savvy , she adds , are still affected .
“ They know that no one really looks like that , but they still say , ‘ I wish my waist were that small . ’ ”

With technology always evolving , no doubt graphics programs like Photoshop will become more sophisticated and easier to use , possibly making it even more widespread .
If “ to Photoshop or not to Photoshop ” is the question , the answer lies in what retouching will ultimately achieve .
These days , purposely being seen au naturel is almost a political statement .
Last April ’s edition of French Elle featured eight European women , including Monica Bellucci and Charlotte Rampling , sans makeup and retouching .
To many , it was as refreshing as it was eye - grabbing .
In the course of making adjustments on the auburn - haired model , Dresser mentions that she recently joined an online dating site , and posted a photo of herself .
Was she tempted to Photoshop it ?
“ I just adjust color -- that ’s my personal rule .
Obviously I can retouch myself to look different , and I ’m aware of how a person can look different in two different photos .
So I try to find a photo of me being me . ”

In a phone conversation yesterday , John Williams at Shadow Government Statistics warned me not to read too much good news from the better - than - expected jobs figure .
The government ’s seasonal adjustments are n’t , well , adjusting properly .
They ’re still keying off “ typical ” fluctuations in employment .
But of course today ’s economic climate is anything but typical .
Yesterday the official unemployment rate ticked down a tenth of a percent to 9.4 % , but according to Williams it should have ticked up a tenth of a percent to 9.6 % .
There are big seasonal changes in employment that the Bureau of Labor Statistics corrects for in order to reduce the volatility of the unemployment rate .
For instance , each year employment spikes ahead of the holidays as companies add workers , and then drops as those workers are let go .
July usually sees a regular pattern of planned automobile production line shutdowns to accommodate retooling for the new model year , but recent disruptions to the auto industry have changed pattern this year .
Without the usual pattern of shutdowns , the government ’s computers nonetheless responded by creating the usual offsetting boost in jobs , not only in the auto industry , but in supporting industries as well .
The auto industry itself was alone among durable goods manufacturing industries in showing a reported , seasonally - adjusted monthly gain in July , up by 28,000 jobs .
Besides bad seasonal adjustments , Williams has problems with the so - called “ birth - death ” model , which “ adds a fairly consistent upside bias to payroll levels each year , currently averaging 76,000 jobs per month . ”
The genesis of the birth - death model was after the early ’ 80s recession , when employment figures did n’t catch jobs being added by new small businesses .
However , when a company like Taylor Bean & Whitaker stops reporting its stats , say because all employees were fired en masse , BLS assumes the company is still in business .
( For how long , I ’m not sure )
The bottom line is that , in recessions , you ’re losing more jobs from failing businesses than you ’re gaining from emerging ones .
Hence the upward bias of the model during recessions .
But according to Williams the biggest problem with the official unemployment rate — “ U - 3 ″ in BLS parlance — is that it excludes both the underemployed and workers who have become “ discouraged ” and stopped looking for work :
During the Clinton Administration , “ discouraged workers ” — those who had given up looking for a job because there were no jobs to be had — were redefined so as to be counted only if they had been “ discouraged ” for less than a year .
This time qualification defined away the long - term discouraged workers .
Add all the underemployed and the disappeared and you have Williams “ alternate ” measure , which pegs unemployment at 20.6 % , not 9.4 % .

Chances that an American bankrupted by medical bills has health insurance : 7 in 10
— Harper ’s Index , September 2009
Capitalists , as my friend Father Michael Doyle says , should never be allowed near a health care system .
They hold sick children hostage as they force parents to bankrupt themselves in the desperate scramble to pay for medical care .
The sick do not have a choice .
Medical care is not a consumable good .
We can choose to buy a used car or a new car , shop at a boutique or a thrift store , but there is no choice between illness and health .
And any debate about health care must acknowledge that the for - profit health care industry is the problem and must be destroyed .
This is an industry that hires doctors and analysts to deny care to patients in order to increase profits .
It is an industry that causes half of all bankruptcies .
And the 20,000 Americans who died last year because they did not receive adequate care condemn these corporations as complicit in murder .
The current health care debate in Congress has nothing to do with death panels or public options or socialized medicine .
The real debate , the only one that counts , is how much money our blood - sucking insurance , pharmaceutical and for - profit health services are going to be able to siphon off from new health care legislation .
The proposed plans rattling around Congress all ensure that the profits for these corporations will increase and the misery for ordinary Americans will be compounded .
The corporate state , enabled by both Democrats and Republicans , is yet again cannibalizing the Treasury .
It is yet again pushing Americans , especially the poor and the working class , into levels of despair and rage that will continue to fuel the violent , proto - fascist movements leaping up around the edges of American society .
And the traditional watchdogs — those in public office , the press and citizens groups — are as useless as the perfumed fops of another era who busied their days with court intrigue at Versailles .
Canada never looked so good .
The Democrats are collaborating with lobbyists for the insurance industry , the pharmaceutical industry and for - profit health care providers to craft the current health care reform legislation .
“ Corporate and industry players are inside the tent this time , ” says David Merritt , project director at Newt Gingrich ’s Center for Health Transformation , “ so there is a vacuum on the outside . ”
And these lobbyists have already killed a viable public option and made sure nothing in the bills will impede their growing profits and capacity for abuse .
“ It will basically be a government law that says you have to buy their defective product , ” says Dr. David Himmelstein , a professor at Harvard Medical School and a founder of Physicians for a National Health Plan .
“ Next the government will tell us a Pinto in every garage , a lead - coated toy to every child and melamine - laced puppy chow for every dog . ”
“ Health insurance is not a race to the top ; it is a race to the bottom , ” he told me from Cambridge , Mass .
“ The way you make money is by abusing people .
And if a public - option plan is not ready and willing to abuse patients it is stuck with the expensive patients .
The premiums will go up until it is noncompetitive .
The conditions that have now been set for the plans include a hobbled public option .
Under the best - case scenario there will be tens of millions [ who ] will remain uninsured at the outset , and the number will climb as more and more people are priced out of the insurance market . ”
The inclusion of these corporations in the crafting of health care legislation has not stopped figures like Rick Scott , the former head of the Columbia / HCA health care company , from attempting to sabotage any plan .
Scott ’s company was forced to pay a $ 1.7 billion fraud settlement — the largest health care fraud settlement in U.S. history — for stealing hundreds of millions from taxpayers by overbilling for medical care .
Scott , who made his money primarily from Medicare , is now saturating the airwaves in a reputed $ 20 million ad campaign that is stoking the anger and fear of many Americans .
His ads are coordinated by CRC Public Relations , the group that masterminded the “ Swift boat ” attacks against 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry .
“ They are using our money to campaign against us , ” Dr. Himmelstein told me .
“ The money for these commercials came from health care interests that collect fees from American patients .
We experienced this before in Massachusetts .
We ran a ballot initiative for universal health care in 2000 and the insurance industry spent $ 5 million on it , including the insurance company I am insured by .
They used my premiums to smear an idea that 70 percent in Massachusetts , according to polls , favored before this smear campaign .
Universal health care was narrowly defeated . ”
The bills now in Congress will , at best , impose on the country the failed model in Massachusetts .
That model will demand that Americans buy health insurance from private insurers .
There will be some subsidies for the very poor but not for anyone above a modest income .
Insurers will be allowed to continue to jack up premiums , including for the elderly .
The bankruptcies due to medical bills and swelling premiums will mount along with rising deductibles and co-payments .
Health care will be beyond the reach of many families .
In Massachusetts one in six people who have mandated insurance still say they cannot afford care , and 30,000 people were evicted from the state program this month because of budget cuts .
Expect the same debacle nationwide .
“ For someone my age who is making $ 40,000 a year you are required to lay out $ 5,000 for an insurance premium for coverage that covers nothing until you have spent $ 2,000 out of pocket , ” Himmelstein said .
“ You are $ 7,000 out of pocket before you have any coverage at all .
For most people that means you are already bankrupt before you have insurance .
If anything , that has made them worse off .
Instead of having that $ 5,000 to cover some of their medical expenses they have laid it out in premiums . ”
The U.S. spends twice as much as other industrialized nations on health care — $ 7,129 per capita — although 45.7 million Americans remain without health coverage and millions more are inadequately covered .
There are 14,000 Americans a day now losing their health coverage .
A report in the journal Health Affairs estimates that , if the system is left unchanged , one of every five dollars spent by Americans in 2017 will go to health coverage .
Private insurance bureaucracy and paperwork consume one - third , 31 percent , of every health care dollar .
Streamlining payment through a single nonprofit payer would save more than $ 400 billion per year , enough , Physicians for a National Health Plan points out , to provide comprehensive , high - quality coverage for all Americans .
But the proposed America ’s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 ( H.R. 3200 in the House ) will , rather than cut costs , add an estimated $ 239 billion over 10 years to the federal deficit .
This is very good for the corporations .
It is very bad for us .
The lobbyists have , as they did with the obscene bailouts for banks and investment firms , hijacked legislation in order to fleece the citizen .
The five largest private health insurers and their trade group , America ’s Health Insurance Plans , spent more than $ 6 million on lobbying in the first quarter of 2009 .
Pfizer , the world ’s biggest drug maker , spent more than $ 9 million during the last quarter of 2008 and the first three months of this year .
The Washington Post reported that up to 30 members of Congress from both parties who hold key committee memberships have major investments in health care companies totaling between $ 11 million and $ 27 million .
President Barack Obama ’s director of health care policy , who will not discuss single - payer as an option , has served on the boards of several health care corporations .
Obama and the congressional leadership have shut out advocates of single - payer .
The press , including papers such as The New York Times , treats single - payer as a fringe movement .
The television networks rarely mention it .
And yet between 45 and 60 percent of doctors favor single - payer .
Between 40 and 62 percent of the American people , including 80 percent of registered Democrats , want universal , single - payer not - for - profit health care for all Americans .
The ability of the corporations to discredit and silence voices that represent at least half of the population is another sad testament to the power of our corporate state .
“ We are considering a variety of striking efforts for early in the fall , ” Dr. Himmelstein said , “ including protests outside state capitals by doctors around the country , video links of conferences in 70 or 80 cities around the country , with protests and potential doctors chaining themselves to the fence of the White House . ”

Terrance Gore is on the Los Angeles Dodgers ' roster for the NL wild - card series against the Milwaukee Brewers .
The speedy outfielder played in two of the Dodgers ' first six games this season and was designated for assignment on July 30 .
This will be Gore 's fourth postseason appearance following time with the Kansas City Royals in the 2014 and 2015 World Series and with the Chicago Cubs in the 2018 NL wild card game .
Italy 's health and drugs authorities have approved the use of the abortion drug RU486 , drawing immediate protests by the Vatican .
The Italian Drug Agency ruled , after a meeting which ended last night last night , that the drug cannot be sold in chemists but can be administered only by doctors in a hospital .
The agency said the pill can only be taken up to the seventh week of pregnancy .
The RU486 was first introduced in France almost 20 years ago and is available in several other European countries .
But approval in Italy has been held up by the Catholic church , which opposes abortion and contraception .
However , Italy allows surgical abortions in hospitals and the use of the morning - after pill .

" What disturbs Americans of all ideological persuasions is the fear that almost everything , not just government , is fixed or manipulated by some powerful hidden hand , " Frank Rich wrote in Sunday 's New York Times .
That manipulation should disturb us .
But contrary to Rich , it is not the work of " corporatists " who have sprung up to attack progressive reforms proposed by Obama and the Democratic majority .
Manipulation is what we got many years ago when we traded a more or less free market for the " progressive " interventionist state .
When government is big , the well - connected always have an advantage over the rest of us in influencing public policy .
Observe : Although President Obama and big - government activists demonize health - insurance companies , the companies " are still mostly on board with the president 's effort to overhaul the U.S. health - care system , " the Wall Street Journal reports ; and ...
Although the activists criticize Big Pharma , " The drug industry has already contributed millions of dollars to advertising campaigns for the health care overhaul through the advocacy groups like Healthy Economies Now and Families USA .
It has spent about $ 1 million on similar advertisements under its own name , " the Times reports .
Big Pharma and Big Insurance want Obama - style health - care reform ?
It 's not so hard to understand .
" The drug makers stand to gain millions of new customers , " the Times said .
And from the Journal : " If health legislation succeeds , the [ insurance ] industry would likely get a fresh batch of new customers .
In particular , many young and healthy people who currently forgo coverage would be forced to sign up . "
No wonder insurers are willing to stop " discriminating " against sick people .
( Forget that the essence of insurance is discrimination according to risk . )
Not that Big Pharma and Big Insurance like every detail of the Democratic plan .
Drug companies do n't want Medicare negotiating drug prices -- for good reason .
If it forces drug prices down , research and development will be discouraged .
( Depending whom you believe , Obama may or may not have agreed with the drug companies on this point . )
As for the insurance companies , they worry -- legitimately -- that a government insurance company -- the so - called public option " -- would drive them out of business .
This is n't alarmism .
It 's economics .
The public option would have no bottom line to worry about and therefore could engage in " predatory pricing " against the private insurers .
But despite these differences , the biggest companies in these two industries are on board with " reform . "
It illustrates economist Steven Horwitz 's First Law of Political Economy : " No one hates capitalism more than capitalists " .
In this case , big business wants to shape -- and profit from -- what inevitably will be an interventionist health - care reform .
Can you think of the last time a major business supported a truly free market in anything ?
In light of all this , it 's funny to watch Democrats and their activist allies panic over the protests at congressional town meetings around the country .
Tools of the corporate interests !
they cry .
But anyone opposing " socialized medicine " at the meeting can't be a mouthpiece for big business because , as we 've seen , big business supports government control .
Conservative groups may be encouraging people to vent their anger at congressmen who pass burdensome legislation without even bothering to read it , but that 's no reason to insult the protestors as pawns .
What 's wrong with organizations helping like - minded people to voice their opinions ?
Why do Democrats , such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi , dismiss citizen participation as " AstroTurf " -- not real grassroots -- only when citizens oppose the kind of big government they favor ?
They were n't so dismissive when George W. Bush was president and people protested -- appropriately -- his accumulation of executive powers .
" When handfuls of Code Pink ladies disrupted congressional hearings or speeches by Bush administration officials , " Glenn Reynolds writes , " it was taken as evidence that the administration 's policies were unpopular , and that the thinking parts of the populace were rising up in true democratic fashion .
...
But when it happens to Democrats , it 's something different :
A threat to democracy , a sign of incipient fascism ... House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls the ' Tea Party ' protesters Nazis . ... "
So when lefties do it , it 's called " community organizing . "
When conservatives and libertarians do it , it 's " AstroTurf . "
Give me a break .
( Updates with resignation of Google CEO Eric Schmidt from the Apple board ) .
Federal regulators want to know if AT&T and Apple worked to together to reject mobile apps for Google 's innovative Voice service , sending letters to the companies asking them to explain this incident and the policies behind the secretive and lucrative iPhone App store .
The letters are the first indication that the feds might be interested in mandating openness for Apple 's iPhone store and similar stores run by Sprint , Verizon and even Google .
The iPhone store , run through Apple 's iTunes software , is the only way an iPhone user can install third - party applications without voiding the phone 's warranty .
According to the letters , the FCC wants to know the who , what , why and when of the rejection of the Google Voice app for the iPhone .
Google Voice , still an invite - only beta program , lets users channel all their calls through a single Google Voice number which offers cheap international calls , free long distance calls , free text messaging and voicemail transcription - though calls through its mobile app still use the minutes on a mobile phone .
The FCC's new chairman Julius Genachowski made it clear Friday in announcing the letters that he was not pleased by Apple and AT&T 's actions , while leaving wiggle room about what , if anything , the feds would do .
" Recent news reports raise questions about practices in the mobile marketplace , " Genachowski said in a press statement .
" The Wireless Bureau ’s inquiry letters to these companies about their practices reflect the Commission ’s proactive approach to getting the facts and data necessary to make the best policy decisions on behalf of the American people . "
[ On Monday Google CEO Eric Schmidt resigned from the Apple board , on which he had served for two years . ]
The feds are already looking at mobile phone exclusivity – such as the lock AT&T has on the iPhone in the U.S. – to see if those deals hurt consumers .
Outside groups are asking the feds to make mobile carriers adhere the same openness rules that apply to ISPs – e.g. letting them use whatever device , app or online service they want to use .
And here the FCC is n't limiting itself to questions about the Google Voice incident .
The FCC also wants to know what other apps have been rejected , what the rules are and what role AT&T plays in such decisions .
( Apple letter ( .pdf ) , AT&T letter ( .pdf ) )
The letters say the matter applies to two open matters before the FCC and clearly indicate that the FCC is at least considering whether it should regulate app stores , which are growing in popularity after the breakout success of the iPhone App store .
The Google Voice app – and its unofficial brethren – were not the first to be rejected from sale in the iPhone store for capricious and seemingly unfair reasons .
For instance , AT&T said it expected Apple to reject a Skype application that would let users make internet phone calls using the phones ' 3G data connection .
Apple also forced Slingbox to cripple its video streaming application so that it would only work over WiFi , and not a mobile carrier 's network – that despite promoting a Major League Baseball app that would be an even heavier burden on the network .
The FCC is clearly very curious about such activities :
Are there any terms in AT&T ’s customer agreements that limit customer usage of certain third - partyapplications ?
If so , please indicate how consumers are informed of such limitations and whether such limitations are posted on the iTunes website as well .
In general , what is AT&T ’s role in certifying applications on devices that run over AT&T ’s 3G network ?
What , if any , applications require AT&T ’s approval to be added to a device ?
Are there any differences between AT&T ’s treatment of the iPhone and other devices used on its 3G network ?
Google was caught off guard by the firestorm of criticism that engulfed Apple and took pains to say that it was still good friends with Apple , despite being disappointed by the rejection .
Google 's app store for Android phones itself does not allow T - Mobile users to download apps that allow them to use their phones as modems – a technique known as tethering .
For its trouble , the FCC also dropped a letter ( .pdf ) on Google , asking what happened with the Google Voice app rejection .
Not surprisingly , the feds also want to know what Android apps Google has rejected and why .
The FCC wants replies from all three tech giants by August 21 , and says that it will not accept replies wrapped in total secrecy , but will allow some information to be submitted under seal .
For the record , Epicenter predicted that Apple and AT&T were courting regulatory trouble in our post earlier this week , which was entitled Apple Rejects Google Voice App , Invites Regulation .

Well , my money happened it Vegas , and you can bet that it stayed in Vegas too .
Fresh off of the plane from Vegas , I have some mistakes I made to share with you so if you go you will be better prepared to gamble wisely .
There are smart ways and dumb ways to gamble .
Getting caught up in the moment is not hard to do .
Flashing lights , bells , whistles , free drinks , and so many different ways to lose money contribute to a lack of concentration when you need to be able to .
Having an extra three hour layover in Denver pushed my arrival time from 7:30 to about midnight .
Once I landed at McCaren Airport in Las Vegas , I was just feeling the rush to get checked in , get a players card and get to the casino .
By 1:00 AM , I was gambling .
I started out playing blackjack with Toni Lynn Bisconti , a lifelong friend who shares my joy of gambling .
We were at a $ 10 minimum table .
After about an hour of back - and - forth wagering , the dealer caught fire .
I was out about $ 200 in a very short time .
The next day , the craps table , the roulette wheel , and the Captain kicked my ass .
The Captain ?
Captain Morgan .
I am not much of a drinker .
At about 9AM , after I had a good breakfast , I settled in at a video poker machine and was getting ready to start playing when a cocktail waitress asked me if I would like something to drink .
I told her that I would take a Captain and Coke .
This turned into an all - day thing .
I ’ll bet I killed a bottle myself .
I was in bad shape and needed to sleep by 9 PM .
The group I was with went downtown and had a blast while I watched my room spin .

People were all over the Red Wings and were putting up $ 240 to win $ 100 .
Here are some tips :
If you are a drinker , build your tolerance before the trip so you can keep focus while gambling .
If you are not a drinker , or only drink on special occasions , do n’t get caught up being Mickey Mantle while you are gambling .
You will lose more times than you win because of mistakes caused by a lack of focus .
Find time to go downtown .
Old Vegas is nice because you can play $ 1 craps or blackjack .
The atmosphere is more fun because your focus is allowed to wander a bit due to the reduced stakes .
The Vegas Strip is a brightly lit trap for the casual gambler .
Downtown is missing that new shine and luster , but offers better play odds and more affordable table minimums .
If you have a hangover , avoid loud slot machines .

Plan your days but not each event .
If you want to go to New York , New York on Friday until 5 and then to Rio until 9 , and then to Bally ’s until 11 , leave windows of time , just in case .
If you find something you are really enjoying or winning at , stay .
Do n’t cash out at 10 minutes to 5 because you have to be somewhere .
Stay on the roll .
It only happens a couple of times while you are there .
Player cards are great if you are Mr. Howell from Gilligan ’s Island .
You need to drop some very serious cash to have your status moved from gold to platinum on your rating card .
The comp trap is usually good for a free breakfast or a T - Shirt , but never panned out to much else .
I gambled for two days straight and was only a quarter of the way to platinum status .

Background
As a consequence of mammographic breast screening programmes , ductal carcinoma in situ is diagnosed with increasing frequency .
Mastectomy for localised ductal carcinoma in situ is thought to be an overtreatment by many physicians , but there is much controversy as to whether complete local excision alone is sufficient .
We aimed to assess the effectiveness of adjuvant radio - therapy and tamoxifen .
Methods
We used a 2×2 factorial design in a randomised controlled trial .
Between May , 1990 , and August , 1998 , 1701 patients recruited from screening programmes were randomised to both treatments in combination or singly , or to none , or to either one ( eg , radiotherapy ) with an elective decision to give or to withhold the other ( i.e. , in this case tamoxifen ) .
Patients had complete surgical excision of the lesion con-firmed by specimen radiography and histology .
Patients have been followed up at least once a year .
Median follow - up was 52·6 ( range 2·4–118·3 ) months .
Our primary endpoint was the incidence of ipsilateral invasive disease .
Findings
Ipsilateral invasive disease was not reduced by tamoxifen but recurrence of overall ductal carcinoma in situ was decreased ( hazard ratio 0·68 [ 0·49–0·96 ] ; p=0·03 ) .
Radiotherapy reduced the incidence of ips-ilateral invasive disease ( 0·45 [ 0·24–0·85 ] ; p=0·01 ) and ipsilateral ductal carcinoma in situ ( 0·36 [ 0·19 –0·66 ] ; p=0·0004 ) , but there was no effect on the occurrence of contra-lateral disease .
There was no evidence of interaction between radiotherapy and tamoxifen .
Interpretation
Radiotherapy can be recommended for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ treated by complete local excision ; however , there is little evidence for the use of tamoxifen in these women .
BRYCEVILLE , Florida ( CNN ) -- Michael Ratley was known as a hero .
Michael Ratley will spend the rest of his life in jail , without parole , for killing his wife with a hammer .
In December 2006 , Ratley carried his 2 - week - old son , Aiden , and his wife , Effie Ratley , 29 , from the flames as fire engulfed their Bryceville , Florida , trailer .
Days after the fire , a teary - eyed Ratley told local media that love drove him to save their lives .
" I might have lost everything physical , but I 've still got my two most precious things , " Michael Ratley told CNN affiliate WJXT - TV at the time .
A month later , Effie Ratley was dead , bludgeoned with a hammer in a bedroom of her in - laws ' home , not far from the trailer 's ashes on a dirt road marked only with a black arrow on a wooden sign .
The man who was hailed as a hero for saving his wife was convicted in July of murdering her .
On Tuesday , a Nassau County Court jury in Yulee , Florida , said he should spend the rest of his life in prison for the crime .
Circuit Judge Robert Foster sentenced the 25 - year - old to life without possibility of parole .
What changed a heroic husband into a hammer - wielding wife killer ?
Hero gets life for murder »
During the trial , no motive was offered .
On January 27 , 2007 , with his parents downstairs watching TV with the door shut and his infant son in the other room , prosecutors said , Ratley put on a pair of thick black gloves , grabbed a heavy - duty hammer and went into the bedroom where his wife was lying down after taking some medication .
He lifted the hammer and " savagely and brutally beat her on the head over and over " -- at least seven times , said Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda .
During the trial , Ratley said he had nothing to do with the slaying .
His defense lawyers argued that an intruder , who Ratley alleged attacked him in the barn the night before , was the culprit .
But prosecutors said that was part of Ratley 's plan , setting up for a scenario in which an intruder killed his wife by cutting the wire on their window .
Testifying on Tuesday , his friends and family spoke of him as a church - going , gentle man who always went out of his way to help others -- the elderly at a nursing home , a neighbor whose husband was slain and sick family members .
" He has always been a caring , nonviolent person , " said his mother , Cindy Ratley .
" He 'd give you the shirt off his back . "
Cindy Ratley said it had been her dream to have her close - knit family living together on her secluded 20 acres .
Witnesses for Ratley tried in court to give a picture of the son , grandson , and friend they said he had always been , with the defense calling the murder a " single , horrible snapshot " in Ratley 's overwhelmingly positive life .
They urged the jury to give Ratley 's son a chance to know his father , one who cares and loves deeply for him , they said .
As his mother and others left the witness stand in the packed and divided courtroom , they each told Ratley they stood behind him and loved him .
As they walked back to sit down , many mouthed , " I love you . "
The prosecutors argued Ratley 's character could n't be clearer , based on his actions .
" Unfortunately , the best example we have of his character is in what he did .
This shows his best character , " de la Rionda said , showing the jurors gruesome photos of Effie Ratley 's injuries .
De la Rionda disputed the description of Ratley as a wonderful father .
" This loving father had no problem whatsoever -- a short distance from his son -- exterminating the life of his son's mother , " he said .
Michael Ratley met Effie Williams when she was having car trouble .
He offered to buy a new tire for her and change it .
Effie Ratley , who enjoyed listening to '50s music and watching black - and - white movies , was thrilled when she and her husband had their baby , her family told the court Tuesday .
" Her son was her pride and joy , " said her stepmother , Joy Williams , wearing a purple and pink " Justice for Effie " bracelet .
" But she never knew more than six weeks of her motherhood dreams . "
By all accounts , the Ratleys ' relationship had its rocky points .
They were married , separated and remarried .
Michael Ratley 's family said that the first time the couple got married , they were worried he was n't mature enough , that he needed to grow up , and they said the couple definitely had growing pains .
" He did n't know if he could love her enough , because he only wanted the best for her , " Donna Stanley said , talking about her nephew .
Effie Ratley 's father , Duane Williams , cried on the stand Tuesday as he talked about his only daughter .
His voice quivered as he tried to explain how he feels her loss each day .
" She 's the first thing I think about in the morning when I wake up , " he said , his voice wavering .
" And the last thing before I go to bed . "
Neither Effie or Michael Ratley 's families wanted to speak about the sentencing after the hearing , but de la Rionda said Effie 's family was pleased with the result .
" They were always hoping for [ the ] death [ penalty ] , but they 're happy he 's going to get life and he's not going to be able to get out , " de le Rionda said .
" He 's going to die in prison . "
While the announcement of the sentence , which spared him from death , was greeted with a pronounced " Yes ! " from Michael Ratley 's family inside court , the gravity of the situation seemed to hit during a short recess .
His grandmother began sobbing .
Family members comforted her until Cindy Ratley sat down next to her .
The two cried and embraced for a couple of minutes .
Michael Ratley looked over , saw his grandmother upset , and he , too , began to cry .

This trailer for Neill Blomkamp ’s District 9 is a little more action packed then I was expecting , but it ’s also interesting as hell .
Especially since after watching it , I ’m not really sure what level of hostility the aliens have for humans .
I have my fingers crossed that it does n’t turn into a cut - and - paste “ us versus them ” movie , and based on the early marketing campaign , I think I have nothing to fear .
The effects are stunning , the designs are gritty and realistic ( but still cool ) and the style seems to walk that thin line between ultra-real and cinematic very effectively .
This is quickly climbing my “ must - see ” list .
Here is the trailer , courtesy of Yahoo , embed via Slashfilm .
And a thanks to Jon Gretar below who points out that this feature is based on Blomkamp ’s short film Alive in Joberg , embedded below for your viewing pleasure .

Wrong .
It is perfectly legal to drive barefoot or in flip - flops .

If you do I recommend you take them off and drive barefoot and move them as far away from the pedals as possible References : http://www.barefooters.org/

AIDS campaigners and human rights groups have accused the Cambodian Government of herding HIV - affected families into an ‘‘ AIDS colony ’’ outside the capital , Phnom Penh .
In an open letter to the Prime Minister , Hun Sen , and the Health Minister , Mam Bun Heng , more than 100 international and domestic groups said they were deeply disturbed by the ‘‘ life - threatening ’’ conditions at the settlement .
Forty families were forced to live in sheds without running water or proper sanitation , they said .
The Government has spent the past two months moving people with HIV / AIDS from the Borei Keila district of Phnom Penh to Tuol Sambo , a flood - prone area 25 kilometres away .
‘‘ By bundling people living with HIV together in second - rate housing , far from medical facilities , support services and jobs , the Government has created a de facto AIDS colony , ’’ said Shiba Phurailatpam , of People Living with HIV / AIDS .
Rebecca Schleifer , for Human Rights Watch , said conditions at Tuol Sambo posed serious risks : ‘‘ People living with HIV have compromised immune systems and are especially vulnerable .
For them , these substandard conditions can mean a death sentence or a ticket to a hospital . ’’
Doctors Without Borders said conditions at Tuol Sambo did not meet minimum international standards .
Last year , according to UNAIDS , 67,200 adults and 3800 children in Cambodia were living with HIV / AIDS .

Vancouver - based startup General Fusion has been running around claiming they can build a nuclear fusion reactor in the next 10 years for under a billion dollars .
And some anonymous futurists just gave them 9 million dollars for their troubles .
Advertisement
Seeing that current nuclear fusion projects are expected to cost around 14 billion dollars ( ITER project ) and take 20 years to complete , General Fusion 's reactor would indeed come at a bargain price .
But how can they make this so cheap , and what makes them so confident they 'll succeed ?
Well currently , the aforementioned ITER project is attempting to use astronomically expensive , superconducting tokamak magnets to keep superheated plasma in its place for a fusion reaction , while the National Ignition Facility is trying to use lasers to compress plasma into a reaction .
Advertisement
General Fusions wants to create a reaction using a mechanical process where 220 pneumatic pistons push acoustic waves through a sphere filled with liquid lithium and lead into a plasma ring in the center .
With 220 of these waves coming in at 100 meters per second , scientists hope that it will compress the plasma into a fusion reaction .
And since the majority of the tech consists of long - established machinery , costs will be low .
If successful , General Fusion believes they can ultimately create a fusion reactor rated at 100 megawatts , that could potentially power a grid for 500 million dollars .
The most recent contribution of 9 million dollars for General Fusion brings the total funding to 14 million , but they 'll need 37 million more over five years to build a working prototype .
Um , can we pass a collection plate around ?

Advertisement " We wanted it to be a bit more Star Wars or Star Trek but the physics gets in the way , " says John Connolly , chief architect of Nasa 's new Altair Moon Lander .
The spacecraft , part of the US space agency 's Constellation programme , is the vehicle that Nasa hopes will carry man to the surface of the Moon by 2020 .
Despite Mr Connolly 's fantasies about its design , prototypes of the craft bear a striking resemblance to the Eagle lander which carried Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the lunar surface 40 years ago .
" That was an ugly , spidery spacecraft , " he says .
" But the Apollo engineers got a lot of things right . "
Like the Eagle , Altair will be delivered into orbit by a heavy - lift rocket ( the Ares V , currently under development ) and then ferried on towards the Moon by a command module .
And like its predecessor it is a two - stage vehicle : a descent and an ascent stage .
The large descent module - including the fragile looking legs - consists largely of an engine and propellant tanks .
The smaller ascent module - on top of the vehicle - contains the life support systems and the engine required to get the astronauts back to an orbiting module ; another throwback to the Apollo days .
But if it looks like Eagle , that is no surprise .
The Altair team have been poring over the old design blueprints and have even drafted in some of the old Apollo engineers .
" We ask them a lot of questions , " said Mr Connolly .
Even the lander 's name has echoes of the Eagle .
Altair is the brightest star in the constellation Aquila , Latin for Eagle .
Compare the two landers
But there are also key differences .
For starters , the new craft is much larger and is a multi-role vehicle , able to deliver astronauts or cargo to the Moon 's surface .
In a standard mission , it will be able to deliver four astronauts to the lunar surface , compared with the Eagle 's two .
Altair has been designed as a multi-use vehicle
The module acts as living quarters for the crew and features an airlock , meaning that the whole cabin does not need to be depressurised every time an astronaut exits the vehicle .
It also has an additional advantage .
" We talked to the Apollo astronauts and they had a real problem with dust in the cabin , " said Mr Connolly .
" The airlock allows us control the dust - dusty space suits can be kept out of the cabin - and it also allows us to split the crew 's operations . "
In the new lander , for example , two astronauts could remain inside whilst two others explore outside .
The airlock - because of its weight - is left behind on the Moon 's surface with the descent stage when the astronauts are ready to leave .
Other configurations of the new lander allow it to act as a lunar outpost , sustaining a crew for more than six months , or as a cargo truck , shipping more than 14 tonnes of material to the surface .
These option are critical for Nasa 's plans to set up a base on the moon as a staging post for exploration on Mars .
The design margins for Eagle were very thin
John Connolly
All the vehicles use a common descent stage , with different configurations of craft on top depending on the mission .
However , one of the main differences to Eagle is the craft 's ability to land almost anywhere on the lunar surface .
" Apollo was restricted to mid latitudes and broad daylight , " explained Justin Vican , part of a team at the Draper Laboratory in Boston , US , which is developing a new landing system for Altair .
" They could only land under optimal conditions . "
Looking down
The Autonomous precision Landing Hazard Avoidance Technology ( Alhat ) project at Draper Labs - the place where the first Apollo Guidance Computers were designed - aims to overcome these limitations .
" One of the hardest spots to land is somewhere like the South Pole , " said Mr Vican .
" Odds are you are going to be landing in total darkness . "
Alhat will basically allow the astronauts to see in the dark .
The physics of spaceflight determines the shape of the lunar landers
It will use a suite of sensors and technologies such as a flash Lidar ( Light Detection and Ranging )
" It 's like a sonar but with light , " explained Mr Vican .
The system gives the astronauts very high resolution topographical images of the surface .
" From space you can see the big obstacles .
The real danger is if you land on a rock three feet high . "
The team behind Alhat aim to have a system that can detect objects " about the size of a basketball " along with steep or cratered terrain .
When the system picks up a hazard , it warns the pilot and allows them to choose a new and precise landing spot on the fly .
It is an example of how technology is reducing the risk of space flight .
" The design margins for Eagle were very thin , " said Mr Connolly .
" Altair should be safer . "
The spacecraft is currently on its third design , but Mr Connolly says there will be likely be a " dozen more " before it is set in stone and the blueprints turned over to an industrial partner to construct .
However , there is still a question whether it will get that far .
Currently , the Obama administration is undertaking a review of Nasa 's manned space activities .
The Augustine review , as it is known , is due to report back in August .
" Nasa is playing its part [ in the review ] , " he says .
" We feel good .
If there is an option of going to the Moon , we will need a lander . "
And if it does get the go - ahead , does he think a new era of manned lunar exploration will capture people 's imaginations in the same way as Apollo ?

A s two of Canada 's biggest Internet service providers , Bell Canada and Rogers Communications are fierce rivals that frequently battle for the same customers .
That marketplace fight rarely spills into the courtroom , yet last month a Rogers advertising campaign prompted Bell to file a $ 50 million dollar lawsuit .
The result was an end to the campaign and evidence both companies over - promise the speed of their Internet services .
The case began when Rogers launched a direct mail and Internet ad campaign called " Check Your Speed . "
The campaign warned users the Internet services " you are paying for may not be what you 're getting " and encouraged them to test their connection with an independent third party .
The campaign unsurprisingly offered Rogers services as an alternative .
Bell filed suit , arguing in court documents that the campaign contained violations of the Trade - Mark Act , Competition Act .
The company sought $ 50 million in general damages , $ 1 million in punitive damages , and an injunction blocking Rogers from continuing with its campaign .
Two days later , Rogers dropped the third - party testing feature .
Rather than using a fully independent third - party service , Rogers had used a server located in Seattle to run its tests .
The court found that the distance between users in Ontario and the speed test server in Washington might help account for slower speeds .
Even more telling was the evidence that placed the spotlight on a Canadian industry practice of advertising the maximum or " up to " speeds for customers , rather than minimum or actual speeds that customers typically obtain .
The Rogers campaign was effectively premised on this discrepancy since it encouraged users to check their speeds where they would undoubtedly learn their typical speeds were lower than those promised by their ISP .
The same holds true for Rogers , however .
Under cross-examination , a Rogers witness was asked about the Rogers service : " if he [ the customer ] runs the test , and it tells him that his Internet connection speed is less than 10 megabits per second , is he still getting the Internet speed he 's paying for ? "
The response ?
The Internet speed he 's paying for is " up to , " as is industry practice .
This practice deserves far closer scrutiny from the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission .
It is time for Canadian regulators to conduct their own tests on promised speeds and establish requirements that bring truth back to ISP advertising .

Most hockey color commentators will try to convince us that scoring the first goal of a game is crucial to getting the eventual win .
Of course , a team can't win unless they score at least one goal , so they do have a point ; but does it have to be the first one ?
In the first three games of this year 's Stanley Cup Finals , the team that scored first went on to ... lose .
Statistically , there must be some way to either confirm or debunk this theory .
Once again , Canadian researchers come to our rescue with a new analysis that predicts the probability of a win when scoring first .
Compared to other sports , hockey goals are rare , with an average of less than six total goals per game .
Goals are also somewhat random with no real pattern in time as to when they are scored .
Finally , they are what statisticians call " memoryless , " meaning their probability of occurring is not tied to a previous event ( like an extra point in football depending first on a touchdown or the number of runs scored from a home run depending on the number of base runners ) .
These three properties , being rare , random and memoryless , allow hockey goal scoring to be analyzed using a statistical concept called a Poisson distribution .
Jack Brimberg and Bill Hurley , both professors of operations research at the Royal Military College of Canada , used the Poisson assumption to see if there was any truth to the first goal advantage .
In the current edition of the International Journal of Operational Research , they show how the probability of winning a game after scoring the first goal will change during the course of the game .
The Poisson theory assumes that there are , typically , a maximum number of total goals per game and that they are equally distributed throughout the three periods .
So , if the first goal does not come until later , then the chances of the tying and lead changing goals by the other team decrease .
Making the huge assumption that the teams are evenly matched , the probability of winning at the opening face - off is 50 percent for each team .
Brimberg and Hurley 's model showed that if , say , Pittsburgh scored first in the opening five minutes of the game then their odds of winning jump up to 70 percent .
If the first goal comes close to the end of the second period , the win probability cranks up to 80 percent .
Other researchers question whether the game of hockey is that simple .
Andrew Thomas of Harvard University looked at four seasons of NHL data to see if the 25,000 + goals scored were evenly distributed throughout the games .
He found they were , except for a few nuances of hockey , like fewer are scored in the first few minutes of each period and significantly more are scored at the end of the third period .
These end - of - game scenarios are mostly due to teams pulling their goalie if they are losing by one or two goals .
This creates increased scoring chances for both teams .
He concluded that the Poisson distribution works for most of the game .
If the score is tied late in the third period , commentators will claim that it is just like sudden death overtime , where the next goal should win the game .
Brimberg and Hurley confirmed this by showing that if the go - ahead goal is scored in the last five minutes of the game , that team has a 95 percent chance of getting the victory .
Overall , the first goal logic seems to have some truth to it .
Now , if we can just convince the Penguins and Red Wings to obey the laws of statistics .

The way people with autism see and process the body language of others could be preventing them from gauging people 's feelings , according to new research .
With around half a million people in the UK affected by autism , the Durham University study suggests visual processing problems could be contributing to their day - to - day difficulties with social interaction .
The research showed that adults with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) found it difficult to identify emotions , such as anger or happiness , from short video clips of body movements without seeing faces or hearing sound .
Those adults who struggled most with this task also performed poorly when asked to detect the direction in which a group of dots moved coherently on a screen , thought to be due to visual processing problems .
People with autism often have difficulty in attributing mental states to others and this is thought to be one of the main causes of their struggle to know how other people feel .
The Durham study , published in the academic journal Neuropsychologia , suggests visual processing problems may also be a contributing factor .
The findings of the study indicate that one of these visual processing problems is a difficulty in perceiving certain sorts of motion , particularly the movement of spatially separate elements spread over a relatively wide area that nevertheless move in the same direction , which is consistent with most previous findings .
The strong link between performances on the tests within the study suggests people with autism have trouble reading body movements because they process some basic visual information differently , according to Dr Anthony Atkinson from Durham University 's Psychology Department .
The typically developing adults – those without autism - in the study generally performed well in both tests .
Dr Atkinson , who led the study , says his findings help to further understand the underlying causes of social interaction problems experienced by people with autism .
Dr Atkinson said : " The way people move their bodies tells us a lot about their feelings or intentions , and we use this information on a daily basis to communicate with each other .
We use others ' body movements and postures , as well as people 's faces and voices , to gauge their feelings .
People with autism are less able to use these cues to make accurate judgements about how others are feeling .
Our research attempts to find out why .
" Our findings point to a difficulty in perceiving or attending to motion as a contributor to the problem of gauging people 's emotions .
We now need to look further to see how exactly this happens and how this may combine with potential difficulties in attention . "
Thirteen adults with ASD and 16 typically developing adults with the same age and IQ were studied .
For the motion coherence test , participants were shown a number of dots on a computer screen with a certain number moving either left or right .
The test had various difficulty levels depending on the percentage of dots moving coherently in one direction .
This task taps one 's ability to see the moving wood as distinct from the individual moving trees , says the author .
For the second test , the study participants were shown two sets of short video clips of people 's body movements and had to identify the emotion expressed by those movements .
In one set of video clips the whole body and head but not the face could be seen .
The other set contained identical sequences of body movements but all that could be seen was reflective patches attached to the major joints .
Based on gestures and movements acted out in the videos , such as waving fists , stamping feet , and skipping , the study participants were asked to assign one of the basic human emotions to it : anger , disgust , sadness , fear or happiness .
The individuals with autism were less accurate than the typically developing individuals in judging the emotions in both sets of video clips .
Dr Gina Gómez De La Cuesta , Action Research Leader at the National Autistic Society said : " This is an interesting study which supports the suggestion that people with autism may well process visual information differently to their peers .
" We warmly welcome all research which helps us further our understanding of autism , and how best to help and support those with the condition .
Autism is a complex and lifelong disability , affecting an estimated half a million people in the UK , and the right support at the right time can make a huge difference to people 's lives . "
Some facts and figures ( source : The National Autistic Society )
Autism is thought to affect around half a million people in the UK today – that means 1 out of every 100 people has autism .
Autism is a lifelong developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with , and relates to , other people .
It also affects how they make sense of the world around them .
It is a spectrum condition , which means that , while all people with autism share certain difficulties , their condition will affect them in different ways .
Boys are four times more likely to develop autism than girls .
People with autism often want to make friends but due to their disability find it difficult .
40 % of all children with autism wait more than three years for a clear diagnosis .

JEWISH MAFIA
When we refer to the Jewish mafia , we are not pointing to religion .
We deem religion in this discussion largely as a contributory although not necessary variable to qualify a Jewish individual as a member of the Jewish mafia .
Note that we do not believe practice of Judaism to be a significant factor to qualify one to be a member of the Jewish mafia because the aspects of tribalism that come from Judaism are infused into Jewish youths .
As adults many choose to not practice Judaism but all Jews maintain an intense sense of tribalism .
When we refer to the Jewish mafia we are referring to the unique form of tribalism practiced by Jewish people .
This tribalism is the most extreme in the world and is rooted in both the Jewish culture and Judaism .
It 's important to understand that most Jewish people actually do not practice Judaism .
A large percentage of Jewish individuals are either agnostic or atheists , while a significant portion practices Christianity .
We have no religious interests whatsoever other than elements that intersect with the cultural aspects of those who practice a given religion .
We hold the view that all religions were created as a means to control large populations .
Thus , we are not concerned with variations of different religions .
So what is the Jewish mafia ?
The Jewish mafia primarily comprises Jewish individuals , some of which are religious while others are not .
We believe the main objective of the Jewish mafia is to enrich the lives of Jews by any means necessary .
In addition to a wide range of criminal activities , the Jewish mafia has been able to create , remove and alter laws that enable them to game the system in a way that makes it difficult for their criminal activities to be discovered .
At the same time , the Jewish mafia controls the judicial and legal system of the west enabling tribe members to escape prosecution .
Finally , the Jewish mafia invariably behaves in a highly discriminatory manner against all gentiles in matters of business , commerce and finance in order to benefit their own interests as well as that of Jewish people .
A comprehensive definition of the Jewish mafia is beyond the scope of this discussion but we will provide a very brief overview .
If a Jewish individual holds a prominent position in an industry that is dominated by the Jewish mafia we consider such individuals as members of the Jewish mafia .
The media is a good example of this .
In this instance we include only those individuals who work as producers , editors , directors and talking heads of the media .
However , there are some gentiles that we include as members of the Jewish mafia .
In all cases , the gentiles included in the Jewish mafia are very influential and wealthy and are intermingled with Jewish interests through business and finance .
Money rules these gentiles which is why they fail to see how they are damaging humanity , or else do not care that their greedy endeavors have created many grave consequences for the world .
Although the most obvious qualification a Jew must possess to be a member of the Jewish mafia is a high status in business , finance , politics or high standing in any other field of influence , we consider any Jewish individual who serves as an apologist or denialist of the facts surrounding the actions and consequences of the Jewish mafia to also be a member .
" There are two sorts of wealth - getting , as I have said ; one is a part of household management , the other is retail trade : the former necessary and honorable , while that which consists in exchange is justly censured ; for it is unnatural , and a mode by which men gain from one another .
The most hated sort , and with the greatest reason , is usury , which makes a gain out of money itself , and not from the natural object of it .
For money was intended to be used in exchange , but not to increase at interest .
And this term interest , which means the birth of money from money , is applied to the breeding of money because the offspring resembles the parent .
Wherefore of modes of getting wealth this is the most unnatural . "
- Politics , Aristotle , 350 B.C .
" The Jew alone regards his race as superior to humanity , and looks forward not to its ultimate union with other races , but to its triumph over them all and to its final ascendancy under the leadership of a tribal Messiah . "
- Goldwin Smith , The Jewish Question , October 1881
“ I am a most unhappy man .
I have unwittingly ruined my country .
A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit .
Our system of credit is concentrated .
The growth of the nation , therefore , and all our activities are in the hands of a few men .
We have come to be one of the worst ruled , one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world .
No longer a government by free opinion , no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority , but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men . ”
- President Woodrow Wilson 1916
“ We are grateful to the Washington Post , The New York Times , Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years .
It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years .
But , the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government .
The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto - determination practiced in past centuries . ”
- David Rockefeller , Baden - Baden , Germany 1991
“ It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system , for if they did , I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning . ”
- Henry Ford
“ The real truth of the matter is , as you and I know , that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the Government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson . ”
- Franklin D. Roosevelt , letter to Col. House , November 21 , l933
“ One of the least understood strategies of the world revolution now moving rapidly toward its goal is the use of mind control as a major means of obtaining the consent of the people who will be subjects of the New World Order . ”
- The National Educator , K.M. Heaton
" We Jews , we , the destroyers , will remain the destroyers for ever .
Nothing that you will do will meet our needs and demands .
We will for ever destroy because we need a world of our own , a God - world , which it is not in your nature to build . "
- Maurice Samuels , You Gentiles , 1924
“ We are on the verge of a global transformation .
All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . ”
- David Rockefeller
“ Today , America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order .
Tomorrow they will be grateful !
This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond , whether real or promulgated , that threatened our very existence .
It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil .
The one thing every man fears is the unknown .
When presented with this scenario , individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well - being granted to them by the World Government . ”
- Dr. Henry Kissinger , Bilderberger Conference , Evians , France , 1991
At every opportunity Jewish shills try to mask the Jewish mafia by spreading disinfo and distractions such as " the Jesuits are behind the New World Order . "
Of course this is comical .
I 'm going to reveal something I 've known for many years .
The Catholic church has been powerless for several decades .
This is a fact .
The final blow to the Catholic church occurred when molestation lawsuits began to surface about three decades ago .
The church has been in severe financial trouble since then .
This is in fact how the Jewish mafia seized the final arm of control over the church , using its banks to finance the enormous financial awards for thousands of cases of sexual deviancy from Catholic priests .
But let 's not forget that the world was a much different place when the Catholic Church actually had real power .
Back then there were no banks or mass media .
Remember that the Catholic Church was against Usury .
But because the Catholic church was powerful prior to the emergence of banks and mass media , it is a well - known fact that the church had already been infiltrated by Jews .
They are referred to as marano Jews .
Trivia
The International Brigades of the Spanish Civil War were foreign volunteers who flocked to the conflict between 1936 - 9 , thousands fighting for the left - wing Republicans with smaller numbers joining the right - wing Nationalists .
The motivations for the volunteers was diverse , some seeing the conflict as a battle between democracy and tyranny , others between Communism and Fascism .
So many Americans joined the Republicans they were able to form their own unit , the ' Abraham Lincoln Brigade ' .
Different factions of the IRA ( Irish Republican Army ) fought for both sides whilst their enemies the UVF ( Ulster Volunteer Force ) sent men and arms to aid the Republicans ( George Nathan , one of the International Brigade 's greatest heroes was an ex-Black and Tan who had served in the Irish Troubles of 1919 - 21 and now found himself fighting alongside his former enemies ) .
The Soviet Union provided some military support for the Republicans but this was dwarfed by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy who not only sent massive military aid to the Nationalists but dispatched the ' Condor Legion ' of German warplanes manned by Luftwaffe crews .
Numerous famous figures took part in the conflict , most notably author George Orwell who fought on the Catalonian front , film star Errol Flynn who worked as a reporter as did famous spy Kim Philby .

WORLD FOOD : AN ANALYSIS OF IMMINENT ISSUES ON THE WORLD’S FOOD SUPPLY
I. Introduction
There are millions of individuals living in the world to date .
Along with the problem of space , the task of feeding this multitude is also one of the greatest problems that world leaders are facing today .
Questions as to whether the supply of food is directly proportional to the number of the public or as to whether the countries are able to produce a sufficient supply of food for their population lingers in the minds of governments and even international organizations .
This study intends to describe the current situation of the world ’s food security and establish certain suggestions that would be able to amend the growing problem of food shortages .
For clarity and coherence of the discussions , the paper is to be divided into three parts .
The first part of the paper will establish the current state of food security in areas all over the world .
A general description of North America , Latin America , Europe , Africa and Asia will be provided .
The second part will be discussing the possible causes of issues on food security .
Issues of urban sprawl and the supply and demand of food stuff are to be discussed in this portion of the paper .
Moreover , the consequent effects such as undernutrition are going to be analyzed along with the attempts of states and governments to rectify this situation through certain policies .
The third part is going to take into consideration the technological attempts to resolve the issues on food supply .
Specifically , the issues on genetically modified organisms will be tackled in this part .
At the end of these discussions , a summation and conclusion will be provided based on the prior arguments held in the paper .
With this conclusion , a set of recommendation will be formulated regarding the views of the researcher on how to rectify these issues on food security .
II .
The World ’s Food Security
Issues on food security have been discussed publicly through academic and scholarly literature .
The succeeding part will be taking into consideration the general description of certain areas of the globe and eventually discuss the food problem that prevails over the said countries .
In a sense , the discussions below shall establish that food problems do exist in a global scale .
A. The North American Experience
North America is composed of Canada and the United States .
The geographical attributes of North America has been characterized as distinctive particularly in its regional environments .
It possesses considerable geographical features such as the periglacial environment , the boreal forests , the Great Lakes , deserts , sea coasts , and the borderlands within the continent . , 2004 ) Though it has apparently presented as a well - preserved environment , the North American landscape was n’t safe from the effects of human interventione ( 2000 ) presented this in his discussions on the effects of agriculture and urbanization in the geography of North America .
In a studyr ( 2004 , 340 ) they noted that one of the basic problems that developed countries like those in the North American region experience is overconsumption .
An artic ( 1991 ) indicated that the major problem of overconsumption is triggered by the compulsion of the American population to consume .
The presence of too much commodities and equally proportioned capacity to purchase these commodities set off this compulsion .
Other elements like advertising , the culture of shopping , government policies , and weak household and community economies also activate this consumption trends in the North American regionng , 1991 ) Results like obesity and other health problems have also emerged as overconsumption took place .
B. The Latin American Experience
Latin America is composed of Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , Columbia , Costa Rica , Ecuador , El Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras , Mexico , Nicaragua , Panama , Paraguay , Peru , Uruguay , and Venezuelaal , 2001 ) It is characterized predominantly varies in climate from tropical , subtropical , and sub-Antarctic .
However , majority of the landscapes in this area are fashioned to cater to common field agriculturer , 2002 , 37 )
It could thus be assumed that cropping and grazing are among the major livelihood in this region .
According to the work on ( 2000 ) economic development in the Latin American region reveals its rather volatile nature .
The performance of the countries on the said region apparently has been erratic from the past decades .
And in the eventful decade of the 1980s , the region has placed its ranking among the third world countries in the current period . , 2000 )
Given the description above , it appears that most of the countries in the Latin American region are classified as developing countries .
One problem in the context of food security in this region is the tendency of such countries to have an urban bias such that they tend to prioritize industrial factors more over agricultural sustenance .
This is manifested in the case of Argentina in 1940 to 1.r , 2004 , 352 ) Being in a region where the soil is rich and the climate is conducive for agriculture , Argentina apparently suffered major problems in food security .
This was triggered by the policy of employing high taxes on agricultural exports .
Some of the consequences were the decline in agriculture employment , slow productivity in the agricultural sector , and losing resources to industrial sector given its preference over the agricultural sector .
Essentially , this made the agricultural production of the country at an all time low , in fact even lower during World War II .
C. Issues in Europe
This region encompasses thirty - nine countriesal , 2001 ) It is connected by the huge Alpine mountain chain including the Pyrenees , the Alps , the Carpathians , the Balkans , and the Caucasus .
Along with this mountainous terrain is the European plain that stretches from France to the Urals .
It is a highly industrialized region along with a highly developed transportation system . , 2001 ) Inland water transportation is also made possible by interconnected river ways and canals .
With its great ports , the said region relies heavily on foreign trading .
Being the embodiment of advanced civilization , Europe has been the central entity that has been looked up to by developing countries .
n , 2004 , 172 ) However , having this prestigious image also entails several connotations .
One that comes to mind is that the said region is able to make use of advanced technology for an earlier period of time as compared to other developing countries .
This means that the mortality rate in the European region has decreased much earlier as compared to regions with developing countries . , 2004 , 136 ) To illustrater ( 2004 ) made a comparison on Sweden and Mexico , with the former representing developed countries and the latter representing developing ones .
They indicated that the death rate in the European country significantly lessened in the early parts of the 1800 , over a century before the decline in Mexico ever took place .
This means that European countries had more mouths to feed as compared to their North American counterparts .
This shows that in European countries , an issue of food security rests not on the number of people but the availability of food .
The proportion between food supply and the number of population is significantly skewed against the entry on food thus establishing the recurring problem of food security .
D. Africa and its Surrounding Countries
There are over forty countries that are under the Sub - Saharan region of Africa .
Majority of the nations here are landlocked territories characterized by arid to semi-arid climate . , 2001 ) Given the said description , it is not surprising that there are limited number of arable land and fresh water sources .
International organizations have constantly urged Sub -Saharan region to open up its market .
However , the Sub - Saharan African market has constantly been open since the 16th century .
( 2003 , 389 ) It has been characterized as a marginal player in international trade .
It is similarly accountable for 2 % of the entire import exports in the international setting.r , 2003 , 389 ) In a 1995 data , the population of Sub - Saharan Africa tipped over five hundred million .
Of this number , over two hundred million were said to be under the poverty line . ( , 2002 , 10 ) To add to this predicament is the pandemic brought about by HIV and AIDS .
By the end of 1999 , over 22 million of the population is infected .
( 2002 , 12 )
One of the most affected areas with regards to the food problem , Africa ’s growing population is among the more major reasons for their food issues .
Accordingr ( 2004 , 136 ) , the population of Africa grows at a rate of 2.35 % annually as seen in the statistics during 1995 to 2000 .
This means that with the seemingly dearth supply of food in the said region , the issue on allocation is also an issue considering the enormous number of mouths to feed .
Another issue in the said country is the low - income growth .
( p168 ) Specifically , countries in Sub -Saharan Africa indicate a negative growth in the annual growth rate of per capita income from 1975 - 2000.r ( 2004 ) added that the region ’s yields in wheat , rice and maize in 1961 - 2001 were the lowest in growth as compared to the other areas of the world .
Added to this predicament is the constant drought that has been occurring because of the climate of the region .
To illustrate , countries like Zimbabwe ( p73 ) have constantly suffered and even succumbed to the perils of drought .
Such effects of drought include massive food shortages and even famine if the state does not impose the appropriate policies to deal with the said problem .
This problem is so prevalent in the said region that countries like Malawi and Zambia even have what they coined as hungry seasons .
( p82 )
E. Asian Problems
In Central Asia , Majority of the countries are landlocked with rugged mountain terrains and plains in Afghanistan and deserts in some parts of China.l , 2001 ) .
South Asia on the other hand , is isolated from the rest of Asia by mountain ranges surrounding the countries .
Moreover , though some of the countries are landlocked , some parts of the religion are separated by the sea .
Countries like Japan and Taiwan are detached from the regional , 2001 ) This region is one of the most illustrious in Asia in terms of its industrial sector .
With major trading partners present in the United States , Germany , and Singapore , the imports and export industries are among the primary source of income for the countries.al , 2001 ) With 10 countries characterized as developing nations , with the exception of Brunei , Southeast Asia is largely composed of archipelagoes .
The region is thus separated by huge masses of water of the Pacific Oceanal , 2001 ) This means that these countries are susceptible to constant storms and typhoons .
Moreover , they are near the Pacific Belt of Fire which makes earthquakes frequent to the region .
However , Countries like Laos and Vietnam have almost half of their population below the poverty lineal , ( 2001 ) However , other countries are still marred by chronic unemployment and high population rates .
In the case of Asia , the region is well endowed with arable lands and even a better climate for agriculture .
In fact , most of the countries in the said region are more dependent on agriculture decades before the concept of modern globalization has been introduced .
In the said region , given the resources for sustaining food security is available , countries are still not safe from the perils of famine and food shortages .
To illustrate , China and North Korea recently succumbed to one of the worst famines that the world has ever seen in known history.r , 2004 , 15 , 18 ) Based on what the authors discussed , the cause of famine is basically triggered by the leadership of the said countries .
Poor policies as well as really radical attempts for change have triggered over thirty million individuals dying in China .
( p17 )
In the case of the North Korean famine , the political affiliations of the said country have been the major indicator on the rise of the problem .
When the disintegration of the Soviet Union took place , the North Korean ties with the said superpower similarly went down the drain .
With North Korea making weapons and ballistics merchandise as well as fertilizer for the former Soviet Union , agricultural lands were not sufficient , when the USSR called it quits .
r ( 2004 ) even indicated that the policies on agriculture similarly took a toll on the famine that took place in North Korea .
Specifically , the laws imposed on farmers prompted them to hide considerable amounts of crops to themselves .
They use these stashed away crops for personal consumption or they peddle it on their own for their own profit .
This means that the laws imposed on the said farmers are so strict that they have to resort to stealing from their own harvest just to have food on their plates .
III .
Geography and Food Shortage
In this current day and age , the concept of development has spawned several models and theories from academics and scholars alike .
However , the determinant of development ceases to be solely measured by the economic performance of a state .
The living conditions and the standard of living of every individual and families alike are seen as similar indicators of development .
Countries have long been in pursuit of economic development .
Take for example a study made in Taiwan revealed that data showing economic growth ; population and employment growth rates ; consumer prices ; economic structures of agriculture , industry , service ; and foreign trade were among the information used to measure economic development .
2000 , 1723 ) However , not all states have the capacity to balance out these elements .
In some instances , the situation and consequent demands of globalization and competition becomes too intense that it overwhelms the stang ( 1999 , 103 ) claimed that a true type of development are hugely affected by the policies that government make and consequently implement .
On this part of the paper , the possible causes of the problems of food security are going to be tackled : urban sprawl and inequality in the supply and demand of food .
Moreover , the resulting issues of malnutrition and the policies that deals with the situation
A. The Issue of Urban Sprawl
The movement of people from the rural to the urban parts of the state has been a lingering occurrence in nations .
This movement of internal migration among the population has triggered a considerable effect not only on space but also in the supply of food .
The initial problem of space basically triggers the main predicament of food security in a specific state .
Given that space is required among cities as the population boost brought about by the rural - urban migration , there is the tendency for these urban areas to expand its borders towards the rural areas .
This condition denotes what is considered as urban sprawl .
( 2001 , 15 ) If this condition is not controlled through policies of the state , then the growth of the urban areas will eventually eat out the areas in the rural lands that are reserved for agricultural purposes .
However , this condition of urban sprawl is triggered by a similar occurrence especially in developing countries .
r ( 2004 , 359 ) indicated in their work that the emergence of an ideology of urban bias may have induced the internal migration and triggered the weakening of the agricultural sector .
They noted that this partiality towards the urban areas , especially in the developing countries , is triggered by policies that raises the price of industrial products and lowers the price of agricultural products .
This means that these policies are made to encourage activities from the industrial sector .
With a subsequent surge in the verve of the industrial sector , states become more appealing to investors in building up factories and plants so as to expand their business .
This concentration of these resources in the urban areas not only triggers urban sprawl but also stunts the development of the state ’s agricultural sector .
The problem is that in developing countries , the effectiveness of this course of action is probably outweighed by its costs .
In countries with urban bias , Disproportionate levy of agricultural products and the allotment of spending supportive of urban districts are instruments employed by states to realize this purpose .
Therefore , agriculture - motivated growth over industry and restructuring the provision of social services are all updated by the principle that the state ’s urban sector has drawn off resources clear of rural regions and at the same time falling short of rousing general development .
Even though rural areas , agricultural lands especially , undergone grave desertion under development policies made by the state , proof from certain states has revealed that poverty is not merely a rural predicament ; without a doubt , urban poverty has been growing swiftly .
This means that the bias and the subsequent sprawl essentially trigger the spread of poverty among the urban dwellers .
Moreover , poverty has transferred from rural to urban districts and that this progression of urbanizing poverty came before the beginning of aid programs coming from international organizations .
B. Supply and Demand of Food
One other predicament that the world is now experiencing is the issue of the demand and supply of food .
Malthus contended that since populations is continuously growing in epic proportions and food resources does not develop in the same exponential fashion , that there would be reduced returns in salaries and living standards among people .
He added that the influence of population is indefinitely superior to the capability in the earth to bring into being subsistence for humankind ( 2004 , 129 ) .
And based on the current situation of the world ’s food security and food supply , mankind has greatly exceeded the Malthus prophecy .
Though it is undoubtedly possible that the planet is capable of housing as much people as it could , there is a considerable drawback when survival comes into play .
Population densities influence the quantity of food that is needed by a person .
In the same way this population could as well make limitations on the access of such resources for every person .
( 2005 , 78 ) This is especially true for developing countries and less developed countries where issues on self - sufficiency are present .
It is these countries ’ economies that could not sustain their own food production to compensate for their own subsistence levels .
( 2004 , 339 )
The connection involving population and the available amount of food is one of the more pressing issues today .
Especially on account of the more underprivileged countries whose economy are not able to resort to importation to solve this supply issue on food .
Food security is thus similarly has its economic personality .
Assuming that there are indeed enough food products that could feed the world , it still does not eradicate the issue of accessibility of these products .
It is turning out to be increasingly understandable that the predicament originates not as much from a crisis with the density of the individuals in the context of space .
The problem rests on the density of populations in the context of food access .
In this sense , the access of food in the context of developing and less developed countries is the basic problem that concerns the world food problem .
In the workster ( 2004 ) indicated that the number of undernourished individuals have reduced in number from 906 million in the 1980s to 800 million in the later part of the 1990s .
However , there is still the issue that the present pattern of undernutrition and food shortage is disparate to food accessibility , but is in its place a utility of global entitlements to food .
Domestic deficits on food are not triggered by physical deficiencies .
Availability of food is the same with the access to food .
This means that it is not just collective food supply but in the same way its allocation that establishes the occurrence of hunger and undernutrition in any part of the globe .
As Leathers and Foster ( 2004 , 9 ) indicated the occurrence of severe food shortages in certain states are basically brought about by poor policy response from the government .
Thus , the government ’s awareness on the imminent occurrence of such shortages and knowing the appropriate courses of action are the key to solving the problem on food .
C. International Undernutrition
In an alarming turn of events , the crisis in the food supply and access to food supply brought about one major implication to the modern world .
It triggered the prevalence of undernutrition , a health problem set off by insufficient sustenance and even starvation .
One sad thing about this problem is that majority of those suffering are in the younger generations .
Children often are the casualties with illnesses as diarrhea , measles and pneumonia , all of which are related to the individual ’s undernutrition .
a , 2004 , 802 ) And according to the said study of Potera ( 2004 ) most of those undernourished who suffer from these illnesses more often than not are subject to the possibility of death .
This is supported by the Leathers and Foster ( 2004 , 64 ) indicating that intestinal disorders , diarrhea , pneumonia , influenza , bronchitis , whooping cough and measles as among the major illnesses that causes child mortality .
All of the said illnesses are associated with undernutrition .
Unfortunately , most of these high rates of child mortality are present in developing countries .
In the work ofr ( 2004 , 63 ) there are several implications of undernutrition .
One of these implications is that undernourished mothers give birth to undernourished children .
This presents the newly born child to the possibly of death within its first year .
More likely these babies are born underweight .
As the study oer ( 2004 , 63 ) claimed , most of these underweight babies are forty times more likely to succumb to death as compared to babies born within the acceptable weight .
This shows that the most striking implication of undernutrition is unmistakably death .
What is more arresting is that majority of the deaths are often placed as a notch in child mortality raster , 2004 , 64 ) However , the remaining percentage of those who have survived their earlier years being undernourished , there are more hurdles that they are to encounter in their later years .
As stated in the work or ( 2004 , 67 ) undernourished children are faced with the likelihood of reduced intellectual capacity and cognitive functioning .
This shows that the mental development of the child also suffers when he / she is undernourished .
One possible effect of this is iodine deficiency among children .
( p69 )
It has been known that children suffering from lack of sufficient iodine have an intellectual quotient that is 13.5 point lesser than normal children .
All in all , the access to nutrition and food supply seems to have a considerable effect on the consequent lives of the child .
Undernutrition , in essence , gives the child a disadvantage even before he / she learns to walk .
A child ’s health may well indicate as to whether the child will be able to learn to write or read in time , meaning keep up with the normal child .
Unless these individuals are given help by a being much larger than they are , then all their endeavors are likely to fail .
The succeeding discussions are going to present some of the policies that states have ratified to deal with this major problem of undernutrition .
D. Policies Ratified to Deal with these Issues
As stated in the earlier parts of the paper , policies of the government do great contribution to solving the food problem in individual states .
One such measure is reflected in the policies regarding agriculture productivity .
In such an area , the land reform programs of countries often come to mind .
According to Leathers and Foster ( 2004 , 292 ) this land reform programs are essentially characterized by the redistribution of land basically for purposes of agriculture .
The said authors noted several instances where land is redistributed as farmlands .
One such instance is the distribution of the US military government of lands in Japan right after the Second World War .
This served as the first steps in reconstructing the Japanese agriculture in the post - war period .
Another instance is reflected in the distribution of land in Algeria in 1962 .
The act nationalized the lands which were owned predominantly by French colonists and eventually redistributed into small parts to numerous farmers in the said country .
All in all , the move towards land reform among countries is basically to meet a requirement of wealth redistribution and to increase the productivity of agricultural lands within the territory .
( p295 )
Another policy that has been implemented by numerous states is regarding consumption .
In the study of Leather and Foster ( 2004 , 340 ) there are two kinds of consumption that triggers the food problem of the world : overconsumption and underconsumption .
In the case of overconsumption , it is normally prevalent in developed countries .
In countries like the United States , their average daily calories consumption is considerably higher than their counterparts in the rest of the globe .
Leather and Foster ( 2004 , 340 ) claimed that solving such problem as food problem caused by overconsumption is to induce levies and taxes on food produces .
Even though they claim that it would be impossible in practical and political terms , imposing such duties on food items will actually reduce a state ’s overconsumption .
On the other hand , the case of underconsumption relates to the situation in developing countries .
This case is more related to the context of undernutrition , however the issue of overconsumption in developed countries is also closely related to the rectifying the issue of underconsumption in developing countries .
Leathers and Foster ( 2004 , 340 ) coined this policy solution for underconsumption and overconsumption as the “ redistribution solution . ”
This is basically the attempt of developed countries to help developing counties to gain access to food products through the export of goods .
It serves as an aid to these developing countries because these goods are priced in such a way that countries could considerably afford the cost of buying such food products .
As stated in the earlier parts of the study , one of the key to remedying the problem of food shortage is basically to give access to these products .
However , this also entails certain actions from the developing countries and a strong political will so as to create policies that will result to controlling , if not the eradication of the food problem .
Population growth is also considered one of the major causes of food shortage .
Leathers and Foster ( 2004 , 393 ) noted some of the possible policies that could deal with this problem .
One course of action is to reduce the rate of population growth .
China took this policy to the extreme when it imposed a one - child policy per couple .
( Mills and Nagel , 1993 , xiii )
This policy was taken as a means to combat the strain on the resources of China as much as a mechanism for population control .
On the whole the consumers of China ’s resources are significantly reduced because of this policy .
Another policy that deals with population growth and the available resources is to invest in improved agricultural productivity .
In the case of Russia , the policies ratified by the state have been implemented such that the crop yield of the country was able to considerably at par with the global scene .
( Arnade and Trueblood , 2001 , 59 ) A third policy option is to protect the soil and water resources of the state .
In England and Wales , the system of irrigation and management of the water systems are now covered by the geographic information system ( GIS ) technologies .
( Knox and Weatherfield , 1999 , 90 ) This technology allows the government and its relevant authorities to monitor the flow and use of such resources .
Moreover , Leathers and Foster ( 2004 , 393 ) added that all these policies should also be complementary with the state ’s economy such that it encourages economic growth in general .
IV .
Technology ’s Response to the Problem
In the past years , technological advances have made the lives of men and women considerably easier and non-complex as compared to centuries before .
The introduction of computerized and automated machines in the forefront of business and commerce have been very influential in maintaining the efficiency of people .
Subsequent innovations such as the miniaturization of formerly bulky technology as well as the immediacy in terms of communication process have allowed the principles of globalization making trading easier as compared to how early merchants tread the seas for commerce .
In the case of food safety , the emergence of new technology has been the advancing the causes of agriculture .
To illustrate , the United States have undergone technological and social - economic structural change in the agriculture sector for several years already .
( Huffman , 1998 , 159 ) As a result , farmers benefit from the scientific breakthroughs to which agriculture is subjected .
Greater yield in terms of agricultural production and a decrease in lost profit because of crop problems such as pests , vermin , and other sickness in food crops are among the results of these advancements .
This part of the study is going to discuss the possible implications of science and technology on responding to the food problem that the world is experiencing .
Basically , the discussions will be surrounding the issue of genetically modified organisms in the development of agriculture .
A general description on the GMO technology would be initially provided and subsequent arguments in favor and against the said technology will ensue .
A. Genetically Modified Organisms ( GMO )
The concept of genetically modified organisms are often used for crops that are customized or altered to be fit for the consumption of human and animals .
Specifically , the alteration process goes through the most modern type of systems using molecular biological systems .
In this process , a foreign gene is added to the genome of the organism .
In this manner , the said genome will eventually carry the traits of the gene inserted to it .
On a more precise description , the DNA of one organism is transferred to another through physically altering it by means of genetic engineering .
With the issue of breeding taken away from the equation , the barrier presented by the sexuality of the species is prevailed over by the process .
( Leathers and Foster , 2004 , 240 ) This means that the margin for error in infusing such genes to specific genomes is significantly reduced as compared to the traditional cross- breeding practices done decades ago in bioresearch .
The modern methods make actual engineering to be possible for scientists .
Specifically , the infusion of a boost in resistance to herbicides , greater nutritional substance , or any other desired characteristics that scientists want to add is possible .
More so with this genome process , precision is of utmost advantage given to the scientists .
Along with the advances in modern technology , this could thus be easily done in laboratories .
This technology is not held back by the restrictions of traditional breeding food crops .
In this technology , as much as genes can be removed from one crop to another , genes coming from non-plant life forms can similarly be employed .
The commonly held illustration of this is the employment of Bt genes in corn and other food crops .
This Bacillus thuringiensis creates crystal proteins that are deadly to insects as well as the larvae of these insects ( Leathers and Foster , 2004 , 241 ) These proteins have been shifted into corn and cotton such that these plants can generate their own form of insect repellents .
With this manipulation of the genetic construct of crops , resistance from pests and disease as well as the ability to stand herbicide , drought and salinity are provided .
The problem in this context is that not everyone is pleased with these GMO technologies .
To illustrate , the European Union imposed a ban on the imports of GM products and even its use in their territory .
( Leathers and Foster , 2004 , 242 ) It even came to the point where the World Trade Organization has to intervene in the matter considering that the trading between countries has been hampered by this ban on GM products .
B. GMO ’s Infusion with Agriculture
As stated in the earlier parts of this paper , the United States is among the forerunners in advancements in technology specifically in agriculture .
Research on genetically modified technology is perceived to be generally the answer to the world food problem , well to a certain degree .
However , the said claim has been under considerable scrutiny by the media and scientific community .
To illustrate , an editorial in Washington Times ( 2003 ) entitled “ Much Ado about GM Foods ” was published pertaining to the lobbying of the political entities in the US on the advancement of genetically modified technology in agriculture .
Seeing the editorial , it appears that it claims an idea to address the problem of food scarcity all over the world .
The said editorial presented a study of the NCFAP with regards to modified foods like the fungus resistant potato .
The use of such product would be able to boost the production of potato immensely as compared to the current state .
Moreover , this will be able to give potato farmers a less cost in maintaining their crops .
This is considering the fact that they would use fewer insecticides and other agricultural products to ensure the proper growth of the crops .
In such a manner , not only does this kind of crop assist the agricultural industry , it also addresses the apparent shortage in agricultural products domestically and in the international context .
On a closer look , the discussion is regarding the use of genetically modified food crops to address the leading problem of the United States regarding the ban imposed by the European Union on the said crops .
The study predominantly cited a study by a government agency , the National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy ( NCFAP ) , stating GM food ’s benefit on major areas like Europe .
The editorial stated that the use of “ genetically modified insect - resistant maize , herbicide - tolerant sugar beet and fungus - resistant potato ” would be able to increase the annual yields of European farmers by billions of kilograms .
( Washington Times , 2003 ) However , the editorial never really took into account the possible downside of such use to the environment .
One is the possible biochemical instability that may take place once a new genetic material is introduced into the environment .
Unanticipated interaction may take place considering the lack of precedence in using such materials .
C. Issues on GMO
Through the attempt to solve the problem of food supply , man has continuously risen to the occasion by using its endeavors as a force in resolving this issue .
( DeGregori , 2002 , 134 ) However , such endeavors are expected not to please everyone .
This is the case in GMOs .
There are several issues on the use of such technology to resolve the food issue of the world .
The preceding discussions will present the claims or ( 2004 , 243 ) regarding the main issues on GMOs : human health issues and environmental issues .
1. Human health concern
There are three usual issues against GMOs on human health : allergies , weakened immune system , and promotion of evolution of diseases .
( Leathers and Foster , 2004 , 244 ) The first reason was triggered by a highly publicized recall program of a brand of tortilla chips that used a kind of GM maize unauthorized for human consumption .
According to what has been reported , the said product is only approved for animal consumption .
An offshoot of the sensationalized report was the complaint of several individuals claiming to have acquired allergic reactions from eating the said product .
Another issue that has risen regarding the health implications is a result of a research in UK indicating that this technology could compromise the body ’s immune system .
( Leathers and Foster , 2004 , 244 ) The research indicated that a laboratory experiment on rats fed with GM produce .
Nevertheless , the said experiment was then criticized by the Royal Society for the lack of any effective experiment design .
This means that the experiment may be flawed or even outright biased against the use of GM produce .
A similar study was made in Japan which indicated that no implications on the immune system were found , thus negating the initially criticized study .
The third issue on human health is regarding the possibility of accidentally creating a disease that is immune to the current antibiotics used by man .
The use of biotechnology and alterations on food crops with genetic engineering could trigger a contagion of evolved illnesses when virus carrying insects .
( Leathers and Foster , 2004 , 244 ) This thus presents a situation wherein the answer for the food problem and eventual solution for survival may well be the one that triggers the annihilation of the species with the introduction of new illnesses .
This may well be a reality with the natural immune system lagging behind the rather high rate of advancement in technology .
2. Environmental Concern
Aside from the supposed implications of GMOs on the human body , the said products may similarly have a considerable effect on the environment in general .
According to Leathers and Foster ( 2004 , 245 ) , three environmental issues exist : the implications to other organisms not targeted by the natural insecticides , creation of “ superweeds ” , and disruption of the ecological balance .
The first issue is basically an argument against the use of Bt gene injected in food crops .
As stated earlier , the said gene introduces a new attribute to the food crop : a natural insecticide .
Initially , the said insecticide targets specific insects that have been noted to be dangerous to food crops .
Nevertheless , Leathers and Fosters ( 2004 , 245 ) claimed that other insects that are not targeted by the Bt gene may well be affected .
This means that insects that may have been not a threat to food crops may succumb to the natural insecticides of the GM crops .
Another issue on this matter is the possible creation of superweeds .
Again a criticism against GM crops , the natural occurring defense mechanisms that the added gene in the plant may produce an effect other than kill the weeds that compete with the soil ’s nutrients .
It could also trigger an evolutionary change for these weeds .
Leathers and Foster ( 2004 , 245 ) claimed that weeds could similarly create a naturally occurring defense mechanism , a sort of resistance to the natural herbicides of GM crops .
This thus creates a much powerful species of weed that would continuously compete with the plant for the earth ’s nutrients .
The third concern on GM food crops is the possibility of ecological ima ( 2004 , 245 ) indicated that when this become a reality , the diversity of species may wear away .
The said possibility is discussed using the issues of herbicide and the subsequent implications on the environment surrounding it .
From the evolution of weeds and the possible effects on the fauna feeding off on these , changes in the genetic construct of food crops has apparently given critics a scare .
Though the hypothetical situations indicated in the discussions or ( 2004 ) appear to be the worst - case scenario , the possibility of these situations to take place is supported citing by previous studies that point to the implications of GM crops .
V. Conclusion
This study has given an in - depth discussion on the world problems and the issues surrounding its existence .
The first part of the paper revealed that there is indeed a problem in world food .
However , it does similarly show that shortage is not the specific problem .
It is the distribution of food across countries that have triggered a more pressing problem .
The second part on the other hand has established that certain elements in society do contribute and even aggravate the problem in world food .
Policies and international frameworks and courses of action have been indicated with the intention of solving this problem .
It is the discussion of the technological advancements and its application on agriculture presents the most promise among the noted solutions above .
Numerous antagonists of GM crops contend that the technology is not required to lend a hand in resolving the trouble in world food , with millions of individuals who do not have an adequate amount of food to consume .
They repeatedly contend that the world generates adequate food to nourish billions of individuals , meaning that the problem of world food is basically an issue of allocation and nor food output .
Regrettably , fitting the allocation setback is a multifaceted subject .
The purchasing power would require boosting in developing countries , in addition to better food creation in developing and developed nations alike such that food crops can be sold at a value the needy can manage to pay .
Given that agricultural land is inadequate , the remaining alternative for growing crop output is to boost yield .
Whereas GM food crop technology is not the solitary process that can be employed to pull off this general objective , it can greatly play a part on this issue .
VI . Recommendations
Based on the conclusion above , the following courses of action are recommended by the paper :
· Individual states should essentially ratify policies that would sustain the performance of their agricultural sector .
· Developed countries should take the lead in research and development to even out the edges of GM crop technology .
· International organizations such as the WTO should impose fewer barriers for developing countries such that they could afford to import crops .
They routinely experience bleeding and nausea , according to a sworn statement by the camp 's chief doctor , seen by The Observer .
' Experience teaches us ' that such symptoms must be expected ' whenever nasogastric tubes are used , ' says the affidavit of Captain John S Edmondson , commander of Guantánamo 's hospital .
The procedure - now standard practice at Guantánamo - ' requires that a foreign body be inserted into the body and , ideally , remain in it . '
But staff always use a lubricant , and 'a nasogastric tube is never inserted and moved up and down .
It is inserted down into the stomach slowly and directly , and it would be impossible to insert the wrong end of the tube . '
Medical personnel do not insert nasogastric tubes in a manner ' intentionally designed to inflict pain . '
It is painful , Edmonson admits .
Although ' non-narcotic pain relievers such as ibuprofen are usually sufficient , sometimes stronger drugs , ' including opiates such as morphine , have had to be administered .
Thick , 4.8 mm diameter tubes tried previously to allow quicker feeding , so permitting guards to keep prisoners in their cells for more hours each day , have been abandoned , the affidavit says .
The new 3 mm tubes are ' soft and flexible ' .
The London solicitors Allen and Overy , who represent some of the hunger strikers , have lodged a court action to be heard next week in California , where Edmondson is registered to practise .
They are asking for an order that the state medical ethics board investigate him for ' unprofessional conduct ' for agreeing to the force - feeding .
Edmonson 's affidavit , in response to a lawsuit on behalf of detainees on hunger strike since last August , was obtained last week by The Observer , as a Guantánamo spokesman confirmed that the number of hunger strikers has almost doubled since Christmas , to 81 of the 550 detainees .
Many have been held since the camp opened four years ago this month , although they not been charged with any crime , nor been allowed to see any evidence justifying their detention .
This and other Guantánamo lawsuits now face extinction .
Last week , President Bush signed into law a measure removing detainees ' right to file habeas corpus petitions in the US federal courts .
On Friday , the administration asked the Supreme Court to make this retroactive , so nullifying about 220 cases in which prisoners have contested the basis of their detention and the legality of pending trials by military commission .
Although some prisoners have had to be tied down while being force - fed , ' only one patient ' has had to be immobilised with a six - point restraint , and ' only one ' passed out .
' In less than 10 cases have trained medical personnel had to use four - point restraint in order to achieve insertion . '
Edmondson claims the actual feeding is voluntary .
During Ramadan , tube - feeding takes place before dawn .
Article 5 of the 1975 World Medical Association Tokyo Declaration , which US doctors are legally bound to observe through their membership of the American Medical Association , states that doctors must not undertake force - feeding under any circumstances .
Dr David Nicholl , a consultant neurologist at Queen Elizabeth 's hospital in Birmingham , is co-ordinating opposition to the Guantánamo doctors ' actions from the international medical community .
' If I were to do what Edmondson describes in his statement , I would be referred to the General Medical Council and charged with assault , ' he said .
· Yesterday the new German Chancellor Angela Merkel became the latest leader to condemn the United States for practices at the prison .
In a magazine interview days before her first visit as premier to the US , Merkel said Washington should close Guantánamo and find other ways of dealing with terror suspects .
