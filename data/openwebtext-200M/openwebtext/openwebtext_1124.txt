A big story over the past couple of years has been the impending demise of the U.S. newspaper industry .
In our current recession , we have seen many big newspapers close their doors and many of the most prominent require bailouts of one sort or another .
Some observers have argued that this is due primarily to ineffective business models ( e.g. , the failure to embrace an online subscription model , etc. ) .
Others see it as a struggle between new media and traditional media where the traditional media is losing .
There is little question that these factors are partially responsible , but I think that there is an even more important one that has received far less attention than it deserves .
Undoubtedly , new media ( i.e. , blogs , social networks , Twitter , etc. ) do some things better than newspapers ever will be able to do .
The utility of Twitter in post-election Iran was a recent example , but there will be many others .
At the same time , most of us would agree that traditional media is light years ahead when it comes to investigative reporting .
I have always thought of the media , traditional or otherwise , as having a crucial role in the American democracy as providing another check and balance on government .
Indeed , we often refer to the media as a " fourth estate " in recognition of this important function .
Sadly , I believe that it is the traditional media 's abrogation of this critical investigative role which heralded its demise .
We tend to think of the lead up to Bush 's unprovoked invasion of Iraq in 2003 as the moment when the American media failed us .
To be sure , this was a failure ; however , it was neither the first nor the most important .
In fact , based on the startling absence of investigative reporting by American newspapers following the 2000 presidential election , we should have seen it coming .
As disappointing as it was to see the mainstream media uncritically accept Bush administration propaganda in 2002 , I believe that the media 's refusal to investigate compelling evidence of election fraud during the 2000 presidential election was even worse .
This should have been a huge story that exposed serious problems with the American democracy and uncovered the culpability of both political parties .
Instead , it was buried .
I consider this to be a watershed moment because it signaled that the media was no longer willing to perform its essential investigative role .
With increasing corporate ownership and one merger after another , it had become clear that investigative reporting which might harm certain corporate / media interests was not going to happen .
Sadly , this included exposing serious election fraud and taking down a corrupt administration .
More recently , it involved making sure that the least threatening candidates would get elected .
Where does this leave us today ?
It leaves me feeling sad and discouraged but mostly just mad .
I believe that we need traditional media , including newspapers , mostly because of the investigative role they used to perform .
But as it becomes increasingly clear that they are not going to exercise this function in a manner that might harm their business interests , I have a more difficult time justifying their continued existence .
By choosing to provide soft entertainment instead of hard news , the media has betrayed our democracy .
The Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed halting high frequency and flash trading .
In response , Nasdaq ( and others ) are now prohibiting flash orders .
Supposedly , the NYSE is also considering banning the practice .
This was a given .
The real question that remains unanswered and demands a thorough investigation is this : WHAT EXCHANGE OFFICIALS APPROVED THIS ?
WHO BELIEVED THAT ALLOWING FAVORED FIRMS TO FRONT RUN OTHER INVESTORS WAS OK ?
Quite bluntly , the clueless dolts who allowed this to occur need to be publicly excoriated , fired from their job as exchange officials , and driven out of town on a rail .
Oh , and , all the gains from this organized theft should be clawed back from all the front - running firms that stole this money — THAT ’S RIGHT , ITS THEFT — one quarter cent at a time .
Put the recovered ill - gotten gains into the SIPIC fund that compensates investors who have been defrauded by their stock brokers .
Stop for a moment to consider what sort of massive disregard for the investing public is required to permit this kind of trading .
The sheer hubris that finds no problem in this exchange permitted encouraged theft is hard to fathom .
One of the problems with the most recent crisis is that there have been no shaming of the responsible parties , no disgorgement of ill gotten gains , no perp walks .
We need to change that pronto .
The WSJ had an Op - Ed last month , In Defense of ‘ Flash ’ Trading , that suggested that “ Flash trading is like offering to sell your house to your neighbor before you officially put it into the real estate listings . ”
That description is , of course , utterly false .
We have alternative exchanges where you can offer stocks privately to other willing buyers ( i.e. , Instinet ) .
Flash trading is more like having access to private info from the sellers , knowing what they will accept , stepping in front of legitimate buyers , and then flipping the house to those buyers while capturing 0.001 % of the transaction .
No benefit to the seller , to the neighborhood or to anyone else — all at a small cost to the buyer .
Oh , and that article defending Flash Selling ?
It was written by Donald Luskin — so you know its utterly wrong , morally contemptible , and guaranteed to lose you money .

Things have not been well in the land of Michigan football .
Last year 's 3 - 9 season and a few off - season transfers have left Michigan fans uneasy .
Then , over last weekend , came Armageddon .
According to a report in The Detroit Free Press , Michigan had violated several NCAA rules regarding the amount of time players were forced to practice .
After decades of a clean program , it had apparently taken second - year head coach Rich Rodriguez barely more than a year to flush everything down the toilet .
We fans , unfortunately given to holier - than - thou posturing from time to time , were tarred , scarred , and all looked foolish .
I saw the report scroll across at the ESPN 's onscreen ticker and sent out incoherent , expletive - laden text messages .
I received equally angry , confused responses .
As I began sifting through the story online , I was surprised by what I found .
Instead of self - righteous columnist anger and end - of - the - world predictions , I was met with relief .
Apparently every program — in all sports at almost all schools , not just the moneymaking football and basketball — does what our football team did .
Michigan has an entire staff devoted to making sure we abide by the rules .
It is n't even clear that we violated anything .
In place of an argument between pro- and anti-Rodriguez camps , which is what I expected when I first heard the news , normally disparate Michigan fans have really come together behind Rodriguez ( for a great discussion of this , check out this post ) .
Many fans , especially those under the age of 40 , have united against what is emerging as the perceived enemy : The Detroit Free Press .
This story has become a classic showdown between the mainstream sports media and the blogs and social networking sites that make up the new media .
And , frankly , it looks like mainstream media is losing the battle .
For instance , take a look at the Free Press ' coverage of new media response to their coverage of the " scandal . "
If newspapers want to figure out why they 're losing market share to blogs , they need to look no further than the story above .
Instead of embracing new media , the web editor of the paper takes bizarre , condescending shots at the mediums .
When discussing PetitionSpot.com , the writer made the inexplicable decision to include the following sentence : " Other popular petitions on the site include one to bring back NBC's Chuck for a third season ( 41,058 signatures ) and another trying to get comedian Kathy Griffin 's new book selected by Oprah Winfrey for her book club ( 36,743 signatures ) . "
On top of that , there seems to be a complete absence of any understanding of journalistic ethics on the Internet .
You will notice the correction ( incorrectly and misleadingly marked as an " Update " ) at the bottom of the page without any context explaining the " update . "
If you look at MGoBlog.com 's discussion of the article , you can see what was deleted from the online record without mention : " Most of the posts are written by someone who identifies himself as Brian .
No contact information is given . "
Even the most cursory glance at the website will find that contact information is readily available , as is a short autobiography of blogger Brian Cook .
This is an egregious error in a paragraph that is nothing more than a pot shot at a blog that happens to be criticizing your publication 's story .
The laziness in online coverage can also be found in the curious decision to use Facebook as the only method of interviewing the founder of the anti-Free Press Facebook group .
If the group founder refused other methods of interview , that 's fine and should be noted , but the story reads as if the author only tried Facebook .
As a result , the quote appears in informal Internet style , making the founder look less than professionally literate .
Aside from the bizarre us - vs. - them tactic taken by the Free Press against the new media response , the coverage of the scandal itself has been ripe with ethical questions .
Jonathan Chait , an editor at The New Republic , wrote a column lambasting the Free Press editors for allowing an opinion columnist — one who has constantly criticized Rodriguez , at that — to become one of the primary reporters on the story .
This is a greater crisis in sports media where the lines between opinion columnist and " hard news " reporter are much blurrier than in traditional news .
The response to the scandal , though , has showed a real chink in the constricting style of mainstream sports media .
The entire issue at stake in the Michigan hullabaloo is the definition of " voluntary workout . "
This is an extremely contextual issue , and the nuances seem completely absent from mainstream coverage .
If you look at ESPN .
com 's initial story about the scandal it fails to frame the accusations with anything near the depth of its own blogger writing simultaneously .
In the post , the blogger is able to explain that these practices occur at all programs and are not necessarily violations .
Why then , is this extremely pertinent information not in the mainstream ESPN story or in the initial Free Press story ?
The Internet 's response has been clear and devastating .
There are details about the story that have still not been explained , such as why there was no comparison to other programs , why freshmen players quoted have responded so angrily , and why certain sources were kept anonymous .
Mainstream media , especially the sports media , need to remove this layer of opacity and add a layer of accountability .
Instead of mocking the criticisms and publishing self - congratulatory articles , the Free Press should respond to the questions being asked .
They wrote their own story about Michigan fans rallying behind the coaches .
Maybe they need to look at themselves and ask why .
Déjà-vu all over again
One example of the latter case is how fragmentation is playing out in the mobile industry today – largely a consequence of varied approaches to platform licensing and governance .
Fortunately , there are forward - thinking organizations in the mobile industry driving initiatives that hold the potential to break the cycle of fragmentation within the mobile ecosystem .
Fragmentation occurs when there are multiple inconsistent versions of a single platform causing an inability to develop applications that can directly , or with limited reconfiguration to address variances in form factor , run across multiple devices that are ostensibly based upon the same software platform .
Within the desktop computer industry , it is widely believed that the biggest hurdle to desktop Linux adoption was fragmentation – more precisely , the fragmented communities , who were each using a different flavour of Linux ( Red Hat , SUSE , Gentoo , Ubuntu etc ) .
Given that these flavours are not uniform in nature , PC vendors are unable to predict their behaviour and have been reluctant to adopt them .
For a long time , operating system fragmentation has also been the Achilles ’ heel of the mobile industry – hindering innovation and preventing the democratisation , widespread adoption and use of the mobile Internet .
Applications must be ported from one device to another , translated from one language to another , and even customized for specific mobile operator needs .
Once a developer builds an application , it is often a further challenge to get it to run on enough phones to create a commercially viable addressable market .
A handful of mobile platforms
While it is not realistic to envisage a single operating system for all mobile devices -n or would one wish to create an OS stranglehold similar to Microsoft ’s position in the PC marketplace – it is essential for the mobile industry to coalesce on a handful of mobile platforms and this process has already started .
The industry has finally come to realize that while proprietary and vertically integrated systems are very good at addressing niches , the only way to unleash innovation is through open , independent and collaboratively developed industry platforms .
See also :
How openness and Linux are unlocking innovation [ Part 1 ]
This has resulted in the formation of a number of consortia offering a variety of “ open ” operating systems and development environments , each promising to be the solution that can deliver exceptional ROI for developers .
While on the surface , these organizations appear to be operating in the same way and delivering similar outputs , there are subtle but critical nuances in their governance , collaboration and licensing model that highly impacts their ability to solve fragmentation .
In other words , the devil lies in the details !
It is now fully acknowledged that focusing on common platform technologies alone will not guarantee successful management of fragmentation ; instead , a well defined infrastructure incorporating a strong and sophisticated IPR policy and platform licensing is required to ensure broad adoption by the various constituents of the mobile value chain while preventing forking and inconsistency in future releases .
Copyleft
For fragmentation to be controlled , a strong copyleft policy is a prerequisite , as it obliges users of the platform to contribute fixes and optimizations before the platform is commercialised .
Another key element in combating fragmentation is compliance testing which ensures that the right to distribute a platform is limited to compliant implementations .
However , to be effective , it is also essential that compliance regimes are built from day one and not as an afterthought .
While platform coalescence is a great way of addressing fragmentation , it is unfortunately not a short term strategy .
Rather , it will take the industry some time before it settles on a handful of platforms .
In the meantime , standard runtimes and web technologies can serve as the bridge that developers use to reach the billions of mobile devices in the market .
Most web developers are already familiar with HTML , CCS and JavaScript and a high proportion of mobile devices feature browsers that can support these technologies .
This means that the upfront time and capital investment for developers will be negligible while the scale achieved will offer them successful returns .
Industry platforms will again play an essential enabling role by providing support for a wide variety of development environments and standard runtimes .
BONDI
Even the Web runtime space was highly fragmented until the advent of OMTP ’s BONDI initiative , whose aim is to consistently and securely open up access from web applications to device and network resident capabilities .
BONDI is defining the key mobile interfaces which are currently not standardised , but present the best opportunities for developers to provide great mobile web services .
By enabling access in a consistent manner to these interfaces , BONDI is providing the developer with the ability to produce new web applications which will be capable of running across different devices and platforms .
In the mobile space , ensuring compatibility and interoperability across a broad diversity of platforms is a real nightmare for developers and as a result , is impeding true innovation .
Convergence around a few common platforms will no doubt reduce the burden of development , maintenance and suppo rt for developers .
However , well defined licensing and IPR policies as well as support for multiple application development frameworks will be the key elements that determine an industry platform ’s ability to address fragmentation .
The broad adoption of mobile standards such as BONDI will enable mobile operators and OEMs to manage their device portfolios more efficiently , ensuring that key applications can be supported consistently across all of them .
Consumers will benefit from a more diverse range of applications and more choice of devices while application developers can ensure that their applications work across different device platforms and operating systems , helping them get the maximum value from their investments .

When the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) made the momentous decision late in 2008 to allow unlicensed broadcasting devices access to " white spaces " in the television spectrum , backers hailed the move as a major step forward for US wireless networking .
" WiFi on steroids , " was how one engineer put it during the debate .
But for white space devices to move from laboratory concept to store shelves , they would need more than steroids ; they would need some sophisticated engineering .
That 's because the FCC imposed two critical conditions : whitespace devices must sense local transmissions from televisions and wireless microphones in order to avoid transmitting on those frequencies , and the devices must also access a geolocation database of known transmitters as a backup solution in case spectrum sensing failed .
( To see the available white space TV channels in your area , check showmywhitespace.com . )
Google , Microsoft , and others promptly got to work on the database , and spectrum sensing technology has already existed commercially for years .
But how would a white space device — say , one located in the kitchen next to the family computer — actually communicate with the access point providing a connection to the Internet ?
Such problems have already been solved many times over by wireless networking solutions as diverse as Bluetooth , 3G data transmission , and WiFi , so adapting one of the existing networking techniques to the new spectrum might seem like a no - brainer .
But white space transmission features a host of challenges not found in conventional WiFi installations , challenges that meant existing WiFi protocols would not be optimal without some tweaking .
Microsoft Research 's KNOWS team
Enter " WhiteFi , " a proposal from Microsoft Research to create a WiFi - style system in which multiple clients can connect to a local access point operating in the UHF TV band .
WhiteFi is the latest project to emerge from Microsoft Research 's " Networking Over White Spaces " ( KNOWS ) project .
For its first trick , the research team handled mesh networking , in which each whitespace device connects to its neighbors , which connected their neighbors , to create a spontaneous local network .
Recently , the team has turned its attention to replicating the traditional WiFi model ( PDF ) of a central access point with multiple client devices connected to it , but getting there required quite a bit of work .
The problems
The differences between WiFi and the white spaces go far beyond the difference in spectrum ( WiFi operates most commonly at 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz , while white space devices can operate over 30 separate 6MHz TV channels in the UHF band ) .
For one thing , white space devices have to contend with far more " spatial variation " than does WiFi .
As transmitters are moved around the neighborhood , city , or the country , the channels on which they can broadcast will change to avoid existing TV transmitters .
This creates more than regional variation .
Imagine an access point that finds a clear space on channel 27 and begins accepting connections from client devices .
But one of the client devices is one kilometer away in a location where a TV broadcast channel 27 can be faintly detected .
The channel can't be used .
The access point therefore needs to query all of the client devices when negotiating its data channels , making the system more complex than WiFi , which may need to worry about interference , but does not have to hop off any particular channel because of it .
A second ( and related problem ) is the variation of the data channels over time .
Imagine an access point merrily transmitting data to five white space client devices in the neighborhood .
Everything progresses swimmingly until someone at the church next door switches on a wireless microphone .
The access point must immediately drop its signal on that channel and find a way to notify all of its clients about a move to some new ( and clear ) channel .
The prototype device
To find out just how many packets of data such wireless mics could handle before interference became audible , Microsoft researchers hauled one of their trial white space devices and a wireless mic down to an anechoic chamber .
The results were not good ; as the research paper puts it , " even a single packet transmission causes audible interference during wireless microphone transmissions . "
In the real world , the problem might not be quite as bad , since transmitters and microphones will rarely sit within a few feet of one another , but it 's still a serious issue .
Finally , white space devices face issues with spectrum fragmentation .
While WiFi broadcasts on a single channel , there 's no particular reason to do this when designing a white space device .
In many locations , the available spectrum will feature several contiguous free channels , and if channels 25 , 26 , and 27 are all open , the device can get the most throughput by broadcasting on a wider spectrum or by channel bonding .
But this also poses problems ; signals of varying widths take more time to detect , and the channel assignment problems noted above all get more difficult to deal with .
The solutions
The Microsoft Research team has addressed many of these issues with WhiteFi .
First , the team crafted an efficient way to detect " variable - bandwidth signals , " called SIFT .
Then , it tackled spectrum assignment algorithms ( finding and using the largest block of contiguous free channels is n't always the best technique , as some other white space devices might be transmitting on one or more of those channels , creating interference that could reduce speeds ) .
Handling disconnections , such as when a wireless mic suddenly pops on and forces a channel change , takes place using a special 5MHz backup channel .
Whenever an access point or a client device detects an TV or wireless mic signal on a channel it is using , it stops transmission immediately and sends out a series of " chirps " on the backup channel .
All access points and client devices check this channel every few seconds , and the chirps will help all the devices work out where to transmit next .
( Ah , but what happens when a wireless mic pops up on the " backup channel " itself ?
The researchers propose a secondary backup channel to deal with this situation . )
How does it all work ?
Pretty well , it seems .
In the team 's testing , the SIFT approach to channel scanning was 34 percent faster than the baseline approach .
Channel disconnections were dealt with in under four seconds .
Such work is going on among various white space developers ( Motorola and Philips are working on devices , for example ) , but it 's also taking place at the IEEE , where engineers on the 802.22 working group are developing techniques for Wireless Regional Area Networks over the TV white spaces .
We 're still some ways from seeing devices on store shelves , but with a projected 1 km transmission distance and the promise of broader transmission channels , white space devices are shaping up into some promising technology .
Once seen largely as a way to offer fixed wireless connections to rural homes , white space devices will soon be able to create mesh networks and WiFi - like connections — that early promise of " WiFi on steroids " might turn out to be surprisingly accurate , after all .
During an interview featuring music legend Dolly Parton , the feisty superstar made a memorable comment concerning recent U.S. protests : “ I understand people having to make themselves known and felt and seen , and of course Black lives matter .
Do we think our little white a**es are the only ones that matter ?
No ! ” Parton ’s remarks not only made headlines but also caught the attention of artist Kim Radford who immediately drew new inspiration from it .

A year ago , I was very skeptical of Ruby 1.9 .
There were a lot of changes in it , and it seemed like it was going to be a mammoth job to get things running on it .
The benefits did not seem to outweigh the costs of switching , especially since Ruby 1.9 was not yet adequately stable to justify the big switch .
At this point , however , it seems as though Ruby 1.9 has stabilized ( with 1.9.2 on the horizon ) , and there are some benefits that seem to obviously justify a switch ( such as fast , integrated I18n , better performance in general , blocks that can have default arguments and take blocks , etc. ) .
Perhaps more importantly though , Ruby 's language implementors have shifted their focus to Ruby 1.9 .
It has become increasingly difficult to get enhancements in Ruby 1.8 , because it is no longer trunk Ruby .
Getting community momentum behind Ruby 1.9 would enable us to make productive suggestions to Matz and the other language implementors .
Instead , we seem to get a new monthly patch fixing Ruby 1.8 .
So my question is : what do we as a community need to shift momentum to 1.9 .
I 'm do n't want a generic answer , like " we need to feel good about it " .
I 'm asking you what is stopping you today from using Ruby 1.9 for your next project .
Is there a library that does n't work ?
Is there a new language feature that causes so much disruption to your existing programming patterns to make a switch untenable ?
I suspect that we are all just comfortable in Ruby 1.8 , but would actually be mostly fine upgrading to Ruby 1.9 .
I also suspect that there are small issues I 'm not personally aware of , but which have blocked some of you from upgrading .
Rails 2.3 and 3.0 ( edge ) work fine on Ruby 1.9 , and I 'd like to see what we can do to make Ruby 1.9 a good recommended option for new projects .

The Battle of the World Financial System Drags On
The rally may end any day , but it did n’t end yesterday .
Stocks rose 127 points , as measured by the Dow .
Oil closed at $ 66 .
Gold rose $ 2.50 .
We said we were doing some serious thinking this week .
Maybe it is the season .
But more and more , our thoughts become grayer .
Less black .
Less white .
Less hard .
Less soft .
A few years ago , it looked to us as though the world financial system had gone to war .
We cheerfully awaited the victory parade .
We figured Mr. Market would whup the feds good and hard .
It has n’t happened so far .
On one side , are the forces of a natural market correction … following a long , long period of expansion .
The easier money gets , the more people tend to misspend and mis-invest it .
Then , inevitably , their mistakes must be corrected .
That ’s what bear markets and recessions are for .
But the feds do n’t like bear markets or recessions .
And at least since the Keynes outlined his general theory back in the early 20th century , they ’ve believed that they do n’t have to put up with them .
Keynes took a page from the Old Testament .
Government should act like an enlightened Egyptian Pharaoh , he did n’t say , but should have .
It should run surpluses in the fat years and deficits in the lean years … thus flattening out the pattern of boom and bust .
Pharaoh was no dope .
He stored up grain for seven years , when the harvests were bountiful .
Then , when the seven lean years came , he released the grain to the people .
Problem solved .
Keynes believed that modern government could do the same thing .
But Pharaoh was not running a democracy .
He had no voters to answer to .
So , if he wanted to store grain in the fat years , he could do so .
In theory , the US government could do the same .
But , in fact , it never runs significant surpluses .
There are too many people who want too much bread and too many circuses .
And you do n’t win votes by denying the voters what they want .
So , in practice , the feds run deficits even in the fat years !
Last year , before the downturn really started to bite , the US federal government ran the biggest deficit in history – nearly half a trillion dollars .
Now , let ’s imagine how that would work for a bad Pharaoh .
He would give out grain in the fat years .
This would encourage farmers to produce less grain .
Then , when the lean years came , Pharaoh would have no grain to give out … and the farmers would have less grain stored up themselves , since they grew less during the boom years .
The famine would be worse than ever .
Then , if we can imagine that Egypt was trading with China at the time , perhaps Pharaoh could borrow grain from the Zhou dynasty to help ease the peoples ’ pain .
Perhaps he could mortgage the pyramids .
Whatever , he – and the Egyptian people – would have been in much better position if he had done as Joseph told him in the first place … lay up stores in good times , draw then down in bad times .
How difficult is that ?
But Bernanke did n’t see the famine coming .
Neither did Geithner .
Or Greenspan .
Or any of the other savants Pharaoh interpret his dreams .
None of them expected hard times .
None of them warned the public .
None of them encouraged the government to save money for the recession .
Nassim Taleb asks why Bernanke was reappointed after he clearly failed the most critical test .
But heck … the federal government is an equal opportunity employer .
Employees are n’t let go just become they ’re incompetent .
Anyway , getting back to our thoughts …
… it looked like a battle to us – between the forces of inflation ( the feds ) … and the forces of deflation ( the market ) .
But battles usually have clear winners .
One side is master of the field and the other retreats .
One side is victorious ; the other is defeated .
Alas , some wars produce no hosannas of success …and no wailing widows of failure .
Some end in draws …or in confusion … or in disgrace and bankruptcy for both sides .
Like the bad Pharaoh , the feds saved nothing .
Now , they have to try to work their Keynesian magic on credit .
This puts them in a weak position ; like a government that wages war on borrowed money .
They can continue their campaign only as long as lenders allow them .
They ca n’t wage the war as effectively as they ’d like .
Then again , maybe they can’t lose it as spectacularly as they might .
For the moment , their credit is still good .
The bond market foresees an inflation rate of less than 2 % .
Bankers , taking money from the government , are happy to lend it back to them .
But the forces of the correction are giving up little ground .
While stocks rally , the real economy remains in a funk .
“ Sharp drop in start - ups , ” is a news headline from yesterday .
New business start - ups are a major source of new jobs .
Bad omen .
Even glamour publisher Conde Nast is forced to make cutbacks .
It has told employees that they may not spend more than $ 1,000 a night when they are traveling .
A Pimco economist says savings rates are still going up … and may exceed 8 % .
This represents hundreds of billions of dollars taken out of the consumer economy .
Oddly , while it makes the slump worse , it also helps finance the government ’s battle against it .
Savers buy US debt ( albeit indirectly ) .
So , the battle is still going on …and the outcome is still in doubt .
Our own Addison Wiggin was interviewed by The Daily Bell on his beginnings at Agora ( working on an old laptop on a desk he shared with your editor in Paris ) , whether or not the West can save itself – and on this ‘ war ’ between inflation and deflation .
On the latter , here ’s what Addison had to say :
“ ‘ Deflation now , inflation later ’ is a mantra we ’ve adopted at The Daily Reckoning .
The Federal Reserve , through it ’s program of quantitative easing , is busting the seems of it ’s own balance sheet in order to fight a deflationary trend in the West .
At some point , the tide will shift .
Mr. Bernanke assures the world he ’s watching inflationary indicators like a hawk .
We have our doubts whether those indicators will do him any good .
As Paul Volcker , the great inflation slayer of the early 1980s , said when we interviewed him for I.O.U.S.A .
‘ Once inflation gets started , it ’s very hard to stop .
And there ’s a strong flavor of that at the moment . ’
[ To read Addison ’s full interview , see here . ]
“ Global trade rose at its fastest rate in more than five years in July , ” The Financial Times reports , “ suggesting the economic recovery is feeding through into commerce . ”
“ I ’ve been worried about the effects of protectionism in shutting off different markets and making a weak economy even worse off , ” says colleague Chris Mayer .
“ Commodity markets especially need open markets to function well .
The EU , for example , just put a 40 % tariff on Chinese made steel pipe .
That ’s not good for steel pipe demand and hence , the steel makers and the commodities that go into steel .
If we see widespread adoption of such measures , we ’d have to re-think some things .
“ But so far , it looks like we ’ve got a recovery of some kind in global trade .
When I look at the global economy , many of the bright spots stem from surging trade along old trade routes ( such as China and Arab world ) . ”
Racehorse prices are in freefall , says a report out yesterday .
But collectible cars are still doing well .
Yesterday , we saw someone drive by in a huge , gaudy pink Cadillac from the 1960s .
It had magnificent fins and enough chrome to stagger a blind man .
In it were a middle - aged man and woman , looking very comfortable and proud .
They were traveling in style … in a rolling sculpture .
Old cars are not only holding their values , they ’re still going up .
But not all old cars .
Detroit ’s muscle cars have been falling in price for the last three years .
Not very green ?
Until tomorrow ,

The Daily Reckoning
( CNN ) --
Days before a key meeting with Western leaders , Iran test - fired two types of long - range missiles Monday in part of what the Islamic republic called routine military exercises , its state - run media reported .
A short - range missile is test - launched during war games in Qom , Iran , south of Tehran , on Sunday .
The tests drew condemnation from France , which noted through its Foreign Ministry that the action comes only a week after Iran revealed the existence of a covert uranium enrichment site .
" These tests can only reinforce the worries of countries in the surrounding region and the international community , especially as Iran is , in parallel , developing a nuclear program , with the existence of a clandestine uranium enrichment site having just been revealed , " the ministry said .
" We ask Iran to choose cooperation and not confrontation , immediately putting an end to its profoundly destabilizing activities and responding without delay to the demands of the international community in order to find a solution in this affair . "
Iran 's nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili is scheduled Thursday to meet with representatives of the five permanent United Nations Security Council members , plus Germany .
European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana will also attend the talks Thursday in Geneva , Switzerland .
In the United States , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs called the missile test provocative and said the Western powers taking part in Thursday 's meeting want Iran to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency with " immediate unfettered access " to the newly discovered uranium enrichment site and people working there , as well as documents related to its planning .
Iran 's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps began a series of missile exercises Saturday to promote the armed forces ' defense capabilities , Fars News Agency reported .

After a series of short - range missile tests , Iran concluded Monday with the testing of the long range Shahab - 3 and the two - stage Sajil missiles , according to reports from state - run media .
Both hit their targets , and Iran 's air force commander hailed the exercise as a show that Iran is " fully prepared and determined to stand against all threats . "
" We will give a fully decisive , crushing and destructive response to anyone who poses a threat to the existence , independence and freedom of the ruling system and our values , " Brig .
Gen. Hossein Salami said , according to Fars News Agency .

The Shahab - 3 missile can strike targets between 800 and 1,250 miles ( 1,300 and 2,000 kilometers ) , according to the reports .
The Sajil - 2 missile is a solid - fuel rocket with a similar range and has been launched twice before , in November 2008 and May 2009 .
If Iran 's claims are true , the missile brings Moscow , Russia ; Athens , Greece ; and southern Italy within striking distance .

Last Monday , Iran wrote a letter to the United Nations ' nuclear watchdog agency , the International Atomic Energy Agency , revealing the existence of a second uranium enrichment facility .
The IAEA acknowledged the admission Friday , prompting President Obama and the leaders of Britain and France to publicly chide the Islamic republic and threaten further sanctions .
The United States and France had been aware of the unfinished nuclear site for several years , according to senior U.S. officials who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations .
Watch how the tests draw a comparison to a 1960s U.S. crisis »
The facility is on a military base near the city of Qom , about 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) southwest of Tehran , and is thought to be capable of housing 3,000 centrifuges , according to the officials and the IAEA .
That is not enough to produce nuclear fuel to power a reactor , but sufficient to manufacture bomb - making material , according to a U.S. diplomatic source who read the letter .
Iran told the IAEA there is no nuclear material at the site , an agency spokesman said .
Iran 's revelation of the site could actually " strengthen their hand " as Tehran heads into Thursday 's Geneva talks , according to Paul Ingram , an analyst who studies Iran and nuclear nonproliferation .
He said the timing of Iran 's revelation -- in between the U.N. General Assembly sessions and the Thursday meeting -- is deliberate on Iran 's part .
" This will make it more difficult to persuade them to abandon enrichment , " said Ingram , the executive director of the British American Security Information Council in London .

Iran says its nuclear enrichment program is intended for peaceful purposes , but the international community accuses it of continuing to try to develop nuclear weapons .
Iran conducts research for its nuclear program in sites around the country .
Until the new letter , it had acknowledged only a uranium enrichment plant in Natanz , which nuclear inspectors visited recently .
Iran also has an unfinished nuclear research reactor in Arak , and U.N. nuclear inspectors were allowed access to that facility earlier this month .
Other important nuclear sites in Iran include its Bushehr nuclear power plant and the Isfahan uranium conversion plant .

In a perfect world , I would never blog about version numbers in Perl .
Version numbers should be boring .
No one should have to think about how they specify or check a version number .
Perl programming makes things easy , not hard , right ?
Unfortunately , version numbers in Perl are n’t boring and easy .
Instead , they are complicated and confusing .
Every Perl programmer needs to understand at least some of this complexity .
Otherwise , you can make life difficult for yourself or others without realizing it .
In this article , I ’m going to explain what I think are ‘ good practices ’ for dealing with version numbers in Perl .
I ’m going to point out what I think are ‘ bad practices ’ .
( ( N.B. , the Perl Best Practices book is wrong ) )
In the end , I ’m going to make some recommendations that I hope people will follow for their own sake and the sake of others who work with their code .
For the impatient , the disinterested or those who just want to follow a recipe , my advice for all modules is this :
our $ VERSION = " 0.001 " ; # or " 0.001_001 " for a dev release $ VERSION = eval $ VERSION ;
If you already use decimal versions that are n’t in the 3 - digit decimal format , that ’s fine , too .
It ’s not worth switching for code you ’ve already published .
If you disagree with me or would like to see alternatives or want to know the ugly details behind this recommendation , then the rest of this article is for you .
Can we skip the history lesson ? 🔗︎
It will be helpful to review at least a little history , then we can ignore how we got here and just focus on what to do .
There are three big historical accidents worth noting : ( ( They were actually intentional , but had unforeseen consequences ) )
Accident # 1 : Perl expects a module to put its version number in a package variable called $ VERSION
The first accident means that a module version number can be anything that can be represented by a Perl scalar : a number , a string , an object , etc .
There are no constraints , only conventions .
This is a blessing and a curse ; it ’s the main reason why version numbers in Perl are n’t boring .
Accident # 2 : The Perl 5.6 interpreter changed from a ‘ decimal ’ version number ( 5.005_03 ) to a ‘ dotted - integer ’ version number ( 5.6.0 )
The second accident got people thinking that ‘ version numbers ’ for modules should n’t be decimals either .
It also introduced a three - digit convention for translating between the two approaches : 5.6.2 is equivalent to 5.006002 and 5.005_03 is equivalent to 5.5.30 .
Finally , it introduced new syntax for ‘ v - string ’ literals of the form ‘v 1.2.3.4 ’ to help represent dotted - integer version numbers .
A third historical accident was actually an attempt to fix the second :
Accident # 3 : The Perl 5.10 interpreter made $ ^V a version object instead of a v-string
Version objects are an attempt to overcome numerous limitations and challenges using v-strings for module version numbers .
The UNIVERSAL :: VERSION ( ) method also changed , to better accomodate version objects and v-strings .
Here is a very contrived example of the change to VERSION ( ) , where 120 , 100 , 103 are just the ASCII codes of the letters of my IRC nickname :
$ perl5.8.8 -e '$ VERSION=v120.100.103 ; print main ->VERSION ' xdg $ perl5.10.0 -e '$ VERSION=v120.100.103 ; print main ->VERSION ' v120.100.103
The version . pm module provides an interface to version objects and , for older versions of Perl , overrides UNIVERSAL :: VERSION ( ) globally to match the behavior of Perl 5.10 .
The version . pm module is one more thing that keeps version numbers from being as boring as I ’d like .
$ perl5.8.8 - Mversion -e '$ VERSION=v120.100.103 ; print main ->VERSION ' v120.100.103
Think about the implications of that for a module called ‘ Foo ’ .
Even if Foo does n’t use version .
pm , if version . pm is loaded anywhere then Foo->VERSION acts differently and gives a different value than is in $ Foo : : VERSION .
Version numbers are for machines , not people 🔗︎
For the most part , version numbers are used to answer just two questions :
What version of Module X does Module Y require in order to work properly ?
Is there a more up - to - date release of Module Z available ?
Neither question is one that we , as people , particularly want to waste our time on if a computer can answer the questions for us .
That means that version numbers need to be specified in a way that makes it easy for a computer to answer these questions .
Recommendation : Never use alphabetical characters in a version
Do n’t use ‘ 1.20 alpha ’ or ‘ 2.34beta2 ’ or ‘ 2.00R3 ’.
There are no standard conventions for alphanumerics , and you just make life hard for the machines , which means no help for the humans .
Decimals and dotted - integers 🔗︎
After following the first recommendation and excluding alphabetical characters for module versions , we are left with two numeric conventions , just like Perl itself :
decimal numbers
dotted - integers ( also called dotted - decimals or tuples )
A decimal version is just what it seems : an ordinary number that is either an integer ( 12 ) or decimal fraction ( 12.345 ) .
Decimal versions are compared in the ordinary , numerical way .
Dotted - integer versions are vectors of ( positive ) integers , so called because they are usually shown separated by full - stop characters ( 12.3.45 ) .
Dotted - integer versions are compared by pairwise numerical comparison of the first element of each version , then the second , the third , and so on .
There are two ways to represent dotted - integer versions in Perl :
v-strings
version objects
I already described v-strings , but you can read more about them in the perldata documentation page .
Despite what it says , v-strings are not deprecated .
( This warning will be removed in a future version of Perl . )
Version objects are created using the version . pm module .
There are several ways to do this .
Here is one example ( and it must be kept on one line ) :
use version ; our $ VERSION = version ->new ( " v1.2.3 " ) ;
The version . pm documentation has been updated in 0.77 to better explain the options and potential pitfalls creating version objects , so I wo n’t repeat them here .
John Peacock , the author of version .
pm , recently suggested that it is probably enough to use version.pm and give a quoted $ VERSION string without the need to explictly construct an object , as UNIVERSAL :: VERSION will convert it to a version object internally anyway .
( ( The ‘use version ; ’ part is n’t even required if the code is limited to Perl 5.10 or later . ) )
use version ; our $ VERSION = " v1.2.3 " ;
This approach is new and untested , but may eventually be regarded as the best way to use version .pm .
Perl decided upon on a three - digit convention to convert between the older decimal style and the newer dotted - integer style so that older Perls could give a useful error message when checking the Perl version number .
# on Perls before 5.6.0 use 5.6.2 ; # syntax error use 5.006002 ; # Perl version error
The three - digit convention takes each dotted - integer component after the first , pads them with leading zeroes if less than 3 digits , and concatenates them together .
To go the other way , the fraction portion of a decimal version is padded with trailing zeroes until the number of characters is a multiple of three , then each group of three digits is turned into an integer .
This convention has a subtle complexity : note that the conversion does not round - trip if a dotted - integer element is greater than 999 .
This might happen if a version number were constructed from a VCS revision number or a timestamp .
v1.2.34567 -> 1.00234567 1.00234567 -> v1.2.345.670
The introduction of the three - digit convention confused people in two ways : how to convert modules from decimal versions to dotted - integers and how to specify version number limits to use ( ) .
Many CPAN modules do n’t use three - digit decimals , partly because most module boilerplate tools create modules with a two - digit decimal starting version :
$ VERSION = " 0.01 " ;
These modules usually increment their versions as 0.02 , 0.03 and so on .
Some authors have been surprised trying to convert their decimal versions into dotted - integers and running afoul of the three - digit convention .
In the following example , a naive conversion results in a number that is less than the previous one :
0.01 0.02 0.03 v0.4.0 # WRONG : this is 0.004 v0.40.0 # RIGHT : this is 0.040
The other area of confusion is providing a version number requirement to the use ( ) keyword .
With the introduction of v-strings , but prior to Perl 5.10.0 , use ( ) internally converts “ use Foo v1.2.3 ” to “ use Foo 1.002003 ” .
So this works as expected :
# in Foo.pm our $ VERSION = " 0.001002 " ; # in foo.pl use Foo v0.1.2 ; # WORKS
However , since Perl recommends specifying “ use v5.6.0 ” as “ use 5.006 ” , some people think the same should apply to loading modules with use ( ) .
But , prior to Perl 5.10.0 ( and the change to UNIVERSAL :: VERSION ) , the inverse case might not work at all !
Consider this example :
# in Foo.pm our $ VERSION = v0.1.2 ; # in foo.pl use Foo 0.001002 ;
On a Perl compiled with support for long doubles , the extra precision in converting with the three - digit convention causes the comparison to fail with this incredibly confusing error message :
$ perl - 5.8.9-64bit -e 'use Foo 0.001002 '
Foo version 0.001002 required -- this is only version 0.001002
Recommendation : always use ( ) in the same form as $ VERSION in a module
When $ VERSION is a v-string , it should only be requested as a v-string ( “ use Foo v0.1.2 ” ) , except on Perl 5.10 or when using version .
pm .
There is a corollary :
Recommendation : do n’t switch version number schemes for a published module
If you do switch , then users wo n’t know in advance the right format to request .
Distribution version numbers 🔗︎
Distributions on CPAN also have version numbers .
These are specified as part of the filename .
( See a prior article for a formal definition of modules and distributions . )
DAGOLDEN / File - Marker-0.13.tar.gz
Recommendation :
Set the distribution version from a module
Usually , distribution versions are set automatically from a primary module within the distribution .
This is good – we let the machine take care of it for us .
It ’s one less thing for us to do , and helps to ensure machine - friendly distribution versions .
That ’s good for binary packages like .rpm and .deb .
For example , using Module : : Build , the ‘ module_name ’ parameter in Build .
PL specifies the name of a module to examine for the distribution name and version .
use Module : : Build ; Module : : Build -> new ( module_name => ' Foo : : Bar ' , license => ' perl ' , )->create_build_script ;
Or , using Module : : Install , you can do the same thing with a Makefile .
PL like this :
use inc:: Module :: Install ; name ' Foo - Bar ' ; all_from ' lib/Foo/Bar.pm ' ; WriteAll ;
The underscore convention 🔗︎
It has been a long - standing CPAN convention that distribution version numbers containing an underscore are ‘ development ’ or ‘ alpha ’ versions , and the corresponding distribution files do not get indexed by PAUSE as a ‘ release ’ version .
DAGOLDEN / Test - Reporter-1.53_03.tar.gz
The three main build tools , ExtUtils : : MakeMaker , Module : : Build and
Module :: Install will all attempt to parse a version number for a
distribution from a primary module file using the MM -> parse_version ( ) function provided by ExtUtils : : MakeMaker .
The parse_version ( ) method looks for the first line in the file that appears to set $ VERSION , and then calls eval ( ) on that entire line .
The following sections show how to specify an alpha version in each of the three version number styles and some things to consider for each .
Decimal alpha version 🔗︎
our $ VERSION = " 0.001_001 ; $ VERSION = eval $ VERSION ;
For a decimal alpha version , the definition is split into two parts .
The
first part provides the version in quotes , which is what gets returned by
MM->parse_version ( ) .
It has to be in quotes so that the underscore is preserved in the eval ( ) call within parse_version ( ) .
Without quotes , parse_version ( ) returns it as an ordinary decimal .
our $ VERSION = 0.001_001 ; # WRONG : parse_version ( ) gives 0.001001
The second line is required to make $ VERSION an ordinary number at runtime .
Without it , Perl would convert $ VERSION to a number by truncating at the underscore , resulting in the wrong version number .
( ( Perl converts strings to numbers differently at runtime than how it parses numeric literals during compilation . ) )
Dotted - integer alpha version with v-strings 🔗︎
our $ VERSION = v0.1_1 ;
For some versions of Perl , it ’s possible to specify an ‘ alpha v-string ’ , with a final decimal point replaced with an underscore .
(( This is an undocumented syntax feature / bug ) ) Consider a ‘ Foo module with a $ VERSION line like the one above .
Here ’s how different versions of Perl handle a request for a higher version number :
$ perl5.10.0 -e 'use Foo v0.1.2 '
Foo version v0.1.2 required -- this is only version v0.1_1 at -e line 1 . BEGIN failed -- compilation aborted at -e line 1 . $ perl5.8.9 -e 'use Foo v0.1.2 ' $ perl5.8.0 -e 'use Foo v0.1.2 ' Foo v0.1.2 required -- this is only v0.1.1 at -e line 1 . BEGIN failed -- compilation aborted at -e line 1 . $ perl5.6.2 -e 'use Foo v0.1.2 '
Note how Perl 5.8.9 and Perl 5.6.2 both succeed , even though a higher version is requested .
One potential solution is to require the version . pm module .
This ‘ fixes ’ 5.8.9 , but fails in a different way for 5.6.2 .
perl5.8.9 - Mversion -e 'use Foo v0.1.2 ' Foo version v0.1.2 required -- this is only version v0.1_1 at -e line 1 . BEGIN failed -- compilation aborted at -e line 1 . perl5.6.2 - Mversion -e 'use Foo v0.1.2 '
Foo version v0.1.2 required -- this is only version v0.0.0 at -e line 1 . BEGIN failed -- compilation aborted at -e line 1 .
Dotted - integer alpha version with version objects 🔗︎
use version ; our $ VERSION = version ->new ( " v0.1_1 " ) ;
This form is visually similar to an alpha v-string , but by putting it in quotes and by passing it the version object constructor , the version is protected from idiosyncracies of different versions of the Perl interpreter .
On the surface , it seems like this is a good approach , but it still has problems if one tries to use ( ) the same version on 5.8.0 and 5.6.2 .
$ perl5.8.0 -e 'use Foo v0.1_1 '
Foo version v0.1.1 required -- this is only version v0.1_1 at -e line 1 . BEGIN failed -- compilation aborted at -e line 1 . $ perl5.6.2 -e 'use Foo v0.1_1 '
Foo version 0.011 required -- this is only version v0.1_1 at -e line 1 . BEGIN failed -- compilation aborted at -e line 1 .
Requiring an alpha version as a decimal 🔗︎
The counter - examples in the previous sections assume a situation where an alpha version of a module is a prerequisite and show how an alpha v-string argument to use ( ) means different things depending on the version of Perl and whether version .
pm has been loaded .
The other alternative is to specify the version as a decimal .
use Foo 0.001_001 ;
While this is in the form of a decimal alpha version , the Perl parser sees this numeric literal as 0.001001 .
This works perfectly with the decimal alpha version example above that has the “ $VERSION = eval $ VERSION ” line .
Both are just numbers and they compare as equal .
That is n’t the case for version objects .
An alpha version object is not equal to a non - alpha version object , even if their numeric components are the same .
If Foo has this version line :
use version ; our $ VERSION = version ->new ( " v0.1_1 " ) ;
then “ use Foo 0.001_001 ” fails , even on a recent Perl .
$ perl5.10.0 -e 'use Foo 0.001_001 '
Foo version 0.001001 required -- this is only version v0.1_1
Recommendation :
Do n’t use v-strings or version objects as alpha versions
There are just too many ways for alpha v-strings and version objects to be used incorrectly .
Even if requiring Perl 5.10 or with version . pm , which a module author can control , if a user follows the three - digit convention and uses a decimal version in the call to use ( ) , it can fail .
Other issues in the toolchain 🔗︎
There are several other ways in which version numbers refuse to be boring .
Each could be an entire mini-essay , so I will only highlight a few of the issues I ’ve found :
Module : : Build can’t handle v-string prerequisites unless they are quoted
ExtUtils :: MakeMaker and Module :: Install have trouble with v-string module versions and prerequisites , even if quoted or given as version objects
In at least one recent bug I ’ve studied , an XS module failed to load with a version object created using the form “ 1.2.3 ” ( without a leading - v )
I think version numbers should be boring .
I do n’t want to have to think about how to write them and I do n’t want to make users think about how to format a version prerequisite .
And I do n’t want to get bug reports about it when a user gets it wrong .
For me , a ‘ boring ’ version number must :
be expressed the same way in its definition , in use ( ) checks , in prerequisites , in *.PL files and in META.yml
support the underscore convention in the same format
have similar behavior across different Perl versions
have similar behavior in use ( ) when converted from X.YYYZZZ to vX.Y.Z format or vice - versa ( ( Remember that users might write a dotted - integer as a decimal , just like they are taught for Perl itself . ) )
Given these criteria , my recommendation is to use decimal version numbers , put them in quotes , and add a string eval :
our $ VERSION = " 0.001 " ; $ VERSION = eval $ VERSION ;
This is safe and effective and always works .
By putting any $ VERSION in quotes , even if it is n’t an alpha , you do n’t have to remember to add them if you ever change to an alpha version .
( And numbers with trailing zeroes are nicely formatted when parsed for distribution versions . )
If you really want to have a dotted - integer module version , then I strongly recommend that you limit your module to Perl 5.10 ( or require version . pm and at least Perl 5.8.1 ) and that you never use an alpha version number .
Always quote your dotted integer version when you define it and always use a leading - v to guide your users towards proper usage .
It ’s unfortunate that version numbers are so complicated in Perl , but if you follow the recommendations in this article , your version numbers will be as boring as possible .
And if you ’ve read this all the way to the end , I hope I ’ve convinced you that ‘ boring ’ version numbers are exactly what you want .
I would like to thank Curtis Poe , Ricardo Signes and Eric Wilhelm for reviewing a draft of this article and providing excellent suggestions for improving clarity and correctness .
I would also like to thank the particpants in the #toolchain and #corehackers channels on IRC for being a sounding board as the article was developed .
Thanks also go to John Peacock for his graceful acceptance of my criticisms and suggestions about version .

It 's easy to understand why Batman is such a compelling character .
We 've all thought that with the right amount of money , training , and some slightly science - fiction - level gadgets , we too could fight crime .
Batman turns into kitsch when he has items in his utility belt that seem custom - designed for whatever random situation he finds himself in ; the best writers understand that Batman works best when he relies on his wits and a small number of tools .
If you 're lucky enough to punch Batman , he bleeds — this is no superhero .
He has simply spent the majority of his life making sure you never get to throw that punch .
Title Batman : Arkham Asylum Developer Rocksteady Studios Publisher Warner Bros. / Eidos Interactive Price $ 59.99 for console , $ 49.99 for PC Shop.ars Platform PS3 ( reviewed ) 360 , PC ( on September 15 )
The Batman portrayed in Arkham Asylum is everything that 's great about the character .
He 's not blessed with a dozen gadgets that get him out of every scrape ; the Joker caught him oddly flat - footed when he took over Arkham and set this collection of super - villains after the world 's greatest detective .
" I 'm not sure I can stop him this time , " Batman says wearily at one point in the game , and it's an unusual moment of vulnerability .
His suit is ripped , he 's underarmed and underprepared , and his number one advantage — planning — has been taken away from him .
This game puts you into Batman 's suit in the rare circumstance where he may very well be in over his head .
The Joker does give our hero one final shot before he sets his trap in motion .
All Batman has to do is kill him , and all of this will be over .
Arkham will be back under the control of law .
No one will die .
Batman goes free .
The Dark Knight fights his own nature for a moment , but he does n't take the shot .
" So predictable , " the Joker sneers , and the game is on .
It was wrong to move the Black Gate inmates here
This is n't a tie - in to any of Christopher 's Nolan 's films , and it does n't operate in the same world as the animated series .
It 's not even in lockstep with the comics .
This is unique take on the characters and the setting of Arkham Asylum .
Written by Paul Dini , it 's a very mature look at Batman , no matter what the Teen rating may have you believe .
People die .
The language is coarse .
Batman may not kill anyone , but his style of combat is based on brutalizing his opponents until they can't get up .
There are two forms of combat in the game .
The hand - to - hand fighting is limited to one button for attacks , but the action is far from simple .
You 'll have to continually attack while careening from one target to the next , all while countering their attacks and dodging blows from pipes and knives .
It only takes a moment to understand the combat , but mastering it will take quite a bit longer .
The more I play the game , the more elegant I find the combat , and it never becomes tiresome .
The second type of combat comes in the Invisible Predator areas where you have large spaces to terrorize your opponents .
As the game continues and you unlock different attacks , you 'll be able to quickly snatch enemies from above , glide down and land with both feet on their chests , or string up the baddies from your perch .
As you take down your enemies one by one they become increasingly scared , agitated , and erratic in their motions .
This is when you feel like you have become Batman ; in any fair fight the Joker 's henchmen would beat you easily .
It 's your challenge to make sure the fight is anything but fair .
You can soften up enemies with batarangs , you can take one down before zipping away and making another pass , or you can simply jump in slugging and brawl your way out of the situation .
The combat is open to your own ideas on what it means to be Batman , and finding all the different ways to inflict pain on your enemies is an absolute joy .
Fighting the demo
Many gamers became skittish after playing the demo , which was both short and linear .
The real game has more than a passing resemblance to Metroidvania games like Shadow Complex in that you visit different locales around the island of Arkham Asylum , and the more you explore with each new power , the more you can find and collect .
Not only are you struggling against the grand designs of the Joker to break both your body and your mind , but you 're also constantly taunted by the Riddler , who has hidden any number of puzzles and collectibles around the Asylum .
You can collect Riddler statues , you have to find different items in some rooms based on vague or misleading clues , you collect audio logs from interviews with the villains , you can smash certain amounts of the Joker 's chattering teeth you find around the levels ... there is a lot to do in order to unlock content from the game .
You can fly through the game and ignore all these diversions if you 'd like , but revisiting old rooms knowing you can now get to a previously unexplored area with a new power stretches your play time significantly .
The game is relatively linear , but you 're given the entirety of Arkham to explore and tackle at your own pace , and the island does not give up her secrets easily .
Consider B. K. , a fit finance executive in his early 40s , who , last October , began “ dating ” a 20 - year - old engineering major at a college 90 minutes from his house .
Like nearly half the sugar daddies on Seeking Arrangement , B. K. is married .
( Neither B. K. nor any other user of the site would allow full names to be published — certain the revelation would infuriate wives or boyfriends , shock colleagues and repel friends or family — and agreed to use only their first names , nicknames or initials . )
B. K. and his wife opted against separation , for the sake of the kids , and for now , they have a policy — at least in his mind — of do n’t ask , do n’t tell .
Between pangs of guilt about cheating , B. K. views his secret dallying as a safety valve , letting him feel desired so he can return home and appreciate the many things he loves about his wife , even if they do n’t include giving him the attention he wants .
And so , nearly each week , B. K. gets together with Lola , the young woman he met on the site , for a meal or a gym workout and a few hours at a hotel outside the Western city where he lives .
Their visits are generally no longer than four or five hours because Lola , a senior , has a full course load and also works 40 hours a week at two low - wage jobs .
With no money from her parents , she was frank in her Seeking Arrangement profile , saying she needed “ immediate financial assistance . ”
In B. K. , she gets that in the form of $ 100 or $ 150 stuffed in her bag each time they meet .
He feels good about helping her with her tuition , encouraging her studies and romancing her , albeit in hotel rooms .
Most of all , he ’s grateful that she does n’t want a commitment .
At least he was at first .
“ It ’s very clear with this site that she ’s getting something out of this , hopefully emotional support and mentoring advice and fun in bed , but also something financial , so do n’t come back to me and say that you were used or that I left you high and dry , ” he said .
“ I like that aspect of it , but on the other hand , it would be nice not to have the money involved , because you always wonder : would she still want to be with me even without the money ?
Does the money make me more attractive than I really am ? ”
ABOUT 30 PERCENT OF ARRANGEMENTS on the site involve the daddy paying an “ allowance , ” usually a thousand or two a month , though the site claims some reach $ 10,000 .
The rest provide the baby with incidental cash , shopping sprees , gifts , travel or the fleeting illusion that theirs is a high - end , easy life .
“ I get flown to whatever city I want , ” wrote a North Carolina college student , who goes by the name gurlnextdoor on the site ’s blog , a mix between an online support group and a kaffeeklatsch .
“ He pays for it , takes me shopping , we talk , laugh , go out to eat and do whatever we want to do for our days together .
. . .
I do n’t bring up mundane problems about my home life , and he does the same .
. . .
If I wanted someone to talk to about my life problems , I ’d get a boyfriend or a therapist . ”
Like B. K. ’s companion , Lola , many women on the site are in their 20s , though plenty of others are in their 30s , 40s and 50s .
Some are looking for attention , some have financial problems and some are seeking refuge from romantic pain .
On the blog and in conversations with me , still others said benefactors provide a way to get the extras they want — the Fendi bags , the to - die - for shoe collection or the breast enhancement .
A surprising number of babies say on the blog that they do n’t need the money at all , either because they have decent - paying jobs or bottomless credit cards from their parents .
What appeals to them about the arrangements are the expensive gifts —
“ I just LOVE being spoiled , ” gushed one 19 - year - old woman on the blog — because those gifts make them feel valued , as if the money spent measures just how desirable they are .

On the same day that a one - time star NFL receiver began serving a two year sentence in the New York State Prison system as a result of a self - inflicted gunshot wound , another potential NFL star receiver is continuing the self - inflicted implosion of what just months ago seemed like a promising NFL career .
When the San Francisco 49ers selected Michael Crabtree with the 10th pick in the 2009 NFL Draft most experts hailed the pick as a coup for the 49ers .
Rated by some as one of the top five talents in the draft , Crabtree ’s slip to the 10th pick was believed to be primarily because of concerns over a foot injury suffered during off - season workouts and general concerns with selecting any receiver that high in the draft .
However , you have to wonder now if it was also partially because some teams feared him following in the footsteps of some of the “ Receivers Gone Wild ” that have inundated the NFL in recent years .
With former Hall of Fame great Mike Singletary , a tough disciplinarian , as his head coach , many believed that Crabtree could flourish in the 49ers ’ system .
Having the talented receiver to serve as the go - to receiver for quarterback Shaun Hill , who is in his first full season as an NFL starter after eight years as a backup , seemed like a great move for the 49ers .
In addition , with future Hall of Fame receiver Isaac Bruce on the roster , everything seemed to be in place to provide Crabtree with a nurturing and supportive NFL environment .
The only problem is that Crabtree has yet to sign a contract and report to the 49ers .
Since the draft , Crabtree has insisted that even though he was drafted behind receiver Darrius Heyward - Bey , he was a better player than Heyward - Bey and should be paid accordingly .
The Oakland Raiders signed Heyward - Bey to a $ 38 million contract , with $ 23 million guaranteed , and Crabtree has been insistent on receiving an equal or greater contract .
San Francisco , however , has been following the NFL ’s unofficial slotting standards and have consistently offered a five - year , $ 20 million contract with $ 16 million guaranteed .
It was obvious from the beginning that getting Crabtree into uniform was not going to be easy , but expectations were that as the season approached , Crabtree would eventually join his new team .
When a Crabtree cousin claimed in early August that the star receiver was prepared to sit out the entire season and re-enter the 2010 NFL Draft , his agent , Eugene Parker , was quick to dismiss the statement .
However , now that we have gone from summer to fall and Crabtree is still nowhere near signing with the 49ers , it looks like David Wells may have been right .
Holdouts are part of the NFL and have been for generations .
However , as the song goes , “ You have to know when to hold them and know when to fold them . ”
If Crabtree hopes to salvage his rookie season , and quite possibly his NFL career , it is time for him to put his hand down and happily join the 49ers .
That is assuming that they still want him .
You see , while Crabtree has been acting like a spoiled athlete , the 49ers have quietly been winning football games .
The 49ers are 2 - 0 with solid victories over their two biggest rivals in the NFC West .
Sure , their receivers have not been spectacular , but Bruce is still a solid player and second year player Josh Morgan has shown great potential .
To his credit , Singletary has not allowed the Crabtree situation to become a distraction for his team and has kept the players he has in the locker room focused on working together to win football games .
The longer the saga continues , the more history becomes the enemy of Crabtree .
Many great wide receivers who were in camp from the beginning of their rookie season have struggled to make an impact as rookies .
Without the benefit of training camp and practice time with Hill , it is doubtful that even if Crabtree signed today he would make a significant impact this season .
The 49ers seem to recognize this and word is that they have considered reducing their offer to Crabtree .
If that happened , basically meaning the 49ers have called the player ’s bluff , it is likely that Crabtree would maintain his pride ( perhaps a false pride at this point ) and indeed sit out the entire season .
The last first round draft pick to sit out his entire rookie season was Kelly Stouffer with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1987 .
The Cardinals eventually traded him to the Seattle Seahawks prior to the 1988 draft .
All you really need to know about Stouffer ’s less than distinguished NFL career is that he has probably gotten more media attention during the last two weeks being compared to Crabtree than he did during his four seasons in the NFL .
Another more contemporary example of the damage sitting out a season can do is the case of fellow wide receiver Michael Williams .
It is likely that if Crabtree does sit out the entire season and re-enter the draft in 2010 , NFL teams will certainly remember the saga of the former USC standout .
If you will recall , Williams got caught up in the court battle over whether the NFL could force players to be three years removed from high school before entering the NFL Draft .
They could , but Williams had already turned pro and was n’t reinstated by the NCAA .
So , he sat out a year before being drafted with the 10th overall pick by the Lions .
He caught 44 total passes in three seasons and is now out of the league .
Crabtree has reportedly received support from a number of teammates , who say they will still welcome him whenever he does sign with the 49ers .
However , at a time when most Americans are just happy to have a steady job and income , there is n’t a great deal of public sympathy for a professional athlete who is choosing to leave $ 16 million on the table because he thinks he deserves an even more insane contract .
All great athletes believe they are invincible and entitled .
That was the downfall of Plaxico Burress and if he is not careful , that will also be what keeps Michael Crabtree from achieving his full potential .
Unlike Burress , Crabtree wo n’t wake up tomorrow in a state prison , but unless he quickly changes his tune and signs with the 49ers , he may spend the rest of his life having to live with the fact that , like Burress , he let pride and self confidence get in the way of his chance at NFL stardom .
World ’s Strongest Vagina Just Got Stronger
Total Pro Sports –
Let ’s file this one under WTF !
We have seen world records for many things before : the highest kick ; longest soccer ball juggling ; and now the strongest vagina .
Tatiata Kozhevnikova of Novosibirsk , Russia , is 42 - years - old , but her vagina remains as strong as ever .
She has exercised her love - box for fifteen years and it paid off after she was able to lift a 14 kg glass ball with it , putting her into the record books .
Tatiata spoke about why she began such training in an interview , and stated the following :
“ After I had a child , my intimate muscles got unbelievably weak .
I read books on Dao and learned that ancient women used to deal with this problem using wooden balls .
I looked around , saw a Murano glass ball and inserted it in my vagina .
It took me ages to get it out ! ”
The incident did not stop her , and she continued her training regimen .
“ You insert one of the balls in your vagina , and it has a string attached to it with a little hook at the very end .
You fix a second ball onto this hook . ”
Sounds like she has the type of attitude that Jason Whitlock wishes Serena Williams possessed .
I guess good things do come with hard training .
Now , with the world ’s strongest vagina , she likely holds the dream destination of most men right between her legs .
Just do n’t go to your local travel agent and try booking a trip there anytime soon .

The past few weeks , spectators around the country and around the world have watched the 2009 version of the Little League World Series ( LLWS ) .
What started more than 70 years ago as a small venture by a gentleman named Carl Stoltz of Williamsport , PA has evolved into a worldwide phenomenon .
For years , the LLWS championship game has been televised nationally .
With the advent of cable television , and with the ever - increasing emphasis on youth sports , today one can find early round games televised as well .
On Sunday , Chula Vista Park View ( CA ) defeated Taiwan 's champions 6 - 3 , in front of a crowd of 32,400 .
Add to that the fact that compared to last year 's tournament , television ratings were up over 100 % for ESPN2 broadcasts , more than 60 % for opening weekend telecasts , with a recent Saturday broadcast on ABC up over 160 % and it is clear that interest in Little League Baseball has never been higher .
While it is easy to point to an overemphasis on youth sports as the reason for the focus on the LLWS , it is curious that the LLWS is the only youth sporting event that receives such .
There is no event in youth soccer , basketball , football , or hockey that even comes close to rivaling the popularity of the LLWS .
Furthermore , the LLWS is for 12 - year - olds , but there is not similar attention given to older , more advanced youth baseball tournaments .
Although the Little Leaguers are quite good for their age , ESPN could certainly air 17 - year - olds playing Legion baseball and provide a higher quality of baseball .
So why is there so much intrigue over watching 12 - year olds play baseball in the LLWS ?
1 ) Who is the next rising star ?
Virtually every major league player competed in Little League , but only a select few made it to the LLWS in Williamsport , PA .
Gary Sheffield , Derek Bell , Book Powell , and Jason Varitek are all former LLWS participants who made it to the major leagues .
Fans love to project the next great prospect .
Of course , major league teams have enough difficulty accurately projecting the success rate of 18 - year - olds ( see Michael Lewis ' best - selling book , Moneyball for a terrific account of baseball scouting ) .
Most 12 - year - olds have not yet hit , nor have they decided what they want to do tomorrow , much less with the rest of their lives .
Even though most fans are aware of the astronomical odds of stardom for these kids , it is tempting for all of us to play Nostradamus when it comes to youth sports .
2 ) The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat ( to borrow a line from ABC Sports ) .
The emotions that these youngsters display run the gamut .
Watching them pour their heart and soul into games , and then have realized or crushed makes for tremendous drama .
Someone once said that one of the beauties of sports is that it is like an excellent play , but the difference is that in athletics , neither the audience nor the participants know the ending .
This is particularly true when we are talking about pre-teens playing a game .
3 ) The purity of youth sports .
For many , Little League Baseball conjures memories of baseball , hot dogs , and apple pie .
We may think back to our youth , walking to the park , with glove in one hand , and our new bat in the other .
Sunny nights at the field with friends and family .
Refreshments after the game .
Dirty uniforms .
New spikes .
Strike outs .
Errors . .
Maybe even that one time when we connected for a home run , and felt that , even for a moment , we were destined to make the Major Leagues .
The Little League World Series puts kids on a big stage at a time in life when they have not been corrupted by agents , money , or greed .
Amazingly , one may not be able to say the same thing in a few years once 9th graders are being recruited by colleges around the country .
Of course , the LLWS has its imperfections and impurities .
1 ) Age - related scandals .
Danny Almonte of the U.S. became the poster child for this several years ago , but other countries have regularly been rumored to have players on their rosters whose age exceeds the limit .
2 ) gaffes .
Kids are suddenly placed in the spotlight , they have hopes built up , and then these dreams may come crashing down in front of millions .
A couple years ago , players from Coon Rapids , MN were caught spitting on their hands before they shook hands with the team that had just defeated them .
I remember the same thing happening periodically when I was a kid , but when it 's caught on national tv , it becomes a major issue .
3 ) Temper tantrums .
The LLWS is not immune from emotional blowouts , whether it be from coaches or players .
4 ) Overinvolved parents .
So what do we conclude about the merits of the LLWS ?
Should youth sports be televised nationally ?
What does this say about our culture ?
Although I 'm not sure the attention these youngsters receive is warranted , nor do I think it may be healthy for their long - term development , I 'm also unaware of research that documents the negative effects of playing in the LLWS .
Furthermore , these games provide a unique opportunity for us to discuss important lessons with our children .
There is a layer of separation when we talk with our kids about steroids in baseball , or a major league manager getting kicked out of a game for arguing .
Talking to our children about sportsmanship , , or when they are watching other kids play in the LLWS may have a more lasting impression because these issues may seem more real to them .
Understanding that whether they are on national tv or down at the local little league field , sportsmanship , honesty , respect , and always matter will serve our children well in all that they do in life .
If you had to teach someone who had never used a computer before on how to open a word processor , write a document , save and share that document with others , how would you begin ?
You might show them how doing these tasks on a computer are similar to their analog counterparts .
How do you teach someone to configure a wireless network and connect to the internet if the very concepts of a network or the internet are foreign ?
On top of that , how do you create software that encourages learning through exploration , trial , and error ?
This was the task set before the software developers at One Laptop per Child , and now at SugarLabs .
Have they succeeded ?
Or has it all been a costly mistake .
To say that the technology industry moves quickly would be understated .
Firms must innovate , adapt and grow , or fail .
Two years ago when One Laptop per Child began shipping their XO - 1 laptop , they defined an industry .
People were excited not for OLPC 's mission , which always seemed to be a footnote , but for a diminutive inexpensive laptop .
Often , the laptop was stated to include a custom distribution of Linux called Sugar that was built to help kids learn .
But Sugar is more than just a Linux distro .
Sugar is actually two different things .
Consider this analogy :
When we use a computer running Microsoft Windows , we think of the entire experience to be that of ' Windows ' .
We do n't make a distinction between the operating system and the user interface elements , even though Microsoft 's UI has a name : Aero .
This concept is reversed with the XO laptops .
The operating system is based on Fedora Linux with a revolutionary user interface called Sugar .
But with such tight integration between the user interface and the operating system , the distinction is blurred , and it 's been causing some headaches at OLPC .
When Sugar get things right , it 's a phenomenal experience .
This is in thanks to well ordered and detailed human interface guidelines which help create a unified experience between applications .
Moreover , it is also perhaps the biggest insight in to their thoughts on representing computing paradigms to a class of user who has little to no experience with advanced technology .
This is best summarized straight out of the guidelines :
Low floor , no ceiling : this mantra should guide your development efforts for OLPC .
All activities and interfaces should be designed in such a way as to be simple and intuitive to users of all age groups , nationalities , and levels of computer experience .
At the same time , we do n't wish to impose unnecessary limitations on the software either .
Instead , we hope to create a platform suitable for all kinds of creative expression which provides a low floor to the inexperienced , but does n't impose a ceiling upon those who are .
This is a worthy goal , but will require a genuine effort on the part of developers , who must take many aspects of design into account .
These guidelines also call for an element of simplicity in the applications which serve several purposes .
First , they help to lower the floor as described above , making applications simple to start using allowing for growth and exploration from there .
And secondly , they help to keep the applications running smoothly and briskly on relatively underpowered hardware .
Over the past few years , it 's been easy for software developers to get carried away .
As technology has advanced , things like memory and disk utilization have lost focus in software development because it 's easier and cheaper not to .
Our computers are fast enough and memory abundant enough that developers do n't need to spend as much time optimizing code as they would have a decade ago .
But when thrust in an environment with a 400 Mhz processor and 256 Mb of RAM , simplicity is an important mantra to cite .
Prior to powering on my XO laptop for the first time , I was n't really prepared for the ' lightbulb ' moments that were to come .
I 've worked in the IT field for over 12 years and have experience in most operating systems including Linux .
The evolution of the user interface , regardless of the operating system , has n't been very revolutionary .
The concepts are fairly common across all distributions , whether Windows , Macintosh , or Linux .
We have files , folders , windows , drop - down menus , etc .
These have existed for years and popularized by the Mac in 1984 .
Since then , all innovation has been evolutionary , and its difficult to think of using computers any other way .
But with Sugar , suddenly there 's something truly different .
At first , the experience was maddening .
How do I save a file ?
How do I configure networking ?
The XO does n't ship with a manual , per se , as interacting with the laptop is part of the learning through experimentation ideas that are at the heart of Constructivism , the learning theory behind much of OLPC 's mission .
But each time I solved the problem , the lightbulb would go off .
I began to see a new paradigm for computing , one that did n't require the methods those of us in the developed world have used for the past two decades .
For example , Sugar uses a Journal to keep track of everything you do .
It 's similar to the feature of the Wii where you can see every game and app you use that day on it 's calendar , and how much time you spent on that game or app .
Taking the concept one step further , when you save a file in Sugar , you are saving it to the Journal .
If you want to work on the file again , go to the journal and click on the item .
Compare this to the file and folder structure we 're all used to .
Files and folders are n't complicated , but they 're rooted in a physical system that we 've been using since file cabinets were invented , and likely before that .
It 's an analogy that has been created in operating systems to help make them more accessible or understandable by a non-technical person , but an analogy that would fail in a remote village in Africa who do n't have much experience with the real - world counterparts .
So why has n't Sugar taken off in the past 2 years ?
Fundamentally , it 's been tied to the XO Laptop and the One Laptop per Child program .
And that program has unfortunately been faltering in the marketplace .
There have been missteps in executing the company 's vision , acknowledged by it 's founder , Nicholas Negroponte .
These include competition by Intel in it 's Classmate PC program , OLPC 's ignorance as to how the targeted developing nations coordinate purchasing ( they do n't ) , and a failure to get the hardware cost to the targeted $ 100 price point .
In a ZDNet Asia interview , Negroponte also pointed to Sugar itself as a problem , stating :
" [ T ]he biggest mistake was not having Sugar run as an application " on a vanilla Linux laptop " , said OLPC founder and chairman Nicholas Negroponte .
" Sugar should have been an application [ residing ] on a normal operating system .
But what we did ... was we had Sugar do the power management , we had Sugar do the wireless management –it became sort of an omelet .
The Bios talked directly with Sugar , so Sugar became a bit of a mess . "
But others have come to Sugar 's defense .
OLPC News considers Sugar as one of the defining elements of the XO laptop in the market place .
And Ivan Krstić , the former Director of Security Architecture at One Laptop per Child calls out the errors of Negroponte 's statements on his blog .
In it he reminds us that Sugar has become the name for two different aspects of the XO :
The user interface and the operating system .
And problems with the XO - 1 , including keyboard and networking issues , are n't the result of Sugar or Fedora Linux .
Krstić says , " It has a lot to do with the choice of incompetent hardware vendors that provided half - assedly built , unsupported and unsupportable components with broken closed - source firmware blobs that OLPC could neither examine nor fix . "
Whether these problems are addressed as OLPC continues it 's efforts with the XO - 1.5 and XO - 2 remain to be seen .
But in May of this year , OLPC spun off the Sugar development team and SugarLabs was founded .
Over the past few months , they 've been nearing completion of their Sugar On a Stick project .
This project allows you to download a bootable Fedora 11 image to a memory stick and boot any PC into the Sugar environment without changing anything on that PC .
This removes the dependency of Sugar on the XO - 1 laptop and will increase exposure to Sugar .
Families looking for a safe way for their kids to play on a computer without messing up their Windows installation could easily boot their computer to Sugar .
And hopefully organizations around the world who are looking for educational software for used or donated hardware can turn to SugarLabs for a lightweight software platform that is geared towards learning .
Sugar has been ambitious and it's heartening to see the developers continuing these efforts independent of OLPC .
Conversely , I hope that OLPC continues to look to SugarLabs for the software that can power it 's laptops .
It 's a partnership built out of a singular vision to bring accessible computing to children all over the world .
And it 's a partnership that needs to succeed .
Because access to information and inspiring creativity and self expression are some of the most important values people all over the world should aspire to .
If you have experiences using Sugar or Sugar on a Stick , or would just like to discuss this article , feel free to comment below .
We 'd like to hear from you !
GeekDad has also covered OLPC 's vision and the XO - 1 hardware in previous articles in this series .

S o , Stephen Harper and his ministers were defending possible war crimes and crimes against humanity , while Michael Ignatieff and senior Liberals were staying mostly mum .
And much of our mainstream media were averting their gaze from , or excusing , the possible crimes .
Now , no less an authority than Richard Goldstone , former chief prosecutor with the war crimes tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda , says that the three - week Israeli onslaught on Gaza eight months ago amounted to " war crimes and possibly , in some respects , crimes against humanity . "
Releasing his report Tuesday , he said : " As a Jew with a long - standing affiliation with Israel , it 's obviously a great disappointment to me , to put it mildly , that Israel behaved as described in the report . "
His four - member United Nations panel found that both Israeli and Palestinian groups committed war crimes , the latter by rocketing Israeli civilian areas .
But the panel reserved its harshest judgments for Israel : Its Dec. 27 - Jan. 18 attack was " directed at the people of Gaza as a whole , " not just at Hamas militants ( as Israel claimed ) .
In fact , Israeli operations were " carefully planned in all their phases as a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish , humiliate and terrorize a civilian population , radically diminish its local economic capacity to work and to provide for itself , and to force upon it an ever increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability . "
Israel was following its Dahiya Doctrine – " the application of disproportionate force and the causing of great damage and destruction to civilian property and infrastructure , and suffering to civilian populations . "
Goldstone has pronounced Israel guilty of :
Goldstone urged the UN Security Council to ask both the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to hold transparent investigations and report back in six months .
Failing that , the council should turn the matter over to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court .
Israel had boycotted the panel and refused it entry into Israel .
Panellists entered Gaza via Egypt for inspections and interviews .
They went to Jordan to meet Palestinian Authority officials from the West Bank .
They heard testimony from Israelis , including some victims of Hamas attacks , by flying them to Geneva .
The 575 - page report ( Adobe Reader required ) – based on 188 interviews , 10,000 pages of documentation , 1,200 photographs and satellite imagery – is not easily dismissed .
But Israel and its defenders are trying , with a smear campaign :
What else would you expect from a report done for the anti-Israeli UN Human Rights Council ?
Where was the need for a UN inquiry when Israel has conducted more than 100 of its own ?
The former South African Supreme Court and Constitutional Court judge is not easily cowed into silence .
" It is grossly wrong to label a mission or to label a report critical of Israel as being anti-Israel . "
He urges " fair - minded people " to read the report for themselves .
( Go to the UN website , UN.org , and search for the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza conflict . )
Goldstone 's report is a condemnation not only of Israel but also its apologists in Canada , including the media .
The latter are now busy burying the report under an orchestrated avalanche of negative reaction without ever properly reporting its contents .

ARLINGTON , Texas --
The first game at the Cowboys Stadium set an NFL regular - season attendance record with a crowd of 105,121 on Sunday night .
The game between the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys broke the previous mark of 103,467 between Arizona - San Francisco in Mexico City in 2005 .
The crowd included up to 30,000 fans in standing - room party plazas at either end of the stadium .
The stadium has about 75,000 seats .
The record for an NFL game in the United States was 103,985 for the Super Bowl between Steelers and Rams at the Rose Bowl in January 1980 .
The largest crowd to watch any NFL game was 112,376 in a preseason matchup between the Cowboys and Houston Oilers in Mexico City in 1994 .
There was also a crowd of 105,840 in Chicago for an exhibition between the Bears and a college all - star team in 1947 .
WASHINGTON -- AT&T Inc. alleged Friday that Google Inc.'s Google Voice service is improperly preventing consumers from calling certain phone numbers , in violation of federal call - blocking rules .
In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission , the phone giant accused Google of violating rules designed to ensure phone companies connect all calls .
AT&T also accused Google of violating " net neutrality " principles , which are designed to ensure consumers can use any legal Internet services they want .

Child molester gets multiple life sentences
In a statement , Chester Stiles critical of law enforcement and his defense attorneys
Convicted child molester Chester A. Stiles will spend the rest of his life behind bars .
Stiles was sentenced to life in prison on 21 of 22 charges Friday after being convicted in March on 22 counts of lewdness and sexual assault with two little girls .
He will be eligible for parole in 140 years .
Stiles was convicted March 3 on 10 counts of lewdness with a child under the age of 14 , 11 counts of sexual assault with a minor under 14 , and one count of attempted sexual assault with a minor under 14 for sexually molesting two girls , ages 2 and 6 , in 2003 .
He received an additional eight to 20 years on the attempted sexual assault conviction .
Stiles ' attorneys said they are planning an appeal .
Wearing a Clark County Detention Center shirt , blue pants , and bright orange socks and sandals , Stiles read a prepared statement .
He criticized law enforcement , the prosecution and his defense , slamming his lawyers because " the truth was not considered as a viable defense strategy . "
He also criticized Nevada statutes that , he said , punish child abusers more harshly than murderers .
" I was convicted on 10 counts of lewdness with a minor , which carries 10 ( years ) to life , and 11 counts of sexual assault , which carries 20 to life .
Twenty - one life sentences for a 12 - minute videotape .
" I say this for my family , my son and the people who care about me -- a 12 - minute videotape that shows no use of force .
No drugs , no violence or brutality .
There are no tears , no threats , no blood .
Indeed , a doctor could not find evidence of molestation and the child did not remember any event .
Yet I 'm to die in prison .
So legislation dictates that a child 's virtue has more value than life itself .
" We see murderers getting a 10 - year sentence in this town , while I incurred 21 life sentences for a non-violent act . "
Before District Court Judge Jennifer P. Togliatti handed down the sentence , Deputy District Attorney Mary Kay Holthus argued that the life sentences should be served consecutively .
" To me , what he has done -- what he has put this family through , these children through , and quite frankly , all of society through -- he should spend every year , every month , every week , every hour of every day that this court can give him behind bars , ” she said .
“ And we should never have to worry if Mr. Stiles will get out and molest another child . "
Holthus said that although Stiles had mentioned incidents of rape and sexual abuse in his own childhood , that fact should n't warrant sympathy .
" You know how bad it made you feel -- why do you go on and do it ?
Why do you victimize other kids ? ” she said .
“ I do n't get how you come from that and end up being there . "
She read a letter in court from the mother of the youngest victim .
The girl 's family was in the courtroom .
" My family has suffered greatly for the crime that has happened .
Sleepless nights , worries , stress nightmares .
I worry every day that she will remember what happened , and how that will affect her everyday life , " Holthus said while reading the woman ’s letter .
" This man has hurt my family so much , there are no words for it . "
Stiles videotaped himself molesting the toddler , who has no memory of what happened .
That videotape was played for the jury during Stiles ' trial .
Her case prompted a national manhunt after the tape was found in the desert in 2007 and police released images to identify the man and the child .
" Not only did he molest that 2 - year - old , but he had to record it and memorialize it for all time .
So it 's never going away -- it will always exist and it is n't something we can just imagine .
It 's something that those of us who 've had to see it , that we 'll never unseen , " Holthus said .
The other girl , now a young teenager , was n't videotaped and testified about the assault during the trial .
She was not present Friday during sentencing .
Nineteen of the charges stemmed from acts on the tape .
Three stemmed from the separate assault of the 6 - year - old .
The cases were tried together .
Stiles also faces federal charges of producing child pornography , which could carry a sentence of 15 to 30 years in federal prison .
His federal trial was scheduled to begin earlier this month but was postponed until August .
Stacey Roundtree , one of Stiles ' public defenders , said the federal charges could be dropped in light of the sentences he received today .
She said Stiles ’ history of sexual abuse should be a factor in his sentencing .
" Punishing him as you would punish a serial killer is not appropriate in this case , " she said .
" Mr. Stiles was in fact a victim of sexual abuse .
It is a fact and it is a factor in this case .
It is n't anything that by any means Mr. Stiles wants the court to say is an excuse for a crime , but it is a mitigating circumstance that this court should consider . "

Male grey - headed flying foxes maintain harems of females
Researchers have discovered a secret of sexual success for flying foxes .
Males with relatively high levels of testosterone in their blood are better able to maintain their " harem " of choosy females , says a study .
The authors report in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters that this link is only evident during breeding season .
A better understanding of the reproduction and behaviour of these bats , say biologists , could help efforts to conserve them .
Every metre of branch that you see is someone 's territory
Stefan Klose , biologist
The team studied grey - headed flying foxes , which are fruit - eating bats that live in colonies of up to 20,000 animals .
" This species is in decline , " said lead author Stefan Klose from the University of Ulm in Germany .
" And flying foxes disperse seeds so they 're really important for ecosystems . "
Dr Klose and his colleagues studied a colony of the flying foxes in New South Wales , Australia .
" In these colonies you see flying foxes hanging everywhere - it looks absolutely random , but that 's not the case , " Dr Klose told BBC News .
" Every metre of branch that you see is someone 's territory .
And within that [ male 's ] territory , there is a group of females .
The size of that group depends on the attractiveness of the male . "
Dr Klose and his team counted the number of females in each male 's harem then captured a group of males using a special device to remove the bats directly from their branches .
" We kept the males in captivity for three days , and during that time we took a blood sample to determine the testosterone levels , " explained Dr Klose .
" Then we released the males back into the colony and watched where they went . "
During the mating period , males with high testosterone were better able to reclaim their harems .
" This was when all the matings took place - when it really mattered , " said Dr Klose .
He explained that one of the roles of testosterone , which is the primary male sex hormone , is the mediation of aggression .
So a male with high testosterone levels is likely to have more confrontations with other males .
Males with higher levels of testosterone are likely to be more aggressive " If you can afford high testosterone because you 're strong and you 're very healthy , then you 're able to reap the benefits , " explained Dr Klose .
" So you will potentially get a lot of females in your territory and have a lot of offspring . "
He also suggested that a larger territory might be a " quality indicator " to females .
" It 's all about female choice , " Dr Klose said .
" So you could imagine that the females think that if a male is able to defend a large territory in an attractive location , he must really be a hotshot . "
He also stressed that the work could inform conservation efforts , as there are often attempts to relocate flying fox colonies away from residential areas .
" People use smoke and noise to drive them away , because they perceive them as noisy or stinky , " said Dr Klose .
" But when we released our males , all of them returned to their colonies . "
Ignacio Moore , an animal behaviour scientist from Virginia Tech in the US , who was not involved in this study described it as " a nice example of basic physiology and behaviour being useful for conservation " .
" The implication is that relocating the animals during the breeding season will not work , as they will simply return , " he told BBC News .
Flying foxes live in colonies of up to 20,000 animals " Suitable habitat must be made available before the breeding season for the animals to inhabit . "
Elizabeth Atkins - Regan , a biologist from Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , pointed out that age could also be a factor in the animals ' ability to keep their harems .
" Perhaps older males have higher testosterone and also are more successful at regaining harems , " she said .
" It 's hard to know whether the higher testosterone is the cause of the greater success , or whether success is due to something else like experience .
I very much hope the authors will continue this research to find out whether there is a causal relationship . "

By his own admission , and the intimations of others , he has a temper too .
I saw flashes of it during the first day of shooting for the season opener .
As each shot was being rehearsed on the Sterling Cooper set — at 10,000 square feet it ’s nearly as big as a real office — Weiner would descend from the production suite with four or five of his writers trailing him like ducklings .
During one scene he became frustrated with an actor ’s performance , telling the director , Phil Abraham , with an edge in his voice , “ I hate what he ’s doing , ” and balling his hands into fists , almost as if he were on the verge of a tantrum , though he quickly defused himself , and with a little gentle coaxing , he and Abraham got the performance they wanted .
Interviewing Weiner is a heady experience .
Oblique as Mad Men can sometimes be , resistant as the show is to explaining its characters ’ behavior or having them mouth talking points , Weiner is not .
“ I always tell this about Matt , ” said Jon Hamm .
“ It ’s impossible to get anything out of him , unless you do one thing : ask him .
Because he loves to talk , and he will eventually spill his guts about everything , because he ’s so excited about it . ”
Which is n’t to say his thoughts come out in linear equations .
Ask him a question and he ’ll consider it from numerous angles , turning it over and over , returning to answers to amend or expand on , perfectly content to live with contradictions , as with this summation after a long analysis of Don ’s and Betty ’s motives during a particular scene , which struck me as a kind of mission statement : “ Anytime you can have a character wanting something and not wanting something , I feel like I ’m in my life , and I hopefully am in the audience ’s life . ”
It follows , perhaps , that he does n’t wear success easily .
At one point he brings up the show ’s stylized title sequence , which depicts Don Draper standing in a dissolving office and then plummeting into a glass - and - steel Manhattan canyon , taunted by glimpses of the good life as seen in old magazine ads .
“ That ’s what the titles are about : Don looks perfect and he ’s in trouble inside , ” Weiner told me .
“ He ’s in trouble and you really ca n’t tell .
I feel that way , and I know other men feel that way , too . ”
( Well , ahem , maybe … )
A few minutes later , after a question about his creative process , a long answer winds up here : “ I start with me , like any writer .
I start with what I ’m feeling , what I identify with — like Don , I ’m trying to hold on to what I have .
He invented himself .
He is always going to be presenting something to the outside world that ’s not who he is .
You do n’t have to be from his background to understand that .
In fact , all you have to do , really , is to have any success at all and you immediately feel like a fraud — most of us , right ? ”
Whatever Weiner ’s demons , they work for him .
“ Matthew writes from this place that ’s very personal , ” Scott Hornbacher , the co–executive producer , told me .
“ I ’m always amazed at his lack of inhibition , which sort of pours out into the characters and onto the page . ”
To hear the show ’s writers discuss Weiner ’s creative process , it ’s almost as if the Mad Men world and its ongoing narratives exist fully formed somewhere deep in the recesses of Weiner ’s mind , tangible but elusive , like dreams half remembered upon waking .
He retrieves fragments and shards and brings them into the writers ’ room , to use as building blocks for larger dramas .
“ There is some of it that is , frankly , mysterious , ” said Lisa Albert , a writer - producer who has been with the series for all three seasons .
“ Like , Matt will have an image in his mind , and he ’s not sure why , and we sit around and talk about it and try and figure out why this thing keeps coming in his mind . ”
She and the other writers mentioned an image of a beautiful cracked glass that Weiner kept seeing , which eventually prompted a key moment in the second - season episode where Don , on a business trip in Los Angeles , takes off with some jet - setters for a seductive but unsettling lark in Palm Springs .
In the recounting , it sounded as if nearly the entire episode grew from the seed of that initial image ( with the added fertilizer of a book of Slim Aarons photos given to Weiner by someone he had met on a plane ) .
“ I count on my subconscious to be consistent , ” Weiner told me .
“ And how that works I have no fucking idea , and I do n’t even want to investigate it .
Because if I lose that I have nothing to say . ”
I will note here that the third - season premiere deals in images of motherhood , breasts , and milk .
Hamm “ has this wonderful sadness and lost quality in his eyes , ” said director Alan Taylor .
“ It ’s a rare quality for a strapping leading man . ” Photograph by Annie Leibovitz ; Styled by Michael Roberts .
At times the show exists on such a subconscious or instinctual level that Weiner ’s directives can leave his collaborators puzzled .
Betty Draper is played by January Jones , whose Grace Kelly looks — with a frosting of Eva Marie Saint — have distracted some critics from the heartbreaking shadows in her performance .
( “ She ’s so affectless that people wonder to what degree she ’s actually playing the part , ” said Tim Hunter , who has directed six episodes of the show . )
Before shooting began on the second season , during which Betty would finally confront Don about his infidelities and throw him out of the house , Weiner suggested the actress read “ Ariel , ” the poem by Sylvia Plath — an abstract howl of female rage and despair .
“ It confused me and freaked me out , ” Jones said .
Not knowing the coming plotlines ( Weiner may not have , either , at that point ) , she assumed this was his way of telling her Betty would be sticking her head in an oven for the season finale .
MADRID , Spain ( CNN ) --
A man died after being gored in the neck during the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona , Spain , the Navarra regional government said Friday on its Web site .
Runners take part in the running of the bulls in Pamplona , Spain on July 9 .
The death would be the first in the running of the bulls since a 22 - year - old American was gored to death in 1995 .
The latest victim was a Spanish man , Daniel Jimeno Romero , age 27 , from the Madrid area who was vacationing in Pamplona with his family , CNN partner station CNN + reported from the hospital , where authorities identified him .
He was rushed to the hospital in cardiac arrest and underwent surgery but died soon after , said the statement from the regional government , whose capital is Pamplona .
Watch man try to scramble away from bull »
Amateur video footage showed the victim falling to the ground toward the end of race , just before the entrance to the bullring , and apparently being gored in the neck .
Three other runners were gored and suffered less serious injuries on Friday , and six others went to the hospital with bruises or other injuries , the Navarra government said .
Emergency workers and ambulances line the route to quickly attend those who fall .
Do you think this tradition should be banned ?
The run in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s in his book " The Sun Also Rises , " also published under the title " Fiesta . "
The event is held July 7 - 14 .
Six bulls and a pack of tame steers run from the corrals , through Pamplona 's old town , to the bullring -- where the bulls will die later in the day in a bullfight .
Including the recent death , 14 people have been killed in the runs since 1924 , when record - keeping began .

BART sets strike for midnight Sunday BART
A BART turnstiles awaits the next wave of commuters at Embarcadero station during early morning rush hours in San Francisco Monday morning , June 29 , 2009 .
BART and its two largest unions have agreed to extend labor contract through July 9 to continue ongoing new contract negotiations and forestall possible strike which would cripple the regions traffic and public transportation system .
BART currently carries approximately 355,000 riders on a daily basis .

BART workers will strike beginning at midnight Sunday , the union that represents train operators and station agents announced this afternoon .
The union made the announcement after the BART board of directors voted unanimously today to immediately impose work rules on the 900 - member Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555 .
BART 's daily ridership averages about 340,000 and those passengers will need to find a new mode of transportation come Monday morning .
BART 's board of directors expressed remorse that they had to unilaterally impose a new contract , which would give management the ability to impose new work rules and would require members of the ATU to pay into their own retirement system , which would equate to about 7 percent of their salary .
" We can't keep going through deadline after deadline after deadline ... Something has to give .
We can't continue the bleeding at this agency , " said director Lynette Sweet .
She and other directors encouraged the union to come back to the negotiating table .
Contract talks between BART management and ATU broke down Wednesday night with management declaring an impasse when the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555 rejected management 's " last , best and final offer , " said BART spokesman Linton Johnson .
Hunt disputes that the two sides are at impasse and said his union may go to court to fight whether they are legally at impasse and are considering asking the governor to intervene .
" We believe the gap between the parties is not unbridgeable , " Hunt said .
" We believe there are still negotiations to be done . "
Johnson , however , stood firm in his stance that the negotiations are at an impasse and expressed confidence that a court would agree with BART management .
Two other BART unions , Service Employees International 1021 and American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees Local 3993 ratified their contracts this week .
Combined , their memberships account for nearly double the number of workers represented by the Amalgamated Transit Union .
The leaders of those two unions said they would honor the picket line .
BART faces a projected $ 310 million deficit over the next four years , and management wanted to cut labor costs by $ 100 million over that period to help balance the budget .
The agency raised fares and cut service starting July 1 .
PORTSMOUTH , N.H. 
Fans and foes of President Obama ’s push to overhaul health care descended on a local high school here on Tuesday to challenge him and hear him fight back against the criticisms  some outlandish  that have slowed the legislation ’s progress .
“ Parasites ! ” yelled the protesters on the right side of the school driveway .
“ Ignorants ! ” yelled the protesters on the left side .
While apparently failing to convert the people outside who protested from the right side of the driveway , Mr. Obama sought to reassure the people gathered inside the school gymnasium that a health care overhaul does not mean that Americans will lose coverage or surrender treatment decisions to the government .
“ Where we do disagree , let ’s disagree over things that are real , not these wild misrepresentations that bear no resemblance to anything that has actually been proposed , ” Mr. Obama told the meeting , attended by about 1,800 people .
Repeat after the Toronto Port Authority .
This is not the 2003 bridge debate .
This is not the 2003 bridge debate .
This is not the 2003 bridge debate .
" It 's like comparing mountain climbing and scuba diving , " board chairman Mark McQueen said yesterday .
In what way ?
" Bridges and tunnels , " McQueen said in an interview , with an air of nonchalant finality .
After a moment 's pause , he elaborated .
Unlike a bridge , no taxpayer can call a pedestrian tunnel an eyesore .
Unlike a bridge , no sailor can call a tunnel an obstacle .
And in 2003 , when David Miller was running for mayor on a promise to kill a proposed bridge to the island airport , Porter Airlines existed only in the dreams of chief executive Robert Deluce .
Now , as the port authority awaits word on its bid for federal stimulus funding for a proposed pedestrian tunnel , Porter is a popular entity that flies about 500,000 passengers a year .
" I do n't think it 's similar at all , " Deluce concurred .
Yet many of the key players from the last battle have returned for this one .
Miller the would - be bridge slayer is now Miller the would - be tunnel terminator .
Deluce the bridge backer is now Deluce the passageway proponent .
Community AIR , the residents ' group that vocally opposed the bridge , is now vocally opposing the tunnel .
The issue , once more , is whether Torontonians see the intensification of air traffic on the island as a boon or a problem .
Though Deluce said he does not think installing a tunnel would " necessarily affect the total number of passengers "
Porter flies , port authority chair McQueen said the proposal is expressly designed to allow Porter to serve more people .
" I would hope so , " he said in an interview .
" That 's the point . "
" If that 's true , " said Community AIR chair Brian Iler , " it 's the same fight as 2003 all over again . "
There is at least one more major difference between the tunnel debate and the bridge debate .
In 2003 , Deluce and the port authority argued the bridge was essential to the success of the airport .
Yesterday , Deluce and McQueen praised the performance of the current ferry system , saying a tunnel would merely be a preferable alternative .
" It should serve as a good supplement to the ferry , " Deluce said .
" One thing that 's certain is that it'll ... ensure we 've got reliable and consistent access to the airport . "
The tunnel proposal , McQueen said , did not even exist until February , when the port authority saw opportunity in the stimulus fund announced in the federal budget .
Iler and New Democrat MP Olivia Chow , whose Trinity - Spadina riding includes the airport , call the tunnel an inappropriate use of taxpayer money given the adequacy of the ferries and the existence of pressing infrastructure needs .
The ferry ride to the airport takes only 90 seconds .

" If your house is leaking , you go and fix the roof first .
You do n't go and build a greenhouse , " Chow said .
" Money is tight ...
We should focus on potholes , the Gardiner , our old sewage system , community centres , libraries .
There 's a $ 500 million backlog of infrastructure that needs repairs . "
The port authority says the project will cost $ 38 million .
It is seeking $ 19 million from the federal infrastructure stimulus fund and $ 12 million from the provincial government to augment $ 7 million from its own coffers .
The tunnel must be built by April 2011 to qualify for stimulus money .
Tsunami advisory issued for Bay Area

A tsunami advisory has been issued for tonight along the Bay Area oceanfront and the rest of coastal California because of an 8.3 earthquake that struck American Samoa .
The National Weather Service 's tsunami warning center issued the advisory for the coast from the Mexican border to the Oregon - Washington border .
The center said no widespread inundation was expected for any of the areas under the advisory , but that large waves and strong currents could lead to dangerous conditions .
The center said a tsunami is possible along the San Francisco coast and nearby areas starting around 9:30 p.m .
The threat will last for several hours , the center said .
People should stay out of the water and move off the beach and coastal harbors and marinas , the center said .
No evacuations have been ordered .
A tsunami with a wave height between 20 centimeters and 65 centimeters above normal tide levels is likely , the center said .
" Expect the water to be a little higher than normal , " said Dan Gudgel , a meteorologist with the National Weather Service , adding that minor damage to the coast could be expected .
" It could generate some strong currents along the coast , " he said .
" But that does n't mean it is n't dangerous . "
A wave surge after a similar advisory was issued in 2006 damaged boats harbored in Santa Cruz , Gudgel said .
A tsunami that struck American Samoa shortly after today 's earthquake killed at least 14 people .
This morning , the Official Google Blog announced that the search giant has acquired reCAPTCHA .
The company provides a service that combines two things that Google would be very interested in : it verifies that information provided to a server has been entered by a human and , in the process , helps identify difficult - to - decipher text from book digitization projects .
As such , it 's a natural fit for Google .
The basic premise of the reCAPTCHA service is based on two related computer science problems .
Book digitization efforts rely on the ability of optical character recognition ( OCR ) software to help extract the text from a scanned image of a page .
For a variety of reasons — damage to a book , improperly placed pages , unusual fonts , etc. — this process fails at a certain rate , leaving an incomplete digitization .
The problem of identifying distorted or partially obscured characters faced by the OCR software is precisely the same problem faced by botnets that attempt to propagate spam by opening e-mail accounts with online services or posting ads in comments on blogs .
To do so , they have to overcome CAPTCHAs ( Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart , for the curious ) by identifying characters that have been distorted and placed over a complex background .
In short , would - be spammers also need to overcome an OCR problem .
reCAPTCHA is an attempt to solve both problems at once .
The service takes images of text that were not successfully processed by OCR programs , and repurposes them for use as CAPTCHAs , since they 're already known to fool the sort of software that 's used by botnets .
If actual humans can decipher them , the results are fed back to the book digitization project , filling in the blanks in older texts .
The service started out as an academic project , and its lead , Luis von Ahn , has published papers that describe its success in defeating botnets and aiding in digitization .
He also launched an extension of the service into the audio realm that uses recordings of historic radio broadcasts .
von Ahn told Ars that , although reCAPTCHA started as an academic project , it was later spun out as a company .
Now , the whole reCAPTCHA team will be moving into Google , where von Ahn will become a Google employee while remaining on the faculty at Carnegie Mellon .
" I will continue advising graduate students , but on projects not related to Google , " he told Ars .
When asked whether reCAPTCHA was being used for Google 's book digitization efforts , von Ahn responded " Not until now . "
Still , it 's a natural fit , given that Google will happily consume both services provided by reCAPTCHA : the identity verification and the improved digitization .
Given that Google may soon be a major purveyor of older books , there 's no reason to think that it wo n't continue to offer the service to third parties , as well .

The member of Congress who yelled that the president was a liar during the speech was Rep. Joe Wilson ( R ) of South Carolina .
Here ’s his official website .
I ca n’t think of anything like it in recent history .
Here ’s the video ( particularly note Pelosi ’s reaction . )
Jammie Thomas - Rasset has lost her retrial against the RIAA and was ordered to pay $ 1.92 million for 24 songs she shared via Kazaa .
The defense had argued that it might have been her children who shared the files instead of Thomas - Rasset , but the jury did n't buy this and found her guilty .
In 2007 a jury slapped the single mother with a $ 222,000 verdict in her case against the RIAA , which she later appealed .
When the case between Thomas - Rasset and the RIAA was declared a mistrial last year , the judge ruled that the fines were “ disproportionate to the damages suffered . ”
The case went up for re-trial before a new jury , who found her guilty and surprisingly handed out even harsher fines than in the first trial .
Thomas - Rasset was ordered to pay $ 80,000 per infringement mounting up to a total of $ 1.92 million in fines .
Thomas - Rasset , like many others , could n’t believe her ears when the court read out the verdict , and later said that it was “ kind of ridiculous ” .
Unlike most people , Thomas - Rasset never opted to settle with the RIAA , determining that she had the law on her side .
Unfortunately for her the jury in this landmark case ruled she did not .
“ We appreciate the jury ’s service and that they take this issue as seriously as we do , ” said Cara Duckworth , an RIAA spokeswoman .
“ We are pleased that the jury agreed with the evidence and found the defendant liable .
Since day 1 , we have been willing to settle the case and remain willing to do so . ”
In the US juries can hand out fines up to an unbelievable $ 150,000 per infringement on a single song .
The average settlement in related RIAA cases is around $ 3000 , which is peanuts considering this recent verdict .
In this light many people might be inclined to settle with the RIAA even when they do n’t even own a computer .
How ’s that for a business model ?
Finally , vegetables have a TV show of their very own .
Not human vegetables .
Do n't be daft .
This is way beneath them .
I 'm talking about actual vegetables : carrots , potatoes , turnips , cauliflowers … such is the target audience for Live From Studio Five ( Five , daily , 6.30 pm ) .
Clearly too stupid for human consumption , it is instead aimed squarely at cold , unfeeling lumps of organic matter with no discernible minds of their own .
And it succeeds brilliantly at keeping them entertained .
I watched last Monday 's episode in the company of a clump of broccoli , and it was held in a rapt silence throughout .
Well , most of the time .
To be honest , I think it drifted off a bit during a Backstreet Boys report .
And I had to slap it awake at the start of each ad break .
Apart from that , it was spellbound .
Yes , here is a TV show that makes any and all previous accusations of " dumbing down " seem like misplaced phoney - war hysteria .
A show providing less mental nourishment than a baby 's rattle .
A show with a running order Heat magazine would consider frighteningly lightweight .
A show which , incredibly , boasts Melinda Messenger as its intellectual touchstone .
A show dumber than a blank screen and a low hum .
Anyone who willingly tunes in to watch this really ought to be forced to work in the middle of a field for the rest of their life , well away from any technological devices ( such as motor vehicles or microwave ovens ) with which they might inadvertently cause harm to others .
In short : this is quite a stupid programme .
It 's hosted by Messenger , Ian Wright and Kate " The Apprentice " Walsh .
Inoffensive in isolation , once combined they demonstrate the sort of chemistry that could close down a public swimming pool for 25 years .
For one thing , they all stare and smile down the lens throughout , as though they 've been asked to imagine the viewer is a backward child at a birthday party .
Kate in particular grins like a woman being paid per square inch of revealed dentistry .
According to the official website the show is " a mix of celebrity interviews , gossip and banter wrapped around a popular news agenda that everyone 's talking about " .
In other words , it 's a torrent of flavourless showbiz porridge interspersed with occasional VTs about Ronnie Biggs or 12 - year - old sex change patients or whatever else the tabloids are moaning about .
Last week they managed to wring 12 punishing minutes out of the " Alesha Dixon on Strictly " debate , a story of interest only to people too dim to wipe themselves after a bowel movement without referring to an illustrated step - by - step instruction sheet at least six times during the process .
First we were treated to a report which summed up what the tabloids thought , including some vox pops in which random imbeciles shared their views .
Then it cut back to the studio , where the hosts summarised what we 'd just seen ( for the benefit of the more forgetful carrots in the audience ) , before reading out emails in which some different random imbeciles shared their views .
This was followed by a commercial break which included an advert encouraging people to read books .
When the hosts are n't smiling or introducing VTs , they 're sharing their opinions .
For instance , last week Ian Wright read out a story about David Hasselhoff 's alleged drink problem , and summed it up by saying , " Wossee playing at ?
I mean , sort it out ! "
Then he did a sort of open - palmed " it's - common - sense - innit " shrugging manoeuvre .
Thus the issue was settled in time for the Bananarama interview .
Still , knocking the hosts is pointless .
They 're hardly trying to present Newsnight .
But the VTs – astoundingly – are , in fact , created by actual news journalists .
Live From Studio Five is the product of Sky News .
Which makes it part of Five 's news quota .
This – in case I have n't yet repeated the word " news " often enough to hammer it home – is a news programme .
THIS IS THE NEWS .
Melinda Messenger , Ian Wright and Kate Walsh are PRESENTING THE NEWS .
In other words : welcome to the end of the world .
I learned this model from Robert Hall back in 1975 .
It can seem silly and trivial ; but it seemed to me then , and still seems to me now , to capture the essence of what is going on in " demand - side " macroeconomics , and to clarify points that both the general public and , I 'm sorry to say , quite a few Ph.D. economists often seem to find confusing .
It also maps pretty well into my favorite economic parable , the story of the baby - sitting coop ( " Baby - sitting the economy " ) that I have put to good use a number of times .
There is only one good , produced at constant returns by the single factor of production , labor .
Choose units so that one unit of labor produces one unit of the good ; then the price level and wage rate must be the same , and can be referred to with a single symbol , P .
There is also only one asset , money .
Agents start the current period with M dollars , and end with M ' after spending on consumption and earning from the sale of their labor .
They derive utility both from consumption and from the expected purchasing power of the money they hold at the end of the period .
( The utility of money presumably reflects its usefulness in providing future consumption ; but we sweep this implicit dynamic problem under the rug ) .
The utility function is assumed to take a specific form :
U = ( 1 - s ) ln( C ) + s ln ( M ' / Pe )
where
Pe is the expected price level .
However , consumers are also assumed to have static expectations , so that Pe = P .
Finally , people are assumed to be endowed with L units of labor .
First , let us consider the full - employment version of the model .
If labor is fully employed , then the budget constraint is
C + M'/ P = L + M/
P
But if the money supply is constant , M ' = M ; also , C = L.
Given the utility function , consumers will spend a share 1 - s of their initial wealth on goods , s on money .
So we can represent equilibrium either by the condition that demand for goods equal supply ,
L = ( 1-s ) ( L + M/P )
or by the condition that demand for money equal supply ,
M/P = s(L + M/P ) .
Both ways of looking at it imply the price - level equation
P = [ ( 1 - s ) / s ) ] ( M/L )
so the price level is proportional to the money supply .
But now let us introduce some rigidity of prices .
Suppose that for some reason - never mind why - the price ( wage ) level is fixed above the level consistent with full employment , so that real balances M/P are too low .
There are two ways of describing the problem this poses .
You could say that at full employment the demand for real balances would exceed the supply :
M/P < s(L + M/P )
Or you could say that at full employment aggregate demand would fall short of output :
( 1-s ) ( L + M/P ) < L
These are just different ways of looking at the same thing .
What must happen , then , is that output is demand - constrained .
But that in turn means that employment , and hence income , is also demand - constrained : the equation for consumption , which must equal output , is
C = ( 1-s ) ( C + M/P )
which has an immediately identifiable " multiplier " flavor .
The clear policy implication is that one should increase output by increasing the money supply ; after all ,
C = ( ( 1-s ) / s ) ( M/ P)
Or , to put it differently , the problem is that at full employment the public would want to hold more real balances than there are available ; and because P will not fall , M must be increased .
This is presumably the meaning of John Maynard Keynes ' famous remark in The General Theory :
" Unemployment develops , that is to say , because people want the moon : men cannot be employed when the object of desire ( i.e. money ) is something which cannot be produced and the demand for which cannot readily be choked off .
There is no remedy but to persuade the public that green cheese is practically the same thing and to have a green cheese factory ( i.e. central bank ) under public control . "
What is wrong with this model ?
Do n't get me started ... but actually there are three main objections that macroeconomists are likely to raise :
1 . What happened to the interest rate ?
For most purposes we will want at the minimum a theory of employment , interest , and money ; that means a model with bonds as well as money and goods , which means IS - LM .
( See my note " There 's something about macro " ) .
2 . More fundamentally , the quasi-static approach here is at best a crude approximation to a dynamic model in which behavior results from plans that are based on expectations about the future .
3 . Finally , the output effects of money come from the assumption of price rigidity .
Where does that come from ?
( Overwhelming empirical evidence , that 's where - but why ? ) .
All these objections help to set the agenda for the last six decades of research .
But if you are one of those people to whom macroeconomics always sounds like witchcraft , who is hung up on Say 's Law , who cannot even comprehend how a shortfall of aggregate demand is possible - then the world 's smallest macro model is a good place to start on the road to enlightenment .

Our political system is supposed to be set up to allow us to elect representatives that will look out for our best interests and defend against the inevitable tendency of those with the most wealth and power to exploit their advantage over the rest of us .
One look at the current state of politics in this country and its ’ pretty obvious the inevitable has happened .
So much so that those with the most wealth and power have literally taken control of our entire government and political process .
They have distorted the purpose of elections from a way to choose worthy representatives into a big sporting event to determine which of the two dominate political parties will control the purse strings in Congress .
They have successfully conned everyone into believing that the whole point is whether or not your ' party ' wins .
It ’s become nothing more than another big American sporting event .
If you doubt it , just imagine what a crowd screaming and yelling at a football game looks like and what a crowd at a major political convention looks like .
They may be dressed a bit better at the convention , but there ’s not much difference in the way they act .
And when the game is over , all we really get is to feel we either won or lost .
And really , nowadays , even the winning team starts to feel they actually lost as well .
When Congress resumes business , we see that absolutely nothing of consequence has changed for the people controlling the game .
For many , there is nothing more important than winning , getting ' their party 's people ' into office , regardless of whether or not those people are actually going to be the best people we can find .
In fact , we know most all the people we get to choose from have sold us out long before they ended up on the ballots .
We know full well we never get anything but a pile of opportunists and we get to pick the least bad choice .
Virtually all of them have been completely groomed to make sure business as usual continues in government .
They are primarily career politicians that know full well “ we the people ” have very little to do with who gets elected .
So we are to have a French health - care system without a French tradition of political protest .
It is odd that American liberalism , in a veritable state of insurrection during the Bush presidency , now seeks political quiescence .
These " townhallers " who have come forth to challenge ObamaCare have been labeled " evil - mongers " ( Harry Reid ) , " un - American " ( Nancy Pelosi ) , agitators and rowdies and worse .
First of all let me clarify , that if you are looking for a Symfony , CodeIgniter , CakePHP ..
etc article , this is not what you are looking for .
In this article you will find small and extra lightweight PHP frameworks that in some cases , can make your life easier .
Really .
Why use a framework ?
Because re-inventing the wheel again and again is something a productive ( note the word used : productive * ) developer , should not do .
By using a framework that supports the MVC patern ( Model , View , Controler ) , you can keep your code readable and understandable , you seperate application logic from presentation and many more things that would require more than an article to cover .
Kohana
We start our listing with the Kohana framework .
The Kohana team describes the framework as a PHP5 framework with support to the MVC architectural pattern that aims to be secure , lightweight and easy to use .
The full package sized only 1.5MB ( 629 KB compressed ) has everything you need to create great and fully functional php applications .
Some of the modules included are :
Archive – Compressed archive creation , supports zip , tar , gzip , and bzip .
– Compressed archive creation , supports zip , tar , gzip , and bzip .
Auth – Simple authentication and user management .
Uses ORM for models .
– Simple authentication and user management .

Gmaps – Google Maps integration , geolocation , and API support .
– Google Maps integration , geolocation , and API support .
Kodoc – Dynamic self - generated documentation .
( Beta ! )
– Dynamic self - generated documentation .
( Beta ! ) Payment – Provides merchant and payment gateway wrappers .
Supports Authorize.net , PayPal , Trident , Trust Commerce , and YourPay .
Great documentation ( Wiki based , this means that everyone can contribute .
Something like the PHP Manual , where user comments are the real documentation ) , excellent and small tutorials like : Creating a blog with Kohana Part 1 and Part 2 , make learning the kohana framework a lot easier .
Rapyd
Rapyd is another small php framework that can also be used as a library .
250 KB of compressed files with an uncomressed size of 484KB .
It is definetely impressive what you can do with it .
Some of it ’s features :
No compiling , no command line needed , just unzip , it will work .
PHP5 Strict
Modules support
Nice URLs ( SEO oriented )
Tiny MVC in few files
epicode
epicode is an extremely lightweight PHP framework .
It includes caching , session , database , form validation , twitter , oauth and asynchronous / non - blocking curl components .
EpiCode started off as an MVC framework but has evolved into a set of extremely useful tools .
Every tool is completely decoupled so they can be used independently or in conjunction .
Each library in EpiCode is thought out and implemented in an extremely cohesive manner .
The documentation can be found here .
Extra Light Framework
ELF PHP is a php framework with a very small footprint , built on Model - View - Controller architecture .
Believe it or not , PHP ELF is sized only 39 KB compressed and when extracted it ’s size is only 72 KB .
Although it ’s small size it features :
Caching system
URL Routing system
Logging system
Requests handler
Image manipulation class
Database abstractization
Minimal server load
and the plans for the Beta 3 include adding :
Validation class
Session class
Pagination class
File upload
Common scripts
Improved caching engine
Improved models
BaseApp
BaseApp Framework is aimed at individual commercial developers or small web application builders who need a starting point .
Also if you are a CakePHP
User you will find yourself at home with the API .
BaseApp was inspired by CakePHP
And Codeigniter but tries to do everything under 50 kb .
It has support for most common features available in frameworks these days but achieves all this in under 50 Kb of compressed Code and not MBs of it .
Some technical data :
PHP 5 with support for new features like autoloading etc .
Fully MVC ( But can be used as a library also ) .
CakePHP API ( 80 % ) and Layout .
Active Records and Object Relation Ship Mapping ( ORM ) .
Model Validation with complementing form helpers .
Data Abstraction Layer with Adodb Support ( Almost all databases supported ) .
Extensive Debugging and Exception Handling facilities ( FireBug Support Built in ) .
Extendable Cookie and Session Handling .
Search engine friendly and url routing features .
Ajax Support through Jquery .
The project is hosted on Google code .

The Obama administration ’s new missile defense plan is setting off a parochial battle on Capitol Hill with lawmakers concerned about a shift in federal contract money .
This week ’s announcement — calling for more flexible , sea - based missile deterrents -- is a boon for the Raytheon Co. and Lockheed Martin , which have significant missile defense operations in Arizona , Arkansas and New Jersey .
It is however bad news for the Boeing Co. and its congressional supporters in Alabama , where the company builds and manages its ground based missile interceptors .
ADVERTISEMENT
Presidentsaid Thursday he was dropping Bush - era plans to put ten , two - stage ground - based interceptors in Poland , a project that Boeing would have managed , and a related radar site in the Czech Republic , and it builds and manages the complex ground - based interceptor enterprise .
Boeing has key subcontractors - Orbital Sciences , Raytheon and Northrop Grumman .
Missile defense is less parochial and more ideological than most defense contract matters .
Most Republicans strongly support the ground - based interceptors that became a centerpiece of the Reagan administration while Democrats have generally been critical , saying they do n’t work well .
But politics ends for those whose districts depend greatly on the money generated by the program .
Boeing does most of the work on ground - based missile defense in freshman Rep. Parker Griffith ’s ( D - Ala . ) district of Huntsville .
Griffith won last year in a conservative district and has been worried for months that the administration ’s missile defense plans could hurt hundreds of jobs his district .
For its 2010 budget request , the Pentagon already slashed $ 2 billion from the ground missile defense program .
Earlier this summer Griffith voted against the 2010 defense authorization bill because of the cuts in missile defense , said his spokesman Sean Magers .
Now , with no prospects for ground interceptors in Europe , Griffith finds himself one of a small minority of Democrats questioning the move by the Obama White House .
“ The initial information that the White House is canceling our plans to construct interceptors in Poland and our radars in the Czech Republic is disturbing , ” Griffith said in a statement .
Griffith has reinforcements from Boeing ’s supporters in Missouri where the company has its Integrated Defense headquarters .
Sen . ( D - Mo. ) , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , has voiced concerns about “ scrapping ” the program , although she ’s also a strong Obama ally .
Senior defense authorizer Rep. Todd Akin ( R - Mo. ) is an outspoken supporter of the ground - based interceptor concept .
The Obama administration ’s plan is to deploy ships equipped with Lockheed Martin ’s Aegis combat system and Raytheon ’s Standard Missile - 3 or SM - 3 interceptors to help defend European allies and U.S. forces against threats from Iran and others .
Lockheed Martin does the work on the Aegis system in Moorestown , N.J. , the home district of Rep. John Adler ( D ) . The Pentagon is also looking to deploy sensors , such as Raytheon ’s Army Navy / Transportable Radar Surveillance system ( AN / TPY - 2 ) .
The Pentagon also seeks to develop and deploy a ground - based version of the SM - 3 .
Raytheon does most of the work on the missile in Tucson , Ariz . , and has already invested some of its own money into the development of a ground - based system .
But now the Pentagon is looking to fund those developments .
The research and development in that area is estimated to cost more than $ 3 billion , according to Gen.
James Cartwright , the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
The Pentagon ’s 2010 budget request seeks 250 Standard Missile - 3 interceptors and looks to increase the number of warships equipped with the Aegis system and the ability to launch the SM - 3 missiles from 21 to 27 .
The Pentagon slated about $ 50 million in 2010 for the development of the ground - based SM - 3 system .
Arizona Reps. Gabrielle Giffords ( D ) , a member of the House Armed Services Committee , and Raul Grijalva ( D ) share the Tucson district .
Giffords supports a strong missile defense budget , including ground - based interceptors .
For the 2010 election cycle Raytheon has already contributed $ 3,000 to the reelection campaigns of Giffords and Grijalva and its political action committee maxed out its contributions to $ 10,000 for both lawmakers in the 2008 elections .
Sen . ( R- Ariz. ) has questioned the new plan , as has his colleague Sen. Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) , who called the decision “ dangerous and shortsighted . ”
Kyl received $ 4,000 from Raytheon in 2008 .
Raytheon employees donated about $ 38,000 to McCain ’s presidential campaign .
By comparison Obama received close to $ 66,000 in campaign donations from Raytheon employees .
William Lynn , the Deputy Secretary of Defense , is a former Raytheon executive who received a waiver from the White House to be able to serve in the Pentagon , because he had been registered as a lobbyist .
Lynn divested all his interests in his former company before he was confirmed .
Meanwhile , the Senate requires him to adhere to strict ethics rule , including recusal for at least a year from any decisions related to his former company .
The deputy secretary of Defense is essentially the Pentagon ’s top manager not only making day - to - day decisions , but also decisions over what kind of weapons the Pentagon should buy .
Raw video : August 11/09 , Chicago .
Increased police patrols are promised in the area around Leland and Sheridan in Chicago 's Uptown neighborhood after " near riot - like " activity in the streets the past few nights .
Video from the area appears to show about a dozen people running back and forth in the street , breaking bottles and yelling .
One NBCChicago.com visitor wrote of " near riot - like gang fighting , " and said that shots were fired Thursday night at about 10:30 .
On the Web site UptownUpdate.com , commenters express fear and anger over the activity .
" This is by no means an isolated incident , " reads a comment by Michael .
" This same exact scene played out multiple times this Spring as well . " " We have had 3 nights in a row of this and never in my 10 years of living here have I seen it so bad , " wrote another resident .
" I 'm scared to walk my dog after 7:30 PM in this neighborhood !
Sad ! , " wrote " KenmoreResident .
"
In the video , purportedly shot Wednesday night , a squad car passes through and tells the crowd to disperse .
Later , several marked cars appear .
Police later confirmed that one person was arrested .
One officer suffered minor injuries .
Residents say its taken repeated complaints to get any action from the city .
Police confirmed that the activity is " probably gang - related , " and said the video is being reviewed by tactical teams and watch commanders in the district .
The New York Times Magazine this week is a special issue on debt ( a topic that has a particular resonance to me : we are still paying off an expensive , but spectacular , year in New Zealand ! ) .
There is a fascinating article on what credit card companies can learn about you based on your spending .
For instance ,
A 2002 study of how customers of Canadian Tire were using the company ’s credit cards found that 2,220 of 100,000 cardholders who used their credit cards in drinking places missed four payments within the next 12 months .
By contrast , only 530 of the cardholders who used their credit cards at the dentist missed four payments within the next 12 months .
A factor of 4 is a pretty significant difference .
That should be enough to change the interest rate offered ( and 2 % default in 2002 is pretty high ) .
The illustrations to the article go on to suggest that chrome accessories for your car are a sign of much more likely default , while premium bird seed suggests likely on - time payment .
The article was not primarily about these issues : it was about how companies learn about defaulters in order to connect to them so that they will be more likely to pay back ( or will pay back more ) .
But the illustrations did get me thinking again about the ethics of data mining .
Is it “ right ” to penalize people for activities that do n’t have a direct effect on their ability to payback but only a statistical correlation ?
Similar issues came up earlier when American Express started to penalize people who shopped at dollar stores .
I brought this up during my ethics talk in my data mining course , and my MBA students were split on this .
On one hand , companies discriminate on statistical correlations a lot : teenage boys pay more for insurance than middle - aged women , for instance .
But it seems unfair to penalize people for simply choosing to purchase one item over another .
Is n’t that what capitalism is about ?
But statistics do n’t lie .
Or do they ?
Do statistics from the past hold equivalent relevancy in today ’s unusual economy ?
Is relying on past statistics making today ’s economy even worse ?
Should a company search for something with a more direct correlation or is this correlation enough ?
At the Tepper School at Carnegie Mellon , we generally put more faith in so - called structural models , rather than statistical models .
Can we get at the heart of what makes people default on credit card debt ?
For instance , spending more than you earn seems one thing that might directly effect the ability to pay back debt .
It is hard to come up with a model where paying for drinks at the bar has a similar effect .
But structural models tend to be pretty reduced - form .
It is hard to include 85,000 different items ( like in the study reported by the New York Times ) in such models .
I vacillate a lot about this issue .
Right now , I am feeling that data mining like the “ spend in a bar implies default on credit cards ” can lead to interesting insights and directions , but those insights would not be actionable without some more fundamental insight into behavior .
The level of “ fundamentalness ” would depend on the application : if I am simply deciding on a marketing campaign , I might not require too much insight ; if I am setting or reducing credit limits , I would require much more .
I guess this is particularly critical to me since I often play the bank at our Friday Beers .
Since we might have 20 people at Beers , the tab can reach $ 300 , and I sometimes grab the cash from the table and pay by credit card .
Either the credit card companies have to come up with new rules ( “ If the tip is > 25 % [ as it often is with us : they do like us at the bar ! ] , then credit is OK ; else ding the record ” ) or I better hit the ATM on Friday afternoons .

Explanation : Going gently into the night , Deep Space 1's ion drive has been running smoothly since it was restarted on November 24 .
How powerful is this high - tech spacecraft 's ion propulsion system ?
At full throttle the engine will consume about 2,100 watts of electrical power generated by solar panels and produce about 1/50th of a pound of thrust .
This is roughly equivalent to the force you exert when holding up a single sheet of paper !
While clearly not suitable for vehicles which need rapid acceleration , ion propulsion is advantageous to use for missions involving asteroid and comet rendezvous .
For these long space voyages which ultimately require a lot of energy , the continuous , gentle nudge of an ion engine easily wins out over brief , powerful , but less efficient blasts from chemical rockets .
Pictured here during ground tests , the Deep Space 1 craft is now about three million miles from planet Earth .

Introduction
Obscure users planned and taught a class called " Creative Computer Exploration with Scratch " , intended to teach elementary school children programming , design , and math in an accessible and engaging way .
The lesson plans and notes from these classes are available under several free licenses .
The first three sessions of this class were held as an after - school arts enrichment program at an Arlington , Virginia primary school , Campbell Elementary , from the fall of 2007 to the spring of 2008 .
RichardBullingtonMcGuire mailto:rbulling@obscure.org taught the first three sessions of the class and Obscure Organization volunteers helped in the classroom .
These lesson plans have also been used in another class in the fall of 2008 Taylor Elementary School in Arlington , taught by Chris Vargas , with parent volunteers from Taylor .
Summary
We have two class offerings : an introductory class and an intermediate class .
Class Description : Introductory Class
In this class , students will explore how to create games , animations , stories , and art using Scratch , a computer learning tool that teaches programming skills .
Students will draw pictures , add sound and movement , and share their projects with the class .
Children will both examine existing programs and design their own new programs , using a visual programming language that snaps together on screen using graphical blocks .
The class will learn about mathematical and computational concepts in a meaningful and motivating context .
They will learn about the process of design , and develop key 21st century learning skills in the areas of creative thinking , collaboration , communication , and analysis .
Scratch is a product of MIT 's Lifelong Kindergarten Project .
More information about Scratch is available at :
Class Description : Intermediate Class
In this class , students will build on the skills they learned in the " Introduction to Scratch " class to design and implement larger and more complex computer games , animations , stories , and art .
We will work on strategies for collaboration and add sounds and photos we record to our projects .
Admissions preference will be given to students who took the Fall or Winter Scratch class .
Call for Volunteers
Obscure is looking for volunteers who can help teach the class in different schools in the coming school years .
We have a need for a teacher who could do this at both Campbell and Taylor in Arlington , Virginia and we are interested in starting this program in other schools too .
If you have computer programming skills , multimedia authoring skills , or education skills , you could make a significant contribution to this project .
It takes a lead teacher , plus one parent volunteer to serve as an aide per 5 students in the class .
The class takes about 2 hours including setup and clean up .
Each class has 5 sessions .
Schedule
As of Summer 2018 , we do not have a firm schedule for future classes .
At Campbell in the 2007 -2008 school year , the classes ran from 12:30 - 1:45 PM on Wednesday afternoons .
Volunteers needed to arrive at 12:15 and stay until 2 PM each day .
At Campbell , the class is held in the large computer lab and conference room inside the school library .

About Campbell
Campbell Elementary is the school that all 4 of my children have attended .
You can find out more about Campbell and its unique features on this web site :
This seminar meshes particularly well with the Integrated Curriculum that Campbell uses ( from an older version of their site ) :
Campbell incorporates core curriculum in a two - year cycle of thematic , intensive projects that encourage deep learning which transfers to other contexts .
Integrated study -- incorporating language arts , science , social science , mathematics , art and music into a single project -- fosters love of learning , an understanding of the interconnections of the world , and the knowledge that there 's a purpose to learning specific skills .

Some former members claim the Church uses a mind control technique to put opponents at a psychological disadvantage .
During the course of his investigation , Sweeney is shouted at , spied on , visited in his hotel at midnight and chased around the streets of LA by strangers in hire cars .
TMR Chief Film / TV Critic Joe Viglione gives a High Five or two or three to Edie Falco ’s Terrific New Showtime Series debuting on June 8 , 2009
Nurse Jackie is the best new series in a long , long time .
There were movie house previews across America on Wednesday evening , June 3 , including free popcorn and soda to anyone showing up at the theater .
It was a brilliant piece of marketing in a boring time which , hopefully , will result in more programs following suit .
The TV episodes translated perfectly to the big screen garnering well - deserved applause from the audience as the quick paced action , humor that comes out of nowhere and innovative camera angles worked alongside the genuine , compelling acting .
Edie Falco in the title role is brilliant and her supporting cast , Peter Facinelli as Dr. Fitch Cooper , Paul Schulze as her secret boyfriend / hospital pharmacist Eddie , Dominic Fumusa ( ex of As The World Turns and a few Law & Order SVU episodes ) as Jackie ’s husband , Kevin Peyton – everyone gets a chance to steal a scene , which works to the dark comedy ’s advantage .
A June 2008 article in The New Yorker said that the producers wanted to get Falco as far away from Carmela Soprano as possible but , c’mon , short hair or no you still feel like this is Carmela after a divorce from Tony cavorting with men who are less threatening and more fun .
Executive producer John Melfi may have been involved with Sex & The City , but his namesake , psychiatrist “ Dr. Melfi ” , was the apple of Tony Soprano ’s eye , and there is no getting away from a powerful series like The Sopranos , though the shadow it casts can only help the promotion of this new vehicle .
The intentional paradox is that Nurse Jackie Peyton ( a play on Peyton Place , perhaps ? – the 60s show that caused such a stir ) walks the path between good and evil , and does it with relish .
She cares about people , she has compassion , and she just loves to get high .
Forget the sex and the salty language , there ’s plenty of it and it is all essential to the tapestry here , but it is the abuse of narcotics that is so in your face that demands this get an R rating , something to keep the kids away from .
Drug abuse is glorified here , the anti-Christ boss ( Anna Deveare Smith as Mrs. Gloria Akalitus , perhaps the best name since the late , great Nancy Parsons played Ms. Beaulah Balbricker in the Porky ’s series ) becoming completely charming stoned ( and getting a huge rise out of the theater audience in episode 2 ) .
Dionne Warwick ’s voice singing “ The Valley Of The Dolls ” is transcendant , the perfect song about the “ cheat ” that is substance abuse … and remember , Barbara Parkins starred in both Peyton Place and The Valley Of The Dolls , so it goes beyond coincidence that the scriptwriters decided on the name “ Jackie Peyton ” for Edie Falco , the star of the biggest show of 1999 to the 2000’s , The Sopranos .
And you know what ?
If TV wants to go back to the original drawing board ( as I suggest Conan O’Brien do with late night television earlier in the week here on TMR Zoo ) , great .
Give the people what they want .
A bit of E.R. , a bit of Martin Scorsese ’s Bringing Out The Dead , some new faces that are n’t too familiar to TV audiences , some friends from the past , all a prescription for a show that is going to develop a big , big following in no time .

One day , playing all those stupid games on facebook will catch up with you .
Let me get this out in the open – I really really hate those games on facebook .
Not the games themselves though .
I hate that even though I am not playing them , I still have to interact with them .
They force me to filter their information feeds , spend time ignoring or blocking requests to play them or writing messages to friends , asking them to stop telling me about their latest win in “ BejewelFarmMafia poker ” , or whatever .
And people already get obsessed with Facebook & other social media , so giving them a new addiction is not on , in my book .
It is all just so damn annoying .
Anway , that ’s all I want to say on the matter .
So , feel free to leave a comment and vent your rage if you agree with what I am saying here .

If the word “ formaldehyde ” does n’t remind you of an embalmed body on a cold steel table , it should !
Is My Home Embalmed ?
It might surprise you to know that much of the shelving , furniture , wall finishes , carpet , cabinetry and flooring in your home could contain this dangerous chemical .
Formaldehyde can also be found in these building materials :
Glue
Plywood
Fiberboard
Insulation
Particleboard
Timber Paneling
What Other Products May Contain Formaldehyde ?
Many personal cleansing and beauty products contain formaldehyde , think about that before you put them on your skin , your largest organ .
Here are some of the personal products that might contain this toxin :
Lotions
Shampoos
Sunblock
Soap Bars
Cosmetics
Body Wash
Toothpaste
Baby Wipes
Bubble Bath
Am I Cleaning My Home With Formaldehyde ?
The short answer is … probably .
Are you reading every single label ?
If not , chances are that you are probably using some fairly toxic chemicals in your house cleaning regime .
The best rule of thumb is to look for products that say things like “ Non-toxic to humans and aquatic life , ” or “ readily biodegradable . ”
I ’ve read my product labels , and they do n’t say I ’m using formaldehyde containing products .
While it ’s great you ’re reading product labels , you must be aware that those tricky manufacturers often use synonyms that do n’t usually create attention in their consumers .
Synonyms and chemicals that “ act like ” formaldehyde are often used on ingredient lists .
Be wary of products containing the following ingredients :
Formalin
Methanal
Oxymethyline
Urea
1,3 - Dioxetane
Quaternium 15
Methylaldehyde
Methylene Oxide
Formic Aldehyde
Oxomethane Formalin
Phenol Formaldehyde
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Safety provides a quick reference list of some products known to contain formaldehyde .
I ’m appalled at the number of baby and kid products on the list , as these little angels usually have no say in whether they ’re being exposed or not .
The Dangers of Using Products Containing Formaldehyde
Watery , burning eyes , nose and throat , asthmatic attacks , skin irritation , headaches and nausea are all possible short term side effects of formaldehyde exposure .
Long term effects include cancer and possibly leukemia .
Most products contain only very small amounts of harmful chemicals .
The danger lies in our modern habits of using many of these products , and for a long time .
As you surround yourself with more and more formaldehyde containing products your exposure level increases .
Similarly , the longer you expose yourself to these products the more exposure you are getting .
Precautions You Can Take to Avoid Formaldehyde Exposure
The first step is getting these chemicals out of your home .
Cleaning and personal care products can be easily replaced with natural alternatives ( remember to look for products that are “ readily biodegradable ” and “ non toxic to humans and aquatic life ” ) .
Other things , like particle board or pressed wood , may take longer to replace , but should be replaced as soon as practical .
Or you can use an organic clay paint to absorb any potential outgassing the next time you paint your walls .
In time , you can greatly reduce your exposure to formaldehyde just by knowing what to look for and what to avoid .
And is n’t it worth this small change now to avoid the potential long term health impacts on you and those you care about ?

This is the letter I wrote in the feedback page at my local Whole Foods store 's website .
I am a Vanderbilt physician and a loyal customer of Whole Foods for years now .
It is with some degree of remorse that I write this letter , but I feel I have no choice .
Your CEO Mr. Mackey 's ill - informed article does tremendous harm to the cause of health care reform .
His solutions , e.g. high deductible plans , are simply ridiculous .
These things are part of the problem , not the solution .
As the country spirals further into debt from health insurance costs , lining the pockets of health insurance company CEOs along the way , and America falls further and further behind other developed nations in all leading health indicators , Mr. Mackey has the audacity to point to Medicare as the problem .
Of course his solutions are silly -- they are simply right - wing talking points .
Hypocrites like him are the same people who would not bat an eyelash at sending troops to Iraq , causing the deaths of many Iraqis and Americans , and then footing the massive bill .
Yet they balk at the idea of paying for health care reform , something that has the ability to save millions of lives .
I truly do not understand this .
Mr. Mackey has the right to speak his point of view .
We customers similarly have a right to support those businesses whose political support will not be detrimental to society .
I realize that the employees in the Nashville store may not agree with Mr. Mackey , but I would be in violation of my Hippocratic Oath and my duties as a physician if I continued to support Whole Foods .
For those employees who may suffer as innocent bystanders , I am truly sorry .
Good luck .

Behind the scenes , the Obama administration was furiously preparing for a major public intelligence disclosure that it had not planned to make .
Obama 's unplanned Iran news
Late Thursday night , two hours after it sent out President Barack Obama ’s Friday schedule , the White House told reporters it was adding another event – a statement that he would give in the morning .
Amid all the hoopla of the G - 20 economic summit in Pittsburgh , there was scant indication the announcement would be dramatic .
But behind the scenes , the Obama administration was furiously preparing for a major public intelligence disclosure that it had not planned to make : that the U.S. had known for years about a previously undisclosed clandestine nuclear enrichment facility Iran has been building since 2005 in a mountain near Qom .

Interviews with administration and international officials , diplomats , non-proliferation and Iran experts suggest the administration had no plans to announce its suspicions before beginning international talks with Iran next week .
But its hand was forced after learning some time during the week of a letter Iran had sent the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency in Vienna acknowledging construction of a previously undisclosed facility .
" We became aware , we were told by the IAEA that Iran had provided them with this letter , " a senior administration official said at a briefing Friday .
" I think that it 's very clear that the Iranian letter to the IAEA is too little too late , given the history of the construction of this facility , given the obligations they have , both to the IAEA and to the U.N. Security Council . "
IAEA officials told Obama aides about the letter Tuesday evening in New York , The New York Times reported Saturday .
They met with Obama and James L. Jones , his national security adviser , on Wednesday to discuss strategy .
According to The Times , European officials urged Obama to disclose the Iranian facility on Thursday morning , when he presided over the U.N. Security Council , but Obama and his aides decided to wait until Friday .
In the meantime , a hurried round of briefings took place in Europe , Washington and New York .
On Wednesday , intelligence officials from the U.S. , Britain and France briefed IAEA officials in Vienna on what they knew about the Qom facility .
That same day , in New York , Obama briefed Russian president Dmitry Medvedev .
Then on Thursdays , intelligence officials briefed congressional leadership in Washington , while Chinese president Hu Jintao was informed in New York .
Shortly before Obama 's announcement Friday morning , the IAEA sent out a press statement confirming that it had received a letter from Iran .
“ I can confirm that on 21 September Iran informed the IAEA in a letter that a new pilot fuel enrichment plant is under construction in the country , ” an IAEA spokesman said in a statement .
At 8:30 am , Obama made the announcement , flanked by Britain ’s Gordon Brown and France ’s Nicolas Sarkozy in a show of international unity .
As Obama spoke , the administration sent out background guidance to Congress and the press with more information on the Qom facility .
“ We learned earlier this week that Iran has sent the IAEA a letter indicating that it is constructing an enrichment facility but providing no detailed information that would enable the IAEA to monitor the site , ” that White House - provided guidance said .
Why would the White House have preferred not to publicly disclose its Qom evidence , seemingly something of a smoking gun for the case that Iran has n’t been transparent about even its current nuclear activities ?
Why was it only prompted to make the announcement after it learned of Iran ’s letter to the IAEA ?
“ Because the Iranians are trying to get in front and create an argument that they did n't do anything wrong , ” the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace ’s George Perkovich told POLITICO .
“ So to try to block that , Obama had to get [ it ] out .
We would have been better off not announcing and keeping it as leverage and a way to see if the Iranians kept their word in a future deal . ”

( PhysOrg.com ) -- NASA scientists have discovered glycine , a fundamental building block of life , in samples of comet Wild 2 returned by NASA 's Stardust spacecraft .
" Glycine is an amino acid used by living organisms to make proteins , and this is the first time an amino acid has been found in a comet , " said Dr. Jamie Elsila of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " Our discovery supports the theory that some of life 's ingredients formed in space and were delivered to Earth long ago by meteorite and comet impacts . "
Elsila is the lead author of a paper on this research accepted for publication in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science .
The research will be presented during the meeting of the American Chemical Society at the Marriott Metro Center in Washington , August 16 .
" The discovery of glycine in a comet supports the idea that the fundamental building blocks of life are prevalent in space , and strengthens the argument that life in the universe may be common rather than rare , " said Dr. Carl Pilcher , Director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute which co-funded the research .
Proteins are the workhorse molecules of life , used in everything from structures like hair to enzymes , the catalysts that speed up or regulate chemical reactions .
Just as the 26 letters of the alphabet are arranged in limitless combinations to make words , life uses 20 different amino acids in a huge variety of arrangements to build millions of different proteins .

Stardust passed through dense gas and dust surrounding the icy nucleus of Wild 2 ( pronounced " Vilt - 2 " ) on January 2 , 2004 .
As the spacecraft flew through this material , a special collection grid filled with aerogel - a novel sponge - like material that 's more than 99 percent empty space - gently captured samples of the comet 's gas and dust .
The grid was stowed in a capsule which detached from the spacecraft and parachuted to Earth on January 15 , 2006 .
Since then , scientists around the world have been busy analyzing the samples to learn the secrets of comet formation and our solar system 's history .
" We actually analyzed aluminum foil from the sides of tiny chambers that hold the aerogel in the collection grid , " said Elsila .
" As gas molecules passed through the aerogel , some stuck to the foil .
We spent two years testing and developing our equipment to make it accurate and sensitive enough to analyze such incredibly tiny samples . "
Earlier , preliminary analysis in the Goddard labs detected glycine in both the foil and a sample of the aerogel .
However , since glycine is used by terrestrial life , at first the team was unable to rule out contamination from sources on Earth .
" It was possible that the glycine we found originated from handling or manufacture of the Stardust spacecraft itself , " said Elsila .
The new research used isotopic analysis of the foil to rule out that possibility .
Isotopes are versions of an element with different weights or masses ; for example , the most common carbon atom , Carbon 12 , has six protons and six neutrons in its center ( nucleus ) .
However , the Carbon 13 isotope is heavier because it has an extra neutron in its nucleus .
A glycine molecule from space will tend to have more of the heavier Carbon 13 atoms in it than glycine that 's from Earth .
That is what the team found .
" We discovered that the Stardust - returned glycine has an extraterrestrial carbon isotope signature , indicating that it originated on the comet , " said Elsila .
The team includes Dr. Daniel Glavin and Dr. Jason Dworkin of NASA Goddard .
" Based on the foil and aerogel results it is highly probable that the entire comet - exposed side of the Stardust sample collection grid is coated with glycine that formed in space , " adds Glavin .
" The discovery of amino acids in the returned comet sample is very exciting and profound , " said Stardust Principal Investigator Professor Donald E. Brownlee of the University of Washington , Seattle , Wash .
" It is also a remarkable triumph that highlights the advancing capabilities of laboratory studies of primitive extraterrestrial materials . "

In the summer of 2008 , Indian Kashmir reverberated with the groundswell of protest .
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets , heeding the call of the separatist conglomerate , the Hurriyat Conference .
This was the first time after the initial years of two decades of armed conflict that Kashmiris reverted to the method of peaceful political agitation , loudly turning their backs on the gun .
( The immediate provocation for the protest was the transfer of state land to a Hindu trust which facilitates the annual pilgrimage to the ancient shrine of Shri Amarnath in the Himalayas .
The decision stirred the deep local suspicion of a larger design to undermine the Islamic character of the troubled , Muslim - majority Valley of Kashmir . )
To handle the protests , the state government took recourse to curfews and stringent security measures , which shut the Valley down for almost three months .
Yet the most effective way of dealing with the protests - and the underlying mistrust of New Delhi that they stemmed from - was not through the baton but the ballot .
Elections for the state assembly in December 2008 were revelatory .
Initially , observers feared the worst for the polls .
Major regional pro-New Delhi parties like National Conference ( NC - the opposition party at the time ) , People 's Democratic Party ( PDP - the then ruling party ) and the Congress itself ( India 's ruling party ) squared up for a tough electoral battle .
But the seething " separatist " summer seemed to have driven these establishment and more conciliatory parties to the fringes of the Valley 's political landscape .
Hurriyat , which saw the state polls as designed to strengthen India 's " occupation " of Kashmir , called for the boycott of the exercise .
In the lead up to the vote on 17 November , it seemed that the force of recent popular protest would leave the polling booths relatively empty .
Instead , turnout shocked everybody .
Booth after booth , long waving queues of people waited for hours in the winter chill to cast their votes .
An estimated 63 per cent of voters ( around three million out of the 4.8 million eligible voters ) cast their votes , which was by far the highest turnout recorded in the Valley in the past 20 years .
The separatists were stunned , as were most observers of the crisis in Kashmir , a state in the throes of secessionist violence since 1989 .
The same people who fought the system in the summer voted for it in the winter .
The struggle against Indian rule had gone hand - in - hand with participation in democratic elections , even though the former and the latter apparently stood in opposition to each other .
The assembly elections had a significant discourse - changing effect within Kashmiri politics .
Suddenly , separatist figures who rode high on the long summer of discontent were pushed to the margins of the state 's political life and the pro-India mainstream parties like NC and PDP hurtled back to centre - stage ( the NC won the plurality of seats , and formed a coalition government with the Congress ) .
It goes without saying that a free and fair election can usher in profound political transformation in any society .
What 's more remarkable is that the democratic electoral process within the long - running conflict situation in Kashmir has proven therapeutic too .
The election in December 2008 is n't the only one that nudged Kashmir along a different track .
In 2002 , Kashmir assembly polls were held in a situation of unremitting militant violence .
The state was still reeling from the destabilizing consequences of the short India - Pakistan war in 1999 over the Kargil heights .
The continuing insurgency inside Kashmir intensified with fidayeen attacks and suicide bombs becoming routine .
But the election in 2002 - which was the first cleanly - held exercise in the state 's entire democratic history - made a significant , redeeming difference .
In a spectacular change in its Kashmir strategy , New Delhi finally agreed to hold a free and fair election in the state as an effort to both clear its name of past wrong - doing and to undermine the ideology and popularity of the separatists .
Democratic processes in Kashmir at the time lacked all credibility .
Successive elections in the state had been rigged to suit New Delhi 's chosen allies and political outfits .
In 1987 , the ruling NC was allowed to manipulate the election in its favour when all indications pointed towards the triumph of Muslim United Front , an alliance of largely religious parties led by the Jamaat - i- Islami .
The same practice was followed in 1996 , when the Indian army coerced people to vote to boost the turnout in what remained a mostly boycotted election , with less than 20 percent of eligible Kashmiris voting .
All the polls from 1953 through 1975 also share in this history of manipulation , with local governments being imposed and dismissed at the will of the Indian government .
Such a rich tradition of orchestrating from New Delhi sparked the outrage that fed into a violent secessionist movement in 1989 ( which was only abetted and transformed into a more Islamist insurgency later in the 1990s with the spill - over of Afghanistan - hardened mujahideen fighters after the triumph of the Taliban ) .
Yet the effect of the 2002 polls was striking .
The election for the first time dislodged the NC and ended its fifty year - old monopoly over Kashmir .
And the beneficiary of this urge for change was the PDP - then just six years old - led by a former home minister of India , Mufti Muhammad Sayeed .
The result was cathartic for the long pent up democratic aspirations in Valley .
The realization that Kashmiris could actually change governments through the ballot gave the otherwise alienated people a fresh stake in the system .
Everybody in the Valley expected the NC to ride back to power on New Delhi 's support .
But relatively high turnout ( 44 percent ) set in motion a sea change in Kashmiri politics .
While the verdict of the election came as a relief to Kashmiris , it was something of the opposite for many politicians .
Realizing that political power in Kashmir was now flowing from the people rather than from the will of New Delhi , politicians had to become more responsive to local issues and aspirations .
Political parties which until now exclusively represented New Delhi 's interests in Kashmir began to better accommodate the Valley 's grassroots discourse .
The PDP , which was part of a six year rotational coalition government with Congress , focused on improving governance and security while deftly straddling the Valley 's mainstream - separatist political divide .
The separatist strand , as embodied by the likes of the pro-Pakistan Hurriyat Conference , remained important within Kashmir 's political landscape .
But pro-India mainstream parties , particularly PDP , made deep inroads for the first time into undermining the political appeal of the separatists .
They incorporated much of the agenda of the separatists , but stopped well short of the conventional rhetoric that calls for independence from India .
PDP was in the forefront of this new politics , criticising the much - loathed Armed Forces Special Powers Act , seeking a reduction in the security presence of the state and demanding an acceptable settlement between India and Pakistan over Kashmir .
The reconfigured platforms found resonance with Kashmiris , and helped consolidated a mainstream mass base in the state .
PDP rule resulted in the rise of a representative political mainstream with strong indigenous moorings , that responded to local discussion and debate and helped dissipate the accumulated public anger which decades of political stonewalling had created .
The party worked to make the security forces more accountable for their treatment of civilians .
It also reined in the dreaded " Special Operation Group " of the Kashmir police which was responsible for gross human rights violations in the state .
It released a number of detained separatists as part of its " Healing Touch " policy .
Under the weight of increasing democratization within Kashmir , the hardline positions of several separatist parties began to crumble .
Unnerved by the resurrected relevance of the mainstream parties , separatists have steadily moved towards a more pragmatic articulation of their demands .
It has become increasingly common to hear talk of flexible solutions to the Kashmir crisis , which accommodate changing global realities ( including India 's rise on the international stage and Islamabad 's growing willingness to compromise on Kashmir ) .
And one major separatist Sajjad Lone , hoping to remain relevant , controversially decided to enter electoral politics , unsuccessfully contesting in the recent national parliamentary election .
The past seven years of the democratic experience in Kashmir - albeit still flawed in many respects - encourages the belief that an environment of conflict and division can be improved if a democratic outlet is made available .
Democratic processes may not overhaul the fundamental crisis or counter the daily motions of insurgency and repression , but they have more subtly softened the sources of discord , tempering their intensity .
In India 's case , Kashmir may not be the only example of the utility of democracy within conflict .
Seventeen years ago , an election in Punjab - the western Indian state that endured an armed , separatist Sikh campaign through the 1980s - made a substantial difference to the affairs of the troubled state .
This change was duly noted in the contemporary readings of the poll , and a parallel was forged .
As Sumeet Ganguly writes in Crisis in Kashmir , " The ( Punjab ) state elections of 1992 , which followed five years of insurgency and direct rule from New Delhi , resulted in extremely low voter turnout but did bring to power a legally constituted government .
The subsequent local elections produced extra-ordinarily high turnouts - more than 80 per cent of the eligible voters " .
This is a trajectory that emerged in Kashmir too , with the middling turnout in 2002 polls leading to more than 60 per cent polling in the 2008 assembly polls .
A democratic process that has generally made right and responsive noises , delivered on broad parameters of governance - no doubt with some glaring failures now and then - has simultaneously engaged and battled the separatist discourse .
This has even caused the separatists to begin to find their own democratic moorings and appreciate the new ground realities .
Now it is incumbent upon India and Pakistan , the state stakeholders in the conflict , to build on these developments and pursue a meaningful settlement .

WASHINGTON  The C.I.A. missile strike in Pakistan ’s tribal areas on Wednesday may have killed Baitullah Mehsud , the leader of the country ’s fearsome Taliban militia , American and Pakistani officials said Thursday .
Officials in Washington and Islamabad were scrambling to make sense of communications intercepts and other intelligence that seemed to indicate that Mr. Mehsud might have been killed in the strike .
By Thursday evening , American officials said they were growing increasingly confident that the Taliban leader was dead .
Still , they cautioned that it may be weeks before they are certain , and they may never gain access to the remote location in South Waziristan to perform DNA tests .
“ There is reason to believe that reports of his death may be true , but it ca n’t be confirmed at this time , ” said an American official with access to classified intelligence reports .

If you enjoyed our Ten Most Difficult Words to Translate article , here are some additions that have caught our attention .
Thanks to everyone who sent words !
Keep them coming for our next installment .
Hyggelig
In Denmark , the word Hyggelig is used often , and is said to be closely tied to the Danish national character .
A dictionary will provide translations along the lines of cozy , warm , and nice , but a typical Dane will argue that these words do n’t come close to capturing the full meaning of the word .
Perhaps a true Dane would like to share some thoughts here ?
Wabi-Sabi
We recently featured an entire blog article on the Japanese concept of Wabi-Sabi .
It is a compound word with a long history , and carries a lot of meaning .
Put succinctly , it ’s a way of living that emphasizes finding beauty in imperfection , and accepting the natural cycle of growth and decay .
Duende
This Spanish word has a long and interesting history .
It ’s original use was to describe a mythical entity that lives in forests , sort of like a fairy or a sprite , that possesses human beings and causes them to feel awe , fear , or a sense of beauty in their natural surroundings .
Since being updated by the Spanish poet and playwright , Federico García Lorca , in the early 20th century , it is now used to refer to the mysterious power of a work of art to deeply move a person .
Saudade
This Portuguese word was also featured in our most beautiful words post a while back .
It refers to the feeling of longing for something or someone that you love and which is lost .
Fairness
This past January , a blog post from the Atlantic Monthly by economist Bart Wilson sparked a debate about whether the English word Fair can be accurately translated .
In the Beyond Words analysis of the Fairness translation debate , we explored all the sides , and discussed Wilson ’s position that Fairness is a uniquely Anglo concept that carries historical baggage making it very different from notions of equity and right vs. wrong .

EMT : Employer took insurance payments
Posted Friday , August 7 , 2009 10:06 pm
BELLOWS FALLS --
A former LeFevre Ambulance Service employee is accusing the company of stealing the insurance payments from his paycheck to help make payroll , leading the insurance company to cancel his policy .
Gregory Malone received a letter from MVP Health Care telling him that his policy was terminated just after his wife gave birth to the couple ’s first child .
Now , with bills piling up for the mother and child due to complications brought on from the birth , Malone is talking to local , state and federal authorities to try to get the company to back pay the insurance money to get the coverage for his wife and child .
" I did everything I was supposed to do .
I made the payments every week , " Malone said as he pointed to the line on past payroll stubs showing that $ 151.52 was taken out .
" But where did the money go ? "
Malone said LeFevre Ambulance Director David Booth admitted that a former office employee had used the insurance payments to help meet the company ’s financial obligations , and according to Malone , the company promised to get the past due payments to MVP Healthcare .
Booth refused to comment on Malone ’s claim , saying in a short telephone interview , that since the police were investigating the case , he could not say anything about the situation .
MVP has promised to reinstate the insurance if the money is paid , Malone said , though the company ’s policy is usually to give organization ’s only 90 days to make past due payments .

A spokesman for MVP also was limited in what information he was allowed to release , due to health insurance privacy laws .
He could only confirm that LeFevre ’s entire policy was canceled on April 30 .

Malone was an EMT intermediate and lieutenant training officer with the Bellows Falls - based ambulance service from August 2008 through June 2009 .
Federal and state COBRA health insurance laws require companies to offer alternative insurance options if an employee ’s policy is canceled but Malone was never told about losing his coverage until he received the letter from MVP on May 4 .
Malone ’s baby will need specialized surgery in his first year because of a birth defect and the couple has been meeting with specialists in Boston .
They are worried that if they go with another insurance company , the baby ’s situation would be considered a pre-existing condition and the company might not cover the operation .

Malone called the Bellows Falls Police Department , the Windham County State ’s Attorney ’s office , the Attorney General ’s office , as well as the FBI .
" Our baby needs surgery and the bills are piling up , " Malone said .
" The surgery needs to happen and we do n’t have the money to pay for it . "
Malone ’s wife Angelina said the experience has been frustrating and disheartening .
The company has been leading the couple on for weeks , and with law enforcement authorities offering little help , and her baby ’s operation getting closer every day , she said things are getting desperate .
" We do n’t know what else to do .
We do n’t want the money back , we just need the coverage , " she said .
" We ’re worried about our baby .
We already owe $ 22,000 and we do n’t have $ 22,000 .
If they do n’t take care of this , we are really going to be in trouble . "

Holy CRAP this is good news : Bradley Denton 's incredible comic sf novel Buddy Holly is Alive and Well on Ganymede is being made into a movie directed and written by Robert Rugan .
Buddy Holly is the story of Oliver Vale , whose mother was obsessed with Buddy Holly , and who one day discovers that Buddy Holly is on the TV , on every TV , on every station , with a guitar around his neck , standing in a bubble on the surface of Ganymede , disoriented , musical , and periodically reading out a sign saying that further information is available from Oliver , and supplying his home address .
The entire world chases Oliver at this point : cops , radio cops , televangelists and their flocks , aliens — you name it .
And Oliver begins a road - trip across America to Lubbock , Texas , there to exhume Buddy Holly 's corpse and verify for himself that the famous musician is not on a distant , airless moon .
When this book came out , I was a bookseller at Bakka in Toronto , the venerable science fiction bookstore .
If you were a science fiction reader in Toronto in those days , it 's a damned good bet I sold you a copy of it .
I hand - sold about 750 copies of that book , and would have sold more .
Will sell more .
Bradley Denton is a stone comic genius and no two of his books are alike , but this is the one I love — I worship — as the apotheosis of a certain kind of gonzo , brilliant , marvellous thing that is to American science fiction comedy what Douglas Adams ' Hitchhikers ' series is to British sf comedy .
To see it come back and to the big screen , too — marvellous .
Congrats , Brad , and well - deserved .

In Egypt , 43 percent of people think Israel was behind the 9/11 attacks in America , a poll by WorldPublicOpinion.org found last year .
In the United States , six percent of Americans say the moon landing of 40 years ago was staged , according to Gallup .
And in Alaska , the former governor , a woman who was nearly a heartbeat away from the presidency , now tells followers that “ Obama death panels ” could decide if her parents and her baby , Trig , who has Down Syndrome , will live or die .
The United States , like most countries , has long had a lunatic fringe who channel in the flotsam of delusion , half - facts and conspiracy theories .
But now , with the light - speed and reach of the Web , “ entire virtual crank communities , ” as the conservative writer David Frum called them , have sprung up .
They are fed , in the case of Sarah Palin , by people who should know better .
For a democracy , which depends on an informed citizenry to balance a permanent lobbying class , this is poison .
And it ’s one reason why town hall forums on health care , which should be sharp debates about something that affects all of us , have turned into town mauls .
The lies and shouts have had the effect that all crank speech has on free speech — stifling any real exchange .
In my state , Representative Brian Baird , a veteran of more than 300 town hall meetings during his 11 years as a Democratic congressman from southwest Washington , has decided not to hold any such forums this recess after receiving death threats .
But is it any wonder that some are moved to violent threats , given the level of misinformation being injected into the system ?
If you really believed that Obama was going to kill your baby and euthanize your parents , well — why not act in self defense ?
Here ’s what Palin said on her Facebook page Friday , in her first online comments since quitting as Alaska governor .
“ The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama ’s ‘ death panel ’ so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their ‘ level of productivity in society ’ whether they are worthy of health care . ”
This is pure fantasy , fact - free almost in its entirety .
The nonpartisan group FactCheck.org said there was no basis for such a claim in any of the health care bills under consideration in Congress .
One House bill would pay for counseling for terminally ill patients — something anyone who has lost an elderly loved one of late , as I have , will find essential .
Palin was given some cover Sunday by the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , a master of slipping innuendo into his arguments .
Defending the “ death panel ” post on ABC ’s “ This Week , ” Gingrich said , “ you ’re asking us to trust the government . ”
By such reasoning , American foreign policy is not worth its word , the currency is worthless , and the moon landing was indeed a fake .
The last time Gingrich went so far was when he called Justice Sonia Sotomayor a racist .
He retracted it then .
We ’ll see what he does now .
As for Palin , she should follow her own advice to the media of a few weeks ago — lay off the kids and “ quit makin ’ things up . ”

Aleksandra Mir , 2020
Earlier this month Cryptic Studios launched their new super hero MMORPG , Champions Online .
In the days prior to its retail release , Cryptic granted gamers a sneak peak in the form of an open beta .
The beta event was open to all and let players craft their own “ Champion ” in a world that pays parodist homage to our favorite super heroes .
Champions
Online models itself closely after its predecessor , City of Heroes , but is hardly a rehash .
Cryptic has updated their model to include many modern features , some happily borrowed from the competition .
These impressions are being written by a gamer who is has yet to fall head over heals in love with the genre – so what sort of impression did Champions leave on this self proclaimed tourist ?
As with most online role playing games , Champions begins with the creation of an avatar ( toon ) .
Cryptic has upped the ante once again , and offers players an unheard of number of options .
If you have played an average MMORPG , you ’ve seen how simple most character creation is .
Most games give you a very limited set of options in your appearance , relying mostly on equipment ( loot ) to diversify the population .
Champions , like City of Heroes before it , does n’t really have armor or clothing drops – Instead you ’re given vast control over your avatars appearance .
Through various sliders you can change nearly every detail of your physique .
Combining this freedom with a plethora of costume pieces that you can mix , match , and color , you can create practically any hero you want .
The freedom granted by the astronomical tailoring options are only half of the creation process .
You have to design your heroes abilities as well , or at least the path on which you ’re going to build upon those abilities .
The first job on your journey to Champion status is chose or create your own framework ; the basis of your hero ’s abilities .
Basic frameworks include descriptions such as power armor , electricity , and telekinesis .
The framework you chose mostly seems to dictate your initial statistics ( strength , dexterity , etc ) , since you ’re not limited to powers from one specific framework .
The lack of any real class distinction adds a great deal of depth to the games progression and character building .
It ’s easy to imagine that there will be an abounding variety of heroes in the Champions world ; from knockoffs of old favorites , to entirely new and unique creations .
The tailors you ’ll find scattered throughout the game ’s world allow for even more options .
For a fee ( in “ gold ” ) you can visit an NPC who will allow you to create and save new costumes .
You can even send your saved costumes to friends , who can then load them into their own game .
For the purposes of the beta , my main toon ( Cassandra Prime ) was a mechanized female , who followed the basics of the power armor framework .
Perhaps the most amusing creation I encountered was Jesus , complete with a white robe and halo ; I did n’t bother to inquire about his superpowers or crime fighting prowess .
After you ’ve finished creating your Champion , you ’re thrust into an entirely typical tutorial area .
This “ newbie zone ” is a segregated instance where you will complete a series of quests designed to familiarize you with the game .
It ’s probably a necessity to have such a tutorial in your game , but it ’s also a little unfortunate that you ca n’t skip it with your subsequent characters .
In this area you ’re given quests that will teach you the basics .
You ’ll learn how to dispense enemies ; how your powers work ; about different types of quests ; and a bit of the back story .
As tutorials go – it ’s functional – a necessary evil .
One interesting aspect of the tutorial zone is the inclusion of one “ Area Quest , ” a feature shamelessly borrowed from Mythic ’s Warhammer Online .
In these “ Area Quests , ” players will participate in large groups .
These players do n’t have to be in your party ; they just have to be in the area of the quest ( in its duration ) to participate .
At the end of the area quest player ’s participation is ranked and awards are given out accordingly .
Upon completing the tutorial zone , you may think that you ’re ready for the real thing , but Cryptic disagrees .
You are immediately given the option to move into one of two other instances , the Crisis In Canadian Wilderness , or the dryly named Desert Disaster .
It ’s in one of these instances that you will learn about crafting classes and progressing your character .
This is the first area in which you ’ll find a “ Power House , ” where you can upgrade your toon ’s abilities .
By visiting one of the power house trainers , you can spend your acquired points on new powers ( or upgrade your old ones ) .
Chose carefully , but know that you can adjust your choices freely until you leave , as well as “ respec ” your previous ten levels for an in game fee .
Once you ’ve finished the available quests in this zone , you ’re finally ready !
Now you ’ll find yourself in a more open world .
There were three basic areas available in the beta : The Canadian Wilderness , The Desert , and Millennium City .
All three areas contain a variety of sub-instances , all with their own quests and sights to see .
Most of my time in the beta was spent running around Millennium City .
Once you ’ve gained your travel skills , it ’s hard to resist flying to the tops of skyscrapers for some improvised platforming and base jumping .
Unlike some other MMO games , there ’s no server designation to choose from the beginning .
All players seem to exist in the same central server , but even the over world is divided into instanced zones .
It ’s a little disappointing that there ’s no real persistent over - world in Champions , but the illusion is kept safe by mostly seamless gaps between instanced zones within the environment .
The basic gameplay is a little more exciting than your typical MMO flair .
Although the combat will seem familiar to those who have played any MMORPG since Everquest , it has its own unique twists that inject some excitement into a rather stale set of mechanics .
Your powers are generally timed abilities , and their use is dictated mostly by their effect and cool down time .
This method of “ timed combat ” is wholly conventional ( almost cliche ) , but additional depth is added through assorted tweaks .
You typically activate a power by either clicking on its icon on the heads up display , or by pressing the assigned hot - key ; what is less than typical is the ability to tap and hold certain powers , using them in alternative ways .
These options , combined with the ability to block , and the health and power orbs that will drop at the feat of felled enemies add a little more action to a traditionally dull combat model .
Player Versus Enemy ( PvE ) gameplay is about what you would expect from this genre .
You go on quests , you gain rewards , you spend them on upgrading your toon .
The “ Area Quest ” system puts Champion ’s on the same page as most other modern MMORPG ’s , but it ’s still a little dull .
The quest story lines are a little too easy to ignore .
I found myself skimming through the NPC quest - giver ’s dialog , discarding the story in favor for the goals I was being tasked with .
This portion of the game is merely acceptable on the surface , but it ’s potentially enhanced by one of the games most unique features : The Nemesis .
When your toon reaches level 25 , you can craft your own nemesis , with all of the tools and options granted by the initial character building .
This character becomes a key figure in your Champion ’s story , which will likely add some excitement to the PvE portion of the game .
The Player Versus Player ( PvP ) component is also a pretty standard fare .
As with many games in this genre , PvP instances are a menu click away .
You can browse a list of available games from any location by clicking on the “ queues ” button on the HUD .
From here you can jump in line and get ready for a little superhero mayhem .
The basic mechanics do n’t differ from PvE , but it is a little more dramatic facing off against other people , instead of brain dead enemy AI .
The most interesting PvP game available in the open beta was a prison escape scenario ; one team played a group of captured villains trying to break free , while the opposing team tried to prevent their escape .
It ’s a little hard to gauge versus gameplay without further exposure , but it was n’t hard to see the potential .
I am lividly opposed to RPG gaming as serious competition ( that belongs to other genres ) , but fun is fun .
While it ’s impossible to form any lasting opinion in this genre from such a short experience , my time spent in Millennium City was simply a blast .
Champion ’s shares some of the genres common pitfalls , but it also manages to set itself apart from the pack .
By layering a bit of action into gameplay that has been recycled since the early days of the genre , Cryptic Studios has created a world that will appeal to old and new players alike , and the campy humor peppered into the Champions world pays honor to its inspiration and solidifies it as fantastic geeky fan service .
I may not have stayed long , but my vacation in the realm of Champion ’s Online has piqued my interest in one day returning to Millennium City .
It may not be soon though – there are other vistas to visit first .

Welcome to the Creationism vs Science page !
To your right , you will see an image of a 3.5 million year old skull excavated from Kenya in 1999 .
This one is named Kenyanthropus platyops , and it is being proposed as another possible distant ancestor of mankind .
Its features are somewhat different than those of " Lucy " , also known as Australopithecus afarensis ( discovered in Ethiopia in 1974 ) , with smaller teeth and a flatter face .
It is also possible that it is related to the australopithecus family , and that its initial classification as a separate genus may have been premature .
Researchers are hopeful that more such remains may be found as excavations continue .
This specimen is being added to the growing list of species which existed 2 to 3.5 million years ago and are clearly neither modern primate or modern human , one of which may have been our ancestors .
However , creationists reject all of this .
According to creationism , humans sprouted fully - formed in our current state , as did all animal " kinds " ( a term which creationists use instead of " species " , but which is curiously undefined ) .
In an attempt to co-opt the language of science ( if not its methods ) , they even call it " Creation Theory " , even though a scientific theory should allow one to derive specific predictions from a defined mechanism : something which is impossible for " Creation Theory " .
Of course , none of this is a problem for creationism because it is not ( despite its claims to the contrary ) a scientific movement .
It is a religiously motivated political movement , which is why they publish all of their " research " directly to the general public rather than letting other scientists subject it to peer review .
Unfortunately , there are many kinds of arguments which are far more convincing to someone who struggled with grade 11 chemistry than someone who actually studied science at the university level , which is why creationism enjoys more than 50 % support from the American public while languishing at less than 1 % among scientists .

Random Cynic's Quote :
" What is called a high standard of living consists in considerable measure in arrangements for avoiding muscular energy , increasing sensual pleasure , enhancing caloric intake beyond any conceivable nutritional requirement .
Nevertheless , the belief that increased production is a worthy social goal is very nearly absolute . "

Aggressive driving habits used by troops to avoid ambushes or roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan may be placing them at risk on roadways at home , according to a small study that is prompting broader Pentagon research into the problem .
The behavior includes driving fast or down the middle of the road , or passing through intersections regardless of signals , say the study 's authors , who are releasing results today .
" These behaviors become both automatic and inexorably linked to a sense of control and safety , " says the study by sociologist Todd Rockwood and occupational therapist Erica Stern of the University of Minnesota .
" Unfortunately , when these same driving behaviors are inappropriately carried over to American roads , they endanger soldiers , their families and their communities , " the study said .
The team surveyed 150 members of the Minnesota National Guard who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
As a result of the findings , the Pentagon is paying to expand the study to survey 600 more troops , say Rockwood and Navy Capt .
E. Melissa Kaime , director of the Defense Department 's Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs .
The Minnesota researchers found that during a 30 - day period in 2007 , 25 % of the combat veterans admitted driving down the middle of a civilian street or running a stop sign .
Ten percent said they drove erratically through an underpass or tunnel .
Much of this behavior seemed to diminish 90 days after soldiers returned home , Rockwood said .
But the soldiers remained apprehensive about driving even beyond 90 days , researchers found .
Nearly half said they were uneasy when they felt boxed in by traffic , the study results say .
Kaime says the Pentagon wants to learn more .
" Can we somehow identify , predict who is likely to come back with the most erratic driving behavior ? " she asked .
This would help the military provide assistance to those most at risk , she says .
Fatal accidents involving soldiers increased after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began , peaking in 2005 , according to statistics .
They have since declined after aggressive Army efforts to monitor soldiers ' driving behavior and educate them .

Last week , retired Air Force Gen. Chuck Wald published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal declaring " There Is a Military Option on Iran . "
It ’s probably not a coincidence that Wald ’s piece was hot on the heels of John Bolton ’s " While Diplomats Dither , Iran Builds Nukes . "
It should n’t come as a surprise that the general who was the air commander for the initial stages of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan would argue that the U.S. military is capable of attacking Iran ’s nuclear and other military facilities .
What is somewhat surprising is Wald ’s overall " tone , " which is less hawkish than the title of his op - ed suggests .
To begin , Wald does not make an argument that the military option is the best and preferred first option .
He states , " The military can play an important role in solving this complex problem without firing a single shot .
Publicly signaling serious preparation for a military strike might obviate the need for one if deployments force Tehran to recognize the costs of its nuclear defiance . "
The problem with preparing to take military action , however , is that – politically – it practically forces the United States to take action .
If Iran called America ’s bluff , any U.S. president would be perceived as weak if he or she chose not to act – which is the last thing the leader of the world ’s superpower is going to do .
At least Wald recognizes that what so many liberal internationalists consider a " diplomatic " option – economic sanctions that could include a naval blockade of Iranian ports – is actually an act of war .
But he says so almost blithely without recognizing the repercussions .
If the United States engages in an act of war without having been attacked ( not that we would ever do such a thing , mind you ) , then Iran might choose to retaliate in probably the only way they can – using terrorism .
It is exactly this kind of cause - and - effect that U.S. policymakers routinely gloss over .
Nonetheless ,
Wald proclaims that " the U.S. military is capable of launching a devastating attack on Iranian nuclear and military facilities . "
Yet such bravado is tempered with some doses of reality :
" Of course , there are huge risks to military action : U.S. and allied casualties ; rallying Iranians around an unstable and oppressive regime ; Iranian reprisals be they direct or by proxy against us and our allies ; and Iranian - instigated unrest in the Persian Gulf states , first and foremost in Iraq .
" Furthermore , while a successful bombing campaign would set back Iranian nuclear development , Iran would undoubtedly retain its nuclear knowhow .
An attack would also necessitate years of continued vigilance , both to retain the ability to strike previously undiscovered sites and to ensure that Iran does not revive its nuclear program . "
And Wald ’s closing statement to the jury seems almost tepid : " But should diplomacy and economic pressure fail , a U.S. military strike against Iran is a technically feasible and credible option . "
To be sure , military strikes are always technically feasible .
But credible with respect to what ?
That they inflict the intended damage ?
That the overall result is what we want ?
In the case of Iran , that the regime will choose to halt its nuclear program ?
Better yet , that the Iranians ( both regime and people ) will somehow like the United States for bombing them ?
What is even more incredulous is that we would believe that the Iranians would not at least try to retaliate – as if we did not retaliate after being attacked on 9/11 .
Ultimately , what is probably most discouraging is that Wald ’s op - ed is not entirely out of sync with Obama administration policy .
It is worth noting the president ’s speech in Prague in April with regard to nuclear proliferation :
" Some countries will break the rules .
That ’s why we need a structure in place that ensures when any nation does , they will face consequences . "
" Rules must be binding .
Violations must be punished .
Words must mean something .
The world must stand together to prevent the spread of these weapons . "
The logical ( and inevitable ) conclusion to such rhetoric is the use of military force .
In that respect , the difference between Obama and Bush is more in style than substance .

Ex -FBI Agent : Why I Support a New 9/11 Investigation
Original Publication - Rawstory.com
By Coleen Rowley
In the absence of my being there in New York City to stand with the 9/11 families , first responders and survivors , I offer the following statement in support of your goal of a new investigation into the attacks of September 11th and the NYC CAN campaign to place it on the ballot for November .
At the time of 9 - 11 , I had been an FBI agent for over 20 years .
My main responsibilities by then were teaching criminal procedure to FBI agents and other law enforcement officers , mostly about 4th Amendment search and seizure , 5th and 6th Amendment law of interrogation , right to attorney and constitutional protection of rights to “ free speech ” , due process , habeas corpus , and against cruel and unusual punishment .
A week before 9 - 11 , I and the rest of the FBI ’s ethics instructors were mandated ( as a result of an earlier public FBI scandal ) to give a one hour PowerPoint presentation , a form of remedial training on “ law enforcement ethics ” which I accomplished in a fairly perfunctory way , just reading the slides .
After 9 - 11 , with the knowledge I had of the bitter internal dispute inside the FBI that was being hushed up but had kept some of our better agents from possibly uncovering more of the 9 - 11 plot before it happened , I could n’t forget two of the slides in that Law Enforcement ethics curriculum : “ DO NOT : Puff , Shade , Tailor , Firm up , Stretch , Massage , or Tidy up statements of fact . ”
And “ Misplaced Loyalties :
As employees of the FBI , we must be aware that our highest loyalty is to the United States Constitution .
We should never sacrifice the truth in order to obtain a desired result ( e.g. conviction of a defendant ) or to avoid personal or institutional embarrassment . ”
The official dissembling and excuse - making about the true causes and prior mistakes that gave rise to and allowed the terrorist attacks to happen , almost immediately ushered in the Bush - Cheney Administration ’s egregious and lawless , post 9 - 11 “ war on terror ” agenda which bore no connection to the original causes and no connection to the goal of reducing terrorism and making the world safer .
When I got a chance , about 8 ½ months after 9 - 11 to tell what I knew , I did so and my disclosures led to further investigation by the Department of Justice Inspector General and figured in the 9 - 11 Commission Report .
But it was way too late for this emerging bit of truth that has continued to leak out in dribs and drabs to have any impact .
The laws themselves , especially the criminal procedure ones rooted in the Constitution that I had spent my career teaching to law enforcement , have largely gone up in smoke .
Having seen the cost of remaining silent , I publicly warned , a few months after my first memo , against launching the pre-emptive invasion of Iraq .
But false agendas had already filled the vacuum created by lack of truth .
And we are still dealing with the disastrous consequences of these unjustified , pre-emptive wars .
Let me therefore simply repeat the request I made to the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 2002 : “ Foremost , we owe it to the public , especially the victims of terrorism , to be completely honest .
I can only imagine what these crime and terrorism victims continue to go through .
They deserve nothing but the complete , unfettered truth . ”
Therefore , I fully support the 9/11 families , first responders , survivors and over 60,000 other New Yorkers who have endorsed a new 9/11 investigation in New York City as advanced by ballot referendum this coming November election .

The University of Cambridge team found these people were able to distinguish between pairs that looked identical to those with " normal " colour vision .
The study is published in the journal Current Biology .
Deuteranomaly is linked to a defect on the X sex chromosome .
The present findings recall reports from the Second World War , which suggested that ' colour blind ' observers might be superior in penetrating camouflage
Dr John Mollon
Colours are detected by humans through the combined action of three different types of cone photoreceptor cells , each of which is optimally activated by different wavelengths of light .
These sensitivities are altered in deuteranomalous colour blind individuals because they possess a variant form of one of the cone photoreceptors .
The sensitivity of cones that should be " middle - wave " is shifted toward that of " long - wave " cones .
This results in decreased ability to differentiate between some colours that are easily distinguishable by those with normal colour vision .
Altered sensitivities
In theory , however , it is possible that owing to the altered sensitivities of their cone photoreceptors , people with deuteranomalous colour blindness may be sensitive to colour differences that are not apparent to those with normal colour vision .
The Cambridge team tested this idea by asking deuteranomalous and " colour - normal " individuals to report whether they were able to distinguish between pairs of colours that were theoretically predicted to look different to people with deuteranomalous colour blindness , but the same to those with normal colour vision .
The researchers duly found some colour pairs were only seen to be different by deuteranomalous individuals .
The finding suggests that although these individuals may be blind to some colours accessible to people who are not colour blind , they also have a sensitivity to a " colour dimension " that is inaccessible to those with normal colour vision .
In fact , the researchers found people with deuteranomalous colour blindness gave large difference ratings to pairs of colours which appeared indistinguishable to others .
The researchers , led by Dr John Mollon , said : " The present findings recall reports from the Second World War , which suggested that ' colour blind ' observers might be superior in penetrating camouflage .
" In part , this might be because random colour variations are less salient than structural or textural variations for the colour blind .
" However , a second factor may be the one considered above : a camouflage paint may not be physically identical to the surrounding foliage but may be a good match to the normal eye - while being a poor match for an anomalous eye . "
Dr Joseph Carroll , of the University of Rochester in New York , said there was enormous variation between people with deuteranomalous colour blindness .
He said the findings of the latest research would probably only apply to those people with the biggest gap in sensitivity between their long - wavelength sensitive and middle - wavelength sensitive cones .
However , he said it was possible that the tests used in the study , when combined with standard tests of colour vision , may be a more sensitive indicator of the severity of a person 's colour vision defect .
Yes , giving up the public option just whets their appetites .
The Republicans smell blood in the water .
Rahm has done so well , right ?
Obama 's unwillingness to fight has been so successful .
Yep , Baucus really knows how to negotiate .
Bipartisanship means letting Republicans win .
Once again , Democrats get sand kicked in their face and smile .
I 'm sick and tired of working for politicians who wo n't fight for working people .
No contributions , no work , except for progressives .
None .
Update I : Senator Feingold :
" A public option is a fundamental part of ensuring health care reform brings about real change .
Opposing the public plan is an endorsement of the status quo in this country that has left tens of millions of Americans uninsured or underinsured and put massive burdens on employers .
I have heard too many horror stories from my constituents about how the so - called competitive marketplace has denied them coverage from the outset , offered a benefit plan that covers everything but what they need or failed them some other way .
A strong public option would ensure competition in the industry to provide the best , most affordable insurance for Americans and bring down the skyrocketing health care costs that are the biggest contributor to our long - term budget deficits .
I am not interested in passing health care reform in name only .
Without a public option , I do n't see how we will bring real change to a system that has made good health care a privilege for those who can afford it . "
Feingold Statement on Public Option
Update II : Pelosi stands firm :
Pelosi Statement on Public Option
Washington , D.C. – Speaker Nancy Pelosi released the following statement on health insurance reform legislation pending before Congress :
Porsche tried to take over VW before agreeing a merger deal
The offices of German luxury carmaker Porsche have been raided by federal prosecutors probing the alleged market manipulation of Volkswagen shares .
The investigation centres on former chief executive Wendelin Wiedeking and finance chief Holger Haerter , who both resigned last month .
The carmaker had built up a stake of 51 % in VW in an attempt to launch a takeover of Europe 's biggest carmaker .
Porsche denied the accusations and said it would co-operate with prosecutors .
The two carmakers have subsequently agreed to a merger , ending months of bitter feuding .
It will take place in 2011 .
Failed takeover PORSCHE & VW TIMELINE March 2008 : Porsche says it will take a controlling stake in VW , - upping its holding from 31 % to above 50 % .
October 2008 : VW briefly becomes world 's biggest company by market value as its shares surge .
It follows Porsche buying VW shares , leaving fewer for hedge funds who needed to buy them to close their positions .
January 2009 : Porsche says it plans to lift VW stake to 75 % .
However this never materialises because of the financial crisis and the slump in the global automotive sector .
May 2009 : Porsche and VW agree a merger after weeks of talks .
VW later suspends talks - saying constructive negotiations are not possible and that Porsche must reduce its debt .
June 2009 : Porsche has request for a 1.75 bn euro loan turned - as it struggles to finance the debt it took on as part of its attempts to gain full control of VW .
July 2009 : VW says it plans to buy Porsche .
The failure of Porsche to takeover VW prompts Porsche chief executive Wendelin Wiedeking and financial director Holger Haerter to resign .
August 2009 : VW and Porsche agreed details under which VW will initially buy a 42 % stake in Porsche - ending months of acrimony between the two firms .
Final nail in coffin for Porsche 's efforts to buy VW .
August 2009 : Porsche offices are raided by federal prosecutors .
" On Thursday morning , officers from Stuttgart prosecutors entered the company 's offices with search warrants .
" The prosecutors suspect a breach of public disclosure requirements and market manipulation , " Porsche said .
Under Mr Wiedeking , Porsche built up a majority stake in the much larger VW , but failed in its attempt to force a full takeover .
Porsche made huge profits on its VW shares , leading some commentators to describe the firm as a hedge fund with a carmaker tacked on the side .
In fact , the share price rises contributed 6.84bn euros to the company 's pre-tax profit of 7.34bn euros in the first three months of this year .
However , the onset of the global economic crisis put paid to the company 's attempts to push its shareholding in VW to 75 % .
As a result of its failed takeover , Porsche was saddled with huge debts .
Family ties
In order to shore up its finances , the carmaker announced last week that the state of Qatar would take a major stake in the company .
Qatar will eventually become the carmaker 's third biggest shareholder , behind the Porsche and Piech families and the German state of Lower Saxony .
Under the terms of the merger with VW finally agreed last week , VW will initially buy a 42 % stake in Porsche by the end of this year for 3.3 bn euros ( $ 4.7bn ; £ 2.8 bn ) .
The deal means that Porsche will now in effect become the 10th brand in the VW family , joining the likes of Audi , Seat and Skoda .

In the good old days before electricity and massive industry , many jobs that now require no or little labor , were undertaken by humans .
This list looks at ten jobs that are now ( mostly ) extinct .
Each job contains at least one element of the bizarre .
Be sure to add your own favorites to the comments .
10 Jester
We have all heard of the court Jester – the fool who was permitted to insult the king without losing his head – as long as it made the king laugh .
It was a job that came with accolades and with fear .
It is also a job unlike any existent today .
How many families do you know that employ a private “ comedian ” so to speak ?
But , while the job did vanish from history for hundreds of years , as recently as 1999 one Kingdom ( Tonga ) has appointed an official jester .
In a bizarre ( and very amusing ) twist , the man appointed happened to also be the government ’s financial advisor .
He was later embroiled in a financial scandal .
The American jester to the Tongan court was Jesse Bogdonoff and he is pictured above .
9 Toshers and Mudlarks
A tosher was someone who scavenges in the sewers , especially in London during the Victorian period .
The toshers decided to cut out the middle man and it was a common sight in 19th Century Wapping for whole families to whip off a manhole cover and go down into the sewers , where they would find rich pickings .
As most toshers would reek of the sewers , they were not popular with the neighbors .
Similarly , the mudlarks were people who would dredge the banks of the Thames in the early morning when the tide was out .
They would have to wade through unprocessed sewerage and even sometimes dead bodies in order to find little treasures to sell .
In a kind of weird twist , this is now the popular hobby of some middle class Londoners who travel the banks to clean up trash .
8 Knocker -Up
A Knocker - up was a profession in England and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution , before alarm clocks were affordable or reliable .
A knocker - up ’s job was to rouse sleeping people so they could get to work on time .
The knocker - up often used a long and light stick ( often bamboo ) to reach windows on higher floors .
In return , the knocker - up would be paid a few pence a week for this job .
The knocker - up would not leave a client ’s window until they were assured the client had been awoken .
This all leads to the obvious question : who knocks up the knocker - up ?
7 Toad Doctor
Toad doctors were practitioners of a specific tradition of medicinal folk magic , operating in western England until the end of the 19th century .
Their main concern was healing scrofula ( then called “ the King ’s Evil , ” a skin disease ) , though they were also believed to cure other ailments including those resulting from witchcraft .
They cured the sick by placing a live toad , or the leg of one , in a muslin bag and hanging it around the sick person ’s neck .
Needless to say this job would also require growing or gathering up a large collection of toads , and in the case of doctors who used just the leg , chopping their legs off to give to their patient .
6 Dog Whipper
A dog whipper was a church official charged with removing unruly dogs from a church or church grounds during services .
In some areas of Europe during the 16th to 19th centuries it was not uncommon for household dogs to accompany – or at least follow – their owners to church services .
If these animals became disruptive it was the job of the dog whipper to remove them from the church , allowing the service to continue in peace .
Dog whippers were usually provided with a whip ( hence the title ) or a pair of large wooden tongs with which to remove the animals .
They were generally paid for their services , and records of payments to the local dog whipper exist in old parish account books in many English churches .
5 Resurrectionist
In Britain , the crime of snatching a body was only a misdemeanor and so was punishable by a small fine only .
This led to a huge industry in body snatching in order to provide corpses to the blossoming medical schools of Europe .
One method the body - snatchers used was to dig at the head end of a recent burial , digging with a wooden spade ( quieter than metal ) .
When they reached the coffin ( in London the graves were quite shallow ) , they broke open the coffin , put a rope around the corpse and dragged it out .
They were often careful not to steal anything such as jewelry or clothes as this would cause them to be liable to a felony charge .
During 1827 and 1828 , some Edinburgh resurrectionists including Burke and Hare changed their tactics from grave - robbing to murder , as they were paid more for very fresh corpses .
Their activities , and those of the London Burkers who imitated them , resulted in the passage of the Anatomy Act 1832 .
This allowed unclaimed bodies and those donated by relatives to be used for the study of anatomy .
This effectively ended the body snatching business .
4 Fuller
Fulling is a step in woollen clothmaking which involves the cleansing of cloth ( particularly wool ) to eliminate oils , dirt , and other impurities , and making it thicker .
In days gone by , the fullers were often slaves .
In Roman times , fulling was conducted by slaves standing ankle deep in tubs of human urine and cloth .
Urine was so important to the fulling business that urine was taxed .
Urine , known as ‘ wash ’ , was a source of ammonium salts and assisted in cleansing and whitening the cloth .
By the medieval period , fuller ’s earth had been introduced for use in the process which ameliorated the process and removed the need for urine .
3 Whipping Boy
A whipping boy , in the 1600s and 1700s , was a young boy who was assigned to a young prince and was punished when the prince misbehaved or fell behind in his schooling .
Whipping boys were established in the English court during the monarchies of the 15th century and 16th century .
They were created because the idea of the Divine Right of Kings , which stated that kings were appointed by God , and implied that no one but the king was worthy of punishing the king ’s son .
Since the king was rarely around to punish his son when necessary , tutors to the young prince found it extremely difficult to enforce rules or learning .
Whipping boys were generally of high birth , and were educated with the prince since birth .
Due to the fact that the prince and whipping boy grew up together since birth , they usually formed an emotional bond .
The strong bond that developed between a prince and his whipping boy dramatically increased the effectiveness of using a whipping boy as a form of punishment for a prince .
The idea of the whipping boys was that seeing a friend being whipped or beaten for something that he had done wrong would be likely to ensure that the prince would not make the same mistake again .
2 Groom of the Stool
The Groom of the Stool was a male servant in the household of an English monarch who , among other duties , “ preside[d ] over the office of royal excretion , ” that is , he had the task of cleaning the monarch ’s anus after defecation .
In the early years of Henry VIII ’s reign , the title was awarded to minions of the King , court companions who spent time with him in the Privy chamber .
These were the sons of noblemen or important members of the gentry .
In time they came to act as virtual personal secretaries to the King , carrying out a variety of administrative tasks within his private rooms .
The position was an especially prized one , as it allowed one unobstructed access to the King ’s attention .
Despite being the official bum - wiper of the king , the Groom of the Stool had a very high social standing .
1 Gong Farmer
A gong farmer or gongfermor was the term used in Tudor England for a person who removed human excrement from privies and cesspits , gong being another word for dung .
Gong farmers were only allowed to work at night and the waste they collected , known as night soil , had to be taken outside the city or town boundaries .
As flushing water closets became more widely used , the profession of gong farming disappeared .
A latrine or privy was the toilet of the Middle Ages .
A gong farmer dug out the cesspits and emptied the excrement .
Gong farmers were only allowed to work between 9 pm and 5 am , and were permitted to live only in certain areas , for reasons that should not be too elusive .
Due to the noxious fumes produced by human excrement , coroners ’ reports exist of gong farmers dying of asphyxiation .
This was obviously a shit job to have .

UNIVERSAL CITY , California —
Although the 2009 Teen Choice Awards left celebrities and stargazers alike with plenty to talk about , none of the evening 's events mixed sarcasm , celebrity and old - fashioned entertainment as effectively as the unlike - anything - you 've - ever - seen performance of one Miss [ artist id = " 2408193 " ]
Miley Cyrus [ / artist ] .
Taking the stage to perform her newly released single , " Party in the U.S.A. , " the 16 - year - old superstar danced around a " trailer trash " set , tongue firmly in cheek , as she spoofed her Tennessee upbringing and even took a whirl around a stripper - like pole on top of an ice - cream pushcart .
" Tonight I 'm performing ' Party in the U.S.A. , ' which is my new single and which I 'm super - excited about , " Miley told MTV News before the taping of the awards , which will air on Fox on Monday night ( August 10 ) .
" I 'm about to go out on tour , so all my music is being aired out right now . "
Miley was also excited to discuss the concept of her performance , which had her giving shout - outs to Britney Spears — moments before she 'd come back onstage to present the pop princess with her Ultimate Choice Award .
" [ My ] performance tonight is funny , but I wanted it to be about [ something more ] , " Miley explained with sincerity .
" ' Party in the U.S.A. ' is an all - American song , and so I come out tonight and I 'm literally in a trailer park .
It 's a blinged - out trailer park . "
Cyrus , her father Billy Ray and others in her group planned out the big number , which she told us was fun but something that had a much deeper meaning to her .
" I 'm like , ' This is to represent where I am from .
I 'm so proud of it , ' " Miley explained .
" All the girls trying to be Hollywood and stuff with their big glasses , me shooing them away .
" I love it , " Miley explained of her performance , one of the most memorable moments of the star - studded evening .
" It 's about my roots . "

Why not try repackaging the same old crap ? ( , Thu 24 Sep 2009 , 22:30 , More
Fannie Mae , the government - controlled mortgage - finance company , bought the loans Deutsche Bank Berkshire Mortgage made to Ocelot for 18 of Ocelot ’s 25 buildings , totaling $ 29 million from 2006 to 2007 .
Fannie Mae has now acknowledged that the loans did not meet their underwriting standards at the time of origination .
Mr. Cestero said in an interview that the poor conditions created by overleveraged buildings were nothing like the widespread abandonment of the late 1970s and early ’ 80s , which turned some neighborhoods into urban wastelands .
But he said the conditions not only threatened tenants ’ health and safety , but risked destabilizing entire blocks .
As a result , he said , the agency had become more aggressive in tracking the buildings , making emergency repairs and working with lenders to find new , responsible owners , as he said the agency was doing with Fannie Mae on the Ocelot buildings .
“ We are very concerned and continue to be concerned about the overall problem that Ocelot represents in the city , where you have multifamily buildings in some state of financial distress , ” he said .
“ If that financial distress is not corrected quickly , you will ultimately end up with physical distress . ”
Tenants have grown frustrated waiting for repairs .
Fannie Mae , which initiated foreclosure proceedings in March on the 18 Ocelot properties for which it had purchased loans , is able to make repairs only in those buildings for which a court has appointed a receiver .
Residents at one run-down Ocelot building sued the landlord , persuading a judge to appoint an independent administrator to make repairs .
Ocelot , which described itself in a 2007 Deutsche Bank press release as building a portfolio of subsidized , “ income - producing real estate , ” has become a kind of phantom .
Its Web site is defunct .
It used to have a suite in a Madison Avenue office tower , but it was evicted this year for nonpayment of rent .
“ The owner is making no attempt to repair the buildings or fix the violations or make them decent places to live , ” said Mr. Cestero , whose agency has so far paid for roughly $ 850,000 in emergency repairs in the 25 buildings , money Ocelot now owes the city .
Rachel Arfa , Ocelot ’s president , did not return phone calls seeking comment .
For Ocelot tenants in the Bronx , life has been far from ordinary .
At 1744 Clay Avenue , residents have endured winter days without heat and hot water .
The super has not been paid in about three months ; tenants took up a collection to buy building supplies .
At 2254 Crotona Avenue , the occupants of one apartment abandoned it last year after parts of the ceiling collapsed , leaving many of their belongings behind .
It remains vacant , a small - scale disaster zone of leaky pipes and caved - in walls and ceilings .
Tenants in the building and other Ocelot properties use knives and screwdrivers to open doors without locks or doorknobs .

Is India being diplomatic enough to and about China and and vice versa ?
You have n't visited China since your swashbuckling escape to India in January 2000 .
Have you ever been invited back and what is your relationship with the Chinese authorities ?
But as the only senior Tibetan Buddhist monk to be recognized by both the Chinese and the Dalai Lama , many say you could be the hinge on which relations between Tibetans and China swing in a new direction ?
But you sound very angry with Beijing ?
Do you think those ' opportunities ' will have arisen by the time you are 50 ?
You 're 24 today and Tibetans have already been in India more than half - a- century ?
Will Tibetans become totally Indian by the time you 're 50 ?
You are young , so you understandably sound impatient .
The Dalai Lama is 73 , many say you should succeed him because you embody the story of your people - of oppression , escape and exile - and have been coached by the Dalai Lama ?
But if you were asked - by popular appeal - to assume leadership of the Tibetan movement , would you accept ?
Yes or no ?
Moving to other issues , I believe you like to listen to hip - hop on your ipod .
Who are your favourite artistes ?
Is that why you play war games on your play station because many might say it 's inappropriate for a Buddhist monk dedicated to peace to play war games ?
But should n't meditation take care of that ?
You 've practically grown up in India , do you speak Hindi , read it , eat Indian food and like it , or do you try and stay away from all that because you want to maintain your Tibetan cultural affiliations ?
Thoda thoda
I know you 've been talking to schoolchildren in Delhi about ' how to be happy ' .
Can anyone ever be totally happy ?
Are you ?
If a free Tibet would make you happier , may be you 're not totally happy like the rest of us lay people ?
India is downplaying the Chinese incursions but Beijing remains miffed about the Dalai Lama���s visit in November to a monastery in Arunachal Pradesh .
Meanwhile , the Karmapa Lama Trinley Dorje , the only senior Buddhist leader recognized by Beijing , the Tibetans and India , picks his way through the diplomatic minefield .
On a visit to Delhi from Dharamsala , the 24 - year - old leader of one of the major schools of Tibetan Buddhism talks politics , hip - hop and video games with .
Excerpts from the interview .
Obviously I can't speak from the perspective of a politician who is active in these communications .
Obviously the government of each country has its own interests in the ongoing conversation .
They are doing what they can to advance their own interests .
I 'm not able to comment on what those interests might be .
But if I were to make some observations and guesses from my own vantage point , it seems to me that the Chinese government is acting somewhat deliberately in attempts to slightly irritate the government of India .
Because of this the neighbourly relationship has suffered a little bit .
India has always been a relatively peaceful country , a country that has always had a reasonably good record of valuing peace , India does not seem interested in pursuing any type of conflict , however , India is on the rise in the world and perhaps the Chinese government feels some type of impulse to blunt this rise somehow .
Perhaps that is what is causing some of the things we see today .
Relationship !
I do n't have a particular relationship at all with the Chinese government .
When I lived in Tibet , it is of course controlled by Beijing so there was no choice but to have some form of relationship .
However , I have left Tibet and now live in India and so I 'm completely removed from any type of control exerted by the Chinese government and so there is no communication to speak of , there is no relationship at all .
No , it 's not that I have any anger or aversion to the Chinese whatsoever .
Since I am a Dharma practitioner , I try to maintain impartiality and be free from excessive attachment to my own side and aversion to and hatred of others .
In terms of where my own interests lie , I 'm very passionate about supporting the middle path that has been articulated by His Holiness the Dalai Lama .
In His Holiness 's vision of this middle path , there is great benefit for the people of Tibet and also great benefit for the people of China .
If we follow the middle path , both the government of China and the people of Tibet will be benefited .
This vision is something that about 90 % of Tibetans support - the vast majority of Tibetans .
I simply consider myself one of those Tibetans whose responsibility it is to further the cause of the people .
Now in terms of specific opportunities that might arise from me to serve this vision , I 'm not so sure .
Right now , the government - in - exile of Tibet has been engaging Beijing in dialogue but perhaps the dialogue has n't always been fruitful .
So , we have to wait and see what kind of opportunities arise .
Due to the kind support of the Indian government and the Indian people and due to the exemplary leadership of His Holiness the Dalai Lama , we Tibetans have been able to preserve Tibetan culture in the diaspora to some degree .
Nevertheless , we would obviously rather be preserving the culture of Tibet inside a Tibet that was amenable to us .
Obviously , that 's not the situation now so that means there 's going to be some challenges for us in preserving our culture exactly the way we want to .
Really , if you want to preserve Tibetan culture in the long term , that has to happen inside Tibet .
This is why I feel the situation of Tibet is dire and that people in the world need to pay more attention to it .
The situation is not one where we can take our time and wait 10 , 20 , 30 years to see what happens , what conditions might change because the danger is so great that much our culture could be lost and the chances of restoring our culture greatly diminished .
So it 's actually quite a hot potato that we have here .
We have to do something quickly .
In the language of your question , if we were to wait 50 years , we would be in danger of losing a great chunk of Tibetan culture that could not be recovered .
Well , you made some remarks about people perceiving me to have a special background .
I would accept that generally speaking , I do have some special attributes in my background in terms of my life story and this subject of the future of Tibetan leadership and possible successors to the role of leadership that the Dalai Lama plays , has been a popular topic in the general conversation around the Tibet issue .
However as I always say , I am just one of the students , the followers of the Dalai Lama and there are a great many Tibetan people who are doing a wonderful job serving the vision of His Holiness and implementing his vision .
I try to do my best too but in terms of future roles that I might assume , I 'm already the Karmapa , that 's my role and it's already one I feel quite weighed down by , it 's heavy responsibilities .
For the future , my view is that I will continue as I am now , serving the vision of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and all of us who are serving this vision together will be successful .
It 's really quite an involved issue .
In order for anyone to assume the role of leader of the Tibetan people , it 's important to have historical context or at least an examination of the historical context .
For anywhere between 800 and 900 years , the Karmapa has been a very apolitical figure , a person who has concentrated solely on spiritual leadership , not involved in any way with governmental leadership .
So I think it would be very difficult to change that historical pattern overnight and turn the role of the Karmapa into something more than strictly a spiritual teacher .
Furthermore , we have to be mindful that the Dalai Lama is enjoying excellent health , he 's very active , he 's still contributing tremendously to the cause of the Tibetan people , he is the strong leader of the Tibetan people and that will continue .
It 's important not to get too far ahead of ourselves .
There 's a lot of talk about what an authentic Tibetan democracy will look like in the future , who are the leaders going to be , but that 's all discussion at this point and we should n't try and reach too far into the future .
I can't think of any specific artistes right now , I basically listen to what ever comes my way , whatever sounds appealing .
It 's important for me to stick to my traditional forms of art because I am a Tibetan Buddhist teacher wearing these robes .
It 's important for me to maintain my cultural affiliations .
But from time to time I do enjoy listening to hip - hop because it has a very modern sound to it and even though I'm a Tibetan teacher representing these ancient teachings , I 'm also a global citizen in the 21st century .
Hip - hop perhaps is one way of me being a 21st - century person .
Well , I view video games as something of an emotional therapy , a mundane level of emotional therapy for me .
We all have emotions whether we 're Buddhist practitioners or not , all of us have emotions , happy emotions , sad emotions , displeased emotions and we need to figure out a way to deal with them when they arise .
So , for me sometimes it can be a relief , a kind of decompression to just play some video games .
If I 'm having some negative thoughts or negative feelings , video games are one way in which I can release that energy in the context of the illusion of the game .
I feel better afterwards .
The aggression that comes out in the video game satiates whatever desire I might have to express that feeling .
For me , that 's very skilful because when I do that I do n't have to go and hit anyone over the head .
No , video games are just a skilful method ..
I like Indian food and learnt a little bit of Hindi as well , but beyond that it 's important to recognize for all practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism that now is the time to be more open to all cultures and traditions in the world .
Tibetan Buddhism must interact with a wide cross-section of cultures .
We can't isolate ourselves any longer and say 'oh , I'm a Tibetan Buddhist practitioner , I have to live up in the mountains and cut all my ties with society ' .
Now is the time for Buddhists to be engaged with the world and part of that is other languages and cultures and different experiences of people .
Especially with regard to India , the birthplace of Buddhism and in all Buddhist traditions there is very high reverence for the land of India , the country .
I have taken some time to learn Hindi , I know a little bit and if I could practice with someone on a regular basis , I would pick it up more quickly .
I did n't find it too hard , Hindi is also fairly close to Tibetan in language form .
In my previous studies , I studied some Sanskrit grammar as well .
Whether one 's happy or not really depends on the way one holds one 's mind .
With regard to the situation in Tibet , of course many of us hope for things to improve but even if Tibet were to gain autonomy , in harmony with the middle way path , it 's possible you still wo n't be content in your mind .
It 's really up to the mind of the individual whether you 're happy or not and one of the main keys to happiness is being content with little .
That contentment is the ground for genuine , stable and long - lasting .
As to whether anyone can be happy without any suffering whatsoever , happiness and suffering are inter-dependent .
You can't really speak of happiness if you do n't have a reference point of some suffering .
You can't speak of suffering if you do n't have a reference point of some happiness .
You can talk a certain kind of happiness that 's beyond the realm of mundane happiness or mundane suffering , but you 're talking a pretty high - end game at that point .
Preliminary results from ESA ’s Planck mission to study the early Universe indicate that the data quality is excellent .
This bodes well for the full sky survey that has just begun .
Planck started surveying the sky regularly from its vantage point at the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth system , L2 , on 13 August .
The instruments were fine - tuned for optimum performance in the period preceding this date .
ESA 's Planck microwave observatory is the first European mission designed to study the Cosmic Microwave Background – the relic radiation from the Big Bang .
Following launch on 14 May , checkouts of the satellite 's subsystems were started in parallel with the cool - down of its instruments ' detectors .
The detectors are looking for variations in the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background that are about a million times smaller than one degree – this is comparable to measuring from Earth the body heat of a rabbit sitting on the Moon .
To achieve this , Planck 's detectors must be cooled to extremely low temperatures , some of them being very close to absolute zero ( –273.15 °C , or zero Kelvin , 0K ) .
With check - outs of the subsystems finished , instrument commissioning , optimisation , and initial calibration was completed by the second week of August .
The ' first light ' survey , which began on 13 August , was a two - week period during which Planck surveyed the sky continuously .
It was carried out to verify the stability of the instruments and the ability to calibrate them over long periods to the exquisite accuracy needed .
This survey was completed on 27 August , yielding maps of a strip of the sky , one for each of Planck 's nine frequencies .
Each map is a ring , about 15° wide , stretching across the full sky .
Preliminary analysis indicates that the quality of the data is excellent .
Routine operations started as soon as the first light survey was completed , and surveying will now continue for at least 15 months without a break .
In approximately 6 months , the first all - sky map will be assembled .
Within its allotted operational life of 15 months , Planck will gather data for two complete sky maps .
To fully exploit the high sensitivity of Planck , the data will require delicate adjustments and careful analysis .
It promises to return a treasure trove that will keep both cosmologists and astrophysicists busy for decades to come .
Here is the truth , you are putting more power to the Government .
Why do you think they would want to institute this so badly ?
When was the last time the Government came around and did something for you that was not in their best interest ?
Think of it this way , were you happy under Bush ?
If not , how would you have felt about granting more and more power towards his office ?
Now , can you guarantee that you will have the same blind faith and trust in every FUTURE politician that may be in control of the all powerful system you wish to establish ?
Just because you are happy with the current situation does not mean you will be in the future .
If you give up these liberties and freedoms now by submitting to the initial steps of socialism then you will have no other choice but compliance in the future .
What if you are denied health care in the future because they deem your actions immoral or illegal ?
Where would you go then ?
Its not a matter of the health care , its the overall principle of socialism becoming established .
READ THE CONSTITUTION .
I find it hilarious that people will buy into the magic occurrences described in a book written 1500 years ago , but have little faith in the founding fathers words .
Remember , they had to fight off an oppressive Government and laid ground rules to prevent it from happening again .

Beer fans poised for Divine release
St. Arnold Divine Reserve No. 8 St. Arnold Divine Reserve No. 8 Photo : Brett Coomer , Chronicle Photo : Brett Coomer , Chronicle Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Beer fans poised for Divine release 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
Tween girls have the Jonas Brothers , and vampire fanatics Twilight and True Blood .
Thursday , beer geeks have Saint Arnold Divine Reserve No. 8 .
Serious brew fans will fan out across the city , stalking beer trucks and scouring the beer aisles at groceries and liquor stores as the first cases hit the shelves .
They 'll be cell - phoning their friends and checking Twitter for news of six - pack sightings .
And in a grown - up version of a Harry Potter release party , scores of them will descend on the downtown Flying Saucer , dressed to the nines in Saint Arnold hats and T - shirts , after general manager Jake Rainey sends out the alert that he 's about to tap the keg .
Parceled out in Belgian - style snifters , the keg should yield 135 to 140 glasses .
“ I can expect that to be gone in about an hour , ” Rainey predicted .
After seven highly rated releases — Divine Reserve No. 4 took gold in the World Beer Cup's Scotch
Ale category — the arrival of these single - batch brews has become a much - anticipated event .
Just 1,504 cases were bottled this year , and the beers can be tough to find , even at $ 15 to $ 16 a six - pack .
“ It 's gotten progressively more challenging as the awareness has grown , ” said Craig Stichtenoth , who has sampled the entire series and still has bottles aging at his home in Katy .
He plans to the hit the Spec's , Kroger and H - E - B outlets as soon as he gets home from work , cell phone in hand — unless , of course , his wife has already found some for him .
The downtown Spec 's will have No. 8 when the doors open at 10 a.m. , but customers will be restricted to two six - packs each .
The series ' popularity is due in large part to the success of the earlier offerings , Stichtenoth said , while Facebook , Twitter and beer blogs are getting the word out to ever - larger crowds .
Houston - based Saint Arnold does n't distribute beyond Texas , but local aficionados buy the Divine Reserves and trade them for specialty beers from other parts of the country .
“ People are anxious to share their local big beers , ” Stichtenoth said .
Rainey also credits Saint Arnold with savvy marketing of Divine Reserve as a luxury item .
Local home - brewers , he added , are excited because No. 8 is based on the winning recipe from this year 's Big Batch Brew Bash .
“ It 's really kind of giving back to the beer community , ” he said .
Phillip Kaufman , whose BBBB - winning recipe inspired this Scotch ale , is doing his part to further tighten the supply .
He 's sending a case to family in Ohio , a case each to members of the sales staff at his chemical company and several other cases for friends , customers and co-workers .
“ I 'm buying as many cases as I can , ” he said .
Later this month , Kaufman will travel to Denver for the Great American Beer Festival , where Divine Reserve No. 8 is entered in the Pro - Am competition .
But buyer beware : No. 8 is no Brand X beer .
Asked for recollections of Divine Reserves past , Saint Arnold owner Brock Wagner recounted the story of “ people who have patiently saved bottles of Divine Reserve in their refrigerators only to come home and see some visitor dumping it down the drain , saying , ‘ What is this stuff ?
Do you have any light beer ? ' ”

Most people know them as European starlings , stout little birds that weigh no more than 4 ounces .
But around the nation ’s airports , they are called “ bullets with wings . ”
Flocks of them brought down a Lockheed Electra during takeoff in Boston in 1960 and a Belgian Air Force C - 130 Hercules cargo plane in the Netherlands in 1996 .
Combined , the crashes killed more than 100 people .
Starlings also fly in the crowded skies above Los Angeles International Airport , a major concern of biologist Todd Pitlik , who works for the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
His job is to control the wildlife populations at LAX , where more than 940 animal strikes involving commercial aircraft were reported between 1990 and 2008 .
About 4 % of the collisions caused substantial damage to engines , wings and fuselages .
Pitlik ’s work is n’t easy .
LAX ’s 3,500 acres just east of the Pacific Ocean contain a menagerie of birds and small mammals that inhabit the drainage ditches , trees , dunes and grassy flats that surround the four runways of the nation ’s third - busiest airport .

Red foxes dash across the tarmac .
Kestrels hover along the final approaches .
Sea gulls rummage for scraps of food while red-tailed hawks and peregrine falcons dive for live prey .
One year , young pelicans that had eaten toxic algae and fish were dropping on the runways .
“ Wildlife situations can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous , ” said Pitlik , 46 , who has worked at LAX since the late 1990s .
“ It is important to minimize the risk and liability , but it ’s also important to take care of the wildlife . ”
Pitlik is part of a USDA program that provided wildlife management services and training at more than 1,300 airports across the country last year .
He is one of seven department biologists in California who work at military and civilian aviation facilities .
Under federal regulations , commercial airports are required to assess wildlife hazards and develop management plans to reduce the risk of mammal and bird strikes .
The Federal Aviation Administration reviews the programs annually , said Ian Gregor , an FAA spokesman .

“ This might be an issue the public became aware of only after US Airways Flight 1549 ditched in the Hudson River ” in January , Gregor said .
“ But preventing bird strikes is something that the FAA and airports all over the country have been working hard at for years and years . ”
Nationally , there were 112,387 reports of aircraft striking birds , mammals and reptiles at 2,008 airports from 1990 to 2008 , according the FAA .
The collisions caused an estimated $ 725 million in damage last year to commercial , military and private craft .
To deal with the problem at LAX , Pitlik has placed traps for birds in the open spaces , including 6 - foot - high metal cages that capture starlings .
Wood and screen boxes with collapsible roofs catch kestrels , hawks and falcons .
For bait , he uses pet food and live pigeons in enclosures that shield them from injury .
Traps for mammals , including raccoons , rabbits , foxes and feral cats , are set as needed ; most are euthanized .

To scare birds and animals away from busy taxiways and runways , Pitlik regularly uses a small pistol that shoots noisy firecrackers into the air .
They either explode with a bang or make a whistling or screaming sound .
Pitlik ’s management plan includes the removal of habitat and food sources that attract wildlife to airport grounds .
Grassy fields and other vegetation are cut back to remove cover and nesting areas .
Vector control is called in occasionally to eliminate rodents and insects hunted by birds of prey .
Red - tailed hawks can be a threat to aircraft because they weigh 2 to 4 pounds , have large wing spans and can carry almost their weight in food .
Kestrels , the smallest and most common falcon in North America , are a lesser danger , but they have one of the highest casualty rates at LAX , especially in June and July when they teach their young to hunt .
The technique involves hovering over their prey at altitudes of up to 65 feet .
They also can become alarmed and fly directly into aircraft .
“ They get in the wrong place at the wrong time , ” Pitlik said .
“ They even get killed by the jet wash ” -- turbulence stirred by planes powering up to taxi or take off .

Pitlik has combined his fieldwork with a community outreach program to reduce the presence of birds at restaurants , grocery stores , gas stations , catering services and other businesses in and around the airport .
They are advised to remove trash promptly , cover garbage cans , trim vegetation , monitor roof tops and install netting or spikes to deter birds from roosting or nesting .
Though wildlife is plentiful in the area , LAX has a lower risk of animal strikes than some other airports because it is not situated along the migration paths of larger mammals or game birds , such as deer or the Canada geese that brought down the US Airways flight in New York City .
“ We have some larger birds , like red-tail hawks or the occasional egret and great blue heron , ” Pitlik said .
Advertisement
“ But their numbers and occurrences are not as great as large birds in the Midwest and Northeast .
Because of our location , we tend to dodge the bullet a little more . ”
Since 2000 , the list of airports with the greatest number of serious incidents has been led by New York ’s John F. Kennedy International with 30 and Sacramento International with 28 .
Los Angeles was tied for ninth place with 16 , including two emergency landings by airliners with engines damaged by bird strikes .
Last month , Pitlik estimated , he captured 350 starlings , 70 sparrows and pigeons , up to six red-tailed and Cooper ’s hawks , and several mammals .
He turns the hawks and falcons over to South Bay Wildlife Rehab , a nonprofit organization on the Palos Verdes Peninsula that cares for orphaned and injured birds and mammals .
Advertisement
The starlings and other small birds are killed and fed to the animals under the organization ’s care .
South Bay Wildlife monitors the hawks and falcons to make sure they are healthy before moving them at least 200 miles from LAX , making it difficult for them to return .
Ann Lynch , the founder and director , says her organization has handled almost 40 hawks and falcons captured at LAX , LA / Ontario International and Van Nuys Airport .
“ South Bay Wildlife helps me do my job , ” Pitlik said .

“ Getting the raptors out of the LAX environment allows them to continue to thrive .
It is a great service to me and the airport . ”

Remember when public opinion turned so dramatically against the Iraq war that the White House only let invited guests attend George W. Bush 's out - of - town speeches ?
Well it seems like the same thing might be happening to President Obama 's healthcare proposal .
As the Ticket reported yesterday , Obama answered questions at a town hall at Northern Virginia Community College in Annandale , Va. , about protecting the uninsured , giving consumers a public option and converting medical records from paper to digital files .
The White House portrayed the town - hall meeting as one in a series of public outreach events , a way for the president to keep his finger on the pulse of public opinion , and in turn to sway Americans on the complex and contentious issue .
This morning , the Washington Post is reporting that " of the seven questions the president answered , four were selected by his staff from videos submitted to the White House Web site or from those responding to a request for ' tweets . ' "
And the three audience members he called on randomly ?
The Post says " all turned out to be members of groups with close ties to his administration : the Service Employees International Union , Health Care for America Now , and Organizing for America , which is a part of the Democratic National Committee . "
None of this would surprise any good White House advance staffer .
Better to control the crowd , screen the questions , anticipate the topics .
And , to be fair , a college campus in a Democratic county might be expected to produce friendly questioners .
The problem is that Obama himself made an issue of transparency , promising an administration that allowed the public to see what its government was doing .
In fact on Jan. 22 , his first full day in office , Obama issued a series of executive orders instructing government agencies to open their files , saying , " Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency . "
So , naturally , reporters jumped on the apparent discrepancy , led by veteran Helen Thomas , a thorn in the side to many a presidential administration , and CBS ' Chip Reid .
See what you think .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs , deflecting the criticism , protested that the White House was not trying to manage the questions .
Thomas reminded him that the Obama administration , unlike its predecessors , calls reporters the night before a press conference to tell them they will be called on , a new way of managing the topics .
Waving off the criticism and arguing that the healthcare forum would be expansive , Gibbs asked the reporters how they could make the case that the White House is muffling dissent when " you have n't heard the questions . "
" It does n't matter .
It 's the process , " Reid argued .
" Even if there 's a tough question , it 's a question coming from somebody who was invited or who was screened or the question was screened . "
With the president 's popularity dropping from his stratospheric inaugural highs -- the latest Washington Post / ABC News poll this week found that Americans are evenly split , 48 to 48 % , on how Obama is handling the deficit -- the White House may be just trying to improve his standing by controlling the optics .
Saving his healthcare plan might prove more difficult .

Historically the 1st Monday after NFP ends up being the quietest trading day of the month .
Will history be threatened today ?
We have now shifted from employment to the Fed taking center stage .
The main event this week is the FOMC meeting , with the decision coming down on Wednesday .
Capital Markets are now wondering if Bernanke and Co. will alter some of their negativity and provide a more upbeat view on the economy , perhaps they could be so bold and shift into neutral !
This time will they explain an exit strategy ?
The market has been waiting for one , but , we may be asking for too many changes in one sitting !
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 9 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœsubduedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
It was a pleasant surprise , and we may look back and declare July 2009 was the month that the worst recession in 50 - years ended .
It was the month , where we saw the pace of US job losses slow more than forecasted and the unemployment rate drop for the 1st - time in over a year .
As a stand - alone event the decline is still weak , but , it was well ahead of the consensus .
PayrollÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s managed to fall by - 247 k , after a - 443 k loss in June .
The jobless rate unexpectedly slipped to + 9.4 % from +9.5 % .
However , the Obama administration is adamant that we will see that 10 % psychological unemployment print by year end .
Unusual seasonal distortions played no role .
This would have surprised almost all analysts .
For instance , despite the unusual timing of auto - plant shut downs this year , seasonally adjusted employment in vehicle and parts was up +28 k vs. a seasonally unadjusted print that was down - 8 k , leaving no real unusual effects in the July print from this sector .
It was the best labor report this year and analysts are expected to revise down their estimates , as the remainder of the year Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœcouldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ show a marked improvement or will it ?
The USD $ currently is lower against the EUR +0.09 % and JPY +0.19 % and higher against GBP - 0.30 % and CHF - 0.07 % .
The commodity currencies are mixed this morning , CAD - 0.01 % and AUD +0.45 % .
It was Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœnotÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ worth waiting for , it definitely surprised and disappointed the market .
CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s employment report was worse on both headline and detail .
The headline ( - 44.4 k vs. - 15 k ) for both full and part - time jobs fell .
The private decline was the worst in 6 - months .
Self - employment had another huge gain and people exited the workforce , driving a decline in the labor force ( + 8.6 % ) .
On the bright side , the pace of job losses is slower than the beginning of the year .
But , the headline has managed to print - 40 k + in 2 out of the last 3 - months !
Digging deeper , the report showed that full - time jobs fell by - 29.1 k , and part - time declined by - 15.4 k .
The labor force shrank by - 53.5 k , which pushed the participation rate to 67.2 % .
What is most disturbing is that collectively the public and private sector lost - 75 k ( the 10 - consectutive monthly decline ) was offset by the gain in self - employment ( +34.8 k ) .
Combine this with the decline in commodities prices has pressurized the loonie .
The general strength of the greenback on Friday took the whole market by surprise .
For now , look for the CAD to finally catch up with the weaker fundamentals !
The AUD managed to strengthen from a 1 - week low on the back of Asian bourses advancing on optimism that the global economy is recovering .
This has stimulated the demand for higher - yielding assets .
Last week we saw that the RBAÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s next move could see policy makers hiking interest rates ( +3 % ) as they scraped a prediction that the economy would fall into recession .
For now the currency looks like a good buy on pull backs ( 0.8397 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 70.88 down - 5 c ) .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s finally dawning on traders that last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s EIA report was actually bearish .
Couple that with the USD aggressively advancing vs. the EUR after FridayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s jobs report has crude prices backing off from its 2 - month highs .
The EIA report showed a bigger - than - projected supply increase .
The commodity Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s rise of late has been rapid and technically over extended on the top side .
The crude oil builds across the States and at Cushing ( where West Texas is stored - +1.2 m to +33.3 m w/w ) , are weighing on the market .
Demand destruction remains healthy as noted by industries reports contracting last month .
This certainly does not bode well for any strong rebound in the coming months .
Crude stocks increased + 1.67 m barrels , w/w , vs. an expected rise of +0.6 m .
Gas stocks declined - 212 k to 212.9 m .
The market was expecting a decline of - 800 k .
Supplies of distillate fuel ( including heating oil and diesel ) , fell - 1.14 m barrels to +161.5 m , an increase of +1.23 m was projected .
Technically the market needs to break below $ 69 to gain any true momentum .
Reality tells us that inventories are high , demand is still really weak and the risk is increasing that we will see a bigger correction towards $ 60 .
We are not seeing growth , but indicators are showing us a Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœless bad is goodÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ scenario .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth noting that OPEC increased their output levels for a 4th - consecutive month in July ( agreed compliance is slipping as some members states take advantage of the stronger prices ) .
Their output averaged +28.39 m barrels a day ( up +45 k , m / m ) .
With the dollar soaring on Friday , investors were willing to lock in their profits for the yellow metal which managed to print a 2 - month high last week .
It continues to underperform this morning ( $ 957 ) .
The Nikkei closed at 10,524 up + 112 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,418 down - 40 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,711 down - 21 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s backed up 11 bp on Friday ( 3.86 % ) and is little changed in the O/N session .
Treasuries prices plummeted last week , recording the largest yield climb for 5 - days in over 6 - years .
The stronger than expected employment data has persuaded investorÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s to purchases riskier assets .
This week the US government is to issue $ 75 b of notes and bonds .
At these lofty yields , will the market fight for the supply ?

One of my favorite DIYs in the newest issue of MAKE , Volume 19 , is a sweet project titled “ MIDI Camera Control ” in our DIY Imaging section by Josh Cardenas .
A while back , Josh got the rare opportunity to run visuals for The Hard Sell tour , a collaboration between renowned turntablists DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist .
These fine gentlemen were out to show nonbelievers that DJs do more than “ just play records ” by simultaneously performing using only original vintage - pressing 45 rpm records played on 8 turntables through 4 mixers .
Josh was tasked with coming up with the unobtrusive multi-camera live setup for the show .
And what he presents us with in MAKE 19 is how to make your own lower - budget version .
He uses standard CCD security cameras and pan-and - tilt brackets with a couple of servomotors for each one .
To avoid the prospect of interference during showtime , though , instead of R/C , Josh chose to use MIDI for control .
You can roughly see the setup in the performance shot above , but here ’s a closer look :
Read the full DIY in MAKE Volume 19 , which will be in your hands any minute now if you ’re a subscriber .
Otherwise , look for it on newsstands on August 18th .
And for kicks , check out this awesome little intro video for The Hard Sell tour , explaining the concept :

With the Federal Reserve 's daily debauching of the dollar , it 's hard for a person to know in what form they should store their savings .
Despite the machinations of the Fed , the demand for US dollars continues to be relatively high .
As Murray Rothbard noted in The Mystery of Banking , the public - expectations component of the demand for money does n't change suddenly and is based upon the record of the immediate past .
These expectations are sluggish in adapting to new conditions .
We seem to be in phase one of Ludwig von Mises 's outline of the typical inflation process : prices are n't rising nearly as much as the money supply .
The public still has deflationary expectations .
And why not ?
After all , the folks at the Bureau of Labor Statistics say that retail prices as measured by the consumer price index fell 2.1 percent this July from a year ago .
Meanwhile , the M - 2 money supply has increased by 8.7 percent year over year .
The average Joe and Jane on the street do n't care one whit that the Fed 's balance sheet has exploded in size over the past year .
And if the government says prices are going down , well , who are they to argue ?
Quantitative easing does n't sound all that scary .
CNBC says the financial system has been saved and Bernie Madoff is in jail — all is well .
But a few savvy folks are taking Bastiat 's cue that it 's more important to understand what is unseen as a result of economic policies , as opposed to just what is seen .
While the fractional - reserve money - manufacturing process is currently broken in the commercial banking sector — because credit - worthy borrowers are hard to source and crumbling real - estate values have bank regulators closing a handful of small banks each Friday evening — the Federal Reserve has expanded its balance sheet to make up the difference and bailed out the large - money - center banks in order that the whole apparatus does n't collapse .
So instead of allowing the market to provide a healthy cleansing deflation , the Fed , the Treasury , and bank regulators are fighting valiantly to keep the fractional - reserve - bubble machine operating , with the ultimate result likely to be inflation and possibly hyperinflation .
" As inflationary pressures mount anew and the financial markets increasingly shun US Treasuries , " wrote John Williams on his Shadow Government Statistics website this past January ,
an inflationary depression can evolve quickly into a hyperinflationary great depression .
Although hyperinflation became inevitable in the last decade , the onset of the process just recently was triggered by Fed and the Treasury actions in addressing the systemic solvency crisis .
What Williams describes is phase two of Mises 's inflation outline : instead of a rising demand for money moderating price increases , a falling demand for money will instead intensify price inflation .
Finally , we come to phase three , where prices go up faster than money supply , the demand for money drops to zero , and government fiat currencies collapse .
In anticipation of the coming inflation , more than a few folks are squirreling away gold coins , and , because of that demand , these coins are still selling at inflated premiums and the spot price of the yellow metal continues to hang stubbornly above $ 900 per ounce .
But gold may not be the only thing to hoard .
Interestingly , when asked if there is anything else a person can store their savings in , globetrotting investor Doug Casey recently offered up an item that has historically been used as money — cigarettes .
" Well , they keep raising the taxes on cigarettes — a pack now costs $ 10 in some places in the US , that 's 50 cents per individual cigarette , " Casey says .
If you 're American and are going to be storing things , you probably can't go wrong building a stash of cigarettes .
Even if you do n't smoke — or perhaps especially if you do n't smoke — every time you return to the US , you should buy the maximum amount of duty - free cigarettes allowed and store them .
Cigarettes , despite flunking the " durability " test , meet all the other criteria to make them a good monetary instrument .
They are generally marketable , despite the constant attacks on their use as being unhealthy .
Cigarettes are divisible , recognizable , ( somewhat ) homogeneous , and , due to the increased taxation , fairly stable in value and have a high value per unit weight .
In fact , a 7 - Eleven at the Jersey shore recently advertised selling cigarettes priced " at the state minimum . "
Cigarettes are so valuable that they are being stolen by the truckload to be sold in high - tax states — like New Jersey , New York , and Washington .
But individual counties also ladle taxes on each pack leading to smuggling within a single state with varying county tax rates , reports the Wall Street Journal .
" It 's a big business and it 's getting horribly bigger , " Paul Carey III , enforcement coordinator for the Northern Virginia Cigarette Tax Board , told the Wall Street Journal .
As in the case of counterfeiting , states do n't take cigarette bootlegging lightly .
Undercover agents for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance arrested 18 people , including two 7 - Eleven operators , for buying untaxed cigarettes .
Smugglers are even willing to trade cocaine for cigarettes .
" That tells you about the profit margin they saw on cigarettes , " the ATF 's Edgar Domenech told the Wall Street Journal .
R.A. Radford famously wrote in his November 1945 Economica article " The Economic Organization of a P.O.W. Camp , "
Most trading was for food against cigarettes or other foodstuffs , but cigarettes rose from the status of a normal commodity to that of currency .
Radford explained that each barracks had an " Exchange and Mart notice board " where sales and wants were posted .
Over time all transactions were recorded in cigarettes with the price of smokes " tending to equality throughout the camp , although there were always opportunities for an astute trader to make a profit from arbitrage . "
In his amazing account , Radford recognized that cigarettes preformed the functions of money nicely especially " as a measure of value and as a store of value . "
Some prisoners , as many kings had before , even " clipped or sweated [ cigarettes ] by rolling them between fingers so that tobacco fell out . "
With the currency value of all cigarettes the same , more popular cigarettes were saved or smoked , while poorer quality cigarettes were used for trading , just as Gresham 's law would dictate .
When cigarette supplies were interrupted , the amount of currency declined , transactions dried up , and prices fell .
But when a Red Cross shipment of several hundred thousand cigarettes arrived over a short period of time , " Prices soared , and then began to fall , slowly at first but with increasing rapidity as stocks ran out , until the next big delivery . "
The Fed has essentially created the biggest shipment of currency ever , but the crippled banking system has n't yet delivered it to our prison camp .
When it arrives , it might be handy to have some spare smokes around to trade with .
Brooklyn Brewery
Updated , 2:25 p.m. |
There seems to be no end of experimentation and obsession with all things bacon , and people , both breathing ones and the animated variety , seem to like it .
There ’s chocolate - covered bacon , the Bacon Explosion ( heart attack in a bundle ) , bacon ice cream , bacon jam and bacon vodka .
People , wistfully , have been fantasizing about a bacon beer .
Brewers are obliging .
Garrett Oliver of the Brooklyn Brewery has created limited quantities of bacon beer .
And in Chicago , David Burke ’s Primehouse at the James Hotel is serving bacon beer brewed by the executive chef , Rick Gresh , as part of a beer pairing menu .
In Washington State , the Front Street Ale House on San Juan Island began offering a bacon beer on tap in spring of 2008 .
Mr. Oliver said his beer , called Reinschweinsgebot , is a mix of two different creations that “ get baconed by different methods . ”
One of the creations is inspired by a technique used to make the bacon - infused bourbon at PDT , a bar in the East Village .
Mr. Oliver mixed brown ale , which had been aged for nine months in bourbon barrels , with bacon fat .
But then he froze the fat into a solid and filtered it out .
“ In the end , ” he said , “ you do n’t have any fat . ”
The second is beer is made out of a malt that was smoked in the same room with some of the bacon made by Allan Benton , a maker of smoked meats in Tennessee .
Then the two complement each other .
“ The first is a bacon - fat - flavored aroma and the second beer is bacon - smoked aroma , ” Mr. Oliver explained .
So what is the assessment of bacon - flavored creation ?
“ We think the beer is really tasty , ” Mr. Oliver said .
“ It would be excellent with pork belly .
It would be more interesting with monkfish . ”
But he only made 20 cases , one of which will be served to diners at a dinner at Per Se in Midtown on Friday night .
As for the other 19 cases ?
“ We never intended it as something we intended to sell , ” Mr. Oliver said .
It seems like the opportunity for the public to try might be the Per Se dinner .
The price ?
$ 350 plus gratuity .
( Ouch ! )
For that amount of money , you could buy a round - trip plane ticket to Seattle , then travel to San Juan Island .
There , intermittently , is a bacon - flavored pale ale on tap at the Front Street Ale House , where it sells anywhere from $ 1.25 for four ounces to for $ 8.25 for a liter .
“ We did it as a novelty not knowing what would happen with it , ” said Warren Combs , brewmaster at the San Juan Brewing Company , who created the beer .
The beer is made by suspending oven - dried bacon in a pale ale that has already been brewed .
“ Every time I take it off tap , ” Mr. Combs said , “ people talk about it and so I put it back on . ”
He plans on making a darker version soon .
To advertise the beer , a yellow pig sign is in the window with the words “ bacon beer . ”
The pig may be the most photographed celebrity on the island .
Mr. Combs said , “ During peak season over 100 people a day take a picture of the bacon beer pig . ”
The key to peace in the Middle East is restoration of international law and the recognition of the right of both Palestinians and Israeli Jews to live in peace and security side by side .
As President Obama says , there is no peace process today .
Israel 's prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , continues to extend illegal settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and maintain a near - complete blockade of Gaza .
Palestinians fire ineffectual rockets into Israel .
Israel regularly attacks Palestinian territories with modern weapons .
No major conflict can be resolved without each side talking to the other .
That was the case in South Africa , Ireland and countless other situations where people said they would never talk to their opponents .
I was vilified in the Eighties for saying that , to resolve the Irish conflict , you had to talk to Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness .
In the Middle East , peace can only be achieved through discussion between the elected representatives of both the Israelis and the Palestinians - and that means Hamas , which won a big majority in the last Palestinian parliamentary election , as well as Fatah .
This does not mean that I agree with the views of Hamas , Fatah or the government of Israel .
Far from it : I do not .
For example , I think a number of passages in the original Hamas charter are unacceptable and should be repudiated .
Many observers believe that this is also the view of some in Hamas .
Yet , for too many people , Hamas as an organisation remains opaque .
What they know about it is derived from a hostile media ; it has no face .
Most would probably think its leader is some disturbed Osama Bin Laden figure .
In fact , al - Qaeda 's supporters in Gaza are so hostile to Hamas that they have declared war on it .
For these reasons , I thought it important to interview the de facto leader of Hamas , Khaled Meshal , who lives in exile in Syria .
Not every issue is clear .
But at the beginning of any peace process , what matters most is engagement .
Dialogue is necessary to get to clarity and mutual understanding .
Sinn Fein did not answer every question at the beginning and neither does Binyamin Netanyahu today .
The answers from Meshal come at a time of heightened tensions and renewed death threats against him , adding to the permanent danger of assassination bids not only by the Israelis , but also al - Qaeda supporters in the region .
I hope this interview will help to make the case for the dialogue that is needed , which I believe is inevitable .
It is simply a question of how much suffering there will be , on both sides , before we get there .
Ken Livingstone : Could you explain a little about your childhood and the experiences that shaped your development into the person you are today ?
Khaled Meshal : I was born in the West Bank village of Silwad near Ramallah in 1956 .
In my early age , I learned from my father how he was part of the Palestinian revolution against the British mandate in Palestine in the Thirties and how he fought , alongside other Palestinians using primitive weapons , against the well - equipped and trained Zionist gangs attacking Palestinian villages in 1948 .
I lived in Silwad for 11 years until the 1967 war , when I was forced with my family , like hundreds of thousands of Palestinians , to leave home and settle in Jordan .
That was a shocking experience I will never forget .
KL : What happened to you after the war ?
KM : Soon afterwards , I left Jordan for Kuwait , where my father had already been working and living since before 1967 .
After completing my primary education in 1970 , I joined the prestigious Abdullah al - Salim Secondary School .
In the early Seventies , it was a hub of intense political and ideological activity .
During my second year at al - Salim school , I joined the Muslim Brotherhood ( al - Ikhwan al - Muslimun ) .
Upon finishing my fourth year successfully I secured admission to Kuwait University , where I studied for a BSc degree in physics .
Kuwait University had an active branch of the General Union of Palestinian Students ( GUPS ) , which had been under the absolute control of the Fatah movement .
I and my fellow Islamists decided , in 1977 , to join GUPS , which we had previously shunned , and contest its leadership election .
However , working from within GUPS proved impossible ; we felt constantly impeded and realised we Islamists would never be given a chance .
By 1980 , two years after I graduated , my juniors decided to leave GUPS and form their own Palestinian association on campus .
Many of the students had become disillusioned with the Palestinian leadership , who seemed intent on settling for much less than what they
had grown up dreaming of , namely the complete liberation of Palestine and the return of all the refugees to their homes .
KL : What is the situation in Gaza today ?
KM : Gaza today is under siege .
Crossings are closed most of the time and for months victims of the Israeli war on Gaza have been denied ­access to construction materials to rebuild their destroyed homes .
Schools , hospitals and homes in many parts of the Gaza Strip are in need of rebuilding .
Tens of thousands of people remain homeless .
As winter approaches , the conditions of these victims will only get worse in the cold and rain .
One and a half million people are held hostage in one of the biggest prisons in the history of humanity .
They are unable to travel freely out of the Strip , whether for medical treatment , for education or for other needs .
What we have in Gaza is a disaster and a crime against humanity perpetrated by the Israelis .
The world community , through its silence and indifference , colludes in this crime .
KL : Why do you think Israel is still imposing the siege on Gaza ?
KM : The Israelis claim that the siege is for security reasons .
The real intention is to pressure Hamas by punishing the entire population .
The sanctions were put in place soon after Hamas won the Palestinian elections in January 2006 .
While security is one of their concerns , it is not the main motivation .
The primary objective is to provoke a coup against the results of the democratic elections that brought Hamas to power .
The Israelis and their allies seek to impose failure on Hamas by persecuting the people .
This is a hideous and immoral endeavour .
Today , the siege continues despite the fact that we have , for the past six months , observed a ceasefire .
Last year , a truce was observed from June to December 2008 .
Yet the siege was never lifted , and the sanctions remained in place .
Undermining Hamas is the main objective of the siege .
The Israelis hope to turn the people of Gaza against Hamas by increasing the suffering of the entire population of the Strip .
KL : How many supporters of Hamas and elected representatives of Hamas are there in prison in Israel ?
Have they all been charged and convicted of crimes ?
KM : Out of a total of 12,000 Palestinian captives in Israeli detention , around 4,000 are Hamas members .
These include scores of ministers and parliamentarians ( Palestinian Legislative Council members ) .
Around ten have recently been released , but about 40 PLC members remain in detention .
Some have been given sentences , but many are held in what the Israelis call administrative detention .
The only crime these people are accused of is their association with Hamas 's parliamentary group .
Exercising one 's democratic right is considered a crime by Israel .
All these Palestinians are brought before an Israeli system of justice that has nothing to do with justice .
The Israeli judiciary is an instrument of the occupation .
In Israel , there are two systems of justice : one applies to Israelis and another applies to the Palestinians .
This is an apartheid regime .
KL : What part , if any , do other states and insti­tutions , such as the US , the EU , Britain , Egypt , or the Palestinian Authority , play in the blockade of Gaza ?
KM :
The blockade of Gaza would never have succeeded had it not been for the collusion of regional and international powers .
KL : How do you think the blockade can be lifted ?
KM :
In order for the blockade to be lifted , the rule of international law must be respected .
The basic human rights of the Palestinians and their right to live in dignity and free from persecution would have to be acknowledged .
There has to be an international will to serve justice and uphold the basic principles of international human rights law .
The international community would have to free itself from the shackles of Israeli pressure , speak the truth and act accordingly .
KL : Israel says that the bombing and invasion of Gaza last year was in response to repeated breaking of the ceasefire by Hamas and the firing of rockets into southern Israel .
Is this the case ?
KM : The Israelis are not telling the truth .
We ­entered into a truce deal with Israel from 19 June to 19 December 2008 .
Yet the blockade was not lifted .
The deal entailed a bilateral ceasefire , lifting the blockade and opening the crossings .
We fully abided by the ceasefire while Israel only partially observed it , and towards the end of the term it resumed hostilities .
Throughout that ­period , Israel maintained the siege and only intermittently opened some of the crossings , ­allowing no more than 10 per cent of the basic needs of the Gazan population to get through .
Israel killed the potential for renewing the truce because it deliberately and repeatedly violated it .
I have always informed my western visitors , including the former US president Jimmy Carter , that the moment Hamas is offered a truce that
includes lifting the blockade and opening the crossings , Hamas will adopt a positive stance .
So far , no one has made us any such offer .
As far as we are concerned , the blockade amounts to a declaration of war that warrants self - defence .
KL : What are the ideology and goals of Hamas ?
KM : Our people have been the victims of a colonial project called Israel .
For years , we have suffered various forms of repression .
Half of our people have been dispossessed and are denied the right to return to their homes , and half live under an occupation regime that violates their basic human rights .
Hamas struggles for an end to occupation and for the restoration of our people 's rights , including their right to return home .
KL : What is your view of the cause of the conflict between the state of Israel and the Palestinians ?
KM : The conflict is the outcome of aggression and occupation .
Our struggle against the Israelis is not because they are Jewish , but because they invaded our homeland and dispossessed us .
We do not accept that because the Jews were once persecuted in Europe they have the right to take our land and throw us out .
The injustices suffered by the Jews in Europe were horrible and criminal , but were not perpetrated by the Palestinians or the Arabs or the Muslims .
So , why should we be punished for the sins of others or be made to pay for their crimes ?
KL : Do you believe that Israel intends to continue to expand its borders ?
KM : Israel does not , officially , have stated borders .
When Israel was created in our homeland 62 years ago , its founders dreamed of a " Greater Israel " that extended from the Nile to the Euphrates .
Expansionism manifested itself on different occasions : in 1956 , in 1967 and later on in the occupation of parts of Lebanon in the Eighties .
Arab weakness , Israeli military superiority , the support given to Israel by the western powers , and the massacres it was prepared to commit against unarmed civilians in Palestine , Egypt and Lebanon , enabled it to expand from time to time .
Although expansionism still lurks in the minds of many Israelis , it would seem that this is no longer a practical option .
Lebanese and Palestinian resistance has forced Israel to withdraw unilaterally from lands it had previously occupied through war and aggression .
While in the past Israel was able to defeat several Arab armies , today it faces formidable resistance that will not only check its expansionism but also , in time , force it to relinquish more of the land that it illegally occupies .
KL : What are your principal goals ?
Is Hamas primarily a political or a religious organisation ?
KM : Hamas is a national liberation movement .
We do not see a contradiction between our Islamic identity and our political mission .
While we engage the occupiers through resistance and struggle to achieve our people 's rights , we are proud of our religious identity that derives from Islam .
Unlike the experience of the Europeans with Christianity , Islam does not provide for , demand or recognise an ecclesiastical authority .
It simply provides a set of broad guidelines whose detailed interpretations are subject to and the product of human endeavour ( ijtihad ) .
KL : Are you committed to the destruction of Israel ?
KM :
What is really happening is the destruction of the Palestinian people by Israel ; it is the one that occupies our land and exiles us , kills us ,
incarcerates us and persecutes our people .
We are the victims , Israel is the oppressor , and not vice versa .
KL : Why does Hamas support military force in this conflict ?
KM : Military force is an option that our people resort to because nothing else works .
Israel 's conduct and the collusion of the international community , whether through silence or indifference or actual embroilment , vindicate armed resistance .
We would love to see this conflict
resolved peacefully .
If occupation were to come to an end and our people enabled to exercise self - determination in their homeland , there would then be no need for any use of force .
The reality is that nearly 20 years of peaceful negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis have not restored any of our rights .
On the contrary , we have incurred more suffering and more losses as a result of the one - sided compromises made by the Palestinian negotiating party .
Since the PLO entered into the Oslo peace deal with Israel in 1993 , more Palestinian land in the West Bank has been expropriated by the Israelis to build more illegal Jewish settlements , expand existing ones or construct highways for the exclusive use of Israelis living in these settlements .
The apartheid wall that the Israelis erected along the West Bank has consumed large areas of the land that was supposed to be returned to the Palestinians according to the peace deal .
The apartheid wall and hundreds of checkpoints turned the West Bank into isolated enclaves like cells in a large prison , which makes
life intolerable .
Jerusalem is constantly tampered with in order to alter its landscape and identity , and hundreds of Palestinian homes have been destroyed inside the city and around it , making thousands of Palestinians homeless in their own homeland .
Instead of releasing Palestinian prisoners , the Israelis have arrested an additional 5,000 Palestinians since the Annapolis peace conference in 2007 - actions that testify to the fact they simply are n't interested in peace at all .
KL : Does Hamas engage in military activity outside Palestine ?
KM : No ; since its establishment 22 years ago , Hamas has confined its field of military operation to occupied Palestine .
KL : Do you wish to establish an Islamic state in Palestine in which all other religions are subordinate ?
KM : Our priority as a national liberation movement is to end the Israeli occupation of our homeland .
Once our people are free in their land and enjoy the right to self - determination , they alone have the final say on what system of governance they wish to live under .
It is our firm belief that Islam can not be imposed on the people .
We shall campaign , in a fully democratic process , for an Islamic agenda .
If that is what the people opt for , then that is their choice .
We believe that Islam is the best source of guidance and the best guarantor for the rights of Muslims and non-Muslims alike .
KL : Does Hamas impose Islamic dress in Gaza ?
For example , is it compulsory in Gaza for women to wear the hijab , niqab or burqa ?
KM : No .
Intellectually , Hamas derives its vision from the people 's culture and religion .
Islam is our religion and is the basic constituent of our culture .
We do not deny other Palestinians the right to have different visions .
We do not impose on the people any aspects of religion or social conduct .
Features of religion in Gaza society are genuine and spontaneous ; they have not been imposed by any authority other than the faith and conviction of the observant .
KL : It is suggested that the division in the Palestinian people between the West Bank and Gaza and between Fatah and Hamas , which obviously weakens their position , came about because Hamas seized power by force in Gaza .
Is this true and how do you explain this division ?
KM : Undoubtedly , division does weaken the Palestinians and harms their cause .
However , the division is caused not by Hamas , but by the insistence of certain international and regional parties on reversing the results of Palestinian democracy .
It dismayed them that Hamas was elected by the Palestinian people .
The division is compounded by the existence of a Palestinian party that seeks empowerment from those same regional and international
parties , including the US and Israel , that wish to see Hamas out of the arena .
Soon after its victory in the election of January 2006 , every effort was exerted to undermine the ability of Hamas to govern .
When these efforts failed , General Keith Dayton , of the United States army , who currently serves as US security co-ordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority , was despatched to Gaza to plot a coup against the Hamas - led national unity government that came out of the Mecca agreement of 2007 .
The plot prompted Hamas in Gaza to act in self - defence in the events of June 2007 .
The claim that Hamas carried out a coup is baseless because Hamas was leading the democratically elected government .
All it did was act against those who were plotting a coup against it under the command and guidance of General Dayton .
KL : Do those of other political or religious views such as Fatah enjoy democratic freedoms in Gaza ?
What is the situation of Hamas members in the West Bank territories controlled by Fatah ?
KM : Some Palestinian factions have been inspired by Arab nationalism , others by Marxism or Leninism , and others by liberalism .
While we strongly believe that these ideas are alien to our people and have failed to meet their aspirations , we insist that the people are the final arbiter on whom they wish to lead them and by which system they desire to be governed .
Thus , democracy is our best option for settling our internal Palestinian differences .
Whatever the people choose will have to be respected .
We endeavour to the best of our ability to protect the human rights and civil liberties of the affiliates of Fatah and all the other factions within the Gaza Strip .
In contrast , the Palestinians in the West Bank under Israeli occupation and the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah continue to be denied their basic rights .
General Dayton is in the West Bank supervising the ­severe and brutal crackdown on Hamas and other Palestinian groups .
More than 1,000 political prisoners , including students , university professors and professionals in all fields are hunted down , detained and tortured , sometimes to death , by the US - , British - and EU - trained and - sponsored Palestinian Authority 's security force .
KL : Do you believe it is possible to reunite the Palestinian people ?
If so , how do you think this could be done and within what kind of timescale ?
KM : It is possible to reunite the Palestinians .
In order for this to happen two things are needed .
First , foreign interventions and demands must stop .
The Palestinian people should be left to deal with their own differences without external pressure .
Second , all Palestinian parties must respect the rules of the democratic game and submit to the results of its process .
KL : Hamas 's refusal to recognise Israel is frequently cited as an insuperable obstacle to negotiations and a peace settlement .
KM :
This issue is only used as a pretext .
Israel does not recognise the rights of the Palestinian people , yet this is not raised as an obstacle to
Israel being internationally recognised nor to it being allowed to take part in talks .
The reality is that Israel is the one that occupies the land and possesses superior power .
Rather than ask the Palestinians , who are the victims , it is Israel , who is the oppressor , who should be asked to recognise the rights of the Palestinians .
In the past , Yasser Arafat recognised Israel but failed to achieve much .
Today , Mahmoud Abbas recognises Israel , but we have yet to see any of the promised dividends of the peace process .
Israel concedes only under pressure .
In the absence of any tangible pressure on Israel by the Arabs or by the international community , no settlement will succeed .
KL : Do you have a " road map " of interim steps which could realistically lead to a peaceful settlement of the conflict ?
Do you think Jews , Muslims and Christians can one day live together in peace in the Holy Land ?
KM :
We do , in Hamas , believe that a realistic peaceful settlement to the conflict will have to begin with a ceasefire agreement between the two sides based on a full withdrawal of Israel from all the territories occupied in 1967 .
Israeli intransigence and the lack of will to act on the part of the international community are what ­impede this settlement .
We believe that only once our people are free and back in their land will they be able to determine the future of the conflict .
It should be reiterated here that we do not resist the Israelis because they are Jews .
As a matter of principle , we do not have problems with the Jews or the Christians , but do have a problem with those who attack us and oppress us .
For many centuries , Christians , Jews and Muslims coexisted peacefully in this part of the world .
Our society never witnessed the sort of racism and genocide that Europe saw until recently against " the other " .
These issues started in Eur­ope .
Colonialism was imposed on this region by Europe , and Israel was the product of the oppression of the Jews in Europe and not of any such problem that existed in the Muslim land .
KL : What role do you think that other countries and organisations , in particular the US , EU and Britain , are currently playing in the Israel / Palestine conflict and the divisions between the Palestinians ?
KM :
The role played by all these has thus far been negative .
The attitude towards Israeli crimes against our people has been either silence or collusion .
The policies and positions adopted by these parties have contributed to the Palestinian division or augmented it .
On the one hand , conditions are stipulated that have the effect of torpedoing unity talks and reconciliation efforts .
On the other hand , some of these international parties are directly embroiled in suppressing our people in the West Bank .
The US and the EU provide funding , training and guidance to build a Palestinian security apparatus specialised in the persecution of critics of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah .
We have particularly been concerned about reports that the British government , directly as well as indirectly by means of security firms and the services of retired army , police and in­telligence officers , is fully involved in the programme led by General Dayton against Hamas in the West Bank .
KL : What should countries such as the US and Britain do to assist a peaceful settlement ?
KM :
They should simply uphold international law - the occupation is illegal , the annexation of East Jerusalem is illegal , the settlements are illegal , the apartheid wall is illegal , and the siege of Gaza is illegal .
Yet nothing is done .
KL : What relations does Hamas wish to have with the rest of the world , and , for example , with Britain ?
KM : Hamas defends a just cause .
For this purpose , it desires to open up to the world .
The movement seeks to establish good relations and to conduct constructive dialogue with all those concerned with Palestine .
Microsoft ’s Stephanie Ferguson :
Interestingly enough , we discovered that most people who carry a Windows phone do n’t realize it ’s running Windows Mobile .
This is an odd thing to admit .
First , it ’d be odd if Microsoft actually never noticed that Windows Mobile phone makers almost never advertise that the phones are running Windows Mobile .
Second , why are n’t they embarrassed by this ?
One thing that was very clear after all these conversations about phones is that there is no “ one size fits all ” in this market .
On Oct. 6th , you ’ll see new Windows phones designed for a variety of tastes , needs and price points — with or without keyboards , with or without touch screens , as well as your choice of GPS , accelerometer and high resolution camera .
Sounds like a wonderful confusion of options for developers , that ’s for sure .

Cell Phone Cash Review
About a week ago I received in interesting email telling me about a new product from Mack Michaels of Maverick Coaching that was going to revolutionize affiliate and product marketing .
The product , Cell Phone Cash , was something that had yet to hit the mainstream , and was certainly a very interesting idea .
After checking out the product ’s website , I saw the beauty of the program , was immediately hooked on the idea , which is why I ’ve written this Cell Phone Cash review !
The Cell Phone Cash program walks you through a step by step method to marketing your site and affiliate offers on cell phones as opposed to the usual SEO and PPC methods .
As many of you know , PPC and SEO marketing are pretty saturated .
There are thousands of people out there , competing in the same space for the same keywords and products .
In sort , it ’s very tough to be successful and profitable using these tactics .
However , cell phone marketing is relatively new , the market is completely untapped , and your customer base is actually LARGER than your internet customer base .
Cell Phone
Cash teaches you how to take advantage of this and how to make some serious money .
( Just for a point of reference , Mach Michaels makes over $ 300,000 PER MONTH using these tactics .
Although , let ’s be honest , it would be tough for any of us to ever replicate that level of success . )
There are nearly 3 billion people around the globe have a cell phone , and that number is expected to grow to 4 billion by 2011 .
Each person , on average checks it 24 times per day , so that ’s a lot of opportunities to get your product or affiliate offer out to people .
And since the price is only $ 24 per month , I definitely recommend that you go pick up Cell Phone Cash .
I was very skeptical at the idea at first , but now I believe Cell Phone Cash could become one of the best investments you ’ve ever made .
Hopefully this Cell Phone Cash review has been beneficial and helped you make the right decision for you !

The accident happened on the sidelines of the Tour de France
A woman has been killed and two other people injured when they were hit by a police motorcycle while watching the Tour de France cycle race , police said .
The woman , who was in her 60s , was hit as she crossed the road along the route of the 14th stage of the race , near Colmar in north - eastern France .
Police said the driver fell off the bike , which ran into the crowd .
It was the first fatality since two children were killed in 2000 and 2002 hit by cars from the publicity caravan .
The biggest accident in the Tour 's 106 - year history took place in 1964 , when a police supply van struck a bridge in the Dordogne region , killing 20 people .
Crash
Saturday 's accident happened in the town of Wittelsheim , near the 38.5 - km ( 24 - mile ) mark , on the route of the three - week cycle race that covers 199 km ( 124 miles ) from Colmar to Besancon .
" A woman crossed the road and was hit by a Republican Guardsman on a motorcycle , " Alain Fontaine , a spokesman for the gendarmerie , told Reuters news agency .
" Then the motorcycle slid and hit one or two more people , " he added .
The two injured spectators were a 37 - year - old woman and a man in his 60s , AFP news agency reported .
Both are expected to survive , police said .
Riders from the guardsmen - the ceremonial unit of the French police - accompany the riders along the route of the race .
This is a completely true thing that happens all the time .

NEW DELHI : It 's a virus that has already claimed over 100 lives but Indian and American scientists seem to have no clue about what it is .
While the entire country is busy dealing with H1N1 influenza , a mystery virus is causing havoc in Uttar Pradesh .
Since January , the state has recorded 665 cases of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome ( AES ) -- a severe neurological condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality .
Around 137 people have already succumbed to the viral infection .
Lab investigations have revealed that only 34 of the cases and four of the deaths were caused by Japanese Encephalitis -- a known scourge in the state .
However , scientists have no clue what caused the rest of the 133 encephalitis deaths and 631 cases .
According to officials , this mystery virus has been causing brain fever and killing people in UP since last year but no breakthrough has been made regarding the virus 's identity and nature .
Experts from Centre for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) Atlanta had picked up 150 samples from UP to help identify the virus .
But they too have failed to make any headway .
Speaking to TOI , director of National Institute of Virology ( Gorakhpur ) Dr Milind Gore said , " We are working on identifying the virus and its origin .
At present we do n't know what 's causing these cases of AES and deaths .
We suspect it could be a type of enterovirus . "
Dr Gore added , " It is clear that JE alone is n't causing AES .
We recently checked 450 stool swabs and found that 68 % of them were positive for enteroviruses .
However , we do n't know exactly which one from this family of viruses is the dominant one behind the deaths .
Even CDC experts have n't figured it out . "
Officials said the search for the " real culprit " behind the AES cases had taken a beating in the last few months with scientists in NIV Pune drowned with H1N1 samples .
" H1N1 has proved to be a setback for the work on encephalitis in UP .
Improved methods of diagnosis and new primers were to be tested against the unknown virus .
But everybody at NIV Pune is busy with H1N1 , " an official said .
AES is characterised by inflammation of the brain , seizures and convulsions among children .
International NGO PATH 's senior programme officer for JE Dr Pritu Dhalaria told TOI , " Usually , around four to five enteroviruses work in tandem , in clusters in particular areas .
It is therefore difficult to identify exactly which virus is the deadly one .
By this time last year , UP had recorded 435 AES cases of which only 15 were caused by JE .
This year , the cases have increased , and we do n't know which virus is behind it . "
Non-polio enteroviruses are very common across the globe .
They are second only to the common cold viruses , the rhinoviruses , as the most common viral infectious agents in humans .
Although infection often has no symptoms and goes unnoticed , these viruses are also associated with occasional outbreaks in which a larger - than - usual number of patients develop clinical disease , sometimes with fatal consequences .
Transmission of enterovirus infections is increased by poor hygiene and overcrowded living conditions .
Measures that can be taken to avoid getting infected with enteroviruses include frequent hand washing .
Enteroviruses can be found in the respiratory secretions and stool of an infected person .
Other persons may become infected by direct contact with secretions from an infected person or by contact with contaminated surfaces or objects .
According to some experts , UP has seen a nearly 40 % increase in AES cases this year , majority of them not belonging to the enterovirus category .

The Large Hadron Collider is still going through a painful commissioning process — coming online in time for the winter shutdown is probably not what researchers had in mind when they broke it the first time .
So , what is a physicist to do when the shiny toys are still being polished ?
Sit around at the pub and gossip about old experiments , of course .
One such session has ended with Jorg Jaeckel , from Durham University , taking a new look at 40 - year - old data from a classical electrostatics experiment .
He found that this data provided the strongest constraints on a particular set of particles so far , thus proving that some experiments age very gracefully indeed .
What was he looking for ?
Well , the standard model has a bunch of particles that are ordered into families with like properties .
New physics , required to explain cosmological observations and gravity , cannot be based on having these particles bounce off each other .
Instead , new particles , some of which only interact very weakly with existing matter , are thought to exist .
Now , we can only detect these particles through their effect on known particles .
So the game goes something like this : use some mathematical framework to posit the existence of a bunch of particles with certain properties .
Combine these guessed - at properties with the properties of known particles , and figure out how one influences the other .
In looking for , and failing to find , these effects , we can eliminate hypothetical particles and constrain the properties of the remaining contenders .
It 's the classic scientific process of finding something that is n't obviously wrong by eliminating the things that are .
Jaeckel was playing the eliminate - and - constrain game with particles that have an effect on known particles which would be observed as a polarized vacuum .
Confirming the existence of a polarized vacuum would be evidence for extremely low - energy particles .
How can we see this ?
By looking at how the orientation of the electromagnetic field of light changes as it propagates through the vacuum .
Another clue would be if Coulomb 's inverse square law were violated .
Coulomb's inverse - square law states that the force of attraction or repulsion between two charges will fall off at the square of the distance between them .
It 's a consequence of the electric field between two charges changing at the inverse of the distance .
This law is pretty basic physics , and it has been tested and re-tested many times , with the last serious test being 40 years ago , using a method designed by Henry Cavendish in the 18th century .
In fact , because electromagnetism is such a strong force , it can violate the inverse - square law , but , these violations happen in specific circumstances that can be controlled .
Once those controls are in place , the experiment just needs to be as sensitive as possible .
The usual way to maximize sensitivity is to set one metallic sphere inside another .
If you charge the outer sphere to some voltage , then the field falls as the inverse of the distance outside the sphere — but internally , the field is constant .
Measuring changes from a constant field that is shielded from the outside world is much simpler than dealing with a changing field that is also exposed to its influences .
This elegant experimental design is what makes the data so extremely precise .
It is 10 - 20 times more sensitive to low - energy particles than " previous " experiments — all of which were actually performed after the last serious Cavendish - type experiment — and allows the data to eliminate a large range of energy / polarization combinations .
The data provides significant new constraints on what particles may or may not be out there , and it was had for the price of a few pieces of paper .
Cavendish - type experiments are not going to eliminate the need for the LHC .
However , a new , more sensitive version of Cavendish - type experiment might provide evidence for particles that the LHC is not really designed to seek .
What 's more , it 's a particle physicist - on - a - budget 's dream .

OTTAWA–Canadians have until Sunday to give their two cents on how best to protect intellectual property at a time when words and music can be uploaded and downloaded in seconds around the world .
Liberal and Conservative governments have spent the better part of the last decade reviewing the Copyright Act , which was penned long before the Internet existed .
" There is no question this is one of the toughest files the government faces , " Michael Geist , Canada Research Chair in Internet and E- commerce Law at the University of Ottawa , said yesterday .
Referring to the threat of a fall federal election , Geist said the input collected at town hall meetings across the country and from almost 5,000 submissions should survive a change in government .
The 1921 act has undergone numerous updates , being amended as recently as 1997 .
The Conservatives put forward a bill in June 2008 to change the act , but were roundly criticized for not consulting Canadians .
The government went back to the drawing board .
This time , anyone who wants to comment on how copyright law should be revised can do so by visiting copyright.econsultation.ca .
While the Copyright Act was once considered something for commercial enterprises to worry about , the Internet has brought it right into the homes of most Canadians .
The responsibility for canvassing Canadians has been shared by Industry Minister Tony Clement and James Moore , minister of Canadian heritage and official languages .
" The current copyright legislation took place in the world of vinyl records and cassette tapes , and nothing like a DVD player or iPods existed ... so it is certainly far behind the times , " Clement told the Star .
He said the trick is to ensure new protections for intellectual property withstand the test of time .
" How do you create something that makes sense today but will also make sense 20 years from now ? " he said , adding he'd like to see a bill this fall , but is content to put it off till February or March if necessary .

Clement said the amended law must avoid being technology - specific and instead apply basic principles to technology as it evolves .
Canada is a signatory to the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty , which calls for protecting the rights of authors to their literary and artistic works while maintaining a balance with the public interest .
Steve Coll explains how the Soviets did it :
In Afghanistan , after an initial and failed attempt to use special forces more aggressively to hit Islamist guerrillas along the Pakistan - Afghanistan border , the Soviets began to pull back into Afghanistan ’s major cities and to “ Afghan-ize ” their military operations .
As they prepared to withdraw , Soviet troops moved away from direct combat , particularly in the countryside , and instead concentrated on training and equipping the Afghan forces .
They also provided supplies and expertise the Afghans lackedair power , for example , and SCUD missiles .
As I described in a previous post , this military strategy worked pretty well , and the Soviet city - fortresses withstood heavy assaults from the U.S. - financed mujaheddin even after Soviet troops left the country ; they left only a thousand or two military and intelligence advisers behind .
How did the US get into a situation that destroyed the last global empire ?
I know why , of course .
That was where al Qaeda was based when 19 men with not even a single bomb were able to murder thousands in America .
We went there to prevent another .
I supported it fanatically .
But all these years later , I can't help wondering if it was a giant trap .
If someone had told me that the US would occupy Afghanistan for eight years and launch a huge counter - terrorism operation across the globe and still not have captured Osama bin Laden , and watched as al Qaeda built a new base in liberated Iraq ( since cornered at enormous expense ) and Pakistan ( still very much alive ) , and elsewhere around the globe , I would have been incredulous .
Yes , I know that al Qaeda is weaker than it once was - partly because of the dedication of Western intelligence , partly by military power , partly by their own record of murdering Muslims - but the costs and benefits seem increasingly out of whack .
Yes , I should have - we all should have - seen this in advance .
But I cannot believe a democracy after 9/11 would ever have tolerated doing nothing or something so minimal it would have seemed utterly insufficient .
Which leaves us where we are .
Afghanistan , like Iran , presents an excruciating set of choices , which is why I find the caution and deliberation of the current administration a welcome change of pace ( although , to be fair , Bush was fast moving in this direction in his second term ) .
But any review must include the basic question : are we engaging in a rational deployment of resources ?
Did 9/11 psychologically mold us to over - estimate the real toll of terrorism on the West 's actual interests ?
If terrorism claims a minuscule number of Western lives in comparison with , say , smoking , have we been conned into a global war that could actually cripple the West rather than protect it ?
Or would a self - interested retreat provoke a more dangerous attack in due course ?
I do n't know the answer to this question .
But I do believe it needs to be asked .
Or we will have learned very little from the war we so righteously began and have waged at such expense as the West 's fiscal footing gives way underneath .

As Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard prepares for his third run for governor , his old nemesis is considering doing likewise .
Can you say , J. Fife Symington III for governor ?
Symington , who governed the state from 1991 to 1997 before legal troubles forced him from office , told The Arizona Republic on Friday that he's " thinking seriously " about running for governor once more in 2010 .
The Democrat Goddard and Republican Symington faced - off in a political classic in 1990 , with Symington topping Goddard in a general election so close that a runoff was required .
Four years later , both men again ran for governor .
This time , though , Goddard was defeated in the Democratic primary by Eddie Basha , and Symington went on to win re-election .
Symington re-asserted himself on the political scene in recent months with his vocal opposition to Republican Gov. Jan Brewer 's proposal to temporarily increase the state sales tax .
Reached Friday by The Republic in Santa Barbara , Calif. , Symington said the tax issue , poor economy and the state 's general dysfunction in dealing with the budget have all led him to seriously ponder another run at the Governor 's Office .
" I 'm really upset about what 's happening , " Symington said .
" We 're going to get ourselves in a lot of trouble .
I do n't think we 're pursuing the right ways to get ourselves out of trouble .
" We could be doing so much better .
We could be laying the framework for a brighter future .
You do n't do that by raising taxes . "
Symington went on to say that he's " very interested " in running for governor next year .
Brewer , for her part , has not indicated whether she plans to seek a full , four - year term in the 2010 election , though she recent told The Republic that she 's " leaning " toward doing so .
If Symington does run , his past figures to be a focal point of the campaign .
And not just his political past .
In 1997 , Symington resigned from office - as required by state law - immediately after being convicted by a federal jury of bank and wire fraud .
His conviction was later overturned on appeal , and President Clinton pardoned him in early 2001 .
" My record is clean , " Symington said .
" I won at the end of the day . "

New atrocity in Afghanistan
US airstrike incinerates scores of civilians
By Patrick Martin
5 September 2009
An airstrike by US warplanes operating as part of the NATO occupation in northern Afghanistan killed more than 100 people early Friday morning , most of them civilians who were incinerated when two gasoline tankers , hit by bombs , exploded in flames .
Large numbers of severely wounded have been taken to the local hospital in trucks and carts .
The two tankers , hijacked by Taliban guerrillas , became stuck in the mud trying to cross the Kunduz River .
The insurgents abandoned the tankers after opening the valves , and the local population of the village of Omar Kheil rushed from their homes to pour off gasoline into any containers they could find .
The British Guardian quoted Moeen Marastial , a member of parliament from Kunduz , as saying : “ Local people are telling me 130 people have been killed despite all the promises of Nato to do fewer bombardments and reduce civilian casualties .
There will be a reaction to this .
It is a very bad day for international forces in Afghanistan . ”
Another local MP , Mohammed Amin Qaneh , said : “ We are very upset ; a lot of ordinary people have been killed .
Why did they have to bomb the tankers ?
Does Nato put the price of oil higher than the price of blood ?
We want justice ; we want those responsible punished . ”
Abdul Moman Omar Kheil , member of the Kunduz provincial council and a native of the village where the airstrike happened , explained the circumstances of the mass killing , telling the press that many local residents were awake at the time because of a late - night wedding party and celebrations marking Ramadan , the month - long period when practicing Muslims only eat and drink at night .
This account was confirmed by a Taliban spokesman who gave a statement to the Associated Press saying that guerrillas had captured the two tankers as they were being driven along a supply line from Tajikistan to the Afghan capital , Kabul .
While this scramble for precious fuel was underway , at about 2:30 a.m. local time , German military forces who patrol in Kunduz province as part of the NATO occupation called in an air attack , which was carried out by two US F - 15 fighter - bombers .
Each jet hit the tankers with a 500 - pound bomb .
There were hellish scenes at the hospital in Kunduz , the provincial capital , about 15 miles north of the village .
“ Wounded people with extensive burns crowded a hospital in Kunduz , ” the French news agency AFP reported .
“ An AFP reporter said around eight were in terrible condition — the skin burnt black and peeling off to expose raw red muscle .
Others were silent in agony with incinerated clothes stuck to their flesh . ”
An eyewitness , Mohammad Daud , 32 , told AFP villagers rushed to one of the trucks when it got stuck in the river to take free fuel at the Taliban ’s invitation .
“ Everyone around the fuel tanker died , ” he said .
“ Nobody was in one piece .
Hands , legs and body parts were scattered everywhere .
Those who were away from the fuel tanker were badly burnt . ”
Reuters reported : “ The desperately poor Afghan villagers heard that the Taliban had abandoned loaded fuel tankers by the river and thought it was their lucky day .
Hundreds ran to fill jugs of the valuable stuff .
Suddenly , a U.S. F - 15 fighter jet roared over and opened fire .
Mohammad Deen heard the explosion .
When the flames died away by Friday morning , charred corpses were still strewn on the riverbank .
“ Villagers could scarcely conceal their rage .
‘ It ’s a tragedy , and people are angry , very angry .
The international community came here to help , but they are not helping anymore , they are only dropping bombs on us , ’ said Deen .
Video footage filmed by Afghans at the scene the next morning showed piles of charred bodies lying by the river , beside chunks of twisted metal .
The frame of one of the tanker trucks still smoldered . ”
NATO officials initially claimed all those killed were Taliban fighters .
A German army spokeswoman told the media , “ We are fairly certain that they were all insurgents , but we are not 100 percent sure . ”
She added , “ After assessing that only insurgents were in the area , the local ISAF commander ordered an airstrike which destroyed the fuel trucks and a large number of insurgents were killed and injured . ”
The puppet Afghan government of President Hamid Karzai echoed these claims , but the story subsequently underwent repeated adjustment as victims flooded the hospital in Kunduz and the scale of the catastrophe for the civilian population became undeniable .
The latest US - NATO atrocity gives the lie to the claims by the Obama administration and the Pentagon that the escalation of American military intervention in Afghanistan is aimed at defending the population from the resurgence of the Taliban , whose regime the Bush administration overthrew in 2001 .
The day before the airstrike near Kunduz , Admiral Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told a Pentagon press conference that he had forwarded to President Obama a review of conditions in Afghanistan by the theater commander , General Stanley McChrystal .
Refusing to answer questions about how many additional troops McChrystal would seek , Mullen said , “ What ’s more important than the number of troops he may or may not ask for is how he intends to use them .
It should come as no surprise to anyone that he intends to use those forces under his command to protect the Afghan people . ”
After the atrocity at Omar Kheil , one could justly conclude that no worse fate can befall a people than to be singled out for such “ protection ” by American imperialism .
The location of the mass killing has military as well as political significance .
Kunduz province is in the northern tier of Afghanistan , the region largely populated by minority Tajiks and Uzbeks , and long considered stable , at least by comparison with the Pashtun - populated regions of the south and east .
There have been a series of violent incidents in Kunduz , suggesting a growing ability by the Taliban or other anti-occupation forces to strike throughout the country .
Former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani , leader of the Jamiat - i- Islami Afghanistan party , narrowly escaped assassination August 13 , when his convoy was ambushed on the Kabul - Kunduz highway in Aliabad district .
Rabbani was campaigning for the election of Karzai ’s strongest opponent in the August 20 presidential election , former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah .
Three weeks earlier , Karzai ’s running - mate , Mohammad Qasim Fahim , escaped a similar attack in the Khanabad district of Kunduz .
According to an August 31 report by McClatchy newspapers , the Taliban resurgence has become a strategic threat to the US - NATO occupation .
McClatchy reported :
“ Taliban insurgents have taken over parts of two northern provinces from which they were driven in 2001 , threatening to disrupt NATO ’s new supply route from Central Asia and expand a war that has largely been confined to Afghanistan ’s southern half , US and Afghan officials said .
Insurgents operating out of Baghlan district along the highway from Tajikistan launched coordinated attacks during the Aug. 20 presidential elections , killing the district police chief and a civilian , while losing a dozen of their own men , local officials said .
It was the worst bloodshed reported in the country that day .
“ Violence has been on the rise in recent months , however , as the Taliban and al - Qaida - linked foreign fighters have staged hit - and - run attacks , bombings and rocket strikes on German , Belgian and Hungarian forces in Baghlan and neighboring Kunduz provinces .
The insurgents now control three Pashtun - dominated districts in Kunduz and Baghlan - i- Jadid , a foothold in a region that was long considered safe . ”
McClatchy quoted an unnamed “ senior U.S. intelligence official ” pointing out that the insurgents were targeting a recently developed logistics route that supplements the main route from the Pakistani port of Karachi and up through the Khyber Pass , which has been under increasing Taliban attack on both sides of the Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
The new route consists of roads from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan which merge and run south through the Hindu Kush mountains to Kabul and the main US airbase and supply center at Bagram .
“ The concern is if we do n’t stunt the ( Taliban ) growth , it could cause problems with our northern distribution network , ” the intelligence official told the news service .
The British newspaper Guardian , in its report on the Omar Kheil massacre , noted , “ Today ’s reports talk about the Taliban , but Uzbek jihadists with close links to al - Qaida are said to be spreading into the area .
Whoever they are , it is one more indicator that security is crumbling across Afghanistan . ”
This latest atrocity marks the worst massacre of Afghan civilians by US - led NATO forces since May , when airstrikes by US warplanes against villages in western Farah province claimed the lives of 140 people , according to an investigation by the Afghan government .

I ’m just reading a thought - provoking book called Hallucinations and Their Impact on Art. Unfortunately , it ’s a little dry so is n’t the most gripping of reads but it has this fascinating bit about how hallucinations were n’t considered to be part of madness in the middle ages .
While it is widely accepted in modern times that you can ‘ hear voices ’ without being mentally ill , the experience of hallucinations is thought to be part and parcel of most forms of madness , whereas this was apparently not the case in medieval times :
From p7 :
What is more curious to the contemporary man is that the medieval description of insanity does not include hallucinations ; and the experience of possession ( passivity phenomena ) is not described as occurring concurrently with or as part of a visionary state .
In Western Europe from AD 500 - 1500 , people who heard voices or saw visions considered themselves , and were considered buy their contemporaries , to have had an actual perceptual experience of either divine or satanic inspiration .
They were not considered mad and were not treated as such .
Hallucinations ( fantasmata ) were only considered mad when combined with trickery ( prestigiae ) .
Unfortunately , the book is out of print but it contains many such gems among the rather dull academic prose .
The Obama administration 's internal debate about whether or not the term " genocide " still applies to conditions in Sudan 's Darfur region has spilled into public view .
President Obama 's special envoy to Sudan , Gen. Scott Gration ( USAF , retd . ) , told senators Thursday that the " genocide " label is no longer accurate or helpful .
" There 's significant difference between what happened in 2004 and 2003 , which we characterized as a genocide , and what is happening today , " General Gration said in testimony .
There is no evidence to support the inclusion of Sudan on the State Department 's list of state sponsors of terrorism , he added .
That designation only hinders the international community 's ability to help rebuild the war - torn county and to help thousands of uprooted families living in camps .
Gration acknowledged ongoing differences within the administration over Darfur and Sudan , calling it an " honest debate " and a " definitional issue . "
The debate is part of a comprehensive Sudan policy review within the administration that stalled last month over how the White House should balance incentives and punishments to get the most cooperation from Khartoum .
The administration debate pits Gration against Obama 's ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice , who US officials say was " furious " when Gration spoke about the " remnants of genocide " last month .
That comment followed a statement by Mr. Obama in Germany about an " ongoing genocide " in Darfur .
In her own testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday , Ambassador Rice steered away from the genocide controversy .
" The United States is deeply committed to two critical things in Sudan , " she said .
" One is effective implementation of the north / south peace agreement , the CPA .
And the other is saving lives and ending the suffering in Darfur . "
Making special mention of Gration 's work , she said , " we are committed to doing our utmost to achieve success in both regards . "
But State Department officials say the debate continues – specifically between the State Department and the National Security Council – over how best to " go forward " in Sudan .
One official said it was safe to assume that Rice would frown on Gration 's comments Thursday .
In response to Gration 's comments Thursday in the Senate , Darfur advocacy groups in Washington generally praised the idea of using incentives and punishments to try to influence Khartoum .
But they were skeptical that Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir intends to work honestly with the international community .
" We are encouraged to hear unequivocally from General Gration that he and the Obama administration are pursuing a balanced approach which includes both carrots and sticks as levers to change Khartoum 's behavior , " said Save Darfur coalition President Jerry Fowler in a statement .
" We are , however , seriously doubtful of Khartoum 's true intention and ability to make good on their promises . "
Gration 's assessment that US sanctions on Sudan are counterproductive and are preventing assistance to the country 's most needy drew a mixed reaction from senators .
Sen. Russell Feingold ( D ) of Wisconsin said reports of President Bashir 's cooperation were " overstated . "
But Sen. Bob Corker ( R ) of Tennessee said continuing sanctions were the equivalent of " cutting out nose off to spite our face . "

Barack Obama has crashed headlong into a wall of distrust .
If he had any understanding of American history he would know why , but his sole interest is himself and he proved that by writing not one , but two memoirs .
The men who waged the American Revolution and then met in secret to write the U.S. Constitution all shared a distrust of government .
They understood government was necessary , but they wanted to keep a federal government small and ensure that most powers resided in the individual states and in  the people . 

For most of American history , the federal government was small .
Its main function was to maintain armies and navies to protect its sovereignty and its commercial interests .
Early presidents encouraged the exploration of the continent and its populating by the many discontents who arrived seeking a better life than the Old World could or would provide .

America promised the intoxicating opportunity to be free to make a life for oneself that had few restraints so long as one did not break the law , honored ones contracts , and took part in the process of debating issues and electing representatives .
This necessity to rise above family bonds and other allegiances to participate in the affairs of ones community , ones state , and ones nation has been the glue that has kept generations of old and new Americans connected .
George Washington and other former revolutionaries were most fearful of what he called factions  and what we now call political parties , but it didnt take long for such parties to emerge because it is the nature of men to come together around commonly held beliefs .
The wonder is that , despite serious differences on how the nation should be run , the parties traded power back and forth , new presidents were elected without rebellions ( other than the Civil War ! ) , and the conduct of the peoples business progressed smoothly .
Some policies worked .
Others did not .
Pragmatism was and is the order of the day .

I can't sit still and see another man slaving and working .
I want to get up and superintend , and walk round with my hands in my pockets , and tell him what to do .
It 's my energetic nature .
I can't help it .
I like work ; it fascinates me .
I can sit and look at it for hours .
You start on Monday with the idea implanted in your bosom that you are going to enjoy yourself .
You wave an airy adieu to the boys on shore , light your biggest pipe , and swagger about the deck as if you were Captain Cook , Sir Francis Drake , and Christopher Columbus all rolled into one .
On Tuesday , you wish you had n't come .
On Wednesday , Thursday , and Friday , you wish you were dead .
On Saturday , you are able to swallow a little beef tea , and to sit up on deck , and answer with a wan , sweet smile when kind - hearted people ask you how you feel now .
On Sunday , you begin to walk about again , and take solid food .
And on Monday morning , as , with your bag and umbrella in your hand , you stand by the gunwale , waiting to step ashore , you begin to thoroughly like it .
... George , who would not be able to get away from the City till the afternoon ( George goes to sleep at a bank from ten to four each day , except Saturdays , when they wake him up and put him outside at two ) , would meet us there .
The case was becoming serious .
It was now past midnight .
The hotels at Shiplake and Henley would be crammed ; and we could not go round , knocking up cottagers and householders in the middle of the night , to know if they let apartments !
George suggested walking back to Henley and assaulting a policeman , and so getting a night 's lodging in the station - house .
But then there was the thought , " Suppose he only hits us back and refuses to lock us up ! "
We could not pass the whole night fighting policemen .

Parliament generally rushed off to Reading whenever there was a plague on at Westminster ; and , in 1625 , the Law followed suit , and all the courts were held at Reading .
It must have been worth while having a mere ordinary plague now and then in London to get rid of both the lawyers and the Parliament .

I 'm mad as hell
A political blog embracing libertarianism from the perspective of a young , frustrated Canadian writer .
In extracts from a statement to police published yesterday , Giampaolo Tarantini , from the southern Italian city of Bari , said he had brought about 30 women to parties and dinners at Berlusconi's Rome palazzo and at least six had spent the night there , the Guardian reports .
No change in fuel efficiency despite modern technological advances ( Image : © 2008 Ford Motor Company )
The average fuel efficiency of the US vehicle fleet has risen by just 3 miles per gallon since the days of the Ford Model T , and has barely shifted at all since 1991 .
Those are the conclusions reached by Michael Sivak and Omer Tsimhoni at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute in Ann Arbor .
They analysed the fuel efficiency of the entire US vehicle fleet of cars , motorcycles , trucks and buses from 1923 to 2006 .
They found that from 1923 to 1935 fuel efficiency hovered around 14 mpg ( 5.95 km /l ) , but then fell gradually to a nadir of only 11.9 mpg ( 5.08 km /l ) in 1973 .
By 1991 , however , the efficiency of the total fleet had risen by 42 per cent on 1973 levels to 16.9 mpg ( 7.18 km/l ) , a compound annual rate of 2 per cent .

The improvements made up to 1991 were in response to two international events – the 1973 oil embargo by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , and the Iranian Revolution of 1979 .
‘ No external prods ’
Both events disrupted oil supplies to the west , says John DeCicco , former senior auto issues expert at the campaign group Environmental Defense Fund , who was not involved in the new study .
Progress has stalled since then , though , despite growing environmental concerns .
From 1991 to 2006 the average efficiency improved by only 1.8 per cent to 17.2 mpg ( 7.31 km /l ) .
“ We were in a period of complacency [ during the 1990s ] .
There were no external prods to improve fuel economy , ” says DeCicco .
“ By the mid-90s there was only us and the Sierra Club [ a US grassroots environmental organisation ] pressing for better standards , ” DeCicco says .
If manufacturers addressed energy concerns at all , it was in the pursuit of “ technological fantasies ” like the electric car , he says .
Electric vehicle research continues to advance and now has high - profile governmental backing , but it ’s unlikely to have a short - term impact on average fuel efficiency in the US .
If the country ’s transportation fuel consumption is to fall by 10 per cent , Sivak and Tsimhoni calculate that the average fuel efficiency across the entire fleet will have to rise to 19.1 mpg ( 8.12 km /l ) .
Financial incentives
President Obama announced in May that new cars should average 35.5 mpg ( 15.09 km /l ) by 2016 .
But improvements to new cars could still leave the efficiency of the entire vehicle fleet largely unaffected without changes in policy , say Sivak and Tsimhoni .
They think there should be a financial incentive to promote owners of older vehicles to scrap them in favour of new cars , as happens already in some European countries .
In addition , tax breaks should be given to encourage the development and introduction of fuel - saving technologies – particularly in the most fuel - hungry vehicles in each class .
“ Society has much more to gain from improving a car from 15 to 16 mpg ( 6.38 to 6.8 km /l ) than from improving a car from 40 to 41 mpg ( 17 to 17.43 km / l ) , ” they write in their paper .
“ Similarly , the benefits are greater from improving a truck from 4 to 4.5 mpg ( 1.7 to 1.92 km /l ) than from improving a truck from 7 to 7.5 mpg ( 3.19 km / l ) . ”

Chester Bennington , lead singer of Linkin Park , hanged himself at the age of 41 today .
Chester was very close with Chris Cornell ( Soundgarden , Audioslave ) , who himself committed suicide by hanging in May .
Today would have been Cornell ’s 53rd birthday .
Bennington and Cornell certainly are n’t the first lead singers to meet their death far too soon , and they likely wo n’t be the last .
It always sucks when someone dies prematurely .
It ’s especially disappointing when that person is the lead singer of a prominent band .
Not only do their families feel the loss , but so do the millions of fans across the globe who will no longer be treated to their amazing vocal stylings .
One of the most famous examples of course is “ The Day the Music Died ” when Buddy Holly , Ritchie Valens , and J. P. ‘ The Big Bopper ’ Richardson went down in a plane crash .
For this article however , we ’re going to focus on the singers who played more of an active role in their own deaths .
Due to their ‘ it ’s better to burn out than to fade away ’ mentalities , we are all left to wonder what could have been .
Here are ten other famous male singers who arrived at the great gig in the sky a little too soon .
10 ) Michael Hutchence of INXS
Age of death : 37
Cause of death : Autoerotic asphyxiation
Hutchence ’s soulful voice helped catapult the Australian rock band INXS to the top of the charts during the ’ 80s .
He bore an eerie resemblance to another member on this list , Jim Morrison .
Ironically , both died under very peculiar circumstances .
Listen to “ Never Tear Us Apart ” and you ’ll understand what we are missing without Hutchence .
9 ) Bradley Nowell of Sublime
Age of death : 28
Cause of death : Heroin overdose
Unfortunately , Nowell lived the rock and roll lifestyle to the very end .
Shortly before the release of Sublime ’s first major label album , and just after marrying his girlfriend , Nowell died on tour in California .
“ Sublime ” was the perfect name for his band , because it accurately describes his voice .
“ 40 Oz. to Freedom ” is one of the best representations of Nowell ’s talent .
8 ) Ian Curtis of Joy Division
Age of death : 23
Cause of death : Suicide by hanging
Curtis was Kurt Cobain before Kurt Cobain .
His lyrics focused on alienation and loneliness .
Known for a powerful bass - baritone voice and spastic stage antics , Curtis suffered from poor health and became depressed over a failing marriage .
In May of 1980 , he hung himself in his own kitchen .
The song “ Shadowplay ” showcases his innate intensity .
7 ) Bon Scott of AC /DC
Age of death : 33
Cause of death : Choked on his own vomit
Scott ’s screechy howl helped define hard rock in the mid- to late ’ 70s .
His decidedly unglamorous look and attitude was ideal for the AC / DC sound .
He was bold , brash and fond of alcohol .
It was the drink that would be his undoing .
His lifeless body was found inside a car after a night of heavy boozing .
It does n’t get much better than Scott screaming “ Highway to Hell . ”
6 ) Freddie Mercury of Queen
Age of death : 45
Cause of death : Bronchial pneumonia due to AIDS
Very few , if any , frontmen possessed the range of Freddie Mercury .
He hit notes that only opera singers were capable of reaching .
Be it tender ballads or stadium anthems , Mercury ’s versatility made him stand out from the rest .
In 1991 , one day after publicly announcing he had been diagnosed with AIDS , Freddie Mercury died .
“ Somebody to Love ” performed live is guaranteed to give you the chills .
5 ) Bob Marley of Bob Marley and the Wailers
Age of death : 36
Cause of death : Melanoma
Marley took reggae and Jamaican music to new heights in the ’60s and ’70s .
He fought injustice and prejudice from an early age , and was a dedicated member of the Rastafari movement .
In keeping with his religious beliefs , Marley refused surgery to halt his melanoma .
Once the cancer spread to his lungs and brains , he succumbed to the disease in 1981 .
Listen to him bare his soul in “ No Woman No Cry . ”
4 ) Jim Morrison of The Doors
Age of death : 27
Cause of death : Heroin overdose ( maybe )
Morrison was the archetypal rock band lead singer .
Charismatic , poetic , conflicted , arrogant and anti-authority , Morrison had it all .
He was lauded for his image heavy , psychedelic lyrics , but his dynamic vocal skills were some of the best in rock and roll history .
His death in 1971 has been shrouded in mystery .
No autopsy was ever conducted .
“ The End ” perfectly encapsulates Morrison ’s unique talent .
3 ) Layne Staley of Alice in Chains
Age of death : 34
Cause of death : Speedball overdose
Very few singers emoted the pain and passion that Staley did .
He emptied his soul in every performance .
Pearl Jam and Nirvana were bigger , but Alice in Chains exemplified the grunge era , thanks in large part to Staley ’s nuanced but tortured voice .
His final days depicted that of a lost soul .
After locking himself inside his condo for weeks , his withered remains were found surrounded by a variety of drugs .
“ Nutshell ” Unplugged is quintessential Layne Staley .
2 ) Kurt Cobain of Nirvana
Age of death : 27
Cause of death : Suicide by shotgun
Cobain ’s early exit became one of the talked about stories of the last thirty years .
His meteoric rise from underground crooner to the voice of Generation X turned into an American tragedy .
Cobain wanted to play his music and be left alone , but the media onslaught shredded his already fragile psyche .
As his fame grew , his drug addiction worsened .
Sometime in early April 1994 , Cobain committed suicide in his Seattle home .
He left behind a legacy of original and memorable music .
The fittingly titled “ Lithium ” was one such song .
1 ) Jimi Hendrix of Hendrix Experience
Age of death : 27
Cause of death : Suffocated in his own vomit
Rock ’s greatest guitarist was responsible for some of the coolest and lasting music ever created .
Hendrix oozed talent from every pore .
His bluesy voice perfectly complemented his incendiary guitar work .
Perhaps more so than any of the others on this list , his untimely death transformed him into an international icon .
His unparalleled technique , which utilized distortion and heavy use of pedals , paved the way for the heavy metal genre .
The circumstances of his death in 1970 are still sketchy .
Although ruled accidental , rumors that he was murdered still circulate today .
His version of “ The Star Spangled Banner ” is pure Hendrix .
Senators reacted with bipartisan concern Thursday over the Obama administration ’s decision to scrap a missile defense system in Eastern Europe , saying Congress and foreign allies were kept in the dark .
The decision announced Thursday morning followed late - night phone calls to Czech and Polish officials , and at least one senior Democrat — Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin Carl Milton LevinMichigan to pay 0 M to victims of Flint water crisis Unintended consequences of killing the filibuster Inspector general independence must be a bipartisan priority in 2020 MORE ( D - Mich . ) — said those countries had no problem with the decision .

But the committee ’s ranking Republican , 2008 GOP presidential nominee ( Ariz . ) , told The Hill the White House never notified his committee until Thursday morning .
McCain also disputed Levin ’s assertion that Czech and Polish leaders were consulted .
" It was an unfortunate decision , ” McCain said .
“ It sends a message to the Russians that could encourage them , and it sends a message to our friends and allies not to count on our commitments . " Minority Leader ( R - Ky. ) was among several Republican leaders who told The Hill the decision caught them by surprise .
“ As clearly as I can tell , there was little or no consultation on the matter , ” said McConnell .
Sen. Richard Lugar ( Ind. ) , the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee , said the calls to Polish and Czech leaders came “ in the middle of the night ” and could endanger foreign countries ’ support for the U.S. effort in Afghanistan .
“ To do this kind of action without any more notification than that is certainly not a confidence - builder , ” Lugar said .
Significantly , the senior Republicans were joined by a handful of centrist Democrats on the Armed Services Committee who said they want to see the intelligence behind the decision .
“ I want to review what intelligence exists for that conclusion , ” said Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb . ) .
“ Obviously the White House ca n’t consult with Congress on everything , but there are some things that are important enough , particularly as it relates to national defense .
And there are some of us who have supported very strongly this defense system in the past — it seems we should have had some advance notice .
” “ I ’m concerned about scrapping it , ” added Sen . ( D - Mo. ) , also a committee member .
“ I think missile defense is a very , very important part of our arsenal .
” The Bush - era missile defense program would have placed interceptors in Poland and a radar station in the Czech Republic to stave off any nuclear threat posed by Iran .
Presidentsaid the U.S. will no longer pursue those plans in favor of a redesigned defense system that would be cheaper , quicker and more effective against the threat from Iranian missiles .
At the White House , Press Secretary Robert Gibbs denied that Congress was n't properly advised , and said Defense Secretary Robert Gates and other military officials would be briefing lawmakers on the Hill Thursday .
" I will certainly check with legislative affairs in terms of certain congressional notifications , but I do n't think it 's been a surprise to anybody , based on the fact that we 've discussed it in here , that the review was ongoing , ” Gibbs told reporters .
Levin rejected the criticism from Republicans that the decision could strain U.S. ties with Eastern Europe , noting that NATO already supported Obama ’s decision and that Poland and the Czech Republic are satisfied with other missiles they have been offered .
“ My understanding is that the Poles and the Czechs are very positive about it , ” Levin said .
“ The Poles have been offered standard missiles , they ’ve been offered Patriot missiles , and my understanding is that they ’re satisfied .
Nothing ’s being undermined , since they ’re supportive of it .
” Levin said he was notified by the White House several days ago that the decision was forthcoming , and that Congress should not have been surprised anyway since the issue of the missiles had been under review .
“ Clearly , people knew that there was discussions going on , and they ’d had previous opportunities to express themselves on it , ” he said .
Sen. Joseph Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) said he was “ disappointed ” with Thursday ’s decision , echoing McCain ’s complaint that it could endanger U.S. interests .
But Lieberman also said it could leave large sections of the U.S. more vulnerable to a missile attack by removing an initial level of protection .
“ If a missile is headed toward the U.S. , the ideal is to get a first shot at it from a European site , ” he said .
“ If we miss , then the Alaska and California sites have a second shot .
The problem is , if you look at a map , the alternate system they ’re talking about now is it leaves only once chance , which is the Alaska and California sites .
” But other Democrats said they had no problem with Obama ’s decision because they never supported the Eastern European missile system in the first place .
“ I ’ve never thought that European option is a good one , ” said Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) .
” We ought to have missile defense in the continental United States . ”

The implications of climate change are well documented and much discussed .
But , due to a curious cocktail of apathy , denial and ideologically fuelled intransigence , some people still choose to play " see no evil " .
Well , maybe this is what it will take to get them to sit up and take notice : climate change is starting to degrade the quality of beer .
Or so say a team at the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute lead by the climatologist Martin Mozny .
The team has just published a study in Agricultural and Forest Meteorology which concludes that " even with the modest warming so far experienced , [ hop ] yields [ in the Czech Republic ] have stagnated and quality declined " .
Yields have already been affected as air temperatures have slowly risen over the previous five decades , say the scientists , and they predict that future warming could reduce yields by a further 7 - 10 % .
But it is the decline in quality of the Saaz hops , which produce the famous Czech pilsners , that is perhaps most worrying for beer lovers .
The " Alpha " acid content – " a major determinant of quality " , according to the team , as it's the compound that produces a pilsner 's defining bitter taste – is likely to fall a further 13 – 32 % if the predicted warming occurs .
The study found that the concentration of these acids has fallen by 0.06 % a year since 1954 .
It 's not the first time that climatologists have expressed concern about the impact of climate change on beer production ( hmm ... I wonder why they choose the quality and output of beer as subjects worthy of detailed examination ? ) .
In 2008 , a researcher at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand told a conference of beer industry representatives that rising temperatures may threaten beer production .
That time it was malting barley that was identified as being particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures .
The researcher , Jim Salinger , concluded :
It will mean either there will be pubs without beer , or the cost of beer will go up .
If that sentence does n't sharpen the focus on the climate change debate , frankly , I do n't know what will .
I Hate My Job .
Now What ?
Whether we admit it or not , many of us have mixed the word hate in the same sentence as our job at one point or another .
Sometimes , it ’s after a long argument with the boss .
Other times , it ’s caused by the hopeless feeling when a month long project is expected to be completed by Friday .
With the economy the way it is , it ’s even easier to feel down about your career .
Chances are good that someone in the office is in deep financial trouble .
The added stress more than likely caused additional tension in work relationships , and tension just leads to more despair .
If this sounds familiar , know that complaining to people around you is the last thing you should do because it does n’t change the situation one bit .
Instead , here ’s a list of more productive actions you can take .
Improve Your Communication Skills – Being able to articulate your ideas and point of view is one of the most valuable assets you can learn .
Remember that communication is both ways .
Be a good listener by being patient , then make an effort to get your point across even when you are too lazy to do so .
Practice Your Selling Skills –
Most people think of selling as convincing someone to buy , but most selling is done on a more intangible level .
Every day , we are selling our ideas with our spoken words .
Every day , we are selling our value as an employee with our work ethic and every day , we are selling our image with how we act .
Let ’s face it .
Some people are just naturally more talented at this but with practice , EVERYONE can improve .
Make a conscious effort to improve your selling skills by listening to people who are convincing and practice selling your ideas often .
To people you know and even people you meet on the streets .
Do n’t be afraid of failure .
The more you fall , the better you become .
Sit Down and Figure Out What You Like and Dislike – Most people who hate their job have never thought about what they can do about it .
Perhaps the solution will present itself with just a friendly chat with your manager .
Without giving yourself a chance to seriously think of the possibilities , how do you know that nothing will work ?
Bottom line .
Before you sit down and exhaust every possible solution on how to be happier with your job , you have no right to say you hate it because it ’s not the job you dislike , it ’s what you are doing with it that you hate .
Gather Your Choices –
Once you start thinking about it , you will come up with some possible alternative .
Map out a to - do list and take action .
Test Out Your Theories –
As you start acting on the possible choices you thought about , you will get a reality check of your theories .
Were you correct in thinking that you were overworked compared with others ?
Is it true that you can really get a higher salary doing what you do ?
Pretty soon , you will get a pretty good sense of reality and armed with this information , you can plot a better course of action .
While we are at it , here is a list of “ What Not to Do ” .
Complain –
It ’s been said but it ’s worth mentioning again .
Understand that you are lucky to even have a job .
Be thankful that while millions of people are forced to look for work , you are in a position to choose .
Buy Things –
Many people do this to feel better , but drowning yourself in debt and being tied to your job even more is the last thing you should be doing .
Splurging is only going to provide temporary relief .
Seek Out Like Minded Individual –
At one of the companies I used to work for , some of the employees always talked about how unfair the work environment was during their lunch and dinner gatherings .
After a luncheon with the group , I was running for the hills because I did n’t need them to affect me negatively .
Nothing –
This is probably the most common , yet most devastating action you can take .
If you do nothing , you are letting your negativity bring your mood down .
If you do nothing , you are n’t giving yourself a chance to be happy .
If you do nothing , you are avoiding the truth .
If you do nothing , you are robbing yourself of what could have been .
Do something , and quick .
Do n’t sit there and say “ I Hate My Job ” .

More Than Just a Photo - Op
Headlines are now being prepared following U.S. President Barack Obama ’s convening of a trilateral Israeli - Palestinian - American peace summit today in New York .
Many will seek to belittle the president ’s efforts thus far .
The summit was being dismissed as a photo - op before it even happened .
The right , in the United States and in Israel , will spin this meeting as further proof of the young president ’s foreign policy naïveté .
Prioritizing Israeli - Palestinian conflict resolution , creating expectations in the Arab world , and publicly disagreeing with Israel , on settlements for instance , are all exhibits in the right ’s case against the new administration ( Steven Rosen here on ForeignPolicy.com provided a boiler - plate incantation of this hawkish line ) .
The spin from the left , in the United States and in the Arab world , is just as predictable .
The president blinked on settlements when Israel said boo , the Palestinians have been thrown under a bus , and the U.S. is pursuing more of the same failed incrementalist policies .
In large measure , both of these views are wrong .
The contours of a strategic methodical Obama approach to achieving the comprehensive Mideast peace of which he speaks are starting to become visible .
The way in which today ’s trilateral was announced is in itself instructive .
Special Envoy George Mitchell was getting played by the parties last week as they tried to leverage America ’s desire to see the three - way meeting take place .
Sometimes that is the lot of an envoy .
It is also an advantage of having an envoy , allowing the president to step in , cut to the chase , and simply announce where and when the parties were expected to report for a meeting with him .
The Americans decided that this week ’s news cycle would not be dominated by the vagaries of Middle Eastern leaders ’ mood swings or the potentially embarrassing ‘ will they - wo n’t they ’ speculation about an Abbas - Netanyahu meet .
Obama decided .
The trilateral happened .
It ’s over on Tuesday , now move on to climate change and nonproliferation .
While some on the Israeli side ( with many Arab commentators agreeing ) will be portraying this as an Israeli win , with Obama weakened and Abbas squaring up to a large helping of humble pie , I think that ’s a misreading of the current state of play .
Let ’s take the issue that has received most attention – settlements .
Analysts will jump on the fact that a meaningful settlement freeze has not been achieved and that President Obama called today to " restrain " such activity , a seeming climb - down from his previous statements .
While it is certainly true that some of the newfound Middle Eastern goodwill toward the U.S. has been squandered by the American inability to deliver a freeze and a price has been paid in America ’s standing and credibility , something else has also been happening that is likely to prove more significant over time .
By holding Israel ’s feet to the fire over settlements for a sustained period , America may actually have achieved a great deal in strategically advancing the two - state goal .
The most significant effect may be this : Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s preferred approach was to focus on interim issues and confidence - building measures ( CBMs ) and to avoid negotiating the core issues ( territories , settlements , Jerusalem , etc. ) on which his positions are the most unreasonable .
In particular , Netanyahu has attempted to advance an economic peace agenda , with his supporters feverishly spinning the idea that the West Bank is becoming an economic paradise .
The Obama team has staked out a clear position – items number 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 on the interim / CBM agenda are entitled " settlement freeze . "
They have been giving short shrift , including today , to the economic peace narrative ( they acknowledge the desirability of progress on the economy and freedom of movement , and should even congratulate themselves that the partial progress made is mainly a result of the heat Israel feels on settlements ) .
The result :
The settlement freeze focus has made Netanyahu ’s natural comfort zone — the interim / CBM world — a prohibitively uncomfortable place to inhabit .
So paradoxically , it is Netanyahu who now feels compelled to embrace and prefer negotiations on permanent status end - game issues .
That is no small achievement .
In addition , the most right - wing government in Israel ’s history is , in practical terms , limiting its pro-settlements proclivities , and a tantalizing pivot has been established : namely , that having failed to reach acceptable arrangements on a settlements freeze , the best and obvious alternative is to proceed now to delineate borders .
In other words , the territory — the border component of the two - state deal — becomes the default solution to what the Americans have established , possibly in a premeditated way , as the never - ending settlement freeze saga .
The cherry on the icing emerged today when the president notably and crucially failed to give a formal blessing to continued construction in East Jerusalem and in almost 3,000 settlement units as an " agreed exemption clause . "
By not providing this kosher stamp , by calling for restraint , actions not just words , America ( just ) retained its credibility on the settlements issue .
So the settlements focus can best be understood as an important exercise in setting down a marker , even though it is also an important issue in its own right .
This is also the best way to understand the Mitchell team ’s several months ’ worth of investment in obtaining Arab gestures toward early normalization with Israel .
The point here was not necessarily the immediate deliverables , which may be meager , but rather to create an expectation .
This administration is serious about comprehensive peace , and the Arab states will need to be serious about making good on their full normalization pledge , which is part of the Arab Peace Initiative .
Mitchell has begun to seriously have that conversation and to get people ’s heads in the Arab world around the idea of what normalization really means .
What we have been witnessing thus far , including today , has been a table - setting exercise .
President Obama ’s message today continued to emphasize key themes — the urgency of achieving a two - state solution , his personal engagement and commitment , and why this is an American national interest .
Starting on day one , as Obama did , rather than in year seven as his predecessor did , has its advantages .
It allows one to invest several months and even to reach an impasse in order to make a point .
I would argue that this administration is determinedly and inexorably moving this process toward a moment of truth that may take another several months or more to arrive , but arrive it will .
The straw - man argument that a focus on CBMs and economic peace can substitute for end - game negotiations has been defenestrated .
A settlement freeze will continue to be pursued but will now be delinked from these permanent status negotiations , which will be launched in parallel , and the Palestinians will be walked back from their preconditions .
Israelis and Palestinians will be brought together to negotiate directly but with an ongoing American presence and guiding hand .
More than that , in fact , one can expect the existing modus operandi to continue , with most of the serious talks and negotiations taking place on three parallel axes of dialogue : American - Israeli , American - Palestinian , and American - Arab states .
Most of that will be via the continuous shuttling of Mitchell and his team , with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ( who is more keenly involved in Middle East peace efforts than is often acknowledged ) and President Obama being deployed as and when necessary .
Over time , one imagines that those key issues that have been addressed only tentatively thus far , or that have even remained taboo , will also be taken on .
Syria , for instance , will at the appropriate moment need to shift from the orbit of hesitantly engaged outlier , to being a centerpiece in a comprehensive peace effort .
A way will also need to be found to deal with the Hamas " untouchables . "
Ultimately , that might mean an indirect engagement via a consortium of regional and other actors ( such as the Saudis , Qataris , Turks , and others , including but not exclusively Egypt ) or by actively encouraging and accepting internal Palestinian political reconciliation .
If there is indeed a strategy here , and I at least think one can be discerned , then it is heading towards the presentation and active promotion , at the appropriate moment , of an American plan for implementing a comprehensive peace .
America will have to recognize that it is dealing on the Israeli and Palestinian sides , for all their differences , with two deeply dysfunctional polities .
The parties simply cannot do this of their own volition , and this is too important for them and for America for it to be left to the mercy of the vicissitudes of their respective domestic politics .
America will have to create the incentives and also the disincentives .
It is not a question of wanting this more or less than the parties themselves .
It is about who is best placed to carry this effort over the finishing line — and only determined American leadership with international support can achieve that .
Senator Mitchell frequently talks about his 700 days of frustration in Northern Ireland and one day of decisive , break - through success .
Today ’s trilateral may register on the frustrating side of the ledger , but President Obama has set off on a path that can lead to that one game - changing day of peace - making .
Given the urgency , as acknowledged again by the president today , let ’s hope he dramatically trims down that 700 number .

Il perché è presto detto : in un paese che attinge ministri fra modelle di calendari , eurodeputati fra conduttrici tv , conferenzieri accademici fra cantanti di night ( e il ricordo indelebile corre a Franco Califano , acclamato ospite di una prestigiosa università romana ) , c’è da aspettarsi di tutto .
Ma attenzione : nessuno mette in dubbio , le capacità professionale di questi onesti lavoratori dell ’intrattenimento .
Il punto è un altro : come mai le autorità hanno deciso di anteporli a scienziati , artisti , uomini di dottrina ?
Fino ad oggi , i senatori a vita si chiamavano Eugenio Montale o Rita Levi Montalcini .
Adesso , appunto , si è pensato a un presentatore televisivo come Mike Bongiorno .
Ecco in che modo si è arrivati al “ sabato nero ” del 12 settembre .
Accuratamente dissodato da una sinistra ansiosa di meticciato , riscoperta dei generi , livellamento fra cultura alta e bassa , il terreno è stato finalmente consegnato al suo legittimo proprietario : il padrone dei media .
Non è certo su di lui , però , coerente ideatore di un progetto tanto perverso quanto brillantemente perseguito , che ricadrà la vergogna dell ’accaduto .
L’onta di aver disertato le esequie di fisici e pittori , astronomi e scrittori , giuristi e matematici , economisti e storici , per accalcarsi intorno al feretro di Mike Bongiorno , ricadrà sulle nostre autorità .
Oggi è un giorno di lutto , sì , ma soprattutto per la nostra decenza di cittadini .
Preferire ai testimoni del lavoro intellettuale , l ’eroe delle trasmissioni commerciali , implica infatti una precisa opzione pedagogica : significa affermare che i valori più profondi della nostra società sono affidati alle soubrettes , piuttosto che agli studiosi .
Lo “ studio ” , anzi , sarà da adesso in poi solo e soltanto quello televisivo , con buona pace di chi si attarda ancora intorno alla ricerca del buono , del vero , del bello . ( 12 settembre 2009 )
First evidence of possible vaccine as US military - backed medical trial in Thailand cuts HIV infection rate by a third
A medical trial in Thailand has raised hopes of a major breakthrough in the fight against Aids after scientists said an experimental vaccine had reduced the risk of HIV infection by a third .
The world 's largest HIV / Aids vaccine trial of more than 16,000 volunteers was the first in which infection has been prevented , according to the US army , which sponsored the trial with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
A combination of two vaccines was tested on HIV - negative Thai men and women aged 18 to 30 at average risk of becoming infected .
All the volunteers were given counselling and condoms to help them avoid HIV .
Then half were randomly picked to receive the vaccine , while the other half got dummy shots .
Until the trial ended , nobody knew who had been given the genuine vaccine and who had not .
A relatively small number of people became infected with HIV – 51 of the 8,197 people given the vaccine , and 74 of the 8,198 who received dummy shots – but the difference was statistically significant , which means scientists believe it could not have happened by chance .
It worked out at a 31 % lower risk of infection for the vaccine group .
Colonel Jerome Kim , who helped to lead the $ 105 m ( £ 64 m ) study for the US army , said it was " the first evidence that we could have a safe and effective preventive vaccine " .
Recent failures had led many scientists to believe that such a vaccine might not be achievable .
In 2007 , the drug company Merck abandoned what had looked at the time like the most promising avenue of research after disappointing trial results .
Today the National Institute 's director , Dr Anthony Fauci , warned it was " not the end of the road " , but said he was surprised and very pleased by the outcome .
" It gives me cautious optimism about the possibility of improving this result , " he said .
" This is something that we can do . "
Every day , 7,000 people worldwide are newly infected with HIV ; 2 million died of Aids in 2007 , the UN agency Unaids estimates .
The Aids Vaccine Advocacy Coalition , an international group that has worked towards developing a vaccine , welcomed the results of the trial – the third major study since 1983 , when HIV was identified as the cause of Aids – as " a historic milestone " .
The executive director , Mitchell Warren , said : " There is little doubt that this finding will energise and redirect the Aids vaccine field . "
Frances Gotch , professor of immunology at Imperial College London , said the results appeared to be statistically significant and may have been the effect of the two different vaccines working in tandem to more powerful effect .
" The fact that they have seen a response with people with such a low incidence of infection is impressive , " Gotch , who is also the principal investigator for the International Aids Vaccine Initiative , told the Guardian .
" Of course it 's not 100 % of people [ protected ] but 31 % could make an enormous difference in the world .
I think this is something we can work with . "
Thailand 's ministry of public health conducted the study , which used strains of HIV common in Thailand .
Scientists stressed it was not known whether such a vaccine would work against other strains elsewhere in the world .
The study was done in Thailand because US army scientists carried out pivotal research in that country when the Aids epidemic emerged there , isolating virus strains and providing genetic information on them to vaccine makers .
The study tested a two - vaccine combination in a " prime - boost " approach , where the first one primes the immune system to attack the HIV virus , and the second one strengthens the response .
Alvac uses canarypox , a bird virus , altered so it can't cause human disease , to ferry synthetic versions of three HIV genes into the body .
AidsVax contains a genetically engineered version of a protein on HIV 's surface .
It is unclear whether vaccine makers will seek to license the two - vaccine combination in Thailand .
Before the trial began , the US Food and Drug Administration said other studies would be needed before the vaccine could be considered for US licensing .
The full results of the trial will be presented at an international Aids vaccine conference in Paris in October .
The executive director of the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise , an alliance of research bodies and funders like the Gates Foundation , said the results showed a vaccine was an achievable goal .
" This is a historic day in the 26 - year quest to develop an Aids vaccine , " said Dr Alan Bernstein .
" This trial is the first demonstration in humans that , with more research , it will be possible to develop a vaccine that is fully protective against HIV . "
Deborah Jack , chief executive of the National Aids Trust in the UK , said a vaccine , by far the most effective way of tackling serious infectious diseases , was desperately needed .
More work was needed , but the promising findings " justify the continuing investments and efforts of the international community , including the UK government , to develop a vaccine . "
The Terrence Higgins Trust said it was treating the results with " cautious optimism " .
" This is the first step on a very long road , " said the policy manager , Vicky Sheard .
" There 's a lot of research needed into how a vaccine can be rolled out , how costly it 's going to be , whether it 's going to be effective against different strains . "
FIRSTLY :
DISCLAIMER :
Why Me ?
Longworth , Rayburn , and Cannon , Oh My !
Yes but , what can you do for me ?
Welcome To The Special Interest " Republic "
" Damn The Country , Obama Must Fail "
The Republicans Have Their Long - Knives Out :
Nothing Ever Changes , Ever :
We 're In Deep Trouble
Is It Too Late ?
A few months ago , I was invited to join an Internet trade group in their lobbying effort in Washington , DC .
The goal was to educate Congressmen and Senators on the realities of privacy online , as well as the complex small - business economy of the millions of mid-sized to small websites that rely on advertising to survive .
Overall , the trip was deemed a success , to some degree , we were able to communicate our issues in a way that was understood , even appreciated .
However , I came back with several additional observations , the most important being that our government is absolutely gridlocked in a pointless turf - war and that we ( the people ) have long - since lost any voice we may have thought we had .
It is with hesitation that I post these direct observations and experiences .
Foremost because of my role as part owner of AboveTopSecret.com , and the potential bias that many may see to infer from my statements .
However , given the escalating climate of political rancor in this nation , I hope that the import of my experience outweighs the potential knee - jerk reactions of bias .
My involvement was requested because I 'm a part - owner of a " long - tail " web site -- that is , one of millions of sites not part of the small collection of massively trafficked mainstream news and portal web sites .
The goal of the trip was to communicate the complexities and fragility of the smaller site owners who very much mirror real - world small business owners and comprise a major portion of online traffic , advertising , and content .
Additionally , my background as an advertising executive helped give me the background and communicative tools to portray our concerns in a way that could be appreciated .
We started early , and our rather large rabble of 20 - or - so web site owners was divided into groups of four and given a tight schedule of visits .
Our group 's rather long and tedious day consisted of nine meetings with Congressmen ( most - often a senior aide ) spread out among three of the House office buildings on Independence Ave. , the Rayburn , Longworth , and Cannon buildings .
Each building is connected by a maze of multi- level underground tunnels which also connect to the Capitol building .
Accompanied by a registered lobbyist ( in order to have access to the tunnels ) , I was teamed up with three other web site owners as we rushed from meeting to meeting .
On three occasions we actually sat down with a Congressman , and for the most part they did a good job of seeming to show interest in our concerns .
The other visits were with senior aides or assistant chiefs of staff , who worked less to appear concerned but usually had one or two good questions .
Despite our best efforts of portraying the needs of online small business that are in each congressional district , it became painfully evident that if we were n't speaking in terms of direct benefit to them , there was no real interest in our visit other than ensuring it ended on time or sooner .
This was the first very clear up close and personal indication that our republic is broken .
It 's not difficult to spot the four types of people rushing about in the tunnels below the congressional office buildings .
Interns and pages are young and generally are dressed in the best office casual Gap or J. Crew can buy .
Congressional staff members are a bit older , and always in business suits from the more expensive selections of Sears or Kohls , or Macy 's if they 're a more senior staff members .
Actual members of Congress are among the best - dressed best - coifed people around , and typically the only ones able to wear a smile .
Which leaves us with the lobbyists ... who are all wearing dark - colored higher - end business suits , serious expressions , fatigued carriage , and comfortable shoes .
Once you can identify the various denizens it becomes obvious this is no longer our republic , and we 're in deep trouble .
While we here on ATS have always known we 're in deep trouble , the picture was clearly painted and readily experienced during lunch .
In one the massive cafeterias of the Longworth building , easily 100 ( or more ) yards long by 60 wide , more than 80 % of all the people in the packed room were lobbyists grabbing some lunch .
Our companion lobbyist confirmed the guess , and also confirmed that it was this way in all the cafeterias , and has been since he can remember ( 18 - year veteran of DC ) .
So I asked him , " With all these well - paid professional lobbyists representing big chunks of potential money , how do actual constituents stand a chance ? "
His response , " They do n't , they never did .
" I reminded him of the subject matter of my site , and how his statement confirms the concerns of conspiracy theorists everywhere .
He said , " It used to be a conspiracy , now it 's just the way things are .
" During my " SkepticOverlord Goes To Washington " adventure , I had the opportunity to speak with several lobbyists other than the chaperone assigned to my group .
Some conversations were over cocktails the previous evening , others after the day 's events before I had to depart to the airport .
One such person in particular became particularly talkative once I identified who I was , and which site I owned .
He knew of ATS and was very interested in many of our topics .
In fact , it might be best to qualify our short but detailed conversation as " getting a weight of his chest .
" After being a Washington lobbyist for quite some time ( into his second decade ) , he was clearly disenfranchised and not enjoying his work .
Two points stand out as being particularly important to the events happening right now . "
Ever since the election , and for the foreseeable future , the Republicans only have one thing on their mind , screw Obama . "
He said nothing else matters to them , not voters , and certainly not getting anything done .
While the daily dance of special interest continues , he said that everyone is continually distracted by the inside war between Republicans and Democrats ... and the smart lobbyists are the ones approaching Republicans with strategies and plans to undermine the Democrats and especially Obama .
His concern was ( and this was in late May , before the worst of it began ) , that the " get Obama " climate was in danger of getting out of control and irreparably damaging the entire country .
The most haunting words I head my entire trip were , " Nothing ever changes here , other than the nameplates on the Senate , Congressional , and Executive offices .
The money ( lobbyists ) controls every policy , every platform , and in most cases , every election . "
It 's one thing to know draw this conclusion on your own , it 's quite another to hear it straight from an insider 's mouth .
Sending chills up my spine hardly covers the feeling .
We here on ATS knew this .
To most of us , this is no surprise .
However , the stunning surprise comes from experiencing an insider 's lament as to the horrible state of the " Special Interest Republic " we have occupying the offices of Washington , DC .
To hear , from an insider 's mouth , that the " elected " officials are gridlocked in bitter battle with no focus other than to force the failure of the new President is stunning confirmation of what we feared was happening .
Combined with the overwhelming control of the entire process by special interest money , and the only conclusion we can draw is , " We 're in deep trouble .
" Regardless of your politics , or your personal opinion of the person represented by the nameplate on the Oval Office , the culture of " get him " we now see is beyond perilous .
In fact , it so horrific and dangerous to our culture it 's difficult to find the appropriate adjective .
I 'm no fan of politicians , and especially many in Obama 's administration .
Part of the reason for my dislike is the never - ending context of attacking the other party and / or president of the other party .
But this current culture of attack - inspired gridlock is , in my opinion , the worst ever .
And to compound our feelings of helplessness , it 's all too clear that the current bunker mentality of an us -v- them all out war on Capital Hill is inspired by the massive money of special interests .
This political war , at a time when so much must be done , is quite possibly the death knell of this nation .
Is it too late ?
Was there ever any hope ?( typo corrections ) [ edit on 11-8-2009 by SkepticOverlord ]

BBC News Magazine
Comedian Graham Norton has been warned by the BBC after making a lesbian joke on his television show .
But it 's not uncommon for gay men to make jokes about their female counterparts .
It started with a series of drawings of a woman in a jumpsuit .
Gay women are not as ' visible ' as gay men Norton was showing them to his guest Ruth Jones , co-writer of Gavin and Stacey , on The Graham Norton Show on BBC Two in March .
" I do n't know why they 've got some lesbian to be the model for this , " he said .
When challenged by Jones that she might not be a lesbian , Norton made a joke about her hair .
At the weekend , the BBC upheld a complaint and said Norton , an openly gay man , had " perpetuated an offensive stereotype " .
There are few subjects off - limits for risque comedians like Norton , and many would probably view the comment as light - hearted .
But Lucy Masoud , a journalist on Love Girls , which describes itself as a fun website for gay girls , says , in robust terms , that Norton 's remarks reflect a wider stereotype perpetuated by some gay men .
" On the gay scene , you do hear men - usually younger gay blokes or older queens - saying they can't stand lesbians , they are all this or that .
They 're butch , they 're chicks with dicks , they 're men with fannies .
GENDER DIVIDE
I think it might be partly a case of sexism .
Women are still judged on their looks and gay men - who stereotypically are supposed to have a more developed aesthetic awareness - consider themselves well placed to make comments about the beauty or otherwise of stereotypically ' ugly ' lesbians
Jane Czyzselska
Editor , Diva magazine " But spend five minutes in Soho [ an area in London popular among gay people ] and you 'll see that the stereotype of a typical lesbian is nonsense . "
It 's an inexcusable attitude but it 's human nature to want to feel superior , she says .
" If you 're seen as being at the bottom of the pile , you want someone to be further below you .
In theory , all minority groups should be fighting together .
People experiencing racism should be fighting with gay people and disabled people for equality together . "
Within the gay community , there is some antipathy both ways , she says , because some lesbians joke about gay men as promiscuous .
She has overheard lesbians who have walked into a gay bar and said ' Watch out you do n't get AIDS ' .
" How do you respond to something as ignorant as that ?
It 's hugely damaging .
All this in - fighting means we are not fighting together for things that are important .
People are so apathetic now .
" We can walk down the street in Soho holding hands and that 's good enough for us .
We 're gay but not political and the fight is finished . "
Different battles Nick Maxwell , who works at Age Concern developing services for older LGBT ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) groups , says the kind of comments gay women are sometimes subjected to from gay men include suggestions they 're fat , ugly , they hate men and they wear dungarees .
ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
As a personal trainer who works within the gay community , I 've never quite understood the gay and lesbian divide .
It seems to be a culture we 've grown up with , although it 's got better in the 18 years that I 've been on the scene .
The lesbians were the ones that always pushed for change and maybe a lot of gay men are n't aware of that
Ryan Bull
" It creates an animosity and it 's self - perpetuating because the men have their groups , the women have their groups , and they do n't understand each other 's concerns .
Homophobia is massively under - reported yet we have it within our own community .
It 's all totally unacceptable and needs to be challenged , wherever it comes from . "
It 's difficult to get women involved in LGBT projects , he says , because as women they may already have been treated as second - class citizens , then derisory comments from men , particularly from men within their own community , reinforce that sense of exclusion .
The animosity , says Mr Maxwell , could also come from a sense that gay men have fought different battles - like being criminalised by the law and dealing with HIV - that lesbians have not faced , although lesbians have long been at the forefront of the successful campaign to change the law .
We 're all working towards the same goals but because of the gender divide it can be easy for people to slip into an insular mindset
Peter Lloyd
Gay Times
Gay humour is often characterised by its cattiness .
So should jokes be taken a little less seriously , given that many gay men and women work and socialise together without any problems ?
This kind of humour is sometimes expressed by gay men but it's not a serious problem , says Peter Lloyd , news editor of Gay Times and Pink Paper .
He thinks it 's partly to do with ownership .
" When you have people that are part of a sub - group , there 's a certain freedom of expression within that so it 's much easier to make comedic references about other people within that community because it 's much safer .
" So there 's an element of this within the community but ultimately there 's a shared level of understanding about our aims and objectives . "
But it does have repercussions in perpetuating a lack of visibility of gay women in mainstream society and gay culture , he says .
" It 's surprising that there can be sometimes a sense of polarity within the community . "
It 's good that media regulators are on to this , he adds , but they should be consistent and apply the same rigour to other broadcasters like Jonathan Ross and Chris Moyles , whose humour in the past has prompted accusations of homophobia .
A selection of your comments appears below .
I am a butch lesbian , and there 's nothing wrong with that .
Okay ?
Yes it 's a stereotype that people think all lesbians look like me .
But being gender variant or transgender is n't a " negative " stereotype .
It 's not " offensive " to look butch .
It 's not a horrible image .
For decades it has been butch gay women and effeminate gay men , the queens , that have been OUT there fighting .
I would appreciate it if the gays and lesbians that can blend in with the heterosexuals would stop trying to make those of us who are visible disappear .
Michelle , AIDS transformed many dynamics including those between gay men and women .
Lesbians came to the support of gay men when they were in trouble and previous sniping was abandoned .
I do n't think it 's appropriate for a gay person of either gender to express disparaging remarks about anyone , let alone another gay person , especially on TV !
On the hand , there is no need to turn a lame remark into a catclysm .
Mary , New York , NY Everything is fodder for jokes .
Even the humourless , sensitive souls who complain on behalf of themselves or others .
Make jokes about everyone and everything , and do n't favour anyone or anything because we as a species are apt to take ourselves rather more seriously than we merit .
What is tragic is the insistence that humanity be divided up into arbitrary groups , and each of those arbitrary groups demand special treatment .
Laugh at them all equally I say because we are all equally ridiculous when the mood takes us and we should have the wind knocked out of our sails as a matter of course .
And anyway laughing is good for us .
Peter , San Vendemiano , Italy ( ex UK )
All the comments posted seem to make it look like lesbians are over reacting and humourless about their sexuality , but this is about more than just an off - the - cuff negative comment .
Lesbians are under - represented in the media and misunderstood in society , I believe more so than gay men .
I do have a sense of humour about my sexuality , I 'll joke with gay and straight friends , but derogatory is derogatory .
We have to deal with snide comments enough , we should n't have to deal with our own community perpetuating the " dyke " image .
Bella , Bath Gay men do make the odd joke about lesbians , but they make jokes about literally everyone , most particularly other gay men .
Gay humour is often very , very robust , and close to the mark .
When we meet lesbians , I 've never seen any evidence of dislike or distrust , although in the bars and clubs there is n't a lot of mixing ...!
Matt , London
As a gay man who has worked to advance gay and lesbian rights , I can tell you that when gay men and lesbians get together in a project or a work environment they usually achieve great things !
We certainly need to respect one another as there are enough homophobes around without bitching our brothers and sisters !
Naughty Graham ; slapped wrists you daft queen ! ;-)
Mike , Birmingham
This would n't be the first time Graham Norton has made jokes about lesbians that risk offence .
He has often made some derisory comments about lesbians ' attire or hairstyle that reflect tired old stereotypes .
Shame on him .
Bianca Pevsner , London , UK
Cant see the problem , Gay men joke about themselves , their sexuality all the time on TV and they joke about others too and straight people joke about gays .
Come on , let your hair down and stop being politically correct .
Gay , lesbian or not , a little joke here and there is no problem .
Steve
Whilst I appreciate that certain minorities have been discriminated against in the recent past I fear that we risk going to far the other way .
I do wish that everyone of every sexual orientation , religion , race and creed would be just a little more tolerant and less quick to claim to be insulted .
Otherwise we risk society becoming much more ghettoised ; with everyone retreating into their own little group and not being prepared to help each other
Mike Slater , Harlow , Essex I find it amusing that this is news when both the gay and lesbian community make their derogatory comments about bisexuals almost constantly .
Oddly this is not news but is to the people who experience such ignorance .
Do you think there will ever be an article based on how the gay and lesbian community marginalise and stereotype many a bisexual ?
Seems to me there are only two communities always fighting for their rights within sexuality , is n't it high time the rest get the same treatment ?
Especially when you have LGBT centres where the L & G seem to be more prominent and the B & T are just put in to make it look like everyone is included in the same equality battle .
Time to open the debate I think because it's about time other people had their rights listened to as well .
Amy , Edinburgh Is n't " older queens " just as big a stereotype as anything Lucy Masoud is complaining about ?
Ian Nesbitt , Durham Surely Graham Norton 's show reinforces all kinds of stereotypes just by starring Graham Norton ?
Fred Lesbians can look like any type of woman .
And some sorts of men .
Gay men can look like all sorts of men .
And some sorts of women .
So can straight men and women .
But what is unforgivable to me as a gay man is not to have a sense of humour .
I 've no idea who this Lucy Masoud is but she has obviously had a humour bypass .
Boyd , London
As with all forms of media we have available to us , we do have the choice to not watch , not listen and not read .
I used to know what to expect from shows with the likes of Graham Norton , Russel Brand and even Stephen Fry presenting them , hence why I watched them .
Do n't you ?
Anne Robinson is probably the worst culprit with her abuse of contestants , yet this is broadcast to the largest demographic of them all .
If you can't handle it then switch off , turn the volume down or have an early night .
Gethin , Amsterdam
The only folk who are joked about , dismissively , without hesitation , by both the lesbian and gay communities are transgender people .
There is an openly hostile attitude , sometimes disguised as humour , most evident in the lesbian crowd .
Look for online references to " tranny (s ) " ;
THIS is where the real ugly - side of humour in the GLBT communities shows itself .
It 's no joke - it 's just bigotry .
Lauren D , Charleston , South Carolina , USA
What ?
Nick Maxwell 's experiences are completely alien to mine .
I see plenty of self - deprecating humour within gay culture , but do n't recall gay men reinforcing negative lesbian stereotypes at all .
That 's the forté of my straight parents and certain straight " friends " .
Belittling celebrities and guests with snide remarks and reinforcing negative stereotypes is what Norton is all about ( go watch CH4's ' So Graham Norton ' re-runs if you do n't believe me ) , so if the BBC is not allowed to show such " humour " then it 's a mystery to me why they contracted him in the first place .
Fad , Staffordshire , UK
In the 70s in San Francisco , lesbians who worked politically with gay men were called " male identified " by other lesbians .
My partner of 25 years is a national leader in GLBT civil rights activism and she experienced this first hand .
The lesbian culture and the gay male culture are completely different cultures .
It 's interesting how we are supposed to be the same because we love same sex .
My partner and I are rare in that we have many gay male friends .
Most lesbians we know do n't socialize with gay men and most gay men we know do n't socialize with lesbians .
I work professionally in HIV / AIDS with many gay men .
The greatest misogyny I 've ever experienced has always been from gay men .
No surprise considering many gay men do n't have that many lesbians in their lives .

Senator Charles Grassley ( Iowa ) , the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , was nice enough to sit down with C - SPAN 's Washington Journal show yesterday morning [ 9/8/09 ] .
Sen .
Grassley answered phone calls and questions pertaining to the health care debate .
The full length video is presented below , and I would encourage you to watch it in its entirety .
I have however excerpted crucial exchanges which I believe to be representative of Sen.
Grassley 's position as the main antagonist to health care reform .
There are five main points that I would like to highlight from the roughly thirty three minute video .
Each point is bolded within the excerpt ; I 'll respond to these bolded portions following each excerpt .
You can also listen to the excerpt by advancing the slider bar in the video above to the corresponding time listed at the beginning of each excerpt .
The first excerpt is below :
[ TIME : 00:21:24 ]
HOST : Let 's go to Jonathan on the Republican 's line , and he 's calling from Wilmington , North Carolina .
Go ahead Jonathan .
CALLER : Thank you and good morning , and thank God for C - SPAN .
Senator Grassley , the first question I would like to ask you is how long you have been a member of Congress ?
GRASSLEY ( R , IA ) :
This is my fifth term ....
CALLER : This is your fifth term ; so we 're going on 30 years .
Is that correct ?
GRASSLEY : This is my fifth term .... Yes. CALLER : And six year terms , thats coming up on 30 years .
When was the last time you had to decide whether you were going to buy food or health care for your children ?
Your salary in the Senate is about eight times what the average American makes .
And to be honest , you live in a bubble and do not realize what the average American goes through .
GRASSLEY : You asked me when the last time was .
It would be from 1961 to 1971 when I was a member of the International Association of Machinists .
I was an assembly line worker making furnace registers at Waterloo Register Company , Cedar Falls Iowa ; and I spent ten years putting screw holes in furnace registers .
During that period of time I had to worry about whether I was going to buy food or other things .
And that was two jobs I had at that particular time .
HOST : And did you struggle with health care at that time , with insurance ?
GRASSLEY : Well , I suppose I was like 20 year old people and early 30 year old people right now .
I was never going to get sick , I never had any need for [ health care ] .
So I think that I was probably , during that period of time , even though my company had a plan for us to join , I think I was seven or eight years of the ten years I spent there before I signed up for the health insurance plan .
1
If you 're working where they have health insurance and you 're 20 to 30 years old and you think you 're never going to get sick , maybe that 's true , but if you have a chance to have health insurance , you outta take it .
2
About four to five million people , of the 50 million people that do n't have health insurance , are people that fall into that category of 20 to 30 years old .
Source : CSPAN : Senator Grassley on Congressional Agenda
1. I would argue that Sen. Grassley 's health care situation in the 1960s and ' 70s is financially incomparable .
He stated that he earned $ 15,000 at some juncture between 1961 - 1971 later in the segment , so I 'll use that amount for comparison purposes and assume that it was 1971 .
Several different metrics reveal that $ 15,000 in 1971 is worth about 60 k in 2003 terms .
Health care in 1971 cost $ 342 per capita and increased to $ 5,711 in 2003 according to the non profit Kaiser Family Foundation ; a respected authority on health care research .
Using the aforementioned data for 1971 and 2003 respectively we can show that the cost of health care as a percentage of Sen.
Grassley 's income quadrupled between 1971 and 2003 .
If 2009 data were available , the difference would likely be larger .
It is , using 2003 dollars , currently four times more difficult to afford insurance than it was in 1971 , using Sen .
Grassley 's situation .
To illustrate this point graphically , I 've plotted national health care expenditures as a function of national Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) over time .
You 'll notice that the GDP cost of health care has roughly doubled in the past 40 years :

No matter what metric is used , health care is more expensive today than in years past .
The increase in health care costs have outpaced the increase in wages during the same time period , thus leaving segments of the population with no alternative .
Health care has simply become too expensive for some Americans and I think the general public has acknowledged this issue ; Grassley appears to be an exception .
2 . This is by far Sen .
Grassley 's most interesting statement of the entire interview / show .
He presents a redundant set of logical tests governing the process of acquiring health care .
He concludes that if somebody has access to health care , they should get health care .
His initial logic can further be reduced to : if you have the capacity to afford health care , you will have health care ; if you can't afford health care , you do n't have health care .
I know the situation is more complex than a binary choice scenario , but the fact that Sen .
Grassley used if to proceed his statement highlights the need for reform .
The ability to obtain health care within one 's means should be a fundamental right , there should be no if .
An individual 's desire for health care treatment should not depend upon their , or anybody else 's , financial situation .
The right to affordable health care supports our declared right to life .
The second excerpt follows and piggy - backs upon the first :
[ TIME : 00:30:10 ] HOST : Let 's go to Dee on the Democrats line calling from New Jersey .
Go ahead Dee. CALLER
Good morning .
GRASSLEY : Good morning .
CALLER : I just have a couple of things and a couple of questions .
One is , a minute ago you said that it was 1971 the last time you had to worry about providing food for your family and for paying for health care .
GRASSLEY : Yeah , let me explain why that was that way .
Because prior to that time I was making about 15,000 dollars and then being elected to Congress and then making 42,000 at the time ; that doubled my income .
3 CALLER :
Well sir , since that time , health insurance premiums have gone up about 400 % for one thing , and the manufacturing base has been decimated since that time .
There are fewer manufacturing - I mean the world has changed since then .
So , that time , while relevant to you , is not relevant to most Americans who are struggling with those choices today .
Secondly , you continue , and I 've seen this in your town hall meetings , you continue to castigate Canada and other countries with single payer health care ; well Canada is number six in life expectancy in the world .
Japan where I lived for seven years , has single payer health care and is number two in the world .
Singapore is number three and they have a system where they have private insurance competing with a public option and it has driven down costs in both directions .
GRASSLEY : Well go to England , where people do n't live as long as they do in the United States if they have cancer or go to Canada where you gotta wait three months to have an MRI .
So if you have a headache , do you want to wait three months to find out if you have a brain tumor .
Or why do so many people come across the lines to have MRIs when they can afford to get it right now .
Why do you have to wait in line for a long time to have hip and knee replacement compared to what you have in the United States .

Government run plan has x number of dollars they 're going to spend on health care and when those x number of dollars do n't go far enough then they erase you .
So when you have a political decision and you only have one choice , the government 's choice , and what we 're trying to do here for the 50 million people that do n't have health insurance is to give them choice by putting them into private insurance plans and that 's why we do n't want a public option .
Because every expert on the subject says says that tens of millions of people , the lowest figure I 've seen is 83 million , the highest figure I 've seen is 120 , are going to be pushed out of their health care plan into a government run plan .
And when you do that , you soon have , everybody else 's premiums go up , and pretty soon other people opt out and then pretty soon you have what the Congresswoman from Illinois said to a group that she was talking to who wanted a Canadian style single payer .
We have to have a public option first because the American people wo n't go from what they have now to what they have in Canada so we have to have this interim stop over .
But you know what their goal is ?
Their goal is to have the government run everything .
And I do n't think the government does a very good job of running the postal service for instance .
So should they be running health care ?

3. Sen . Grassley has already falsely compared his plight to that of others , now he 's providing his excuse ; money .
Sen .
Grassley fails to comprehend the intricacies of his own health care situation .
He has been a member of Congress since 1974 , at which point he qualified for the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program ( FEHBP ) of 1959 ; the plan does not provide government run healthcare it simply provides " the widest selection of [ private ] health plans in the country . "
Sen .
Grassley has n't had to worry about health care , in the same since as most American's , for the last 35 years because of this program .
It also does n't hurt to make more than 95 % of the general population .
Either one of these circumstances explains Sen .
Grassley 's inability to relate to the imperativeness of health care reform .
4 . I think the caller makes a good point , although his factual assertions are slightly off base ; for example Japan is third in average life expectancy , not second .
The caller 's main point was that these other countries with nationalized health care actually produce a higher standard of living , at least in terms of life expectancy , than does the US .
Sen .
Grassley was very dismissive of this argument and eagerly presented counter examples to the caller 's claims .
Sen .
Grassley instantly focused on areas where these systems are inferior to the USA , rather than focusing on their advantages .
I do n't want you to tell me what does n't work , or wo n't work , I want you to support what does work or could work .
Japan , Singapore and Canada are obviously doing something right , as designated by their average life expectancies , it is your job as a Senator to determine what it is in order to better our country .
5 . Grassley apparently does n't know shit about the post office .
If the health care plan passes and is as successful as the post office , 82 % of American 's will support its implementation .
ノルバスクの適応 症
ノルバスクの作用機序に関してですが血管平滑筋に存在するカルシウムチャネルを阻害し、それによって血管平滑筋細胞内へのカルシウムイオンの流入が阻害されます。
これによって血管平滑筋が収縮できなくなりますが、これによって血管平滑筋は弛緩し血管は拡張します。
ノルバスクの特徴は、他のカルシウム拮抗薬と比較して副作用が起こりにくいことが特徴です。
カルシウム拮抗薬の代表的副作用には頭痛、顔面紅潮、歯肉増強などがありますが、これらは起こりにくくなっています。
また作用持続時間が長、1日1回の服用で済むことも特徴の1つです。
ノルバスクの適応症には2種類あります。
ま ず1つ目に高血圧症が挙げられます。
ノルバスクによって血管を拡張させることで、血圧が下がるため高血圧症治療薬として使用されています。
降圧作用が非常に高く、高血圧症における薬物治療の治療の主目的である降圧目標を達成するには手っ取り早い薬であるため高血圧症治療には最も使用されている薬の1つです。
ま た2つ目の適応症として狭心症が挙げられます。
狭心症は心臓の機能を支える心筋に血液を供給する血管である冠状動脈内部が何らかの原因によって狭窄することで、血液の通り道が細くなり、血液供給が不十分となり、胸の痛み、息切れなどの症状を引き起こす疾患です。
これが悪化して冠状動脈が完全に閉塞してしまうと心筋梗塞となってしまいます。
ノルバスクは冠状動脈を拡張することによって、血液の通り道を広げ、狭心発作を起こさないようにします。
高血圧症には通常1日量が2.5～5mg、狭心症には5mgが使用されますが、いずれも適宜増減されます。

Can Mormon women wear pants when visiting a temple ?
Can men wear cummerbunds during a marriage ceremony ?
Are vasectomies an appropriate birth control option ?
The answers to these ( no , no , and not really ) and similar questions about Mormon practice and leadership might not seem to be especially secret , but the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints is n't pleased about secret church documents hitting the Internet .
In this case , the cause of the displeasure is the confidential Church Handbook of Instructions , published by Wikileaks on April 16 .
The church is currently trying to get the information pulled down using copyright infringement notices , but Wikileaks does n't respond to such requests .
The church has turned instead to targeting other sites that host or link the handbook .
Scribd , a sort of " YouTube for documents , " has already taken down a copy of the material after receiving a copyright infringement notice from the Intellectual Property Division of the Church ( who knew churches had such divisions ? ) .
The church has also gone after the Wikimedia Foundation , the group that oversees Wikipedia and Wikinews ( it has no connection to Wikileaks ) .
What 's interesting about the takedown request is that the Wikimedia Foundation did not actually host or even cite the material in question ; a Wikinews article published on April 19 simply mentioned the existence of the handbooks at Wikileaks and provided a link to it .
In response , Wikimedia also received a copyright infringement notice from Intellectual Reserve , the church 's IP division .
The link was subsequently removed .
The Mormons clearly " get " the Internet in some sense ( you can chat online with a missionary , for instance ) , but they appear determined to follow in the footsteps of groups like Bank Julius Baer that have managed to draw widespread attention to confidential documents without managing to have them removed from Wikileaks .
Given that any such removal will be tough going , it seems strange to highlight the issue by going after a Wikinews post , for instance .
But the Mormons are n't the only religious group targeting Wikileaks .
The site has already amassed an impressive track record when it comes to irritating powerful and litigious groups , so it was really just a matter of time before Scientology got involved .
That happened back in March , when the group 's lawyers demanded that Wikileaks remove a set of " Operating Thetan " documents .
A quick look through the trove shows why ; the documents are bizarre , and include large chunks of handwritten material by founder L. Ron Hubbard ( " Incident 1 occurred about 4 quadrillion years ago + or -.
It is very much earlier than Inc. 2 , which occurred only 75,000,000 years ago ( a bit less ) .
Incident 2 is only peculiar and general on the planet and nearby stars , whereas Incident 1 is to be found on all Thetans . " ) .
The documents also discuss dealing with things like " Theetie Weetie cases . "
In a press release issued on April 7 , Wikileaks was defiant , saying that " we have come to the conclusion that Scientology is not only an abusive cult , but that it aids and abets a general climate of Western media self - censorship .
If the west [ sic ] can not defend its cultural values of free speech and press freedoms against a criminal cult like Scientology , it can hardly lecture China and other state abusers of these same values . "
When even judges recognize that restraining orders against Wikileaks are failures , we might expect that groups would simply let such leaks alone and not call any more attention to them than necessary .
That 's clearly not the case , however , so we might soon learn whether religious power can succeed where Swiss bankers have failed .

The commandment to " be fruitful and multiply " the Krishevsky family follows quite closely .
Last Saturday , the great grandmother , Rachel Krishevsky passed away at the age of 99 , leaving behind no less than 1,400 children , grandchildren , great - grandchildren , and even great - great - grandchildren .
Krishevsky got married to her cousin , Yitzhak , just before turning 19 .
The couple brought seven sons and four daughters into the world .
In accordance with haredi custom , Krishevsky brought up her children to see children as a great joy .
Her children subsequently adopted her outlook and produced 150 children of their own .
These 150 children continued the commitment to be fruitful and multiply and themselves had no less than 1,000 children .
From here , the lineage continued even further , and Rachel Krishevsky was blessed with a few hundred great - great - grandchildren .
Rachel Krishevsky died on Saturday surrounded by loving descendents .
Due to their great numbers , the family is not quite clear on precisely how many descendents there are .
" The estimate in the family is that we are about 1,400 people since almost all of those from the family line were blessed with many children , " said one of the grandchildren Wednesday .
Though she lived a full and long life , the family is saddened by Rachel 's passing .
Krishevsky lived nearly her whole live next to Jerusalem 's Mahane Yehuda open - air market .
" Grandma was a God- fearing woman her whole life , and her door was always open to the homeless and poor near the market who were looking for a place to eat , " added the grandchild .
" She knew the entire book of Psalms by heart , and participated in all the family events , happy and sad , up until two years ago .
She knew all of her descendents .
We are sad about her death , but proud of what she achieved in her life and her righteousness and compassion . "
Though Krishevsky certainly produced many offspring , she did was not a record - breaker .
In the haredi sector , there are two well - known cases of living people having great - great - great - grandchildren .
One such case is in a Hassidic family living in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Mea Shearim .
Another such family is that of Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv , the leader of the Lithuanian branch of haredi Judaism .
A few months ago , his great - great - grandson had his first child .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Google Inc.'s report to the Federal Communications Commission that it was Apple Inc. that rejected its Google Voice application from the popular iPhone 's app store is at odds with Apple 's version of events .
With Google 's GOOG , +0.01 % permission , the FCC posted online a formerly confidential letter from the company stating that , " Apple 's representatives informed Google that the Google Voice application was rejected because Apple believed the application duplicated the core dialer functionality of the iPhone . "
The letter was made public Friday .
Read a copy of the letter
Google notes in the letter that Phil Schiller , Apple 's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing , informed Google executive Alan Eustace " that Apple was rejecting the Google Voice application " during a phone conversation July 7 .
Google 's Washington Telecom and Media Counsel Richard
Whitt said in an online posting that the Mountain View , Calif . - based company opted to disclose the letter after Apple AAPL , +1.50 % disclosed its own response to an FCC inquiry on the matter .
However , in Apple 's version sent to the FCC , it stated that " contrary to published reports , Apple has not rejected the Google Voice application , and continues to study it . "
Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris said in a statement that , " We do not agree with all of the statements made by Google in their FCC letter .
Apple has not rejected the Google Voice application and we continue to discuss it with Google . "
Google Voice is an application that enables users to connect all of their mobile and land line numbers and messaging in a centralized hub .
When news of the application 's rejection from the iPhone app store surfaced , initial speculation on who might have been behind the decision shifted to AT&T Inc. T , +0.74 % , the exclusive U.S. carrier for the device .
That 's because the Google Voice application could in some respects present a competing service to AT&T .
See related story .
The FCC , which has taken on a more active role under the Obama administration , intervened by sending queries to all three companies about why the application was rejected .
" In light of pending FCC proceedings regarding wireless open access and handset exclusivity , we are interested in a more complete understanding of this situation , " the FCC wrote in letters sent to the companies .
When they try to take on the subject things get awkward , at best .
At worst , you get something that leaves you shaking your head , while staring quietly at the wall for several hours .

5 Superman's Sex Tape
So why is Superman whoring himself in front of the cameras ?
Does he need money to pay for the Fortress of Solitude ?
No , it 's all because of this guy here .

The guy , who looks like Slimer from Ghostbusters dressed up like Indiana Jones for Halloween , is named Sleez .
Using whatever the hell powers allow you to do such a thing , he brainwashed two superheroes into his control , Big Barda and freaking Superman .
So , did he send both heroes out to steal all the gold in the world ?
Kill all the other superheroes and take over the universe ?
Nope , he wanted them do a porno flick , and film it .
Which , we have to admit , is the same thing we would do .
Sleez , by the way , is a member of the New Gods space pantheon and was Darkseid 's best pal in the whole world .
But while Darkseid had the cool position of god of evil , Sleez was the god of porn .
Darkseid became embarrassed of being seen with the guy and kicked him out .

Get the hell out , and take your stupid stripper 's pole with you !
It gets weirder .
After Sleez has shot his Superman / Barda porn movie , Darkseid finds himself a copy because he has agents on Earth whose only job is to find new porn in specialized stores for him .
This is not a joke -- or at least not our joke -- this is actually in the story .
So there he was , watching his Earthling porn when he suddenly sees Big Barda getting her freak on .
Barda , by the way , is married to another superhero , Mr. Miracle .
So Darkseid does the most evil , supervillian thing he can think to do : Show Mr. Miracle the tape of his wife getting what is surely the best sex of her life from Superman .

Of course you do n't tell him what 's on the tape , you just make him watch it .
You truly are the god of evil , Darkseid .
Mr. Miracle , Barda 's husband , quickly finds Sleez 's movie studio and stops his wife and Superman from showing up on Porntube .
Sleez tries to escape through the sewers but Superman follows him .
Faced with a life behind bars and without porn , he decides to end it all .
He lights a match and the concentrated gases in the sewer make this story end just the way it ran , as a massive explosion of shit .
Only seriously ill and vulnerable patients should be prescribed antiviral drugs to help them to get over swine flu , the World Health Organisation said yesterday , in advice which conflicts with the decision taken by the British Government to prescribe Tamiflu to everyone with swine flu .
Most people will recover from swine flu within a week , just as they would from seasonal forms of influenza , the WHO said .
" Healthy patients with uncomplicated illness need not be treated with antivirals , " the WHO concluded in guidance issued on the internet .
" Worldwide , most patients infected with the pandemic virus continue to experience typical influenza symptoms and fully recover within a week , even without any form of medical treatment . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Swine flu , now present in 177 countries , has been blamed for 1,799 deaths , and it is feared that over -use of Tamiflu will lead to the virus becoming resistant to it .
The WHO has been formally notified of 12 cases where the H1N1 virus has already been found to have developed resistance after mutating .
The WHO issued its advice after a panel of international experts reviewed the effectiveness and safety of antivirals in tackling the pandemic .
It agreed , however , that antivirals are appropriate in cases where patients suffer a severe bout of swine flu or have an underlying medical condition .
In these cases the drugs have proved effective at reducing the risk of pneumonia setting in .
The Department of Health responded to the WHO guidance by saying that the decision to offer Tamiflu remained right and sensible .
" We believe a safety - first approach of offering antivirals , when required , to everyone remains a sensible and responsible way forward .
However , we will keep this policy under review as we learn more about the virus and its effects , " a spokesman said .
Andrew Lansley , the shadow Health Secretary , has backed the Government 's approach , especially in the early stages of the outbreak when the severity of the disease was unclear .
He added : " In the light of this latest expert advice , it may be appropriate for GPs and the fluline to make clear to otherwise healthy patients that there may be little benefit in taking anti-virals .
But I do not think it would be appropriate for us to not offer treatment to those who request it . "
The number of courses of antivirals issued in England by the National Pandemic Flu Service has almost halved since the beginning of the month .
In the seven days up to 18 August there were 45,986 courses prescribed , compared to 90,363 the previous week .
Last week there were 11,000 new cases of swine flu reported , down from 25,000 the week before .
In its advice the WHO included pregnant women as one of the at - risk groups that should continue to receive antivirals .
" As pregnant women are included among groups at increased risk , WHO recommends that pregnant women receive antiviral treatment as soon as possible after symptom onset , " it said .
The WHO recommended that children under five be regarded as being a high - risk group and should therefore be treated with antivirals as soon as possible once symptoms began .
Children over five years , however , should only be given the drugs if their condition becomes serious or if they have an underlying health problem .
Earlier this month a team of researchers from Oxford University said children with mild symptoms should not be given the antiviral to combat swine flu and urged the Department of Health to urgently rethink its policy .

Galactic Dark Matter Modeled
I do n’t spend too much time worrying about the ultimate fate of the Earth as it interacts with a swollen red Sun some five billion years from now .
My thought is that if any civilization is still on the planet in a billion years , it will have long since worked out how to exit when necessary ( and it will be necessary a lot sooner than five billion years ! ) , or maybe how to tweak planetary orbits to preserve our planet , if only as a choice historical site .
Still less do I worry about the Milky Way being destroyed by a collision with one or more satellite galaxies , like the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds that move around the parent galaxy .
So when I read that an Ohio State team led by Stelios Kazantzidis had shown via computer simulations that such a collision would leave the galaxy more or less intact , my real interest was in the implications of this work in terms of one of science ’s great mysteries — the nature of dark matter .
Have a look at the team ’s modeling of the dark matter structure thought to surround galaxies like ours .
Image :
This image from a supercomputer simulation shows the density of dark matter in our Milky Way galaxy which is known to contain an ancient thin disk of stars .
Brightness ( blue - to - violet - to - red - to - yellow ) corresponds to increasing concentration of dark matter .
The bright central region corresponds roughly to the Milky Way ’s luminous matter of gas and stars and the bright clumps indicate dark - matter satellites orbiting our Milky Way galaxy which are known as “ substructure ” .
The simulation predicts that the dark - matter halos of spiral galaxies are lumpy , filled with hundreds of dark matter substructures that pass through the stellar disks of galaxies , leaving their imprint and disturbing them in the process .
Credit : Stelios Kazantzidis , Ohio State University .
If galaxies are embedded within huge haloes of dark matter ( the Milky Way ’s halo is thought to be a million light years across , or ten times larger than the 100,000 light year width of the galaxy ) , then a filamentary model of dark matter running throughout the universe emerges , with the larger galaxies at the intersection of dark matter filaments .
As this Ohio State news release suggests , satellite galaxies like the Magellanics would move along the strands of this web , gradually drawn into orbit around the larger galaxies .
Kazantzidis ’ team ran computer simulations of galaxy formation to study this model , setting up collisions between satellite galaxies ( and their associated dark matter ) and the larger spiral galaxy .
During the collision , the dark matter interacts gravitationally with the spiral galaxy .
The result :
The satellites pass through the galactic disk again and again , losing mass each time .
The effect of their gradual dissolution is that the primary galaxy shows a distinctive signature that is consistent with observation .
Says Kazantzidis :
“ We ca n’t know for sure what ’s going to happen to the Milky Way , but we can say that our findings apply to a broad class of galaxies similar to our own .
Our simulations showed that the satellite galaxy impacts do n’t destroy spiral galaxies — they actually drive their evolution , by producing this flared shape and creating stellar rings — spectacular rings of stars that we ’ve seen in many spiral galaxies in the universe . ”
The next figure shows the formation of this unique flared shape :
Image : Density maps of disk stars illustrating the global morphological transformation of a galactic disk subject to bombardment by dark matter substructures .
Brighter colors indicate regions of higher density of disk stars .
The left panel shows the initial disk , while the right panel depicts the final disk after the violent gravitational encounters with the orbiting substructures .
The edge - on ( upper panels ) and face - on ( bottom panels ) views of the disk are displayed in each frame .
Satellite - disk interactions of the kind expected in the currently favored cosmological model produce several distinctive signatures in galactic disks including : long - lived , low - density , ring - like features in the outskirts ; conspicuous flares ; bars ; and faint filamentary structures above the disk plane that resemble tidal streams .
These morphological features are similar to those being discovered in the Milky Way , the Andromeda galaxy , and in other spiral galaxies .
Credit : Stelios Kazantzidis , Ohio State University .
So we have what Kazantzidis calls ‘ a wealth of signatures ’ that are both consistent with the current cosmological model ( including dark matter ) and consistent with observations of other galaxies .
The flared edges of the above image , in which a disk that is narrow at the center widens toward the edges , are such a signature .
The latest report on this work is in Kazantzidis et al. , “ Cold Dark Matter Substructure and Galactic Disks .

A preprint is also available .
Andrew Sullivan , after being caught possessing marijuana in a national park , got the charges dropped while similar cases were prosecuted .
The judge is not happy :
In the Court ’s view , in seeking leave to dismiss the charge against Mr. Sullivan , the United States Attorney is not being faithful to a cardinal principle of our legal system , i.e. , that all persons stand equal before the law and are to be treated equally in a court of justice once judicial processes are invoked .
It is quite apparent that Mr. Sullivan is being treated differently from others who have been charged with the same crime in similar circumstances .
If there were a legitimate reason for the disparate treatment , the Court would view the matter differently .
But the United States Attorney refused to allow the Court to inquire into why , in the circumstances of this case where Mr. Sullivan had already been charged with the crime , either a forfeiture of collateral or an adjudication would make a difference in the immigration application .
But there is more .
If , in fact , a determination that Mr. Sullivan had possessed marijuana is a factor which , under immigration law , the immigration authorities are legally charged with taking into account when deciding Mr. Sullivan ’s application , why should the United States Attorney make a judgment that , despite the immigration law , the charge should be dismissed because it would “ adversely affect ” his application ?
If other applicants for a certain immigration status have had their applications “ adversely affected ” by a conviction or a forfeiture of collateral for possession of marijuana , then why should Mr. Sullivan , who is in the same position , not have to deal with the same consequences ?
In short , the Court sees no legitimate reason why Mr. Sullivan should be treated differently , or why the Violation Notice issued to him should be dismissed .
The only reasons given for the dismissal flout the bedrock principle of our legal system that all persons stand equal before the law .
In business , words are like fashion .
You try a word on because important people around you are saying it and getting results , but you may not actually know what it means .
Every group in the company has their own unique set of words and every group uses these words to verbally define who they are , what they know , and what they own .
These words , these phrases , have value when everyone is in agreement as to what they mean , but used outside of your part of the organization , their value decreases , especially the closer you get to engineering .
The engineering burden is that when it comes to the product , we know how it works .
Everyone else outside of engineering has vastly less working knowledge of the product ; they do n’t need that depth for their job .
The engineers know the intricate details of the system , the people who built it , and what it is capable of .
This is why , when fashionable words show up in our day , we grind our teeth .
We ’re cynical because we do n’t trust fashionable words .
They sound important , but over the years we ’ve found they obfuscate our product ’s capabilities , they portray our development process as trivial , and they create productivity destroying expectations elsewhere in the building .
I ’m guilty of using these words .
I ’ve written about them before , but they still stand out in my day .

Cutting edge fashion looks freakish to me .
When I see a model walking down the runway wearing a black and white geometric monstrosity , I wonder , “ How does anyone make money doing this ? ”
These are n’t the designs that end up in your local department stores .
They ’ve traveled through many different designers who have watered them down and made them palatable versions of the cutting edge .
New ideas , like fashion , have to start somewhere .
When Jordan in Marketing lays down an energetic thirty minutes of incomprehensible marketing buzz - speak , I take a deep breath and attempt to hear his enthusiasm rather than his seemingly meaningless words .
I remind myself of the time I walked to his office and threw down twenty minutes of arcane engineering reality and he gave me the benefit of the doubt .
He clarified and we found a comfortable place to communicate .
During the IETF 75 meeting in Stockholm , there was this multipath tcp BOF ( “ start - up meeting ” sort of ) on Thursday morning that I visited .
Multipath TCP ( shortened to MPTCP at times ) is basically an idea to make everything look like TCP for both end points , but allow for additional TCP paths to get added and allow packets to get routed over any of the added flows to overcome congestion and to select the routes where it flows “ best ” .
The socket API would remain unmodified in both ends .
The individual TCP paths would all look and work like regular TCP streams for the rest of the network .
It is basically a way to introduce these new fancy features without breaking compatibility .
Of course a big point of that is to keep functionality over NATs or other middle - boxes .
( See full description . )
The guys holding the BOF had already presented a fairly detailed draft how it could be designed both one - ended and with multiple adresses , Â but could also boast with an already written implementation that was even demoed live in front of the audience .
The term ‘ path ’ is basically used for a pair of address + port sets .
I would personally rather call it “ flow ” or “ stream ” or something , as we cannot really control that the paths are separate from each other as those are entirely in the hands of those who route the IP packets to the destination .
They stressed that their goals here included :
perform no worse than TCP would on the best of the single TCP paths
be no harder on the network than a single TCP flow would be , not even for single bottlenecks ( network and bottleneck fairness )
allow resource pooling over multiple TCP paths
A perfect use - case for this is hosts with multiple interfaces .
Like a mobile phone with 3G and wifi , as it could have a single TCP connection using paths over both interfaces , and it could even change paths along the way when you move to handover to new wifi access - points or when you plug in your Ethernet cable or whatever .
Kind of like a solution to the mobile ip concept with roaming that was never made to actually work in the past .
The multipath tcp mailinglist is already quite active , and it did n’t take long until possible flaws in the backwards compatibility have been discovered and are being discussed .
Like if you use TCP to verify that a particular link is alive , MPTCP may in fact break that as the proposal is currently written .
What struck me as an interesting side - effect of this concept , is that if implemented it will separate packets from the same original stream further from each other and possibly make snooping on plain - text TCP traffic harder .
Like in the case where you monitor traffic going through a router or similar .
This is brilliant !
Imagine crunching your desk , chair and laptop bag all into one small thing .
This is the Openaire .
It is a hybrid of a laptop carrying case , work surface , and chair and consists of a semi- rigid protective sleeve designed as an ergonomic laptop work surface and a protective shell that also functions as a comfortable seat .
In other words , it does n’t matter if you do n’t have a table to place your mouse , this one has .
It does n’t matter if you have no place to sit , just remove the laptop cover , extend it and sit !
And ofcourse once you are done , just fold it up and slide in your laptop !
How exciting !

Bjarne Stroustrup designed and implemented the C++ programming language .
He can be contacted here .
At the July 2009 meeting in Frankfurt , Germany , the C++ Standards Committee voted to remove " concepts " from C++0 x .
Although this was a big disappointment for those of us who have worked on concepts for years and are aware of their potential , the removal fortunately will not directly affect most C++ programmers .
C++0 x will still be a significantly more expressive and effective language for real - world software development than C++98 .
The committee acted with the intent to limit risk and preserve schedule .
Maybe a significantly improved version of " concepts " will be available in five years .
This note explains the reasons for the removal of " concepts , " briefly outlines the controversy and fears that caused the committee to decide the way it did , gives references for people who would like to explore " concepts , " and points out that ( despite enthusiastic rumors to the contrary ) " the sky is not falling " on C ++.
No " Concepts " in C++0x
At the July 2009 Frankfurt meeting of the ISO C++ Standards Committee ( WG21 ) , the " concepts " mechanism for specifying requirements for template arguments was " decoupled " ( my less - diplomatic phrase was " yanked out " ) .
That is , " concepts " will not be in C++0 x or its standard library .
That -- in my opinion -- is a major setback for C++ , but not a disaster ; and some alternatives were even worse .
I have worked on " concepts " for more than seven years and looked at the problems they aim to solve much longer than that .
Many have worked on " concepts " for almost as long .
For example , see ( listed in chronological order ) :
It need not be emphasized that I and others are quite disappointed .
The fact that some alternatives are worse is cold comfort and I can offer no quick and easy remedies .
Please note that the C++0 x improvements to the C++ features that most programmers see and directly use are unaffected .
C++0 x will still be a more expressive language than C++98 , with support for concurrent programming , a better standard library , and many improvements that make it significantly easier to write good ( i.e. , efficient and maintainable ) code .
In particular , every example I have ever given of C++0 x code ( e.g. , in Evolving a language in and for the real world : C++ 1991 -2006 at ACM HOPL - III ) that does not use the keywords " concept " or " requires " is unaffected .
See also my C++0x FAQ .
Some people even rejoice that C++0 x will now be a simpler language than they had expected .
" Concepts " were to have been the central new feature in C++0 x for putting the use of templates on a better theoretical basis , for firming - up the specification of the standard library , and a central part of the drive to make generic programming more accessible for mainstream use .
For now , people will have to use " concepts " without direct language support as a design technique .
My best scenario for the future is that we get something better than the current " concept " design into C++ in about five years .
Getting that will take some serious focused work by several people ( but not " design by committee " ) .
on the financial woes gripping the owners of StuyTown and Peter Cooper Village is filled with insider analysis that makes our eyes glaze over , such as , " At Stuyvesant Town , there is a $ 3 billion first mortgage , or commercial mortgage - backed security , and a $ 1.4 billion second loan , known as “ mezzanine debt ” held by SL Green , the government of Singapore and others . "
But the bottom line is easy enough to grasp ; as one analyst puts it , " I ’d say their equity has been wiped out , given the decline in apartment values . "
The city 's housing commission , among others , believes Tishman Speyer , which controversially acquired the properties for $ 5.4 billion three years ago , is at high risk of default on some $ 4.4 billion in loans .
Sources say the company only has enough juice to hold on until February , and even co-CEO Rob Speyer admits " the asset is going to require a restructuring .
Once the court case is resolved , we ’ll speak to our debt holders as well as our fellow equity investors . "
In March the state appeals court ruled that developer Tishman Speyer had wrongfully raised rents and deregulated thousands of apartments after receiving special tax breaks ; the decision is being appealed , but if upheld , the market - rate tenants could seek treble damages , costing Tishman Speyers and parteners more than $ 200 million .
( A ruling is expected as soon as tomorrow . )
Naturally , the whole mess has tenants uneasy ; Daniel R. Garodnick , a city councilman who lives in Peter Cooper Village , says , " Residents are increasingly concerned that the maintenance of the buildings is slipping , even as they are getting hit with a flurry of potential charges for major capital improvements . "
And a recent report from Realpoint , a credit rating agency , estimates that the property has a value today of only $ 2.13 billion , suggesting $ 1.9 billion in equity has gone down the drain .
Rafael E. Cestero , the city ’s housing commissioner , tells the Times , " We are absolutely keeping an eye on it .
It ’s an iconic complex .
We ’re not doing this to bail out anybody who was part of the original transaction .
Those folks are going to take their lumps .
We are looking at how we can ensure that the rent - stabilized units and the families that live there and families that could live there in the future could be insulated from the unwinding of this deal . "
Diarmuid Makes Me Touch Myself NSFW

My friend Diarmuid does n't have a girlfriend and he 's a bit down about it .
So I filmed some willing girls , saying he makes them ' touch themselves . '

" xenophobia sucks "
see how many of the joys of life you miss out on , when you allow yourself to be wilfully blinded by lazy , narrow , prejudice .
most everyone else saw , understood and enjoyed the joke , and the willing participation thereof ; you only saw an excuse for xenophobic name - calling .
an opportunity to use this as an object lesson , what you tried to do here , and ultimately how silly you ended up looking .
what else do you think you might be missing out on day - to - day , when your first resort is always to this sort of cheap , tired - out , collectivist tribalism .
me , i'm not sure the trade - off , that rush you get from subsuming yourself in the mob , and indulging in the toxic " notion of the other " , is worth what you lose of your humanity and common decency .

The major new health - care overhaul bill that landed in the Senate on Wednesday sets the lines for a fall showdown over taxes , spending and coverage for millions of uninsured Americans .
The bill , by Sen . Max Baucus , chairman of the Finance Committee , breaks a logjam and is likely to form the core of a bill in the full Senate .
The biggest beneficiaries ...
It was surreal .
Throughout the financial media , commentators and analysts appeared at a loss for words Thursday to identify potential catalysts for the abrupt surge in gold and silver prices .
The equity markets felt calm , the dollar 's value against foreign currencies was not tanking , and the bond markets offered nary a clue .
Gold was the hot topic of the day , but insightful discussion remained remarkably absent .
I generally consider it a trap to ascribe daily market oscillations to specific causal factors , but when a clear technical breakout carries even large - cap mining shares like Newmont Mining ( NYSE : NEM ) to double - digit percentage gains , the discussion must dig deeper than the momentum - buying and short - covering explanations that dominated the airwaves .
Gold had indeed been primed for a technical breakout , as I pointed out in an article drafted before the move began .
However , a long list of fundamental drivers supporting higher gold and silver prices leads this Fool to conclude that the move will have some legs .
In no particular order , here are some of the more recent fundamental catalysts I 've identified :
In a move that Western media sources have failed to cover adequately , the agency responsible for oversight of China 's state - owned enterprises ( SOEs ) recently warned foreign financial institutions that SOEs will be permitted to walk away unilaterally from failed OTC derivative hedge contracts .
China will purchase up to $ 50 billion in Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) from the International Monetary Fund .
Fools will recall that China has explicitly called for replacing the U.S. dollar as the world 's reserve currency in favor of these SDRs .
Russia and India have likewise indicated an interest purchasing SDR - denominated IMF bonds .
China 's ramped - up dealmaking activity for resource - related assets around the globe reflects an official policy directive .
Recent loans or investments by Chinese entities relating to foreign resource assets are themselves nearing the $ 50 billion mark .
China has indicated that foreign reserves will be deployed in support of this broader initiative , representing another clear diversification away from U.S. dollar exposure .
The Democratic Party of Japan emerged as the clear victor in last week 's election , ending a 15 - year reign of the Liberal Democratic Party .
Fools will recall that the Democratic Party of Japan 's finance chief advised his nation last May to cease purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds unless those bonds are denominated in yen .
China is considering a ban on rare - metal exports .
More than 95 % of the world 's supply of rare - earth minerals comes from China , so the move places global manufacturers of everything from hybrid cars to cell phones in a difficult position .
China is also the world 's leading producer of gold , and this move raises this Fool 's eyebrow as a precedent for China 's restricting exports of key strategic resources .
China is actively encouraging its 1.3 billion citizens to invest in precious metals .
I have viewed excerpts from state television touting the extraordinary relative value of silver to gold given the large deviation from the historical ratio between prices of the two metals .
Because gold and silver are surprisingly small physical markets , even a minor uptick in investment demand could fuel sizeable price increases .
Hong Kong is repatriating its physical gold reserves from London to high - security vaults at home , and it is inviting the region 's central banks to store their bullion there .
Announced just this week , the move deals a significant blow to London 's historical role as a global hub in the precious metals market , and it raises the specter of a potential price - settlement hub in Asia to rival the New York and London daily spot - price fixes .
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is also targeting a new gold bullion ETF using the new vault as a repository , which would remove yet more physical supply from the market .
The SPDR Gold Shares ( NYSE : GLD ) reports holding 1,078 tonnes of gold , slightly more than China 's last - reported gold reserves .
It 's no coincidence that all of the above developments -- which can be considered potential near - term catalysts boosting the strength of this breakout in gold and silver -- hail from Asia .
This Fool has observed China , which holds more dollar - denominated debt than any other nation , steadily ramping up both its rhetoric and its actions in a clear vote of no confidence in the greenback .
I view an end to this 18 - month correction in precious metals as imminent , and I concur with the likes of Jim Rogers that the dollar remains between a rock and a hard place .
Where to invest
If you lend credence to these and other fundamental factors supporting a continuation of the eight - year bull market in precious metals , then you 'll want at least some investment exposure to gold or silver .
With commercial production at the world - class Penasquito mine slated for early 2010 , I consider Goldcorp ( NYSE : GG ) the best - positioned of the large - cap miners .
I also find it interesting that shares of Yamana Gold ( NYSE : AUY ) , which trade around $ 10.50 now , fetched $ 19 before the correction took hold in March 2008 , as the company has only strengthened in the meantime .
Golden Star Resources ( AMEX : GSS ) is just one of many promising junior miners that have broken out impressively this week .
For silver , I continue to highlight Silver Wheaton ( NYSE : SLW ) for its fixed , low - cost business model .
Coeur d'Alene Mines ( NYSE : CDE ) is enjoying quite a resurgence as two huge mines rake in the cash flow .
As this bull market for precious metals roars onward , stay tuned for additional Foolish coverage .
It ’s great to be right .
It ’s Sunday , a good day to gloat about how I was right and everyone else who gets paid serious money was a fucking idiot .
The Financial Crisis that everyone claims they could n’t possibly see coming ?
I saw it coming , two years before the collapse–all the way from Moscow .
And so I just want to tell all of you lying brainwashed dickheads out there : I toldja so !
Yup , that ’s right : in 2006 , two years before the financial collapse , I wrote a big piece in The eXile headlined “ Why You ’re Fucked : FINANCIAL CRISIS II : ANOTHER SEQUEL ” predicting that the out - of - control credit bubble would explode and tank the financial system .
I ’m excerpting it below so that you can all worship me , .
I believe the word is “ prescience ” ?
And while we ’re on the subject , just wanted to remind everyone of the last “ who coulda see it coming ? ” financial collapse that I predicted before anyone else : Russia ’s 1998 financial crash .
I got it right in 1998 …
Okay , now I can hear you asking through gritted teeth , “ But if you ’re so smart , Ames , why ai n’t you rich ? ”
Good question .
I ask myself that about 150 times a day , and one of the best answers I can come up with is , “ Whoever said that there ’s a relationship between smarts and wealth ? ”
Maybe if my family wealth came from taxpayer handouts like Megan McArdle ’s , I ’d be a rich man today .
Or if I was born into a filthy rich family .
Inherited wealth , and welfare - for - the - rich seem to be the only paths to riches in this country .
Butcha can’t take my gloat away , by gum !
… And I was right about 2008 , which I called in 2006 .
Ha - ha - frickin-ha !
So , getting back to my Sunday gloat : ahem …let me clear my throat here …
I WAS FUCKING RIGHT !
Yeah , I may be poor , but I ’m not a braindead idiot like the rest of you .
And while I did n’t get rich off being so smart , I also did n’t sacrifice my healthy years accumulating capital , only to see the whole thing vanish before my eyes .
While you were slaving away in a miserable job , I was living in my body the way God intended : fucking , snorting , and basking in the kind of cult - celebrity glory you fools only dream about .
And while your savings vanish and your housing values collapse , the investment I made into being more right than you is something that pays dividends forever .
So now I ’m going to cash out a few shares of my “ I ’M RIGHT AND YOU’RE NOT ” investment –behold my gloat , for your eyes and everyone else ’s , and not only .
Here is an abridged version of my exile article from June 16 , 2006 :

Why You ’re Fucked
FINANCIAL CRISIS II : ANOTHER SEQUEL
by Mark Ames
Could we be on the verge of another financial catastrophe ?
I ’ll admit it : I ’m hopeful .
First , because I ’m poor and spiteful , and secondly , because one of the nice things about financial collapses ( like military disasters ) is that all the ugly , corrupt realities underpinning a so - called economic boom are revealed , and the worst in humanity is laid bare , and everyone everywhere gets pissed off , cynical , and hopeless .
That ’s the kind of thing that boosts my mood , not to mention my sexual drive .
Financial panics are to me what endangered mammal horns are to Chinese men : pure Viagra placebo .
…
In retrospect , the financial crises that ripped through emerging markets in the late 1990s appear inevitable and obvious .
So does the bursting of the NASDAQ / dot - com bubble in 2000 .
But right up to the day of the Asian / Russian collapses , no one expected them , and no one understood them , because the circumstances , and in particular the terminology , had not yet been incorporated into popular financial - crisis discourse .
So what is happening globally this time ?
What ’s the word that everyone ’s going to “ get ” this time around , just as the last time around words like “ debt burden ” went from being vague economics terms to obvious explanations for why those markets collapsed .
Last time it was a debt bubble .
This time it ’s a credit bubble .
( italicized bold in original–MA )
What that means is that since 2000 - 1 , when the US markets crashed and the economy headed into a recession , the US Central Bank pumped shitloads of money ( liquidity ) via ridiculously low interest rates .
This meant that people had not so much “ more money ” as “ easy - to - access ” money which they used to buy houses .
All that easy money meant housing prices soared for five years straight , to levels unprecedented when compared to the average Joe ’s stagnating income .
However , all the Joes who owned houses saw their asset prices soar , much like those who held NASDAQ stocks in the 90s saw their stock portfolios soar , and that meant more money to spend on everything from plasma TVs to hybrid SUVs , liposuctions surgeries and everything else sold on credit .
The US government worked the same voodoo on its budget — massively increasing spending while at the same time cutting tax revenues .
In other words , offering easy , free money to itself .
This easy money , and easy credit , is even easier in other parts of the world .
China has seen its money supply grow 20 % over the last year , and credit growth has soared 30 % in India .
The same has been happening in Europe , Japan , and of course Russia , where Russians are offered easy loans to “ purchase ” everything from vacations in Turkey to crap apartments in podmoskovie .
While in the last crisis , emerging market economies like Russia were forced to issue bonds at increasingly high interest rates in order to finance other high - interest - rate bonds they could n’t pay off , this time around , thanks to all the easy money and the weak dollar , yields on emerging market bonds are illogically low , approaching developed economy bond yields .
Meantime , junk bonds issuance is at its highest rate since the 1999 speculative peak .
Mergers and acquisitions are bursting all records .
Much of this is financed by debt , and all kinds of popular , profitable debt schemes like repos , credit swaps , and all sorts of “ esoteric ” debt products and instruments .
Central bank reserves in Russia are approaching an insane $ 240 billion , while China ’s $ 880 billion now exceeds Japan’s .
More and more money is being pumped , inflating prices on any piece of crap asset , from Brazilian bonds to partly - built Moscow panel apartment blocks .
Just as record low interest rates in the US led to unprecedented rises in housing prices , year after year , all this easy money is leading to massive price rises in commodities .
Copper has doubled just this year alone .
Oil — everyone here knows what ’s happened .
In Moscow and elsewhere in Russia , housing prices have soared every year since 1999 , including 45 % in Moscow just this year alone .
The stock market also boomed 50 % before falling .
This is the bubble .
Easy credit swells prices to ridiculous heights .
The credit - issuance bubble is untenable .
And now it ’s starting to pop .
And what ’s making it pop is an ever - so - slight pullback from five years of reckless easy money in the US , where it all started — in the form of today ’s higher US Federal Reserve interest rates .
Even though they ’ve raised rates 16 times , they ’re set to continue raising rates because inflation is still rising , and the dollar is still weak .
The catch is that inflation is rising because of the easy credit .
If the credit ’s cut off , inflation will slow , but the bubble will pop and take the whole thing crashing down .
If credit remains easy , inflation will continue to spin out of control , requiring even more credit tightening later and an even bigger bubble burst .
Recent signals that the Fed planned to continue raising rates were the catalyst for this past month ’s credit - bubble pop — and why Russia ’s stock market is tanking .
That ’s because the US still controls , to an incredible degree , international finance .
If US rates keep going up , that means money gets less and less easy .
No one in the financial markets world wants to be the last to the gate .
So they pull out of the speculative markets first — like Russia — and as the bubble burst grows , money retreats to safe places , such as US bonds , which are now returning rates not all that different from Brazilian bonds .
Panic sets in — money follows money , and just as asset inflation becomes irrational , so does asset deflation .
The bottom line is this : the global economy is experiencing one of those insane , untenable imbalances , all emanating from New York and Washington , just like the last time around , most of the effects of which will be felt in Mumbai , Istanbul and Moscow .
As the easy credit dries up in the US , assets that inflated most wildly — like American houses and Russian stocks — are the first to fall .
And both already are .
What ’s happening with emerging market stocks is just a snapshot of what ’s to come .
In just the last month , the stock market selloffs have wiped out $ 2 trillion in wealth around the globe .
That ’s scary , and that means that more money ’s going to be leaving places like Russia .
And just like last time , first it ’s the stocks and bonds that get hit , and eventually , property prices get creamed as more and more money leaves .
How far everything will fall , and for how long , is anyone ’s guess .
All one can do is hope .
And my hope is that the whole fucking house of cards comes crashing down , to the point where in a couple of years from now , humanoids will be roaming barren cities in packs , competing with crows and stray dogs for carcass bones .
Because when that happens , everything , even a nifty three - room apartment in Kitai Gorod , or a humble condo at Zuma Beach in Malibu , will be affordable to a lifelong fuckup like me .
So keep the easy credit rolling , ye greedy finance goons … the higher it rises , the harder it will fall .
And the more for me .

South Africa is the setting for the alien - human confrontation
A film about extra terrestrials by a first - time director and a cast of unknowns has topped the US box office .
District 9 , directed by Neill Blomkamp , took $ 37 m ( £ 22.5 m ) in its opening weekend , displacing GI Joe .
The Time Traveler 's
Wife entered the chart at three , with used car caper The Goods : Live Hard , Sell Hard another new entry at six .
District 9 was produced by Lord of the Rings maker Peter Jackson , and was helped by a strong marketing campaign .
Curiosity
The film , which is about a group of aliens forced to live in a South African ghetto , was advertised with posters on bus stops asking people to report non-humans , and bus stop seats marked for humans only .
According to Rory Bruer , Sony 's head of distribution , the ploy stimulated people 's curiosity .
" It did really pique their interest and drove them to the internet and elsewhere to discover what 's going on , " he said .
US BOX OFFICE TOP FIVE 1 District 9 - $ 37 m 2 GI Joe - $ 22.5 m 3 The Time Traveler 's Wife - $ 19.2 m 4 Julie & Julia - $ 12.4 m 5 G - Force - $ 6.9 m Source : Hollywood.com
Blomkamp , who also co-wrote the movie , previously made music videos and adverts .
District 9's largely unheralded cast includes South Africans Sharlto Copley and Mandala Gaduka .
Another new entry in the chart is animation Ponyo at number nine , from Hayao Miyazaki , who made Spirited Away , winner of the best animated feature Oscar in 2003 .
But teen rock musical Bandslam , featuring High School Musical star Vanessa Hudgens , failed to make a big impression and landed outside the top 10 in its opening weekend .

BEIJING  Chen Shui-bian , the former president of Taiwan who had been on trial since March on corruption charges , was convicted and sentenced to life in prison on Friday by a three - judge panel .
The sentencing was expected , but nonetheless came as a serious blow to the political forces that Mr. Chen had led for decades in opposing the traditional ruling party of Taiwan , the Kuomintang .
Mr. Chen ’s wife , Wu Shu-chen , was also convicted of corruption and sentenced to life in prison .
They were accused , among other things , of stealing and misusing public money from 2000 to 2008 , the time that Mr. Chen was in office .
They were both fined a total of $ 15 million .
Under Taiwanese law , it is mandatory for the trial court to file an appeal in cases involving a life or death sentence , even if the convict chooses not to appeal .
Mr. Chen was the first politician outside the Kuomintang to become president of Taiwan , after he helped create , in the mid-1980s , a pro-democracy movement that opposed martial law and other civil restrictions .
Martial law was lifted in 1987 , and the island ’s first multiparty presidential elections were held in 1996 .
The Obama administration intends to announce an ambitious plan on Thursday to overhaul the much - criticized way the nation detains immigration violators , trying to transform it from a patchwork of jail and prison cells to what its new chief called a “ truly civil detention system . ”
Details are sketchy , and even the first steps will take months or years to complete .
They include reviewing the federal government ’s contracts with more than 350 local jails and private prisons , with an eye toward consolidating many detainees in places more suitable for noncriminals facing deportation  some possibly in centers built and run by the government .
The plan aims to establish more centralized authority over the system , which holds about 400,000 immigration detainees over the course of a year , and more direct oversight of detention centers that have come under fire for mistreatment of detainees and substandard  sometimes fatal  medical care .
One move starts immediately : the government will stop sending families to the T. Don Hutto Residential Center , a former state prison near Austin , Tex. , that drew an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit and scathing news coverage for putting young children behind razor wire .
The scale and openness of the trade , which has seen live donations rise from 15 per cent of transplants in 2006 to 40 per cent last year , makes it clear that the Chinese government will have to fight hard to stamp out a lucrative trade that enriches corrupt doctors , dealers and officials .

Bernanke Sees A Recovery - How Would He Know ?

Just a note - the Hussman Funds Annual Report ( fiscal year ended June 30 , 2009 ) - is now available .
There is an additional link at the end of this weekly comment .
The printed report is currently in press , and will be mailed shortly ( as with corporate earnings releases , audited financial statements for mutual funds tend to lag the closing date of the fiscal period by several weeks ) .
Since some of our shareholders are not regular readers of these comments , those of you who are will see a few themes repeated in my letter to shareholders .
I suspect that my continued skepticism about blue skies ahead is self - evident , but as usual , we 'll take our evidence as it comes , and even here we have a position in index call options ( as something of an " anti-hedge " in the Strategic Growth Fund ) that is now slightly in - the - money .
Do n't miss the Note on Risk and Return in the letter to shareholders , which shares some thoughts I believe are essential to good investing .

" Our forecast is for moderate but positive growth going into next year .
We think that by the spring , early next year , that as these credit problems resolve and , as we hope , the housing market begins to find a bottom , that the broader resiliency of the economy , which we are seeing in other areas outside of housing , will take control and will help the economy recover to a more reasonable growth pace . "
Ben Bernanke , Federal Reserve Chairman
On Friday , investors took great cheer in an optimistic statement by Ben Bernanke suggesting good prospects for economic growth ahead .
We might be inclined to place a sliver of credibility in Chairman Bernanke 's assessment - if not for the fact that the quote above was n't from last week at all , but rather , hails back to November 8 , 2007 , just before the recent recession began .
You might recall that the S&P 500 was pushing 1500 at the time .
The implosion of the global credit markets was still just a slight rumble .
As it happens , that was also the week our recession warning composite shifted clearly into negative territory , prompting the weekly comment Expecting A Recession , where I wrote " On Saturday , the consensus of economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators indicated expectations that growth will be sluggish into next year , but that there will be no recession .
Unfortunately , the economic consensus has never accurately anticipated a recession .
For my part , the outlook has changed .
I expect that a U.S. economic recession is immediately ahead . "
That was followed the next week with Critical Point , which opened with a saying of Rudiger Dornbusch : " The crisis takes a much longer time coming than you think , and then it happens much faster than you would have thought . "
A good economist thoughtfully recognizes " general equilibrium " - resources moved to one place must be taken from somewhere else .
Securities or monetary liabilities , once issued , must be held by someone in the economy until they are retired ( the failure to recognize this is the basis for the " cash on the sidelines " fallacy ) .
Instead , Bernanke 's economic research is a minefield of partial equilibrium analysis .
Helicopter Ben is a lot like John Maynard Keynes , who wrote in his General Theory " If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes , bury them at suitable depths , and leave it to private enterprise on well - tried principles of laissez - faire to dig the notes up again , there need be no more unemployment . "
Solving economic problems , to our Fed Chairman , is as easy as throwing money out of helicopters .
Not surprisingly , throwing money out of helicopters has been the basic core of his strategy during this crisis .
This does not involve complex thought about debt restructuring , moral hazard , incentives , equitable distribution of resources , or other factors .
All it requires is the three second tape playing in Bernanke 's head - " We let the banks fail in the Great Depression , and look what happened . "
And then the tape repeats .
Never mind that the cause of the upheaval was not the failure of banks per se , but the disorganized Lehman - style failure of banks .
The tape is n't long enough to encompass such nuances .
Ben Bernanke ( like Tim Geithner and his predecessor Hank Paulson ) , shows no hesitation in diverting the real resources of the American public to defend and compensate the bondholders of mismanaged financial companies who made reckless loans and who should have ( and equally important , could have ) been expected to write down principal or swap debt for equity as an alternative to receivership .
This is not decisiveness .
It is timidity and poor stewardship .
Worse , the underlying problems are not healed - only band - aided temporarily by a flood of public money .
Unfortunately , the resources used in the recent bailout were not just free money tossed out of a helicopter .
Only a partial - equilibrium economist thinks that way .
No , this was an allocation of trillions of dollars of real resources that could be spent improving access of poor families to health care , finding cures for life - changing diseases , providing better education , and reversing the crowding - out of productive private investment .
A public servant willing to act this carelessly with the resources entrusted to him , and so strongly in defense of fellow bankers , frankly does not deserve the job .
Most likely , we will face the same credit issues a few quarters from now , given that the lull in the adjustable - rate reset schedule is near its end .
We continue to expect a fresh acceleration of credit losses as we enter 2010 .
It would be best if we faced these challenges with more thoughtful leadership .
Meanwhile , Harvard economist Martin Feldstein ( who was the likely alternative for Fed Chairman when Bernanke was appointed ) noted last week " I think we 'll see a positive number in the third quarter , but what will it be driven by ?
Fiscal stimulus , Cash for Clunkers , and some inventory building .
But the question is what happens next - in the fourth quarter and into next year - and I think there 's a real danger of a double dip . "
Elsewhere , Alan Greenspan concurred , saying " We 're OK for the next six months .
We are getting a recovery ... but the process does n't have legs to it . "
A second part of Friday 's enthusiasm , of course , was the sharp jump in the rate at which lenders are realizing losses on failing mortgages .
That , as it happens , is what was behind the sharp jump in the rate of existing home sales .
As John Mauldin recently pointed out , a June survey of 1500 real - estate agents by Mortgage Finance found that only 36 % of all existing home sales involved " non-distressed " properties , and of those , only 31 % were described as unforced or optional , the remainder being sales prompted by personal financial difficulty such as unemployment or changes in family circumstances , but without a delinquent or foreclosed mortgage .
As John wrote , " Think about that for a minute .
Two - thirds of home sales are either foreclosures or banks taking a loss on the mortgage .
And only a third of the remaining one - third - roughly 10 % of overall sales - comes from something we could call a normal selling process . "
Rest easy though .
Bernanke sees a recovery .
Market Climate
As of last week , the Market Climate for stocks was characterized by unfavorable valuations and mixed market action , with strong breadth and major indices generally trending higher , but still tepid sponsorship evident in trading volume and strenuously overbought conditions .
Currently , we estimate that the S&P 500 is priced to deliver average total returns over the coming decade of only about 6.8 % annually .
Presently , about 40 % of our defensive hedge in the Strategic Growth Fund is covered with what are now in - the - money index call options , so we will allow the market to put us in a more constructive position - without removing our existing downside protection - if investors are inclined to carry the market higher on the winds of questionable economic enthusiasm .
The overall " delta " of the Fund is still relatively flat , but will pick up more positive exposure to market fluctuations if the market advances further .
This does mean that we will stand to lose whatever we gain on a decline back down toward current levels , so the call exposure will be profitable only if the market sustains an advance .
Our exposure to index calls is currently just over 1 % of assets , and we are otherwise well - hedged against any serious downside that might emerge .
In bonds , the Market Climate continues to be characterized by relatively neutral yield levels and moderately unfavorable yield pressures .
Yields are generally in the middle portion of what I view as a wide trading range , so we are maintaining our current positions , with an eye toward adding some additional duration exposure on yield spikes above , say , 4 % on the 10 - year Treasury , and clipping off some duration on significant declines in yields .
The Strategic Total Return Fund also holds somewhat less than 20 % of assets in bond alternatives such as foreign currencies , precious metals shares , and utility shares .

Woman who inspired Beatles ' Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds dies aged just 46 after battling disease
Inspiration : Lucy Vodden ( nee O'Donnell ) died after battling lupus , an incurable disease
The woman whose childhood friendship with John Lennon ’s son Julian inspired the song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds has died .
Lucy Vodden , who was recently revealed as the girl behind the 40 - year - old Beatles song , had been battling lupus , an incurable disease of the immune system .
Julian Lennon has said that the track was inspired by a picture he drew of classmate Lucy O’Donnell with star - like shapes when they were at nursery school in the mid-1960s .
The young Julian showed his father the picture and told him it was ‘ Lucy in the sky with diamonds ’ .
Lennon used the phrase as a title for a song he wrote for the album Sgt Pepper ’s Lonely Hearts Club Band , released in 1967 .
Last night Julian and his mother Cynthia
said they were ‘ shocked and saddened ’ by 46 - year - old Mrs Vodden ’s death .
The musician , who lives in France , got back in touch with her six months ago after discovering through mutual friends
that she was chronically ill .
He sent a bouquet with a personally written card and then gave her garden centre vouchers because he had learnt that she took solace in her plants .
Muse : Julian Lennon , pictured with father John and stepmother Yoko Ono , drew a picture of Lucy O'Donnell and took it home
‘ I ’ve been able to help out a bit , ’ he said at the time .
‘ I was so upset to hear what had happened . ’
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds initially caused controversy and was banned by the BBC because of its supposed reference to the drug LSD .
The whereabouts of Julian Lennon ’s childhood painting is uncertain , although at one stage it was in his mother ’s possession .
THIS IS WHY AMERICA IS THE GREATEST PLACE ON EARTH
Yes you see that correctly .

Melon Boats
This is one of those fun recipes which involves the kids in the kitchen .
Summer is offering the bountiful fruits to cool us down .
A trip to the Whole Food market last week made us load our cart with these delightful little cantaloupes they were offering four for a dollar that day .
I have never seen a cantaloupe so little ; abut 3 - 4 inches in diameter , & it was just perfect for this kitchen project .
Every now & then we get a magazine from “ Texas Power ” which promptly goes to the recycle bin .
As I carelessly flipped through the pages before tossing it , I saw this cute colorful pictures of the melons filled with jello & fruits – a summer fruit salad !
The tiny cantaloupes came just in time .
We got busy immediately to make our fruit filled melon boats .
Melon Boats
Ingredients : 1 Melon ( Cantaloupe , Honey Dew or Watermelon ) 2 Small Packets of Flavored Jello ( Use any flavor you would like ; I used Blue & Dark Cherry ) – you would need more / less depending on the size of the melon Chopped Fruits ( any combination of fruits you have in mind – I used peaches & pears along with some of the scooped out cantaloupe )
Note : Keep in mind that some fruits like pineapple & guava will not allow the Jello to set ; so avoid those fruits .
Preparation :
Cut the melon in half .
Remove the seeds & discard ( in a Cantaloupe or Honey Dew ; try to get a seedless Watermelon if you are using one ) .
Scoop out some of the fruit from each half , to make space for the jello & fruit filling while leaving some flesh to bite into .
( See the pictures ) – Save the scooped out melons .
Prepare Jello as per instructions ;
Pour the Jello into the Melon halves .
Chop the fruits including some of the melons you scooped out & stir them in carefully in the liquid jello in the melons .
Chill in the refrigerator till the Jello sets .
Cut into slices / boats .
Serve chilled .
This is an excellent kitchen project to do with kids .
They will be able to help with scooping & mixing the jello & of course the greatest fun comes when the jello sets & they get their own boats .
Any kind of melon can be used for this , & try to choose your jello with contrasting colors for more colorful fun .
Now let us Mingle with the Melons ; Meeta ’s Monlthy Mingle is being hosted at Chew on That .
Sending melon boats to the mingle , the theme being the Marvelous Melons this time .

First of all , I ’ve just released version 0.2.1 of the Haskell diagrams library .
This is a minor release which fixes a few bugs and adds a few new combinators , most notably a grid layout combinator contributed by Ganesh Sittampalam .
For more information and a full list of the features new to 0.2.1 , see the diagrams web page .
The real reason for the release , however , is to get existing new features out the door before gearing up for a planned major rewrite of the backend to use a constraint - solving layout engine .
This will allow for much greater elegance and flexibility , as well as a number of features ( such as arrows connecting different parts of the diagram ) which would be difficult or impossible to implement in the current framework .
My ultimate vision is for the diagrams library to become a viable alternative to declarative drawing systems such as MetaPost and Asymptote , with the distinct advantages that it will be
purely declarative , and
declarative , and an embedded DSL , providing the full power of Haskell and its ecosystem , as opposed to the ad - hoc specialized languages used by MetaPost and Asymptote .
If this sounds exciting to you , I hope you ’ll join me , either by trying out diagrams for your projects and providing feedback , or by contributing some code .
If you ’re interested in helping with the rewrite itself , let me know ; I also plan to set up a core / contrib model like that of xmonad , so there should also be plenty of opportunities for contributing independent add - on modules which enhance the core functionality .

The era of “ duck face ” or “ duck lips ” has passed , as lips that have generated many parodies that are folded , as if for a kiss , have become a typical Instagram selfie marker .
A new word in the selfie is “ fish gape ” or “ fish yawn ” – a photo with an open mouth with prominent teeth that appear in the frame if you open your lips and smile slightly .
Trendsetters are already replenishing the social network with “ fish gape ” , and we recall how stars were photographed before and today .
So , the “ duck face ” are Kendall Jenner , Lily Aldridge , and Doutzen Kroes :

Against fans of the “ duck face ” today are the “ fish gape ” Selena Gomez , Rosie Huntington - Whiteley , and Adriana Lima :

Beautiful photos are an integral aesthetic component of successful promotion on social networks of both show business stars and ordinary users who want to express and show themselves .
The ability to work on the camera plays a huge role in creating the perfect shot : a languid look and a mysterious smile or , conversely , an open mouth and other chips will help emphasize the image and correctly convey the idea and mood to other users .
The main thing is that you feel confident and your image and emotions in the picture look harmonious .
Create and smile !

What does your selfie say about you ?
Psychologists from China and Singapore have studied how character traits are reflected in selfies .
Now we know why you do n’t have to fold your lips with a duck .
Since selfies have gained popularity , escort girls have completely new opportunities to control the impression that they make others .
But so far , each selfie - girl has chosen how she wants to reveal herself to the world , based only on his intuitive ideas , which means looking “ sexy ” or “ beautiful ” .
Finally , you can be guided by more accurate data .
Psychologist Lin Qiu from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and his colleagues from the Chinese Academy of Sciences invited 123 Internet users to post a selfie on the Weibo micro-blogging site ( this is the most popular Chinese social network , something between Twitter and Facebook ) .
“ Self - shooters ” were asked to pass a classic psychological test to determine personality traits .
This test , the Big Five Inventory ( BFI ) , defines the Big Five character traits : extraversion , goodwill , good faith , neuroticism , openness to a new experience .
Selfies were evaluated by 13 parameters : did the girl fold her lips with a duck face ; did she tighten his lips ; looked at the camera ; expressed positive emotions ; camera height ; front or side camera ; is the whole face visible , whether the body is visible ; whether location information is shown ; is the public space shown , whether private housing is shown ; are there any traces of editing in Photoshop .
Researchers have found that some of these photo features correlate with the Big Five character traits .
For example , those whose test showed a high level of goodwill often showed positive emotions on their faces and kept their camera low .
Also , more positive emotions were on the faces of people with a high level of openness to a new experience .
Selfie - girls with a high level of conscientiousness ( diligence , consciousness ) were less likely to act on the background of their housing ( probably for reasons of confidentiality ) .
But girls with a high level of neuroticism ( emotional instability ) are fond of duck face .
And only the level of extraversion ( openness , sociability ) did not correlate with any of the details of the photo – perhaps because everyone tries to portray themselves as open and friendly on selfies .
So , these were objective data – how the features of a selfie correlate with character traits identified with the help of the test .
But the girls were interested in another question : those who look at selfies instinctively read these psychological signs and guess what kind of person the person is in front of them ?
To understand this , 107 girls who were not familiar with the authors of the selfie were invited and asked to tell what they think about these people from their photographs .
It turned out that intuition here works so - so .
Moreover , when evaluating unfamiliar selfies , girls most often agreed with each other – it seems that people as a whole tend to draw similar conclusions from the same details in photographs .
But these conclusions are most often erroneous .
Girls suggested that positive emotions on the face and uncompressed lips are signs of an introvert ; positive emotions and a direct look into the lens indicate goodwill ; lips with ducking and a passion for Photoshop mean a low level of integrity , and photographs in public places mean a high level of integrity ; negative emotions , a photo in solitude , a duck face and a partially hidden face are signs of neuroticism .
All of these conclusions were not correct .
But , perhaps , to know about them is not superfluous : even if this is not true , but this is how people take our selfies .
In general , if you do not want to be considered a lazy neurotic , say goodbye to the “ duck ” forever .
Houses prices , like everything else , are a function of supply and demand .
The inventory ( supply ) of houses on the market has dropped significantly in recent months , fueling hope that the housing bust is over and done with .
Unfortunately , the inventory of houses listed for sale may severely understate the actual inventory of houses owners want to sell .
This , in turn , may be creating a far too rosy picture of supply and demand .
Amherst Securities has produced a scary analysis of this " shadow inventory " overhang , which Amherst estimates is a shocking 7 million houses .
( The consensus is only 2 - 3 million ) .
7 million houses represents 1.4 - times the number of houses currently sold in the country each year .
So this represents a massive overhang .
As these houses hit the market in future years , they will keep pressure on house prices .
This will likely either lead to further declines in prices or delay the recovery .
The build - up of shadow inventory , according to Amherst , is the result of three factors :
High " transition " rates .
More mortgages that fall behind by 30 and 60 days are progressing through to default .
Low " cure " rates .
Fewer delinquent mortgages than usual are returning to performing loans .
" Liquidations " of deliquent loans are taking much longer than usual .
The banks are taking longer to foreclose and holding foreclosed properties to avoid putting pressure on prices ( and thus triggering writedowns ) .
Mortgage mods are delaying foreclosures .
Many houses are early in the foreclosure process .
We have wrapped many of Amherst 's charts into the presentation below .
Here is the firm 's bottom line :
We are concerned that , in light of this housing overhang , the stabilization we have seen in home prices the last few months is temporary .
Securing an HTTPS server
In response to numerous comments about " excessive minimalism " , I recently put together a new website for my Tarsnap online backup service ; and since I was reworking things anyway , I decided that it was a good time to move to a new web server and generally clean up the system configuration .
Among the things I cleaned up was how I handle HTTPS : I need it because people enter passwords when creating tarsnap accounts and when logging in to the tarsnap account management interface , but I was n't satisfied with the ( in ) security of running Apache with SSL enabled .
There are two reasons why I do n't like the idea of running Apache with mod_ssl and OpenSSL to service HTTPS requests .
First , SSL is a complex protocol , and thus implementations are likely to be buggy and insecure ; and second , SSL certificates are sensitive information .
If someone finds a vulnerability in OpenSSL , I do n't want them to be able to leverage that into accessing anything else on the server ; and likewise , if someone finds a vulnerability in something else ( Apache , for instance , or -- although it would greatly shock me -- one of the tarsnap CGI scripts )
I do n't want them to be able to leverage that into gaining access to the SSL certificate for www.tarsnap.com.
In order to maximize the separation between systems on this machine , I set it up following the " service jail " model : Using FreeBSD 's jail functionality ( roughly speaking , chroot redesigned to be secure ) , I have daemons running each in their own " world " and bound to individual non-routable IP addresses ; and then I use the ipfw firewall and natd daemon to translate and pass packets back and forth to the external interface .
Among the jails on this system , I have a package - building jail on IP address 192.168.128.1 ; a dns cache jail on IP address 192.168.128.53 ; an outgoing mail daemon on IP address 192.168.1.25 ; and an authoritative nameserver on IP address 192.168.0.53 .
TCP connections incoming to port 80 on www.tarsnap.com are redirected by natd to an Apache process running on IP address 192.168.0.80 , while incoming connections to port 443 -- that being the standard port for HTTPS traffic -- is redirected to IP address 192.168.0.44 .
There they encounter the stunnel daemon , which is running with the following configuration file :
chroot = / var / run / stunnel pid = / stunnel .pid setgid = stunnel setuid = stunnel output = /var/log/stunnel.log syslog = no [ https ] accept = 192.168.0.44:443 connect = 192.168.0.80:80 local = 192.168.0.44 cert = /usr / local/etc/ssl/server.crt key = /usr / local/etc/ssl/server.key
As one might expect from the configuration file , stunnel takes the incoming HTTPS connections , performs the necessary SSL negotiation , and then passes the underlying HTTP connection on to the Apache daemon at 192.168.0.80 .
Now if someone compromises OpenSSL , they will still be stuck within the stunnel jail -- able to steal the SSL certificate , to be sure , and also able to intercept other HTTPS connections -- but unable to do anything to Apache ( or the CGI scripts which Apache launches ) aside from what could already be done from the outside world .
There is one slight inconvenience to this configuration , however : Because HTTPS connections are proxied via stunnel , Apache 's logs show stunnel 's IP address as the source of each connection , with obvious consequences for log analysis .
That said , there is a workaround available : Apache 2.2 can be instructed to log source port numbers , and stunnel logs all connections it handles -- including the source IP address of the incoming connection and the port number used for opening up the connection to Apache .
Consequently , it is possible to correlate Apache and stunnel 's logs in order to generate a traditional HTTP log file including " real " source addresses .
( I might blog further about this in the future -- if you 're interested , please leave a comment below . )
Good system security requires multiple layers .
It is n't enough to use software , like Apache , mod_ssl , and OpenSSL , which have no presently known vulnerabilities , and upgrade them whenever vulnerabilities are found .
Designing secure systems requries accepting that security vulnerabilities will be found -- and exploited before they can be fixed -- and putting components together in such a way as to minimize the potential impact of such vulnerabilities .

An Afghan - born Colorado man charged with conspiring to explode bombs in the United States made several trips to Canada , U.S. authorities said Friday .
U.S. prosecutors told a federal court in Denver the travels of Najibullah Zazi across the border raise concern he might have tried to organize another terror cell north of the border .
While the surprise revelation by prosecutors is raising concerns in U.S. intelligence circles , a family member has told CBC News that Zazi was just visiting his dying grandmother in Mississauga , Ont .
U.S. prosecutor Tim Neff told the court that Zazi played a direct role in a plan to make and detonate hydrogen peroxide - based bombs on commuter trains , possibly to coincide with the anniversary of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , hijackings .
" The evidence suggests a chilling , disturbing sequence of events showing the defendant was intent on making a bomb and being in New York on 9/11 , for purposes of perhaps using such items , " Neff said .
Zazi , a 24 - year - old Colorado airport shuttle driver and coffee cart owner in New York , was transferred on Friday on the orders of U.S. Magistrate Judge Craig Shaffer from Denver to New York City to face charges of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction .
Zazi is due to make an appearance in court in Brooklyn on Tuesday .
Investigators said they found notes on bomb - making that appear to match Zazi 's handwriting and discovered his fingerprints on materials — batteries and a scale — that could be used to make explosives .
Zazi told the FBI that he must have unintentionally downloaded the notes as part of a religious book and that he deleted the book " after realizing that its contents discussed jihad . "
Zazi is also charged , with two other men , with lying to authorities in a continuing terror investigation .
The other two are his father , Mohammed Wali Zazi , and Ahmad Wais Afzali , an imam at a mosque in the New York City borough of Queens .

VMWare and Java —
What do the have in Common ?
VM – Virtual Machine .
Just the name , underlying infrastructure , technology is 99.9 % different .
Did any one ever thought a Virtualization giant like VMWare would buy Java based Framework developer Company “ Spring Source ” , popular for it ’s “ Spring Framework ” , used in most J2EE web applications today .
VMWare ’s acquisition of SpringSource , is the most significant development in the history of the Java development platform , after the Oracle - Sun deal .
VMWare is now into serious Cloud Computing .
The company sees its role in the cloud , very crucial .
The acquisition of the commercial open - source middleware / framework company makes perfect sense .
First make your Virtualization highly resilient , portable then partner with Networking giants for Virtualization Aware Networking , and then jump into software market .
SpringSource gives VMWare a development “ platform , ” the next step , to deliver in VMWare - based cloud services and a unique Ecosystem to define both application construction and deployment architectures .
The vision constructed by SpringSource CEO Rod Johnson a while ago , speaks to an environment in which developers can declare not only how objects should connect with one another , but how they should be packaged into virtual machines and deployed into the virtualized infrastructure :
Working together with VMware we plan on creating a single , integrated , build - run - manage solution for the data center , private clouds , and public clouds .
A solution that exploits knowledge of the application structure , and collaboration with middleware and management components , to ensure optimal efficiency and resiliency of the supporting virtual environment at deployment time and during runtime .
A solution that will deliver a Platform as a Service ( Paas ) built around technologies that you already know , which can slash cost and complexity .
A solution built around open , portable middleware technologies that can run on traditional Java EE application servers in a conventional data center and on Amazon EC2 and other elastic compute environments as well as on the VMware platform .
The impact of this acquisition has focused on how it plays as a competition to Microsoft Azure , which –when combined with the Hyper - V virtualization platform–threatens VMWare ’s dominance in the enterprise .
Forrester Research thinks it ’s much more than that , however :
VMware has a bigger agenda SpringSource helps to fulfill making vCloud bigger than simply an Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) alternative and keeping Microsoft at bay .
Enterprises are already demanding that cloud environments and internal cloud solutions support their hypervisor standard VMware .
So it was n’t going to be a stretch to get vCloud adopted , assuming it delivered as promised .
But the battle is n’t IaaS , it ’s becoming the equivalent of the operating system for the next generation data center and you ca n’t achieve that aim without applications ; and you ca n’t become application - relevant without being relevant to developers .
Stephen O’Grady says it ’s not just about the development and integration , but also about tooling :
When ( colleague Michael ) Cote and I met with SpringSource CEO Rod Johnson at OSCON a few weeks ago , one of the primary topics of discussion was the development experience .
This could wind up one of the unheralded benefits of the acquisition : Rod gets the tooling story .
He understands that Microsoft , again , is setting the bar for the development experience by allowing its developers to localize the cloud environment via Visual Studio .
With VMware ’s virtualization capabilities , the tooling story for SpringSource could get very interesting vis a vis cloud development and deployment .
Everyone is excited about the future of cloud computing —
There are technologies evolving for both public and private clouds that give developers just as much control over every element of how their applications are built , deployed , and operated as they have had in the past .
These technologies are a combination of declarative descriptive configuration policies and automated software and systems that can interpret those policies and respond as required .
SaaS is a key - player in today ’s industries .
Spring Framework has done wonders in this .
SaaS offerings allow customization at levels of granularity unthinkable before Spring demonstrated dynamic instantiation .
Custom applications deployed to IaaS offerings could declare that they require a isolated networks for backplane communication , connectivity to two different storage systems by name ( perhaps even one in the cloud and one through FCoE ) , or provide monitoring through specific protocols .
VMWare is not the only company that can currently achieve this vision .
Microsoft is in a great position to allow a similar story for its developers , assuming it partners with the right systems companies to push dynamic configuration beyond Hyper - V into the physical infrastructure layers .
.
Net and the Microsoft tool set are already quite capable of delivering significant coordination between application development and deployment .
Citrix and Red Hat , by contrast , do not yet seem to have such a sophisticated vision .
BTW , VMWare got cloud monitoring powerhouse Hyperic in the deal as well .
What ’s your take on VMWare ’s acquisition of SpringSource .
Is it as important as the cloud pundits , or is there little excitement worth raising hair here ?

Used cars ' now gaining in value '
One firm said the price increases were ' completely unprecedented '
Second - hand cars are gaining rather than depreciating in value due to a shortage in supply , an industry - wide research company has found .
CAP Motor Research Ltd , which provides valuation data to the car industry , said the usual 15 % - a - year depreciation of used car prices has been reversed .
Companies delaying replacing their fleets and the government scrappage scheme has led to a shortage in supply .
This year the average family car has increased in value by about £ 600 .
Mike Hind from CAP Motor Research Ltd told the BBC : " What usually happens in the second - hand car market is a steady depreciation .
Nearly everything that comes in is being sold at the moment and that is very , very unusual
Tim Naylor , British Car Auctions
" But this year we have seen the complete reversal of that , with used - car prices rising on a month - by - month basis by about 3.5 % which is translating into really big rises in the values of used cars . "
Mr Hind added : " The high values are good news if you want to sell your car but not so great for second hand dealers or anyone trying to pick up a bargain . "
Tim Naylor , from British Car Auctions , told the BBC the price rises he has seen in 2009 have been " completely unprecedented " .
He said : " Prices have gone up between 25 and 30 % depending on the car .
" Nearly everything that comes in is being sold at the moment and that is very , very unusual . "

Tdi SE , 06/06 plate , 30,000 miles : Jan £ 16,600 - Sept £ 20,000 = +£ 3400 Professor David Bailey of Coventry University Business School said he believed the scrappage scheme would be short - lived .
Prof Bailey said : " The way it 's going the scrappage scheme will run out of money in October , so we may see a reversal in the new car market . "
In April , used - car magazine Parker 's reported that for the first time in the UK new cars were cheaper than used ones .
The firm said the anomaly was caused by the dearth in used cars , combined with a recession - led fall in demand for new cars , which has forced carmakers to slash prices .

We ’d all seen the bomb – a fiery mushroomed column of mortality , destructive power that could kill the dead .
Awe and hysteria born from the ashes of the Second World War led to the Cold War , and in turn a need to protect messaging and communication in case such a nuke ever hit home .
Indeed , there is strength in number , or rather , in networked distribution , on many levels .
From these beginnings , adaptations of the first digital communication technologies emerged , connecting 4 western universities and laying the foundation for the age of telecommunication .
Email , as a means of electronically sending messages between two people , is said to have began at MIT in the 1960s .
The system was crude , and basically amounted to different users leaving notes for each other stored on the same shared computer .
This was a precursor to today ’s method of sending an email across a network , which , incidentally , was created not too much later .
The First Network Email
The backbone of our current email system began with ARPANET , near the end of 1971 , by Ray Tomlinson , an ARPANET contractor working for Bolk Beranek and Newman .
ARPANET was the network created by the Advanced Research Projects Agency ( ARPA ) of the United States Department of Defense during the Cold War .
Tomlinson ’s goal was to take his existing basic messaging system , SNGMSG , and take it to the next logical evolution , indicating for a given message which user was at which of the network ’s computers .
At its core , email is n’t too different from regular mail .
When you send a letter to someone , you indicate two things on the outside in order to get it where you want it to go : the name of the intended recipient , and the presumed current location of said recipient .
Tomlinson came up with an elegant way of designating these two parts with the adoption of the @ symbol .
His system , familiar to all of us now , identifies the recipient before the symbol , the location after .
While the location referred to a particular computer at the time , the location now refers to the domain at which a mail server is hosted , a bit like sending a letter to an apartment building , and you leave it to the building administration to get the note to the right person .
There ’s a popular myth that the first email ever written was “ qwertyuiop ” , but actually was some forgettable test text that Tomlinson himself can’t remember .
Email Exchange Today
The principles behind the ARPANET extended to the Internet that followed .
Messages are now sent via a local electronic mail server , which then relays to the intended destination using SMTP , or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol , read using Post Office Protocol ( POP ) or Internet Message Access Protocol ( IMAP ) which access the mail server that received the message .
Many companies have local mail servers of this kind , which manage the incoming and outgoing messages workers send and receive internally or from outside their network .
The next step , which many companies have started to take , uses services like Microsoft Exchange Hosting .
While local mail servers get the basic job done , numerous factors make hosting a mail server off - site a safer option .
A hosted exchange service , in short , acts as an intermediary between senders outside the network and those within , offering an added layer of protection to catch SPAM , viruses , and other junk or dangerous email .
Also , the infrastructures of the kinds of companies that offer a hosted exchange service , for instance , Microsoft Sharepoint Hosting allow pretty much guaranteed uptime and security over a cloud - computing network , far more stable than a company ’s local mailserver .
No offense to affected IT workers !
It ’s nice to know that in the event of a robbery , fire , or anything else horrible , that stolen or destroyed equipment does n’t mean lost data .
The Future
One possible direction for email could be towards using XMPP instead of SMTP .
Anarchogeek explains the situation well , basically that instant messenger services use a means of transferring information that is highly permission - based ( because of invited friends ) , usually resulting in less junk and more quick and pure communication .
There are critical mass issues to overcome in making a transition away from something as prevalent and accepted as SMTP , but XMPP could very well be the next step in electronic mail .

Similarly , Twitter did not attract the young trendsetters at the outset .
Its growth has instead come from adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter , said Jeremiah Owyang , an industry analyst studying social media .
“ Adults are just catching up to what teens have been doing for years , ” he said .
Many young people , who have used Facebook since they began using the Internet and for whom text messaging is their primary method of communication , say they simply do not have a need for Twitter .
Almost everyone under 35 uses social networks , but the growth of these networks over the last year has come from older adults , according to a report from Forrester Research issued Tuesday .
Use of social networking by people aged 35 to 54 grew 60 percent in the last year .
Another reason that teenagers do not use Twitter may be that their lives tend to revolve around their friends .
Though Twitter ’s founders originally conceived of the site as a way to stay in touch with acquaintances , it turns out that it is better for broadcasting ideas or questions and answers to the outside world or for marketing a product .
It is also useful for marketing the person doing the tweeting , a need few teenagers are attuned to .
“ Many people use it for professional purposes  keeping connected with industry contacts and following news , ” said Evan Williams , Twitter ’s co-founder and chief executive .
“ Because it ’s a one - to - many network and most of the content is public , it works for this better than a social network that ’s optimized for friend communication . ”
Image Teenagers , it seems , would rather chat with close friends than tweet to the masses .

Wendy Grazier , a mother in Arkansas , said her two teenaged daughters thought Twitter was “ lame , ” yet they asked her to follow teenage pop stars like Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift on Twitter so she could report back on what the celebrities wrote .
Why wo n’t they deign to do it themselves ?
“ It seems more , like , professional , and not something that a teenager would do , ” said 16 - year - old Miranda Grazier .
“ I think I might join when I ’m older . ”
Julian Rauscher hat nicht schlecht gestaunt , als er in der vergangenen Woche eine Antwort auf sein Hilfsangebot für den eingetragenen Verein SOS - Kinderdorf bekam .
Rauscher , Webmaster der Spielenetzwerkseite Gamersunity , wollte der Hilfsorganisation Platz für Werbebanner zur Verfügung stellen und so seine Leser auf die gemeinnützige Arbeit des Vereins hinweisen .
Doch SOS - Kinderdorf lehnte das Angebot ab .
Man wolle nicht mit Videospielen in Verbindung gebracht werden , da es Titel mit gewaltverherrlichenden Inhalten gibt und diese auf Gamersunity .
de behandelt würden .
In einem Interview mit Eurogamer .de begründete Thomas Laker , Sprecher von SOS - Kinderdorf , die Reaktion wörtlich :
» Tatsache ist , dass über Spielekonsolen , am PC oder online Spiele gespielt werden können , die dem Nutzer Gelegenheit geben , virtuelle Gewalt gegenüber realistischen Abbildern von Menschen auszuüben .
Diese Spiele enthalten massive und wirklichkeitsnahe Gewaltdarstellungen , die wir als unethisch ablehnen ...
… Wir sind besorgt , dass auch junge User über diese Spiele – getarnt als harmlose Unterhaltung – auf vielfältige Weise mit Gewalt in Kontakt kommen können .
Deshalb nehmen wir in besonderer Verantwortung für die uns anvertrauten Kinder und Jugendlichen eine kritische und distanzierende Haltung zu den Inhalten von so genannten Shooterspielen beziehungsweise Online - oder PC - Kriegsspielen ein . «
Andere Hilfsorganisationen scheinen da weniger Berührungsängste und eine differenzierte , aufgeklärte Perspektive zu Computerspielen zu haben .
So machen auf Gamersunity .

The latest rumors out of the Euro - basketball world is that the Greek basketball club Olympiakos is set to offer Allen Iverson a 2 - year deal worth an estimated $ 10 milllion .
That deal would be the same proposed offer that Nate Robinson recently turned down and would be about equal to the NBA ’s mid-level exception that NBA teams are offering him .
I ’m sure Iverson ’s feelings of not being wanted by any NBA squad might put this Olympiakos offer into serious consideration .
If he accepted , Iverson would be an instant star overseas and would push Josh Childress ’ European stardom back to just being that dude on the court with the ‘ fro .
The Vlachs of Greece and their Misunderstood History by Helen Abadzi 1 Abstract The Vlachs speak a language that evolved from Latin .
It was transmitted by Romans to many peoples and was used as an international language for centuries .
Most Vlach populations live in and around the borders of modern Greece .
The word ‘ Vlachs ’ appears in the Byzantine documents at about the 10th century , but few details are connected with it and it is unclear it means for various authors .
It has been variously hypothesized that Vlachs are descendants of Roman soldiers , Thracians , diaspora Romanians , or Latinized Greeks .
However , the ethnic makeup of the empires that ruled the Balkans and the use of the language as a lingua franca suggest that the Vlachs do not have one single origin .
DNA studies might clarify relationships , but these have not yet been done .
In the 19th century Vlach was spoken by shepherds in Albania who had practically no relationship with Hellenism as well as by urban Macedonians who had Greek education dating back to at least the 17th century and who considered themselves Greek .
The latter gave rise to many politicians , literary figures , and national benefactors in Greece .
Because of the language , various religious and political special interests tried to attract the Vlachs in the 19th and early 20th centuries .
At the same time , the Greek church and government were hostile to their language .
The disputes of the era culminated in emigrations , alienation of thousands of people , and near - disappearance of the language .
Nevertheless , due to assimilation and marriages with Greek speakers , a significant segment of the Greek population in Macedonia and elsewhere descends from Vlachs .
Tra s’dzic tut tsi-am pri suflit , o Pirivole dzînni
To say all I have in my heart o Perivoli tell me La cari s’ñi aspun eu dorlu , la tini i la Armâni ?
To whom shall I tell my pain to you or the Arumans ?

There is a small hotel in Perivoli , a village of Pindus , ensconced above the national forest that has the name Valia Calda3 .
Virgil Perdichi , an immigrant to the US spent all his savings to build it .
He hoped that the hotel would give some life to the village that had been almost emptied by emigration and wars .
When the hotel formally opened around 1973 , Virgil arrived in Greece to attend , but the military junta government blocked his exit from the airport .
In 1983 , aged about 86 , he died in Waco , Texas ; then I went to his house to help out with the acceptance of inheritance .
I thought that I would read easily the correspondence that he had with his brother about the hotel , but to my surprise , the letters were completely unintelligible .
The decedent was not a dangerous communist , as one might have expected given the junta ’s treatment .
The crime was that the Perdichi siblings , like their mother , had attended Romanian - language schools in Pindos when Macedonia was part of the Ottoman Empire .
Years later , a young economist who worked at an international organization told me that her name was Papahagi .
Initially I thought that a Romanian priest had gone for a pilgrimage to the Holy Land during the years that the Christian hajj was common .
But all those who have dealt with the ‘ koutsovlach issue ’4 know that the surname Papahagi belongs to a family of distinguished 20th century philologists from the village Avdela of Pindos .
Their works , unknown in Greece , are connected to a road that some people followed towards an Ithaca that bitterly disappointed them .
Few people now know this story in Greece , but some diplomats knowledgeable about Romania say that the issue of the Vlachs who live there is difficult and ‘ taboo ’ .
During a trip to Romania in 2002 , I understood the reason .
When I mentioned to Romanians that a great - grandfather might have been a Vlach , they told me smiling that I was also a distant relative .
They explained that the Vlach language is old - style Romanian , about like what the Pontus dialect is for Greeks , and that the Vlachs are diaspora Romanians .
They asked me why in Greece they are forced to Hellenize their names and why Greece does not allow the use of the Vlach language in television and radio .
Until that time , my relations with the Vlachs were limited to a vague memory that some relatives and friends descended from them .
I decided to find answers to the questions I had heard .
I read much of the voluminous material that exists on this issue in books and on the internet and spoke to many Vlachs of diverse political persuasions .

This article summarizes the issues as were understood by a multilingual Greek educational psychologist .
The Paradoxes of Vlachology
The students who enter the Metsovion Polytechnic Institute in Athens would not normally imagine that the benefactors of an engineering school would be Vlachs .
This word brings to the mind of many Greeks the image of an uneducated shepherd with a glitsa and tsarouhia on some mountaintop , and of women with long embroidered skirts and kerchiefs carrying buckets of dairy products ( e.g. the brand of condensed milk , ‘ Gala Vlachas ’ and the song ‘ in your embroidered apron you Vlach woman ’ )
In the 21st century most Greeks may not remember the Vlachs as anything distinct .
By the 12th century the name already had a general meaning of a transhumant or shepherd .
6 Many Greeks think that " Vlachika " is the ‘ northern dialect ’ of Greek , which pronounces e as i , o as u , and s as sh.7
One reason is that nothing sets the Vlachs apart as a race or a distinct minority .
They have the same religion , appearance , the same pronunciation in Greek , and about the same names .
( Many Vlach surnames are meaningless in Greek but so are Albanian and Turkish surnames . )
The only difference is that they or their grandparents knew a language which belongs to the Balkan Latin family .
In Romania it is easier to tell who is a Vlach .
Many are recognized by their Greek surnames ( e.g. Papadima , Papacostea , Caranika ) and first names , which sometimes are still written with the Greek diminutives ( e.g Athena , Perikles , Zoitsa , Steliu , Nacu , Lambrache , Tache ) .
The faces that go with the names often look like those that one sees in Greece .
Some Romanians ask why the Vlachs are not recognized as a minority in Greece .
However , historically the members of this ‘ minority ’ have acted as the backbone of Hellenism : fighters against Ottoman occupation , like Rigas Feraios , Giorgakis Olympios , and possibly Theodoros Kolokotronis ; 8 leaders of leftist resistance against the Germans ( EAM ) , such as Alexandros Svolos and Andreas Tzimas .
Distinguished writers like Kostas Krystallis and Christos Zalokostas were Vlach , as were contemporary composers like Apostolos Kaldaras , Kostas Virvos , Babis Bakalis , and Mitropanos .
Many became rich Balkan merchants during the 18th and 19th centuries and many Greek national benefactors were Vlachs , such as Nikolaos Stournaris , Georgios Arsakis , Michael and Georgios Tositsas , Georgios Sinas.9 Simon Sinas financed the construction of the Academy of Athens , while Georgios Averoff contributed to the first Olympic games .
10
There was at least one Vlach prime minister , Ioannis Kolettis ( 1773 -1847 ) , ministers ( like Evangelos Averoff ) , and countless senators .
Without the majority realizing it , the government of Greece was many times under the control of this ‘ minority ’ .
How are the contradictions reconciled ?
The topic is extremely politicized , and the publications of the last 100 years reflect that .
Some authors analyze Byzantine documents and travelogues of foreigners , songs and traditions for differences or similarities .
Specific events are generalized , and the historical hiatus is filled and interpreted according to the political ideology of each writer .
11
In general , the Greek publications leave no doubt about the Greek origin of the Vlachs , while others leave no doubt about their particular identity and non-Greek origin .
There also are long debates about the name of the Vlachs .
In Vlach they call themselves Armân or Arumân . 12 " Hii Armân ? "
Are you a Vlach ?13
As with the Greek word ‘ Romios ’ , it derives from Romanus and denotes a citizen of the Roman or Byzantine empire , which was called Romania .
In the Byzantine literature usually the term ‘ Vlach ’ is used .
Similar to this word are the ancient German ‘ Valah ’ ( Volcae in Latin ) , which refers to a Latinized Celtic tribe that settled in the Roman Empire .
The Germans called some Latin - speaking people Valah or Wallach .14
The term Vlach may be German or Slavic , but is used as Blachi in medieval Latin as well .
The word is related to others that refer to Latin or Celtic speakers , like the Walloons of Belgium , Welsh in English , Wloch in Polish , Olasz in Hungarian , Volokh in Russian .15
This article uses the word " Vlachs . "

Traditionally , Vlachs lived in the southern Balkans .
Areas with considerable Vlach population exist in central and southern Albania ( e.g. the destroyed Moschopolis ) and the area that was earlier called Pelagonia and is now in FYROM , with cities such as Krusovo and Monastir ( Vitolia ) .
However , most Vlach habitations appear to be in Greece .
The mountain villages form a line from Rome to Instanbul .
At the sides of Pindus , from Grammosta to Pertouli there are about 80 mountain villages , despite the extensive demographic changes of the 20th century .
Traditional groups in the plains still exist from Xanthi to Corfu and from the mouth of the river Acheloos to the mouth of Sperchios ,18 and also in Evoia .

At the end of the 19th century , there were about 150,000 Vlachs in the southern Balkans ,19 and about half the Greek population of Thessaloniki in fact consisted of Vlachs .20 After 1912 - 13 about 100,000 ( 2/3 of them ) became Greek citizens .
21
Since then , they have been much reduced due to emigration and assimilation .
The 1951 census , the last time that minorities were counted in Greece , recorded 39,385 Vlachs .
Around 2003 , there may be 20,000 people in Greece who consider themselves Vlach .
22 Traditionally , there was a broad spectrum of living conditions and thought among Vlachs .
They ranged from isolated and illiterate mountain dwellers of Albania to cosmopolitan merchants and directors of Greek schools .
However , the groups that attracted the most attention were the transhumant shepherds .
Many foreign visitors were impressed by the picturesque nomads and semi-nomads they saw in Macedonia , with their dresses , occupations , languages , and ability to manage in difficult conditions .
23 Most interesting were three shepherd groups : The Arvanito - Vlachs ( Farsarotes ) , Vlachs , and Sarakatsani .
Despite the unclear meaning of their name , 24 the Sarakatsani spoke Greek in the 19th century , so their Greekness was not disputed .
The Arvanito - Vlachs , whose women often wore long hats , had Albanian names that indicated long cohabitation with Albanians .
25
Travelers also wrote a lot about the ‘ generic ’ Vlachs .
The northern type was considered light colored and with features different from neighboring groups , while the southern types were shorter and darker .
26 ( Geographically , however , northern and southern dialects are mixed .
27 ) They lived free on the mountaintops , were considered hard - working and smart , and many chelniks ( goat - herding chiefs ) had considerable flocks and wealth .
The women who set up households in different places every day when the flocks moved , had more social freedoms than Greek women .
These mountaineers were something different and enviable as is shown in the song ‘ Nu - ñi ti arâde feată ñica ’ , where a girl wants to marry a mountain Vlach .
The plains Vlachs may have been more numerous than the shepherds .
Among them were the Meglenites around the Pangaio mountain , who were farmers , spoke a separate language , and had extensive relations with Bulgarians .
Others settled in urban or rural areas and had occupations similar to those of non-Vlachs .
Much has been written about the educated urban elites of Moschopolis and Pelagonia , who were often Vlach traders traveling as far as Hungary , Romania , and India .
28
At least as far back as the 17th century , urban Vlachs cultivated the Greek language and literature during the darkest periods of the Ottoman empire with translations and printing presses .
29 Records show that they considered themselves Greek , usually had Greek names,30 and several became national benefactors .
Evidence includes 24 letters of Moschopolis merchants , the printing press of Moschopolis , and the records of commercial fraternities of Transylvania .31 Examples of Greek scholars were Rigas Velestinlis ( Feraios ) and Konstantinos Mertzios .
The latter was a rich merchant of the 18th century , who discovered and rescued the Greek archive of Venice and later became a Greek Academy member .
32
The archive of the Greek high school in Monastir during the 19th and 20th century shows that almost all the students and teachers were Vlachs , often from poor families .
33 Several people maintained the Greek conscience in modern FYROM , despite the passage of 90 years since Pelagonia became Serbian .34
These families maintained a simultaneous use of Greek and Vlach languages for centuries .
Apparently , during the 18th century a large number of Ottoman subjects spoke Vlach at home , but its use gradually diminished .
Linguist Gustaf Weigand who studied the Vlachs extensively around 1980 mentions that " a large number of the ‘ pure Greeks ’ of Thebes , Serres , and Thessaloniki ’ are pure Vlachs .35
There were Vlach speakers from the south of Karditsa to the west , Agrafa mountains and Eurytania province who lost their language in the 19th and 20th centuries .
36 In Peloponese , where Vlachs had emigrated from northern points , the Vlachs also were assimilated in the local population .
( Sometimes Vlach place names remind us of the earlier language . )
37 Some Meglenites were converted to Islam in the 18th century and went to Turkey , while others identified with Bulgarians and went to Bulgaria .
The people who still spoke Vlach in the 20th century were mainly isolated mountaineers who married among themselves .
Historical Data About the Vlachs
The defenders of various positions base their arguments on some historical data .
Below are the basics .
The Balkan Latin languages developed from a Latin ( or a proto - Balkan version ) that was a lingua franca ( language of communication for different peoples ) during the Roman empire .
( Similarly in the west , Latin evolved into Italian , Spanish , French , etc. )
The Balkan Latin languages share many grammatical and lexical features but differ enough among them to be considered separate languages .
In the beginning of the 21st century there are four : Aromanian of the south Balkans , Megleno - aromanian , that are spoken only by 2000 - 3000 people around Gevgeli , Daco - Romanian of Romania , and Istro- Romanian .
The latter is spoken by only about 500 people at the Croatian part of the Istria peninsula .38 Further south in Croatia and along the Dalmatian coast the Morlachs or Black Vlachs also spoke Balkan Latin , but their language disappeared around 1890.39
The languages have local dialects .
Ancient Greece was conquered by the Romans in 146 BC and became a Roman province .
40
In the 3rd century AD , the capital of the eastern Roman empire was moved to Constantinople .
During the German invasions of the 4th century , Rome was sacked , and the Roman empire continued as " Romania " , known later as Byzantine empire .
It is unknown who spoke Latin at various times .
Many nationalities lived in the Byzantine Empire ( e.g. Armenians and Goths ) and at least some Byzantines spoke a Latin - derived language during the 6th century AD.41 Ioannis Lydos , a contemporary of the Latin - speaking emperor Justinian ( 527-565 AD ) mentions that Latin was used extensively among Greek - speaking people , particularly for official reasons .
42 Ultimately , Greek predominated and became the official language of the empire about 618 AD .
From the 6th to the 10th century , the Byzantine Empire lost control of its western provinces to Slavs and other invaders , and the knowledge of Latin was reduced .
The name ‘ Vlachs ’ is mentioned for the first time by the Byzantine Georgios Kedrinos , who wrote that the brother of the subsequently Bulgarian emperor Samuel was killed in 976 by ‘ odites Vlachous ’ between Kastoria and Prespa lakes .
43 Documents from Athos show that there were Vlachs in Chalikidi peninsula around 1000.44
The Armenian historian Kekavmenos , who wrote a treatise called ‘ Stratigikon ’ described warlike Vlachs around Trikala and Larissa , who in his opinion were " Dacias and Vesi " who had had been expelled from the regions around the Savos and Danube rivers because they were bandits .
45 Anna Komnini , historian and daughter of the Byzantine emperor Alexios Komninos , repeatedly mentions the Vlachs of Thessaly , whose chief named Pudilos rushed during the night to notify Alexios Komninos that the Koumani had crossed the Danube .46 Beniamin of Tudela , a 12th century Jewish rabbi , visited in Thessaly in 1173 and mentioned that the Vlachs descended from the mountains like deer , committed robberies , were invincible , and did not keep their word .
47 In 1183 , the Vlachs of Thessaly rebelled against the heavy taxation imposed by the emperor Isaakios Angelos for the wedding of his daughter and created the Bulgarian - Vlach empire of the Asenids .48 Ioannis Asan declared himself " Imperator omnium Bulgarorum et Blacorum ’ .
( Emperor of all Bulgarians and Vlachs ) .
When Frederico Barbarosa passed by that place , Ioannis Asan was mentioned as ‘ Emperor of Vlachs and most Bulgarians ’ , ‘ Emperor of Vlachs and Koumani ’ , or ‘ Emperor of Vlachs and Greeks .
’49 Military expeditions against the Asenids were mostly unsuccessful .
Byzantine armies were defeated in Veroia and Serres around 1190 - 1195 .
Finally around 1318 , this empire was divided between the Byzantine Empire and the Catalonian duchy of Athens.50 After the fall of the Byzantine Empire , the Ottomans considered the Greeks and Vlachs one nation ( milet ) until 1905 , although some early references differentiate among them .
The villages of Pindus date from the 17th century51 and were possibly founded for safety from persecutions .
From that time there is some evidence regarding the relations between Greeks52 and Vlachs .
During the 18th century , Greeks and Vlachs coexisted abroad ; documents and references of associations in Hungary , Vienna , or Romania do not differentiate between the two .
But there were disputes in 1790 - 1810 in Hungary regarding the language in church .
The negative reaction to the request that the mass be chanted in Vlach as well as in Greek split the community of Pesti ( Hungary ) in 1809.53
In 1905 , when disputes in Macedonia increased , the Ottoman Empire declared the Vlachs a separate nation , partly to divide the Christians .
54 Older writings in the Vlach language are very few .
The earliest texts date only from the 18th century and are brief verses : on an icon of Virgin Mary , above a church doorway , and on a jug .
( See pictures . )
A Greek - Vlach gospel was printed in 1822 and a sanctification ceremony in 1816.55 Secular texts were meant to teach Greek to Vlachs , like grammars and dictionaries .
56
The voice of the Vlachs is only heard through tales and folk songs .
Where Could they have Come From ?
The Vlachs themselves have no traditions that they came from some other part of the world , and no songs or tales have survived regarding some Roman general or the green pastures of a distant country that they lost during the Slavic invasions .
All Macedonian Vlachs whom Weigand consulted around 1890 indicated that they lived pretty much in their ancestral country .
57 Populations had moved but over relatively short distances .
However , the Vlachs speak a language that has no close relation to the area languages , so many people assumed that they must have come from somewhere else .
58
There are many Greek words in Vlach , 59 but they are mainly modern Greek.60 Finally , Vlachs share some traditions with Greeks ( e.g. the Kalikantzaroi spirits ) but not others , such as the prohibition of unmarried women from going to church .61 Briefly , theories about their origin have been : Roman legions .
Greeks and foreign travelers of the 18 - 20th centuries62 expressed the opinion that the Vlachs are descendants of Roman legions who stayed on to guard the narrow mountain passes and eventually became shepherds .
The various versions of the theory do not take much account of the women ’s nationality , though women were needed to father children .
Thracians - Diaspora Romanians .
Romanian historians hypothesized that between the 6th and 10th centuries , the Vlachs left their country north of the Danube and descended in the southern Balkans , possibly where the grasslands were better .
Pro-Romanian authors ( e.g. Tache Papahagi ) considered the Vlachs relatives of the Romanians , parts of Pelasgian and Thracian tribes that were Latinized .
According to this view , the Thracians inhabited the area from Romania to Macedonia , but the Slavic invasions that started in the 6th century fragmented it .63 ( See picture . )
Today this theory makes little sense .
The Pelasgians were a historical anachronism ,64 and ancient Macedonians have been rather conclusively shown to be a Greek tribe .65 Partly Slavs .
The Slavs moved to the Balkans during the 7th century , influenced the Vlach - speaking populations , and maybe displaced some .
66
Although there was no specific effort to prove that the Vlachs were Slavs , this argument was used to prove that the Vlachs were not Greek.67 Jews .
Benjamin of Tudela , a 12th century Sephardic rabbi suspected that at least the Vlach bandits of Thessaly had Jewish origin because although they robbed Jews , they called them brethren and did not killed them as they did others .
68 A distinct local ethnicity .
More recent Romanian historians consider that the Vlachs are a specific nation possibly descending from Pelasgians , Illyrians , Thracians , Macedonians ( they consider the latter non-Greek ) and other groups that were Latinized .
This position is explained in the ‘ Dodecalog of the Vlachs ’ that has an almost religious fervor .
69
The adherents of this theory get support from the observations of foreign travelers who perceived the mountain Vlachs as different from Greeks .70
The tendency of many Vlachs to identify with Greeks is attributed to religion ,71 adoption of Greek names that implied a higher social status,72 and a tendency of becoming easily assimilated in local populations .
73
Some people call themselves Macedono - Vlachs and focus on the Vlach presence in the greater Macedonia of Ottoman times .
74 Latinized local inhabitants .
Some contemporary Greek historians think that the Vlachs are main Latinized Greek populations .
75
According to this theory , the Vlachs of the Greek peninsula and cities in the north where Greek communities also lived are originally Greek .
By the same theory , Vlachs who lived beyond the borders of Greek communities are probably not Greek .
Indeed , many Vlachs of Serbia , Bulgaria , and Albania do not consider themselves Greek and have traditionally lived north of the Greek borders .
76 Emigrants from the northern Balkans .
The Vlachs ’ place of origin may have been the northern or northwestern Balkans , 77 from where the Byzantine emperor Justinian also hailed .
( His ancestral home was Prima , possibly Caricin Grad in south Serbia . )
78
The Roman presence was strongest near the two large roadways of the antiquity , the navigable Danube river and Via Egnatia ( towards Constantinople ) .
The Balkan Latin languages must have developed round these two axes that cut transversely across the Balkans : Daco - Romanian and Istro-Romanian around the Danube , Aromanian and Megleno - Aromanian around Via Egnatia.79
The separation becomes clearer in contemporary Albania and south Serbia , where ancient inscriptions in Latin are more numerous than those in Greek .
The dividing line ( Jirečec line ) constitutes a border between the western ( Latin speaking ) and eastern ( Greek speaking ) Roman empire .
Some ancient burials in Albania indicate that the inhabitants were Christians with Latin names .
Today the Jirečec line is further to the north than most Vlach habitations , but the inhabitants may have been pushed south in the 7 - 10th century by the invading Slavs.80
The use of the definite article at the end rather than the beginning of the word , a feature of Balkan Latin as well as Albanian and Bulgarian , lends some linguistic support to this theory .
Each of these theories leaves some aspects about the Vlachs and their language unexplained .
Given the generic use of the word to imply shepherd or nomad , it is unclear whom the Byzantine writers called Vlachs and what languages those spoke .
Did the Vlachs come from Romania or some remote place ?
Certainly populations fled due to Slavic invasions , and some probably moved away from the Jirečec line .
But the obviously large number of now assimilated Vlach speakers and presence in many parts of the Ottoman Empire suggests that thousands must have come from the north , and there is no historical record suggesting such a move .
The Vlachs could indeed descend from Roman soldiers , but they are not the only ones .
Roman legions ( including Greek and other recruits ) were stationed in Macedonia for centuries , and they must have left descendants , whose genes 20 centuries later are scattered widely .
Endogamy was established at some point among Balkan Latin speakers , but it is unknown when .
It is conceivable that a caste would be established of Roman soldier descendants intermarrying among them early on , particularly among those guarding the mountain passes , but there is no evidence of such a caste .81 Geographic isolation clearly played a part in language retention , and Balkan Latin has been for centuries connected to transhumant shepherds , even in the Istria peninsula which is close to Italy .
But if the ancestors of the Vlachs lived only around mountain passes , their descendants might have been relatively few .
The biggest problem with the theories of separate ethnicity is that they attribute national origin to speakers of a lingua franca .
National origin and language often coincide , 82 but many times in history a lingua franca evolved into a mother tongue .
83 During the Roman empire , probably very different people spoke Latin .
When soldiers had children where they were stationed , most would have probably spoken the local language , since the language of the women often prevails in children .
Latin may have survived outside the areas where it was spoken customarily because it was a high - status language84 and was cultivated for some centuries ( as English is cultivated in contemporary India . )
Nevertheless , the Balkan population conquered by the Romans was predominantly Greek and reverted to that language once the Byzantine government established its use .
Standard Latin eventually died out .
Unfortunately , no written record survives to show the development of Latin into proto-Balkan and subsequent languages and who continued to speak it .
85 Historians mention only two words dated from 586 ( torna torna fratre ) .
86
Thus , it is unclear how the Vlachs of the 10th century are related to the Latin speakers of the 6th century .
It is hard to prove the origin of Vlachs just through language .
Perhaps a single theory cannot account for the origin of all Vlachs , and different scenarios may have happened to different groups .
At least some sixth - century Byzantines spoke the ‘ voice of the Italians , ’ so they could communicate and intermarry with people fleeing the Slavs from the north ( particularly the ‘ akrites ’ guarding the borders ) .
The language may have thus been strengthened , forming new dialects .
It may have also been strengthened during the two centuries of Asenid reign , so some Aromanian speakers of the 20th century may have been speaking since the 12th rather than the 6th century .
Groups , such as many Arvanito - Vlachs who did not move southward may indeed be continuing the Roman language depicted in the inscriptions of the Jirečec line .
The existence of ‘ northern ’ and ‘ southern ’ Vlach dialects and physical appearance suggests that there may be a genetic and historical variability .
The origin of Vlachs could be clarified through comparisons of DNA samples ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) of various populations .
The various Vlach groups could be compared among themselves and with Greeks , Romanians , and Albanians .
However , no genetic studies have been done on the Vlachs .
The existing DNA studies on Greeks ( which include some Vlachs as part of the general population ) show that Greeks are quite homogeneous87 and that the populations of Macedonia and Epirus are more closely related .
88 Greeks are different from Turks and Bulgarians but quite similar to other Europeans , 89 particularly to Italians.90
So , even if the Vlachs are descendants of ( male ) Romans , they are a genetically related population .
Hopefully , more research will take place later on , though political repercussions may raise obstacles .
Without it there is simply not sufficient evidence regarding the origin of various Vlach groups .
Nations get created , and one could argue that the language made Vlachs into a nation regardless of origin .
Discussions with contemporary Romanians show that the Vlach language received much attention in the 19th century .
Some people were moved by this idiom that was so far and so near and wanted to protect it and to preserve it .
In the conflicts that followed , the Greek authorities and writers emphasized the Romanian political motives and seemed to consider Aromanian as a negligible peasant language .
They did not understand its emotional appeal to the Romanians , similar to the appeal that the Pontus dialect has on Greeks .
And the forgotten Vlachs finally found someone to pay attention to them and were flattered that some people valued their language .
The lack of understanding for the feelings towards a mother tongue had disastrous consequences for many Greeks and Vlachs .
National Identity Decisions
The majority wants to be considered Greeks , not Aromanian.91 .. Greeks are mainly the ones who share our education rather than our common nature .
92
As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire approached , the Vlachs became the focal point of political intrigue .
Their nationality would determine the land demands by various countries after the death of the ‘ great ill man ’ .
Without the Vlachs , the Greeks constituted fewer than 50 % in Macedonia .
For the Bulgarians it was important not only to make some Vlachs Bulgarian but also to avoid identification with the Greeks .
So the Vlach identity became an important issue .
However , ethnic identity had little meaning in earlier centuries .
The empires that appeared after the fall of the Greek city - states were multiethnic : Rome , Byzantium , Ottoman empire .
Homogeneous countries based on nationality appeared in the southern Balkans only after the end of the Ottoman empire , and people suddenly had to decide irrevocably where they belonged .
Groups often have had to make such decisions , but language was only one of many criteria .
Other factors were religion , security , economic interests , geographic roots , kinships , and personal interests of leaders .
These factors also determined which language the next generation would speak , as in the case of islamization and identification with the Turks .
It is unknown what the various tribes of the Balkans considered themselves to be , if anything , during various times in history .
But Vlach and Greek speakers coexisted at least since the 12th century .
According to Anna Komnini , there were Vlachs in the Byzantine army during her father ’s reign.93
In principle , Greek learning and education was available to Vlachs at least since the Byzantine times .
But even less educated and more isolated populations had contact with the language through the ancient Greek they heard in church .
94 Extensive knowledge of Greek may have been the reason why literate Vlachs did not often write in their language .
95
Whether due to old kinships or to available education , many or maybe most 18th century Vlachs considered themselves Greek.96
This may also have been due to the fact that Vlachs in each place were few .
( Moschopolis in southern Albania that could have been the nucleus of a Vlach civilization , was destroyed by Albanian Moslems in 1769 and 1778 , and its inhabitants were scattered . )
Because there were no marriage obstacles with other orthodox people , Vlachs could and did intermarry with Greeks , particularly in urban areas .
The Jirečec line theory implies that some Vlachs were compatriots of the renowned emperor Justinian .
Whatever his national origin , the emperor was a Roman citizen in a multiethnic empire .
Modern Greece has narrower borders .
But perhaps due to the multiethnic background of southern Balkans since the ancient years , it is language rather than national origin or ethnic purity determines who is Greek ( See citation of the famous Isokratis text in Paniygrikos . )
None of us knows who our ancestors were during the 6th , 11th , or 15th century and what languages they spoke .97
If the Vlachs who were described in the 10th century as savage bandit shepherds spoke Greek in the 19th century ( like the Sarakatsani bandits ) no identity issue would arise .
Also , no one questions the identity of assimilated and partial Vlachs .
Therefore , the Vlach speakers of contemporary Greece are as Greek as everyone else .
How did the people reconcile the Greek and Vlach identities ?
Clearly , the urban educated Vlachs had no problems with a dual identity .
This was made easier by the disappearance of the term Hellenes until about 1827 .
Even less educated Vlachs expressed the view that the Greeks and Vlachs together constituted the Hellenes.98 " The Greeks are not any more Hellenic than we are .
We may be Vlachs and they may be Greek , but together we make up the Hellenes " .
99 However , the Latin - derived language and unclear origin made the Vlachs a convenient target for various special interests : Catholics , Romanians , Italians .
Those interested competed for the loyalty of anyone they could convince .
Romanian Propaganda
The Roumanians are not so quite inured to blood as the Greeks and Bulgarians , and they have always conducted their propaganda by the clean and benevolent method of bribery .
100 No brother , I am not a Romanian nor do I have Romanian interests , as many fanatical Greeks maintain ; nor have I separated myself from Greeks in anything …
Why do all now call us Vlach and Koutsovlach , go away from here , we do n’t want you at our church , we do n’t send priests to your house , and many other things against us .
Are we not , today ’s Vlachs those Greeks who suffered so many horrors for this poor country and religion ?
101 Romania was under a strong influence of Fanariote Greeks when the " koutsovlach issue " started .
Possibly to tempt the west to fight against the Turks , a group of Macedonian Vlachs , supported by Anastasios Panou , regent of Moldavia , sent in 1836 a letter to Napoleon the Third asking for the formation of a Latin country in the Balkans that would be supported internally by Vlachs and externally by France .
102 France then sent a Catholic priest to convert them to Catholicism .
103 Balkan traders traveled or lived in Moldo - Vlachia for centuries and surely understood the similarities between Romanian and Vlach .
People from Epirus lived and traveled there .
But national tradition in Romania says that Averkios from Avdela of Pindos , a monk in the Iviron Monastery of Athos , went to newly independent Romania in 1860 , heard people speak , and said « shi γio hiu Armân » ( I am also a Vlach ) .
With the support of the local church authorities he sent a group of children from Pindos around 1865 to study there .
104 Another inhabitant of Abdela , the teacher Apostolos Margaritis , took the initiative to open Romanian schools for the Vlachs .
The first school opened in Vitolia ( Monastir ) around 1876 , supported by Greek - led churches in Romania .
105 Quickly Romanian - language schools opened in many Pindos villages and Macedonian cities .
Around 1900 , at the apex of the movement , there were around 106 such schools in the Balkans as well as a post - secondary commercial school of Thessaloniki .
106
These schools were not for the general population , like French or English schools .
Essentially only Vlachs attended .
Surely some Romanians took a humanitarian interest in the Vlachs and offered them opportunities that raised their standard of living .
Graduates of Romanian schools usually got scholarships for studies in Romania , so some sons of shepherds became engineers or even Romanian Academy members .
To study in Romania at that time was equivalent to studying in the US in later years .
107 But along with humanitarian effort , the Romanian government tried to convince the Vlachs that they were diaspora Romanians .
Romania was too far from Macedonia to demand a portion , but it wanted population and if possible control of a small principate in Pindos .
Archives in the Romanian ministry of external affairs document the government efforts to win the Vlachs ’ allegiance .
108 Around 1890 a serious propaganda started in towns and villages where many were pressured to receive Romanian teachers .
109
The families received subsidies to send their children to Romanian schools , where also food was served .
110 Many people ’s huts were replaced with stone houses .
111 But the propaganda had limited success because Vlachs considered themselves Greek and preferred Greek schools .
It failed completely in eastern Macedonia and around Olympus , where the inhabitants did not feel different from other Greeks .
112
It had more success in the north , at the villages of Pindos .
There , Greek schools were non-existent or of low quality , and Romanian education was a good solution .
113 Romanization included church mass in Romanian and efforts to ordain pro-Romanian priests and bishops .
114 The Greek patriarchate reacted negatively , did not allow mass in Romanian and did not recognize the ordained priests .
115 But Vlachs were not just pressured by the Orthodox Church .
Uniate Catholics ( who merely expected allegiance to the Pope ) also tried to convert them , 116 and French Lazarist monks opened a high school in Monastir in 1880 .
117
At the end of the 19th century , the Bulgarians also pressured them to become members of the Bulgarian church through threats and assassinations .
118 Some Vlachs of Ochrida in 1870 did so , because the latter allowed mass in Vlach .
Some pro-Romanian Vlachs collaborated with the Bulgarians in the battles that preceded the dissolution of Turkey .
119
An important factor in people ’s nationality decisions was the behavior of the people who represented them and the consequences of the choice .
Unfortunately , the Greek authorities and the Patriarchate showed little sensitivity to Vlach issues .
The bishops pressured them to pay church taxes , while the Bulgarians relieved them .
120 Sometimes the Greeks were as violent as the Bulgarians .
121 For example , they killed in 1904 12 pro-Romanian Vlachs from Houma , near Gevgeli .
122 Kapetan Akritas , a local Greek leader , demanded in 1905 that the communities close the Romanian schools and burn the books , oblivious to children ’s education needs .
Such conflicts are described in detail in Romanian books and probably incited some people to take the side of Romania .
123
The conflicts were considered persecutions and created the impression that the Vlachs of Greece should be saved from oppression .
For years later , some Vlachs pressured the Romanian government to take measures for the protection of their compatriots .
124 After the liberation of Macedonia from the Turks , the Romanian schools continued to function through the 1913 treaty of Bucharest .
Perhaps the government of Eleftherios Venizelos did not want to put at risk the schools of the large Greek communities in Romania .
Agreement on the Romanian schools also paved the way with better relations between Greece and Romania ; the latter notified Bulgaria that if it would send its armies to Sofia if Bulgaria did not withdraw its occupation army from Thessaloniki .
125
The cooperation policy with the Romanian government benefited Greece , but not necessarily the Vlachs .
The relatively few schools went on for about 50 years until 1945 , and in some villages like Perivoli three generations of people attended .
The Romanian high schools perhaps had a more modern curriculum than Greek schools because they taught French , which was useful for commerce .
The Commercial School of Thessaloniki was considered very good .
126 However , primary schools taught no Greek , and secondary schools very little ( e.g. two hours a week ) .
127 Thus , graduates did not learn the literate language or spelling and were not prepared to work in higher - level jobs or even submit applications for various services .
The diplomas of the Romanian schools were not recognized in Greece , and graduates could continue their studies only abroad .
Many immigrated to Romania , USA , and Australia .
Of those who stayed , some were stigmatized as communists or reactionaries and had a hard life , unable to find a good job .
128 In an effort to convince Vlachs that they were diaspora Romanians , the curricula taught that Vlachs descended from Pelasgians , Thracians , and ancient Macedonians who were not Greek .
129
These beliefs sometimes created personal problems , and some people spent their lives obsessed with the Vlach language or not feeling anywhere at home .
130 Given the traditional belief that Greek is the one who partakes of Greek education , ironically the Romanian schools succeeded in taking many Vlachs out of Hellenism .
The Dream that Became a Nightmare Romania ’s effort to claim the Vlach population finally bore fruit .
In December 1918 , the government acquired southern Dobrogea , a square part of northeastern Bulgaria with four prefectures that the Romanians called Cadrilatér .
Romanians constituted only 2.3 % of its population , 131 so the government called on the Vlachs of Greece and neighboring countries to move there and thus increase the Romanian - speaking population .
The government promised 50,000 and 100 stremmata of land to those willing to go .
The Greek government had no objection ; to the contrary , it encouraged the immigration of Vlachs .
The condition was that those moving to Romania had to abandon their Greek citizenship .
Through an agreement with Romania , the emigrants were declared non-Greeks and their descendants lost the rights to Greek citizenship .
In general , those who agreed to go were the poorer transhumant shepherds of central Macedonia , not the urban populations or those living around Olympus and southern Greece .
In some places like Veroia , the Romanian adherents exploited the economic competition of Greeks and Vlachs , 132 and 30 - 35 % of the Veroia Vlachs left , around 500 families .
The immigration was encouraged by people who organized the journeys and benefited from the sale of estates .
133
The immigrants had to pay a ticket of 1500 drachmas and another 1000 for travel expenses .
134 In 1925 - 36 , about 2000 - 2500 families ( total of 10,000 - 18,000 people ) sold their belongings and left by boat from Thessaloniki to Constanza .
In Cadrilatér , the colonists did not find things as promised .
They did not get 50,000 drachmas , just land that often did not have water .
The transformation from shepherds to farmers in marshlands was painful .
Besides malaria , they suffered from deadly tuberculosis .
135
And they had to deal with Bulgarian guerillas , who tried to take back Cadrilatér .
136
Some realized that Romania wanted them to ‘ pull the snake out of the hole ’ .
( See insert . )
Some tried to return to Greece , but they had lost their citizenships and their estates had changed hands .
Despite the difficulties , they did what they could in their new country , building schools and houses .
But peace did not last long for them .
In 1940 , at the insistence of Germany and through the treaty of Craiova , Romania returned southern Dobrogea to Bulgaria .
Suddenly one day the Vlachs lost everything and became homeless .
There was a population exchange , and they ended up as refugees in Constanza and other parts of Romania .
After the loss of Cadrilatér , Romania did not need them , and the Vlachs became a problem .
They adhered to royalist or right - wing politics and ( as discussed below ) created political problems in the country .
The communist government that came in power in 1947 closed many in concentration camps .
For the next 45 years , these people suffered many deprivations .
They suffered from poverty and hunger when Ceausescu sold the food of the country and from forced childbearing .
To visit Greece , six months of paperwork and waiting were necessary ; they could go only after their relatives invited them and offered to pay all expenses .
They could not even request political asylum because they had to leave family members behind .
Several became academics and scientists and did well , but most of their descendants live in modest conditions .
In 1930 , their relatives in Greece considered them fortunate , but since 1947 they felt sorry for them .
When the Vlachs immigrated to Cadrilatér , some women had a different opinion .
One person related to me that his mother did not want to acquire Romanian citizenship , even though she had given up the Greek one .
She remained stateless for many years and finally acquired the citizenship only because the government refused to admit him in school without that change .
Another woman was coerced into going by being told that she would never again see her teenage son , who had already been taken there .
Yet another refused to board the ship to Cadrilatér and had to be brought on by force .
And she was sick for days afterwards …
From Roman Legions to Fascism
The duty calls on us , as descendants of the ancient Roman Legions and our free brothers beyond the Danube to fight on the side of Italy and Germany .
» 137 The Roman legions had been dissolved centuries earlier , but the name continued to haunt the Vlachs .
In the 1930s , legionnaires ( legionari ) were the fascists of Europe .
Many Vlachs in Cadrilatér became members of right - wing nationalistic organizations , like the Iron Guard and some participated in political upheavals and pogroms in Romania .
Ion Duca , the prime - minister of Romania and leader of the National Liberation Party declared the organization illegal and arrested some of its members .
On December 21 , 1933 , Ion Caranica , Doru Belimace , and Nicolae Constantinescu ( the first two being Vlachs ) assassinated him as he descended from a train .
The desire of various countries to exploit the Vlachs ’ language did not end with Cadrilatér .
The next suitor was Italy , who in 1917 took over Epirus for a while and declare the ‘ Principate of Pindos ’ , hailing the Vlachs as ‘ lost brothers ’ .
This act was repeated in 1942 .
Alkiviadis Diamantis , who was from Samarina and lived in Romania , appeared as the ‘ prince of Pindos ’ .
Accompanied by Italian soldiers , he declared at a time of famine during the World War II , that Romania was sending a shipment of a million okades of wheat for distribution only to Vlachs .
Although the wheat did not arrive , the police confiscated flour that people bought for their homes , creating strong remonstrance and accusations that Greece was trying to kill off the Vlachs .
138 Violent conflicts erupted , some Vlachs were sent to remote islands and others were mistreated .
General George Tsolakoglou , who served as a prime minister during the German occupation , gave a secret order to local authorities to treat Vlachs better .
The Vlach community in Romania was also worried about the persecutions and new tribulations of the Vlachs and pressured the government again to intervene .
139
In 1942 , Diamantis founded the Roman Legion of Larissa , which admitted even some communist party members .
He tried to win the allegiance of educated Vlachs in Larissa .
The ‘ Legionnaires ’ mainly turned against the Vlachs who resisted their goals and tortured them , imprisoned them , sent them to concentration camps in Italy , or robbed those who organized the national resistance against the Germans .
140 After the end of the war , several ‘ legionnaires ’ were convicted as criminals and collaborators .
Some escaped to Romania , where the communists arrested them .
The borders of Romania closed , and many never appeared again in Greece .
The Romanian schools and churches of Greece that aided the occupation forces were also closed in 1944 - 45 .
The majority of the Vlachs who stood by Greece did not have much better fate .
Countless were killed in 1940 - 41 , fighting against the Germans and Italians , and many Vlach women help in the battles of Pindos .
Subsequently many were leaders in the resistance .
141 For this reason , most Vlach villages of Pindos were burned down by the Germans in 1943 - 44 , and the inhabitants were executed en masse .
Assimilation and Oblivion Fudzi haraua di la Armân Gone is the happiness of the Vlachs O gione o xinite o young man o immigrant s- pri fatsa cură fântâni on the face like a faucet run di lacriñi upărite hot tears ca si au maratsîl i –n cheptlu –alor because the poor peope have in their chest un dοr té treaca nu are a pain that does not go away s- kirire asteapta un popor and loss awaits a people când dulţea - i limbă keare when they lose their sweet language 142 After all the disasters of two wars , the safest thing for the surviving Vlachs was to hid and forget the language that got them into so much trouble .
It is as if they all decided that its use was a problem .
Thus , Aromanian is taught very little and is not officially used anywhere in Greece .
There is no radio program in Aromanian , no Vlach newspaper , just as there is none in Albanian or Serbomacedonian .
143
There are many Vlach associations , and an All Greece Association of Vlach Cultural Organizations .
However , they do not actively teach or promote the language .
For example the web page of the folkloric association of Veroia Vlachs ( www.vlahoi.gr) lists as activities the conservation of national attires , dance , singing , collection of folkloric and historic material , and old pictures .
But there is no language instruction , despite one mention that it is disappearing .
The relatively few Vlachs who know it well seem to be afraid to transmit it for fear of being branded anti-Greek .
The language had been struggling for a while .
After the Asia Minor catastrophe of 1922 , the government needed space to settle the refugees , and many Vlachs lost their grazing lands and wintering places after 1923 .
144 Gradually , more settled in urban areas , where many were assimilated by their Greek neighbors .
145 Occupations , social structures , and geographic isolation disappeared , and the people ’s particular code was lost with them .
146 In a Greek - speaking environment , a second language did not serve any special purpose .
Also , because of their relationship to villages , Vlach was often considered a language of low social status .
The families that rose abandoned it .
Perversely , the Romanian schools and the beliefs of the Legionnaires accelerated the loss of the language .
The cultural capital of the Vlachs was lost when thousands of people left or were killed , i.e. the older people who knew the language well and could teach traditions to the younger generations .
The language survived better in places where there had been no political problems , as in Metsovo .
There , the Romanian school closed in 1913 , and few people left for Cadrilatér .
147
Under these conditions , it is hard to maintain the language , even in villages where Vlachs live among themselves .
Middle - aged Vlachs may remember the grammar but have a limited vocabulary , while the young speakers do not know how to create derivatives of words or understand idioms used a few years earlier .
Unfortunately , the literate younger generation cannot learn either from books or from mass media .
Most Vlachs in contemporary Greece are hostile to Romanian leadership , and they refuse to adopt the spelling and style of the Romanian - educated people who wrote Vlach literature , poetry , and dictionaries .
148 Instead , the speakers of the 21st century say that the language has traditionally remained unwritten , so they do not use it for reading and writing .
It is even hard to agree on a script and spelling that make sense for Greeks .
The method of Katsanis and Dinas , that combines the Latin and Greek alphabets , seems to be gaining acceptance .
But there is no Vlach Academy to decide on uses and set standards .
Along with the script , there is a need to modernize the language .
Aromanian has a large and poetic vocabulary , but it expresses better the needs of the villagers than those of contemporary urban people .
To express contemporary topics , those living in Romania use Romanian words ( usually of Latin origin ) but in Greece these words are not commonly known except through foreign languages ( e.g. university , checks , bank , hotel ) .
One opinion is that local words should be used , even if these are Greek , eg. ‘ xenodohiul ’ rather than ‘ hotelul ’ .
But rather than conjugate Greek words in Vlach , it is easier to switch the code and use Greek grammar .
The result is expressions such as ‘ zeci hiliade lire metrisiasasi pano sto trapezi , multi dihonia , multi fagomara .
’149 The language is also declining in Romania , where it is considered a dialect .
The grandchildren of the Cadrilatér immigrants rarely know enough about the specific conjugations and vocabulary .
There are associations that try to preserve the culture , and some schools in Constanza teach Aromanian to the children .
In Romania there is a Vlach press , publishing poetry , prose , and some journals with Vlach topics .
150 Elsewhere , the activity is limited .
In the US and Germany there are organizations such as Societatea Farsarotul ( www.farsarotul.org) and Union für Aromunische Sprache und Kultur .
Often created by persons who studied in Romanian , they tend to propagate the theory of a separate identity .
Even so , few people spend much time on Vlach issues .
After 30 years , very few in the world will remember this language .
Intermarriage with the surrounding population is also depleting the people who identify themselves as Vlach or who know enough about the culture .
Until the middle of the 20th century , the rural Vlachs typically married among themselves .
151 Endogamy was important for keeping properties in the same groups , that also needed brides skilled in the needs of transhumant shepherds .
Vlach brides were sought after , but marriage with Greeks was condemned ; 152 a folk song describes a father who refuses to give his daughter to a Greek and who says that Greeks and Vlachs do not intermarry .
153 The Vlachs who went to Cadrilatér continued the endogamy .
Their children married among themselves , but their grandchildren have overcome this taboo as well .
Recent Developments
The Koutsovlach issue has been long forgotten in Greece and is a topic mainly for a few old men .
The partition of the Vlachs took place three generations ago , and only a few old people survive from the original Cadrilatér immigrants .
Now that Greece faces a low birth rate and immigration of completely foreign people , the decision to encourage thousands of Greek citizens to move to Romania seems unfortunate .
But it is hard to judge the politics of that time with today ’s criteria .
In the beginning of the 20th century , it was important to form a country without populations of hostile and irredentist beliefs .
If the Vlachs who went to Cadrilatér had stayed in Greece , there might have been more pro-Italian ‘ legionnaires ’ during the German occupation .
The combination of Greek and Romanian politics proved disastrous for the Vlachs .
Perhaps few other populations have been disrupted so much because of a language .
Greek authorities up to the mid-20th century behaved in a narrow - minded and undiplomatic way toward the pro-Romanian Vlachs , while they took care of the Asia Minor refugees , even those who spoke only Turkish .
154 The authorities rarely tried to win the Vlachs ’ allegiance or offer constructive alternatives to the Romanian propaganda .
With their behavior they scared some people into conformity but lost many others and were internationally accused of oppressing minorities .
155 Many problems would have been avoided if the Patriarchate allowed mass in Vlach ( not in Romanian ) instead of pushing people into viewpoints that they often did not believe in .
The narrow - mindedness and attentiveness to appearances have repeatedly caused the Greek people and the Orthodox Church to lose friends and adherents .
156 Over the years , Greece has maintained its homogenizing policy , which is credited by some as helping avoid the Balkan conflicts that exploded since 1990 .
The country has to maintain a difficult balance between the rights of citizens to believe whatever they want and the need to avoid any possible rise of violent irredentism .
In fact , its policies towards Vlachs as people have been kind .
The Vlachs of Albania have been accepted as Greeks from northern Epirus and have received residency .
Thus thousands of Arvanitovlachs immigrated , who did not know a word of Greek but who got jobs and have been supporting their families back home .
But the 1990s disputes with FYROM about the name of Macedonia have echoed the old Romanian teachings on origins of ancient Macedonians .
Perhaps also the spectre of Pindus Vlachs fighting for independence or ‘ legionnaire ’ terrorism somehow remains , because the Greek government continues to be suspicious of those who espouse the old pro-Romanian or separatist beliefs .
A citizen was convicted in 2001 because he circulated a pamphlet of the Council of Europe regarding minority languages .
157
An old man ’s citizenship was taken away without his knowledge because he published a magazine that promoted the old arguments .
158 Hooligans burned books from FYROM during a book fair , which included Vlach books .
( Surely no one knew enough to tell them apart . )
Unfortunately , such actions bring back to life an issue forgotten long ago and create a cause for sarcastic articles abroad that mock the presumed democratic ideals of Greece .
Even the website of the Turkish Ministry of External Affairs ( www.mfa.tr) mentions that the Vlachs enjoyed greater freedoms under the Ottoman Empire .
Likewise , the government has remained very cool towards the descendants of the Cadrilatér emigrants .
The Greek embassy in Bucharest that teaches Greek to interested people could approach the Vlach organizations and invite them to participate , but it has not .
Normally , persons who can prove a Greek origin are entitled to Greek citizenship , but this group is not because of the old bilateral treaty .
Citizenship applications by persons born in Romania are screened to find out whether their forefathers abandoned their citizenship under the treaty .
( The old records are incomplete , and not all cases are found . )
Nevertheless , time is healing this issue .
In preparation to enter the European Union , Romania has rescinded its old position that Vlachs are diaspora Romanians and in need of special protection .
After Romanians receive the right to move freely in the European Union , the descendants of the Cadrilatér Vlachs will be able to live in Greece if they so desire .
The Vlach language has attracted the interest of the Council of Europe , which tries to conserve minority languages .
On June 24 , 1997 , the Council adopted decision 1333 ( 1997 ) that recommends measures for the maintenance and dissemination of the language , and its use in television , radio , and churches .
159 During a subsequent visit to the Metsovo area , Mr. Stephanopoulos , President of the Hellenic Republic , encouraged the inhabitants to speak and teach their language .
160 But the Council of Europe recommendations have yet to be implemented .
Some people might indeed try through mass media to convince Vlachs that they are minorities , even when their grandparents thought otherwise .
Nevertheless , a strong record of civil rights may do the most to convince people that it is worthwhile being Greek .
History has shown that governmental and church rigidity may create bigger problems than any foreign meddling .
The European emphasis on minority languages has increased the interest in the Vlachs of Greece .
A four - volume research by a teacher named Asterios Koukoudis received an Academy of Athens prize in 1998 , and several other books have been published since 2000 .
But an effort to teach Aromanian at Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki stopped due to limited student interest and cancellation of funds by a Vlach organization .
Thus , Aromanian is taught in Freiburg , Germany ( and by people who believe that Vlachs are not Greek ) , but continues to be neglected in Greece .
The challenge for all who love the old language and its songs is to preserve it and cultivate it while avoiding political pitfalls .
It is unknown whether the Vlachs are a distinct ethnicity , but the mixed marriages have scattered their genes in the general population of Greece .
The issue is no longer whether the Vlachs are Greek .
It is we , the Greeks , at least the inhabitants of Macedonia , Thessaly , and Epirus , who have become a little Vlach .
Maybe we should give more respect and attention to the forgotten heritage shared by some of our ancestors and relatives .

The Meglenites called themselves Vlau ( singular ) and Vlasi ( plural ) .
The arvanitovlachs call themselves Ramani rather than Armani .
This nomenclature may have created problems for some , because people thought they considered themselves Romanians .

Some Vlach villages are in FYROM and Albania : Krusovo , Megarovo , Tyrnovo , Monastir , Milovista , Gopesi , Beala , Ohrida , etc. ( Nikolas Siokis , personal correspondence , 2/2003 ) 21 Estimates are difficult due to a lack of census information and political bias .
Weigand ( 1895 ) concluded there were about 100,000 in Greece and another 500.000 in the Balkans , and Winnifrith ( 2002 ) agrees with the larger number .
The Romanian propaganda mentioned 1,200,000 ( Romanos , p. 14 ) .
After the union of northern Greece , of the approximately 160,000 Macedonian Vlachs , 102,000 ended up in Greece , 30,000 in FYROM , 13,500 in Albania , and about 10,000 in Bulgaria , Kosovo , Serbia , and Bosnia ( Koukoudis , 2000 , vol. 3 , p. 40 ) .
25 The Arvanitovlachs lived around Moschopolis in southern Albania , spoke Vlach and Albanian ; sometimes they knew Greek , other times not ( Exarhos 2001 , vol. 2 p. 58 ) .
They call themselves Ramâni rather than Armâni , and the similarity with the word Romanian may have convinced Greeks that they considered themselves Romanian .
29 Greek knowledge among the poor may have been due to the efforts by the monk Kosmas Aitolos ( 1714 - 1779 ) to open a school in every Epirus village so that the Vlachs , Arvanites , as well as those speaking various Greek dialects could learn Greek .
30 According to the Serbian professor Dusan Popovich ( Zafiris , p. 201 ) .
Many Vlachs were named Socrates , Achilleas , Homer , Agamemnon , Cassandra , Antigone ( Zafiris , p. 140 ) .
These names also became fashionable among the Greeks during the same period .

33 Boys who studied in the 6 - grade high school of Monastir came from many Vlach villages .
E.g. Milovista had 1092 orthodox and 506 Romanizers , Megarovo had 2416 Vlach speakers and 100 Moslems , Neveska had 1092 Orthodox Greeks and 60 Romanizers ( data by Chalkiopoulos , in Iliadou 2003 , p. 84 ) .
The principal in 1897 - 1906 was Alexandros Zoumetikos , subsequently last principal of the Greek high school of Adrianoupolis .
34 Research by Kahl ( 2001 ) .
In all areas of Pelagonia , the Greek population consisted basically of Vlachs .
E.g. in Resna , at the end of the 19th century there were 660 Hellenes of whom 650 were Vlach and 10 Greek .

During a Byzantine expedition against the Avars in Thrace ( 579 - 582 AD ) there was a danger that the load might fall of a mule .
Then the voice of the mule driver was heard speaking in the ‘ father ’s tongue ’ .

And though the mule driver did not hear the voice , the soldiers heard it and thought that the enemies were telling them that and they ran away shouting ‘ torna torna ’ ( «τη πα τρώα φωνή .

Some , like the monk Daniel , wanted to wipe out the Balkan languages .
Daniel composed his dictionary so that the children of the Moesiodacians could get used to the Greek language ( « δια να σ υνηθίσουν οι τ ων Μοισ ιοδάκ ων παίδε ς την Ρωμαϊκήν γ λώ σσαν » ) .
Rigas Fereos , like Kosmas Aitolos , believed that all the Balkan people should learn Greek .

69 Caragiu 1996 , « Twelve irrefutable and historical truths about the Aromans : ( 1 ) the Aromans exist today and for the last 2000 years , ( 2 ) They originated south of the Danube and are a continuation of latinized European populations ( Macedonians , Greeks , Thracians , Ilyrians ) , ( 3 ) They all spoke proto-romanian ( staroromâna ) , ( 4 ) The place where Aromanian was spoken was divided through the Slavic invasions , ( 5 ) Proto - Romanian was divided in four dialects - languages , ( 6 ) Aromanian is the mother tongue of the Aromanians and gives them their ethnolinguistic conscience , ( 7 ) There are two categories of Vlachs , indigenous and in diaspora , ( 8 ) The position of the indigenous Aromans who live in the Balkan countries is quite different from that of the diaspora Aromans .
( 9 ) The diaspora Aromans have a particular position – they went to Romania by choice .
( 10 ) They should be called Aromans and Macedono - Vlachs , ( 11 ) The Aromans are Orthodox Christians .
( 12 ) The Aromans must have one goal , to cultivate their language and their traditions .
70 " The Vlachs , this very interesting people are not Greek at all but a race of nomads , who come down from the Balkan lands in the winter with their flock and pass the cold months in Greece .
They are shepherds by business , and their tribal name has become a sort of synonym for an ancient profession . "
( .A. Wigram D.D. - Hellenic Travel , Faber and Faber Ltd. , London 1947 , p.109-11 ) Mentioned in www.vlachnet.gr 74 Papanace 1996 .

Some particularities in the pronunciation of the words show use since the Roman years .
( Lazarou 1999a , p. 17 ) 80 Thomas Winnifrith , presentation at the 8th MacedonoVlach Congress in Trumbull , Connecticut , USA ( July 4 - 6 2003 ) .
The Romans displaced population from Dacia , and later populations moved back to contemporary Romania .
However , When Kekavmenos wrote about Dacians , he might be referring to Dacia Mediterranea and not to the Romanian Dacia , or perhaps to another place , because place names were often confused .
82 Cavalli-Sforza , 1994 .
83 Worldwide this is happening right now in record numbers .
Historically , many Hellenistic era Jews spoke Greek , although they were not allowed to marry pagans .
The African slaves of the 16th century lost their languages in one generation because they could only communicate among them in English .
Jamaicans are not related to the inhabitants of Samoa , though both peoples use Creole or pidgin English .
There are also example of remote populations who conserved a language , such as Gaelic among some Scots and Irish .
The Vlachs may be such an example .
86 The words are common and coincide with standard Latin .
The people who pronounced them could be speaking proto-Balkan or another form of Latin. 92 Τοσοῦτον δ' ἀπολέλοιπεν ἡ πόλι ς ἡμῶν περὶ τὸ φ ρονε ῖν καὶ λ έγειν τοὺ ς ἄλλο υ ς ἀν θρώπους , ὥσθ ' οἱ ταύτη ς μαθηταὶ τῶν ἄλλων διδά σ καλοι γ εγ όνασιν , καὶ τὸ τῶν Ἑλλήν ων ὄνομα πεποίηκ εν μηκέτι τοῦ γένου ς , ἀλλὰ τῆ ς διανοία ς δοκεῖν εἶναι , καὶ μᾶλλον Ἕλληνα ς καλεῖσθαι τοὺ ς τῆ ς παιδ ε ύ σ ε ω ς τῆ ς ἡ μετέ ρας ἢ τοὺ ς τῆ ς κοινῆ ς φύ σε ω ς μετέχοντα ς.

Many Vlachs of Serres during 1890 supported the Greeks , spoke Greek , and some were inspectors of Greek schools ( Weigand , p. 273 ) .

The poem attributed to Rigas Feraios states that Napoleon was going to save « la Armâname sh la Grecame sh la tuta Crishtiname » ( the Vlachs , the Greeks , and all of Christendom - Exarhos 1994 , p. 355 ) 99 Asterios Koukoudis ( 2000 , p. 33 , vol. 3 ) cites Mr. Zioga from Perithori of Nevrokopi , Serres .

4 , p. 121 . 105 Perhaps the city was chosen because the Vlachs of Serbia were being assimilated ( Papathanasiou , p. 88 ) Perhaps the Romanian - speaking Fanariotes considered Romanian a modern form of Aromanian , particularly after many Slavic words were tossed out around 1850 .
By contrast , the Greek taught in schools was ancient and incomprehensible to the uneducated .
107 One positive outcome was that the Greek authorities opened schools in the Vlach villages as well .
Thus , the Vlach villages had more teachers than all of France , and around 1890 , the Vlachs were almost all literate ( Weigand , p. 343 ) .
The letters of the Perdichi family show that women who attended Romanian schools around 1900 could write in practiced calligraphic writing .
The sentences were mainly in Romanian with some Vlach words .
110 Zafiris p. 206 .
Because of the food subsidies , a few non-Vlach children would also attend .
112 Peyfuss p. 84 .
After 1913 , 88 % of Vlach children attended Greek schools ( Mertzos , p. 100 ) .
113 Koukoudis p. 233- vol .
4 . 115 A Vlach dies in Monastir in 1904 , and his brother wanted to bury him under the care of a Vlach speaking priest , whose ordination the Patriarchate did not recognize .
A crowd of people took over the hearse and did not permit the burial .
The Turkish authorities embalmed the body and postponed the burial until they received instructions from the Sultan , who finally decided that he should be buried without priests ( Tega , p. 55 ) .
121 Peyfuss , 1994 , p. 86 .
125 Papathanasiou , p. 90 .
Thus the price paid for the Greek control of Thessaloniki was the Romanization of some Vlachs .
128 Papathanasiou , p. 77 .
The Greek government could have aligned their curricula with the Greek curricula and allowed only the instruction of Aromanian or Romanian languages , but apparently there was no such effort .

The Romanian Instrument of National Propaganda Romanian Colonizers Welcome to the chest of the mother country .
You are finally here , at the chest of the mother country , who is accepting you with the great love of mother and who will never forsake you in the critical moments of your life .
Colonizers !
If thus far you have only heard the story of the rich land of the mother country , you wil then taste her fruits and feel that it is the Mother Country .
Colonizers !
Remember here all the places that were dear to you there in the great GREAT PLAINS OF MACEDONIA , from its hills to the plains of MEGLENA , of relatives and friends at the GANDACIA mountain your dear mountains , the great river VARDARI , the streets you walked listening to birds singing , think of your flocks of sheep , your communities , the GREAT PLAINS , your church , your cemetery where your parents , siblings , ancesters rest , your villages .
You must quickly forget all these things , however , when you step on the land of GREAT ROMANIA .
You must forget when you start a new household , and you must be proud that the Mother Country receives you with pleasure , and you can rely on her for anything you need , because we know that you will even give your life and that you will not leave unpunished the enemies who try to bother her .
For whatever the Mother Country has to give from now on , you also have to give .
You should have deference and faith in her and in His Majesty the monarch Michael A ’. Colonists !
From today you carry on your shoulders a big burden with much responsibility .
Aside form your duties as colonizers , do not forget that you have another duty , to maintain peace in this corner of the country .
Be vigilant every moment and be united with all .
Welcome Livadiotes to the Mother Country .

Despite what a recent PETA ad would have you believe , some vegetarians are fat .
Take , for example , the herbiverous and tubby Dugong .
Dugongs have long been hunted for their fat , meat , and oil and they ’re easy targets : they swim slowly through shallow waters munching on seagrass like a cow on pasture .
In fact , they ’re often called seacows .
Though dugongs are protected in the US under the Endangered Species Act , some are still killed by motorboat collisions and poachers .
There are about 100,000 dugongs left , the majority in Australian waters .
Like their relative the elephant , dugongs can grow huge : up to 11 feet in length and 2,000 pounds in weight .
The shy animals can only stay underwater for about 6 minutes , and sometimes “ stand ” on their tail flukes to push their heads to the surface , holding their front flippers in front of them like arms .
This activity , combined with the dugong ’s distinctive head and body shape , not to mention its “ conspicuous ” nipples , is thought to have inspired lovelorn sailors ’ tales of mermaids and sirens .
Accordingly , dugongs ( along with manatees ) belong to the order Sirenia
The dugong ’s long lifespan ( 70 years ) and a slow reproduction rate ( one calf every 3 to 7 years ) makes it less able to adapt to environmental changes than smaller , more fertile animals like squid or jellyfish .
However , unlike some other animals , the dugong has no set breeding period and can mate year round .
Although unusual now , there used to be “ herds ” of hundreds of dugongs , who would segregate cream - colored young in a “ nursery ” while blue - grey adults foraged for food .
Now , most dugong groups sighted have only 6 or so members .
Unfortunately ( or fortunately , depending on how you look at it ) dugongs are rarely found in captivity , but you can “ adopt ” your own dugong via the World Wildlife Fund here .

Behind - the - Scenes With The Ellen DeGeneres Show's Workflow
When The Ellen DeGeneres Show started in 2002 , it was standard - def and housed on the NBC lot .
All the changes came six years later .
Building a new facility coincided beautifully with the producers ’ other interest : switching from standard definition to high definition , and from tape to tapeless .
That path soon became a journey with a bump in the road and a happy destination .
“ The show was very excited to move to the Warner Bros. lot .
It is such a great place to work , ” explains Derek Westervelt , the show ’s executive in charge of production and senior producer .
“ After Telepictures designed and purchased a technical package we wanted , the studio built the facility from the ground up for us .
And it is fantastic . ”
Readying the new facility for season six , the systems integrator recommended moving from Avid to Apple Final Cut Pro in lieu of Avid .
Previously , had cut with Avid Meridiens , adding the Unity by season three to allow multiple editors to work on the show simultaneously .
The thought of switching to another editing system was met with reluctance .
“ Our editors were very familiar with Avid and it was such a stable , reliable system , ” says Westervelt .
“ So there was a bit of concern from that point of view alone .
Why change ? ”
As it turned out , says Westervelt , the new facility performed smoothly in many ways .
“ This complex was built top to bottom , with all the broadcast and post infrastructure , ” he says .
“ We were in very good shape on the broadcast side . ”
But stresses showed up in post - production .
Once the new editing system was in place , it was n’t long before everyone had second thoughts .
“ While Final Cut Pro was good in some ways , it became quickly apparent that it was n’t the right application for us , ” says Westervelt .
Ã¢Â€Â˜A Trying Season ’
Senior editor Clark Burnett , who started on the show in season two as a freelancer and has been full - time for the last three seasons , says the transition from SD to HD , and from tape to tapeless , was “ interesting . ”
“ We made it work , but it was a trying season , ” he says .
Because the editing team was so used to Avid Unity as a way to collaborate and share editing duties , it was a rude shock to lose that easy capability .
“ We were so used to working with a lot of last - minute needs , ” says Burnett .
“ Last season , we could n’t do that without workarounds – and there were tons of workarounds . ”
Westervelt agrees .
“ The workarounds took additional time that became challenging , ” he says .
“ We did n’t miss deadlines , but we scrambled hard to make it . ”
Perhaps no one felt the pain more than Telepictures Productions Engineer Jason Schroeder , who worked through several round - the - clock shifts during the start - up period .
According to Schroeder , one of the problems was that the entire system did n’t have enough storage capacity .
“ Front Porch Digital offered to work with us to achieve the results that were originally promised to the Ellen post department for their long - term data archive , and chose its DIVArchive as the solution , ” says Schroeder .
“ Sitting between the applications and our IBM LTO - 4 tape library , Front Porch delivered on their promise .
[ The DIVArchive ] responds well within the system and does a fantastic job . ”
Re-evaluating Workflow
As everyone struggled through the season , Omneon and HP gave Schroeder the support needed to re-evaluate the workflow .
The show ’s Omneon Spectrum media server could be paired with the Unity by using Marquis Broadcast ’s Medway media - transfer and format - conversion software .
“ With this technology , the staff was looking at a very easy solution on how to integrate their previous gear with an Avid Unity , ” says Schroeder .
“ Their efforts enabled the post department to salvage a majority of the media - asset - management infrastructure and focus entirely on delivering a robust edit solution . ”
The Marquis transfer is extremely fast , says Schroeder .
“ It ’s so fast that it ’s pretty much a real - time record transfer off the Omneon to the Unity , ” he says .
“ Within anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute of the act finishing , the editors have it . ”
The Marquis transfer engines make the media available on the Unity first , and then the editors used DaletPlus for long - term management on the show ’s near - line and LTO - 4 data archives .
It was n’t hard to figure out that , with Final Cut , the editors also needed more time to do tasks that had previously been seamless , even in the background .
“ When I was cutting on the [ Final Cut ] system and did n’t have to share , I had no problems with it , ” says Burnett .
“ The moment we tried to treat it like a Unity , it did n’t work the way I was used to .
I would have to create a new project and copy it into another system .
The system just was n’t a good fit for what we do here . ”
“ By the middle of season six , we knew we would come back to Avid , ” says Westervelt .
“ It was a matter of how to do it . ”
Transitioning Back to Avid … Slowly
How they did it was slowly .
While season six was still in production , Avid brought in four edit bays .
“ We did a beta - test situation where every Friday we would cut one show on the Avids , ” says editor Burnett .
“ We did our teaser as well .
We did have issues , but Avid kept stepping up and dealing with them immediately . ”
The trick was not only introducing the new Avid system , but using it simultaneously with the existing editing system .
That ’s when Schroeder did something rather unconventional : he swapped out the xSAN storage and put in a Unity .
“ One of the amazing benefits of Unity today , to Avid ’s credit , is that it ’s open to connecting with [ other editing systems ] , ” says Schroeder .
“ We took full advantage of that here .
One of my technical challenges was to make sure the editors could finish season six while we were ramping up for season seven .
The end result was awesome .
I had FCP and Avid editors using the same SAN .
Technically , Final
Cut ca n’t use the media that Avid creates , but the ability for both platforms to operate on the same SAN volume gave us an enormous amount of flexibility we never had . ”
By the end of season six , 10 Avid Media Composer Nitris DX systems had moved inside the show ’s post - production facility .
One of them is used in a unique way : it sits in the equipment room , and is used remotely by StudioCity , the company that produces the show ’s promos .
StudioCity editors are able to access the Avid with Apple Remote Desktop and a VPN connection , select their shots , and play out the HD clips directly over fiber , compressed using an Evertz JPEG - 2000 card .
Plenty of Storage
The show ’s new system also has plenty of storage : 64 TB of Avid Unity ( online ) , 100 TB of HP EVA storage ( nearline ) , and 400 TBs of IBM LTO - 4 tape storage ( deep archive ) .
Considering that Season 6 started with only 16 TB of editing storage and barely 100 TB of LTO - 4 tape storage , the post - production staff feels like it has arrived at a system that fits the model of what ’s needed .
“ Avid ’s new campaign is about listening to customers , ” says Schroeder , who reports that he ’s logged no overtime yet this season .
“ It is n’t just a slogan .
With Avid , they value communication very highly , and that speaks volumes about why we ’re reinvesting in that company . ”
For the editors , the return to Avid editing systems provoked sighs of relief .
“ The new Avid is slick , ” says Burnett .
“ This is going back to what everyone loved about the Meridiens .
It ’s a dependable , solid box . ”
He is also now enjoying the benefits of the tapeless workflow .
“ The one thing that ’s amazing about tapeless is how I can bring back all the media , ” he says .
“ Before , we would output it split four - channel track .
I would digitize and cut it .
Now all the media is there and it comes back quickly and slickly . ”
Westervelt says it did n’t take long to get up to full speed again .
“ The Unity we have is very quick , ” he says .
“ They can retrieve and shuffle their media effortlessly , so our problems there have been resolved . ”
With season seven in its early days , Westervelt looks forward to expanding the show creatively .
“ We ’re starting to branch out and do more live shots , ” he says .
“ We ’re exploring ways to do that in a more fun , accessible way .
We ’ve been doing sequences using Skype and Twitter to connect with the audience , and they love it . ”
“ The show has a lot of components to it every day , ” he says .
“ Some of them are regular - we ’re a day - and - date show - we also have music acts , live remotes .
Bringing those disparate elements together every day is a challenge .
And Avid , in almost every way , makes that do - able for us .
When we want to take that challenge to a new level , Avid is a ready tool to take what ’s thrown at it . ”
It ’s hard to know whether to laugh or cry after reading the reactions of analysts and officials in the Middle East to President Obama ’s Cairo speech .
“ It ’s not what he says , but what he does , ” many said .
No , ladies and gentlemen of the Middle East , it is what he says and what you do and what we do .
We must help , but we ca n’t want democracy or peace more than you do .
What should we be doing ?
The follow - up to the president ’s speech will have to be led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
This will be her first big test , and , for me , there is no question as to where she should be putting all her energy : on the peace process .
No , not that peace process  not the one between Israelis and Palestinians .
That one ’s probably beyond diplomacy .
No , I ’m talking about the peace process that is much more strategically important  the one inside Iraq .
The most valuable thing that Mrs. Clinton could do right now is to spearhead a sustained effort  along with the U.N. , the European Union and Iraq ’s neighbors  to resolve the lingering disputes between Iraqi factions before we complete our withdrawal .
( We ’ll be out of Iraq ’s cities by June 30 and the whole country by the close of 2011 . )
TOKYO , Japan —
In the country with the lowest birth rate in the world , the newly empowered Democratic Party of Japan has proposed a solution : pay to procreate .
As part of the manifesto that helped the DPJ rout the long - ruling Liberal Democratic Party in last month ’s election , families will receive 26,000 yen ( about $ 280 ) per month for each child through junior high school .
“ We could use the money ; it would help us manage , ” said Jun Otake , a human resources manager at Japan Airlines who stands to receive $ 840 per month for his three young daughters .
“ People need help regardless of the number of children , but obviously more children mean more mouths to feed . ”
Otake , 41 , should know .
He and wife Yuki are raising their daughters , ages 11 , 7 and 2 , in an 800 - square foot apartment with two bedrooms and a single bathroom that Jun , as the only man in the house , finds ever - more frequently off limits .
To support this modest lifestyle , Jun commutes to work 90 minutes each way from the Tokyo suburb of Fujisama , not arriving home until midnight .
Yuki , who gave up her own career 12 years ago , juggles the care of the girls .
Their only time together on weekdays comes during mandatory 7 a.m. family breakfast .
It is n’t easy to raise children in Japan , where the birth rate of 1.37 children per woman has fallen well below the replacement level of 2.07 and contributed to structural problems facing the world ’s fastest - aging society .
The reasons cited are myriad : the cost of schooling , a lack of daycare options and an increasing number of women unwilling to interrupt or forego their careers among them .
But the new measure , which mirrors similar programs in other countries ( France , for example , for years has heavily subsidized the cost of raising children ) , is not without its critics .
The child stipend plan — part of the DPJ ’s populist agenda that includes making high school education free and removing tolls on highways — has been criticized by economists who question whether the $ 54 billion program , which costs more than the country ’s defense budget , is affordable .
Furthermore , women without children wonder if the money would be better spent on increasing the number of day care centers and other methods to help women return to work after giving birth .
“ The child allowance is not a fundamental solution , ” said Vivian Tokai , 41 , director of government relations at an international conglomerate who is married but has no children .
She and her husband , a marketing executive at a Japanese brewery , live in Tokyo ’s Akihabara neighborhood , where waiting lists for public day care facilities are long .
Last October , more than 40,000 Japanese children were unable to register with government - approved day care centers , which are larger than their private counterparts and have better resources , such as playgrounds .
The DPJ proposed the allowance “ as a bargaining chip to get elected , ” Tokai said .
“ The government needs to overhaul the fundamental things .
Finding child care is very , very difficult . ”
Tell that to Mayumi Yamamoto and her American husband , Brad Horton , college professors who are raising a 6 - year - old daughter in one of Tokyo ’s most child - rich wards .
It took Yamamoto , 49 , and Horton , 42 , more than two years to find a spot for Shiori because their neighborhood center concluded that the couple was working only part - time at their universities and rated them as lower priorities than families with two working parents .
The ordeal was so difficult and protracted that the couple decided not to have a second child , Horton said .
“ That ’s one less child living in Japan , ” he added ruefully .
For working women who succeed in finding care for their children , the costs add up .
Eiko Tanaka , who works in the Tokyo branch of a Danish pharmaceutical company , pays about $ 478 per month to send her daughter to day care each day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Tanaka recently returned to work after taking a year off to care for her second daughter , who recently entered a nursery .
Still , Tanaka said she and her husband can afford the costs , adding that the child allowance , which will be paid to all families regardless of income , should be limited to poorer families .
“ I do n’t like that they are giving it to everybody , ” Tanaka said .
But Naoko Kaihata , 36 , a senior consultant at the Tokyo office of CB Richard Ellis real estate firm , said she and her husband , who works as a research analyst at the Bank of Yokohama , welcome the stipend to help raise their 4 - year - old daughter , whose day care costs more than $ 500 per month .
“ It is not so much that we think we will spend more on our daughter ’s stuff or family expenses , but this does help us feel more secure for our future , ” Kaihata said .
She paused , then added that the government also must spur economic growth by creating incentives for businesses .
“ If I ca n’t get a job in the future , a child stipend is not enough , ” Kaihata said .
“ I will feel insecure and I will start to think I do not want any more kids . ”
New Water Fountains Fill Only Non-Disposable Bottles in UK
September 1st , 2009 by Beth Graddon - Hodgson
[ social_buttons ]
A new water dispensing technology created by UK designer Oliver Craig could change the way that European shoppers and commuters drink water , and it ’s a technology that could help eliminate water bottle waste that ’s cluttering international landfills greatly due to increased convenience .
Today , it can be a challenge to get a refill of fresh water from a hygienic source when on the go , so many commuters and shoppers traversing the UK streets who find themselves thirsty are forced to go into a local shop to purchase a bottle to get their fix .
With the Source Water Dispensing System by Oliver Craig , thirsty people will no longer have the excuse of inconvenience or inaccessibility that leads them to buy bottled water .
The Source Water Bottle Dispensing System is designed to be purchased by retail shops and other businesses in the UK and placed in the street , so that those passing by can stop in for a refill .
The catch is that the special water bottles must be purchased from the high street shops in order to give them access to fresh , clean drinking water .
For hygienic purposes the water bottles have a valve in the base , so that the part of the bottle that makes contact with the mouth never comes in contact with the dispensing machine , therefore eliminating the opportunity for germs to pass from one person to another .
The Source Water Bottle Dispensing System comes with an added perk that benefits both the high - street businesses that have installed the machine and the thirsty green - minded person passing by in need of a drink , since contained in the water bottle by Source and the system is an RFID Technology that transfers points to the bottle .
Since these points can be redeemed at the retail location , shoppers and commuters have an added incentive to use the green water system with the prospect of free merchandise ; and the shop itself recruits new clientele to their brand .
As society moves away from purchasing drinks in disposable bottles , there ’s a whole word of opportunity for new technologies and gadgets that help us adopt a waste - free water bottle way of life .

The extension of pro- democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s house arrest Tuesday highlighted divisions in the international community over how to respond to Myanmar ’s ruling generals , with Western powers blasting the court decision but neighboring powers remaining pointedly mute .
A Myanmar court , backed by the ruling generals , convicted Suu Kyi of violating national security laws and extended her house arrest by 18 months in what supporters at home and abroad have dismissed as a show trial .
The sentence in effect removes Suu Kyi from playing any public role in elections expected to take place in May .
The U.S. , Britain , France and the European Union harshly criticized the court ’s decision , and the British - chaired U.N. Security Council said it would hold a closed - door session to discuss the sentence .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon , who failed to win permission from the generals to see Suu Kyi during a visit to Myanmar last month , again demanded her “ immediate and unconditional release . ”
But Myanmar ’s neighbors and trading partners China and India remained silent on the case , underscoring the difficulty of forging a concerted international response to Suu Kyi ’s continued imprisonment .
Advertisement
Tuesday ’s verdict would appear to leave Myanmar ’s critics without a clear way forward .
Before Suu Kyi’s arrest and trial , there were growing calls from Western governments to ease sanctions and engage in dialogue with the generals .
Last month , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton hinted at the prospect of U.S. investment in Myanmar should the military government release Suu Kyi and more than 2,000 other reported political prisoners .
Such overtures have withered as it became apparent that the generals will continue to defy appeals for leniency .
“ The verdict has made it more difficult to do anything , ” said David Steinberg , a Myanmar expert at Georgetown University .
Advertisement
“ And the U.N. Security Council -- the generals are n’t worried about that .
[ Senior Gen . ]
Than Shwe said to Ban Ki-moon , ‘ Look , we ’re having free and fair elections next year . ’
And , at least publicly , the secretary - general bought it . ”
The Obama administration is toeing a harder line than some analysts predicted this year when it began its ongoing policy review for Myanmar , also known as Burma .
President Obama recently renewed long - standing trade and investment sanctions , including a ban on the import of Myanmar gems .
“ There are a number of studies going on right now for making modifications to the current policy , but after this , the Burmese must make some significant concessions , do something really remarkable , to give any rationale for a policy change , ” Steinberg said .
Suu Kyi was arrested in May after an uninvited American , John Yettaw , 53 , swam across a lake to enter her home .
Yettaw was sentenced to three years in prison for breaching Suu Kyi’s house security and an additional four years with hard labor for immigration and other violations .

“ The whole trial was politically motivated and began as a deliberate attempt to jail her , ” said Bo Kyi , secretary of the Assistance Assn. for Political Prisoners , a humanitarian group based in the refugee camp of Mae Sot in Thailand .
“ The regime wants to attach a criminal record to Aung San Suu Kyi ’s life , which they think will prevent her role in politics and in public life . ”
Thousands of supporters and security personnel gathered outside the courtroom at Yangon ’s Insein Prison for the culmination of the trial .
The military - backed court initially sentenced the 64 - year - old Suu Kyi to a three - year prison term , including hard labor .
But after a short recess , a high - ranking official read aloud a special order from Than Shwe , the chief of the military government , reducing the sentence by half and allowing the ailing Nobel Peace Prize laureate to serve the time at her villa in Yangon .
A witness in Yangon said unrest broke out in front of the prison , with as many as 50 people taken away in security vans .
Advertisement
State - run television was replaying the announcement of Suu Kyi ’s verdict from early afternoon onward .
“ They want to highlight the fact that Aung San Suu Kyi gets her sentence reduced , ” said Aye Thar Aung , secretary of the opposition National League for Democracy - aligned Committee Representing People ’s Parliament , who went to Insein Prison to hear the verdict .
“ But what the regime has shown to Burma and the world is they can punish a great leader with a jail sentence on ridiculous charges . ”
Suu Kyi , leader of the National League for Democracy , has been in detention for 14 of the last 20 years , mostly under house arrest .
Her party won elections in 1990 , but the military government rejected the results and put her in custody .
Advertisement
A much - disputed constitution enacted in 2008 bars Suu Kyi from standing in next year ’s national vote on the basis that her late husband , with whom she had children , was a British citizen .
But many analysts think her presence in the campaign would greatly aid the opposition forces .
Suu Kyi’s party has said it will not participate unless the government releases the more than 2,000 reported political prisoners it holds and reviews the 2008 charter .
“ This is not only the regime ’s rejection of NLD ’s call for review of the controversial 2008 constitution , but also ensures that Aung San Suu Kyi cannot play any role in the coming 2010 election , ” said Naing Aung of the Thailand - based Forum for Democracy in Burma .

“ Then , to deflect any serious reaction to this complete injustice , the regime sends her back home for house arrest . ”

DESPITE a recession that reduced global arms sales last year , the United States expanded its role as the world 's leading weapons supplier , increasing its share to more than two - thirds of all foreign armaments deals , according to a new congressional study .
The US signed weapons deals valued at $ US37.8 billion ( $ 47.8 billion ) in 2008 - 68.4 per cent of international sales - up from $ US25.4 billion the previous year .
The growth was particularly noticeable against worldwide trends .
The value of global arms sales in 2008 was $ US55.2 billion , a drop of 7.6 per cent from 2007 and the lowest total for international weapons agreements since 2005 .
The increase in US weapons sales around the world '' was attributable not only to major new orders from clients in the near - east and in Asia , but also to the continuation of significant equipment and support services contracts with a broad - based number of US clients globally '' , according to the study .
The annual report was produced by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service , a division of the Library of Congress .
Regarded as the most detailed collection of unclassified global arms sales data available to the general public , it was delivered to the US House and Senate on Friday , ready for members ' return from the Labor Day recess .
The former vicar of clergy for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles testified this week under oath that Cardinal Roger Mahony ordered him in 2000 not to contact police about allegations of sexual abuse by a priest .
In deposition papers filed Friday as part of a civil case , Msgr. Richard Loomis also testified that Mahony ordered him not to inform parishes of allegations against the now defrocked Rev. Michael Baker .
In 2007 , Baker was sent to state prison for 10 years after his conviction on molestation charges .
He has been called before a federal grand jury investigating how the archdiocese handled priest abuse cases .
Loomis is on leave from the archdiocese after also being accused of sexual abuse .
Advertisement
Tod M. Tamberg , a spokesman for the archdiocese , said church officials had not seen the deposition and therefore could not comment .
Under questioning by John Manly , an attorney for one of Baker ’s victims , Loomis testified that after learning Baker had performed three baptisms , despite orders to discontinue ministry , he told Mahony in a memo that the archdiocese should tell police .
Mahony “ wrote on the memo and initially his response was to proceed but then through the general counsel ’s office I was told . . . that we were going to wait , ” Loomis said .
The 2000 discussions about Baker arose after an attorney for two brothers told the archdiocese that Baker molested them until 1999 .
Advertisement
The archdiocese and Baker settled the matter out of court for $ 1.3 million .
The deposition contains a comment by Donald H. Steier , an attorney for Baker , that by 2000 the individuals who alleged that they had been sexually abused were adults .
Because of that , he said , “ there is no legal requirement to make reports . ”
Manly said in an interview Friday that , “ because of Cardinal Mahony , they never called the police until 2002 . ”
Advertisement
In a 2002 interview , Baker told The Times that he had informed Mahony in the 1980s that he had sexually abused children .
“ I told Mahony I had a problem , ” Baker said .
Mahony allowed Baker to remain active in the archdiocese and sent him to a New Mexico treatment center .
Later , Baker was assigned to other parishes and , according to court records and interviews , abused other boys .
Advertisement
Mahony said in a 2002 interview with The Times that no one at the archdiocese reported Baker to the authorities in 2000 because “ it was just our expectation that the two brothers had gone to police because they were so angry at him . ”
In late March 2002 , Mahony authorized an attorney to notify police about Baker .
Until then , according to a confidential e-mail from an archdiocesan lawyer , Mahony had been “ reluctant ” to tell authorities .
In May 2002 , Mahony formally apologized for having allowed Baker to continue in the ministry .

A satellite image of Iran 's Khark and Khargou Islands in Persian Gulf were the bright objects were reportedly sighted by the IRGC Iran 's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps ( IRGC ) has targeted and downed an unidentified shining object after sighting it over Persian Gulf waters .
" " Glowing objects were sighted over the Persian Gulf .
IRGC air defense targeted one of the objects successfully , forcing it to plummet and sink in the seas off Boushehr ( Province ) , " " said top regional commander , Brigadier Ali Razmjou .
"
" The three bright objects were detected by our radars when flying over the Persian Gulf Islands of Khark and Khargou , " " he added , according to a Monday report posted on IRNA .
Brig .
Razmjou explained that when the radars indicated that they were not Iranian aircrafts , the IRGC fired at the three objects .
He also added that the fallen objects ' remains have not been found yet .
The exact time and location of the sighting and downing of the weird aircraft has not been announced .

The find will allay fears of a decline in Venezuela 's energy industry President Hugo Chavez has announced the discovery of a vast gas field off the coast of Venezuela .
The find - estimated at 7 to 8 trillion cubic feet , about five times what Spain uses in a year - was made with the Spanish energy company Repsol .
Mr Chavez announced the find while in Spain during a tour of Europe and Asia .
" What are we going to do with so much gas ? " he jokingly asked Repsol 's head Antonio Brufau in a joint interview with Spanish newspaper El Pais .
" I 'm sure we 'll find some use for it , " came the reply .
Mr Chavez said the development of the field would put Venezuela - which already boasts the largest proven oil reserves outside the Middle East - among the world 's top five gas producers .
Repsol confirmed the " enormous " discovery , which it made in an offshore site called Cardon 4 in the Gulf of Venezuela in an exploration consortium with the Italian energy company Eni .
It said further tests were under way to confirm provisional estimates of its volume .
If so , it will be the biggest gas find in Repsol 's history .
Boost for Venezuela Repsol said that once development of the field was under way , profits from the venture would be split three ways , with Repsol and Eni taking 32.5 % each and Venezuela 's state company PDVSA taking 35 % .
For both Mr Chavez and Repsol the timing of the announcement could not have been better , reports the BBC's Will Grant in Caracas .
There have been suggestions that the oil industry in Venezuela is in decline , with falling prices , reduced production and high debts to contractors .
However , this gas find will go a long way to calm investor fears in Venezuela and Spain about the extent of the country 's energy reserves , our correspondent says .

Slackware 13.0 release notes .
Tue Aug 25 23:40:18 CDT 2009
Hi folks ,
Historically , the RELEASE_NOTES ( at least in recent releases ) had been mostly technical information , but once again Robby Workman has covered the important technical details in CHANGES_AND_HINTS .TXT .
Thanks !
Probably the first thing to mention about the release of Slackware 13.0 is that it marks our first release with an official 64 - bit port !
Thanks to the hard work of Eric Hameleers , Slackware for x86 is available in both 32 - bit and 64 - bit ( x86_64 ) editions .
Eric did incredible work on the 64 - bit port .
The SlackBuild scripts were so much of an improvement over the originals from the 32 - bit tree that they were imported over on the 32 - bit side -- the only difference in the build trees is whether $ ARCH is set to i486 or x86_64 .
These scripts are finding use in other ports too , like Stuart Winter 's ARMedslack port to the ARM architecture ( the ARM Versatile platform emulated by QEMU , and the Marvell SheevaPlug ) , and Mark Post 's Slack / 390 Linux Project for IBM S/390 G2 class systems and above .
The goal of a unified source tree for these projects seems to be coming into focus .
For more information about these Slackware ports , see http://armedslack.org and http://slack390.org.
Getting back to the x86_64 port ( nicknamed Slackware64 ) , we also have to thank Fred Emmott who helped us solve a number of tricky problems having been there before -- without his help things like getting ncurses right so that the nVidia installer worked , and laying the groundwork for future multilib support would have been much more difficult .
Thanks Fred !
About the only things to mention here are that Slackware requires a recent 2.6.x kernel ( I believe 2.6.22.x is a minimum ) , but as usual unless your needs are specific you 're probably better off running the included kernels that we 've tested things against .
The best kernel to run ( even on a one CPU / core machine ) is the generic SMP one , but that needs an initrd , so be sure to read the instructions in / boot after installing with a huge * kernel if you plan to switch .
We 've used the well - tested and recently patched 2.6.29.6 kernel , but the 2.6.30.5 kernel is also available as packages in / testing .
If you decide to give that a try , be sure to read the information about LILO in there .
I would not suggest trying to run without udev .
Consider it the userspace portion of the kernel .
It * is * possible , but if you must do that you 'll have to tweak a couple things here and there .
The specifics are left as an exercise for the advanced user .
Wait , an advanced user would just use udev .
Really , it works and makes things a lot easier .
Another huge change in Slackware 13.0 is the move from KDE3 to KDE4 .
KDE4 has been out for about a year and a half now , and it has come a long way since KDE 4.0 .
The KDE 4.2.4 release included in Slackware 13.0 is a very fast and polished desktop .
It looks great and achieves its goal of making the Linux operating system as nice a desktop OS as anything that is available at any price !
With KDE3 pretty much winding down ( probably there will not be further releases ) and projects dropping KDE3 support in favor of KDE4 , the time was right to make the move to KDE4 in Slackware .
I 'm using it on all of my own machines ( including an Intel Atom with compositing enabled ) , and I 've really fallen in love with it once I got used to it .
The tools are integrated better with the desktop , Qt4 seems to be a faster and more stable platform , and nearly everything that was available for KDE3 has been ported to KDE4 and works great .
Huge thanks to the KDE team for producing the great desktop environment they promised to deliver !
As with any major rewrite , there are , however , still a few quirks , but these are few and the improvements have been coming fast .
One of the issues we 're aware of is that k3 b has n't been working as well as the KDE3 version for some people ( it works fine here , but we have heard some reports ) , and there are some other KDE applications where people still prefer the old versions .
To help with this , there are KDE3 compatibility packages that can be found in / extra / kde3 - compat / .
With these installed , most KDE3 programs will run .
A KDE3 version of k3b is also included in that directory .
Xfce has been updated as well , and continues to be a great lightweight desktop that does n't get in your way .
You 'll notice improvements in Xfce immediately upon starting it .
If you have n't looked at this great desktop environment lately , you might want to give it another try .
Thanks to Robby for tracking the Xfce development closely and making sure everything was just exactly right in the Slackware Xfce packages .
If you prefer GNOME , there are teams online producing GNOME for Slackware .
Here are a few places to look :
http://gnomeslackbuild.org
http://www.droplinegnome.net/
http://www.gware.org/
If any of these replaces some system components , using them voids your warranty . ;-)
But it should work , * if * you absolutely must have GNOME .
I 'd suggest Xfce instead if you want a GTK + based desktop .
If you do want to use GNOME , remember that there may be some updates needed after 13.0 releases , so it might be best not to rush into it .
Thanks to these teams for making the GNOME desktop a viable option for Slackware users .
Need more build scripts ?
Something that you wanted was n't included in Slackware ?
Well , then check out slackbuilds.org .
Several of the team members work on the scripts there .

The Agrawal - Kayal - Saxena ( AKS ) primality test , discovered in 2002 , is the first provably deterministic algorithm to determine the primality of a given number with a run time which is guaranteed to be polynomial in the number of digits , thus , given a large number , the algorithm will correctly determine whether that number is prime or not in time .
( Many previous primality testing algorithms existed , but they were either probabilistic in nature , had a running time slower than polynomial , or the correctness could not be guaranteed without additional hypotheses such as GRH . )
The AKS test is of some relevance to the polymath project “ Finding primes “ , so I thought I would sketch the details of the test ( and the proof that it works ) here .
( Of course , full details can be found in the original paper , which is nine pages in length and almost entirely elementary in nature . )
It relies on polynomial identities that are true modulo when is prime , but cannot hold for non-prime as they would generate a large number of additional polynomial identities , eventually violating the factor theorem ( which asserts that a polynomial identity of degree at most can be obeyed by at most values of the unknown ) .
Our starting point is Fermat ’s little theorem , which asserts that
for every prime and every .
This theorem suggests an obvious primality test : to test whether a number is prime , pick a few values of and see whether .
( Note that can be computed in time for any fixed by expressing in binary , and repeatedly squaring .)
If the statement fails for some , then would be composite .
Unfortunately , the converse is not true : there exist non-prime numbers , known as Carmichael numbers , for which for all coprime to ( is the first example ) .
So Fermat ’s little theorem cannot be used , by itself , to establish primality for general , because it is too weak to eliminate all non-prime numbers .
( The situation improves though for more special types of , such as Mersenne numbers ; see my earlier post on the Lucas - Lehmer test for more discussion . )
However , there is a stronger version of Fermat ’s little theorem which does eliminate all non-prime numbers .
Specifically , if is prime and is arbitrary , then one has the polynomial identity
where is an indeterminate variable .
( More formally , we have the identity in the ring of polynomials of one variable over the finite field of elements . )
This identity ( a manifestation of the Frobenius endomorphism ) clearly implies ( 1 ) by setting ; conversely , one can easily deduce ( 2 ) from ( 1 ) by expanding out using the binomial theorem and the observation that the binomial coefficients are divisible by for all .
Conversely , if
( i.e. in ) for some coprime to , then by comparing coefficients using the binomial theorem we see that is divisible by for all .
But if is divisible by some smaller prime , then by setting equal to the largest power of that divides , one sees that is not divisible by enough powers of to be divisible by , a contradiction .
Thus one can use ( 3 ) ( for a single value of coprime to ) to decide whether is prime or not .
Unfortunately , this algorithm , while deterministic , is not polynomial - time , because the polynomial has coefficients and will therefore take at least time to compute .
However , one can speed up the process by descending to a quotient ring of , such as for some .
Clearly , if the identity holds in , then it will also hold in , thus
The point of doing this is that ( if is not too large ) the left - hand side of ( 4 ) can now be computed quickly ( again by expanding in binary and performing repeated squaring ) , because all polynomials can be reduced to be of degree less than , rather than being as large as .
Indeed , if , then one can test ( 4 ) in time .
We are not done yet , because it could happen that ( 4 ) holds but ( 3 ) fails .
But we have the following key theorem :
Theorem 1 ( AKS theorem )
Suppose that for all , ( 4 ) holds , and is coprime to .
Then is either a prime , or a power of a prime .
Of course , coprimality of and can be quickly tested using the Euclidean algorithm , and if coprimality fails then is of course composite .
Also , it is easy to quickly test for the property that is a power of an integer ( just compute the roots for ) , and such powers are clearly composite .
From all this ( and ( 2 ) , one soon sees that theorem gives rise to a deterministic polynomial - time test for primality .
One can optimise the powers of in the bounds for ( as is done in the original paper ) , but we will not do so here to keep the exposition uncluttered .
Actually , we do n’t need ( 4 ) satisfied for all that many exponents to make the theorem work ; just one well - chosen will do .
More precisely , we have
Theorem 2 ( AKS theorem , key step )
Let be coprime to , and such that has order greater than in the multiplicative group ( i.e. the residues for are distinct ) .
Suppose that for all , ( 4 ) holds , and is coprime to .
Then is either a prime , or a power of a prime .
To find an with the above properties we have
Lemma 3 ( Existence of good )
There exists coprime to , such that has order greater than in .
Proof :
For each , the number has at most prime divisors ( by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic ) .
If one picks to be the first prime not equal to any of these prime divisors , one obtains the claim .
( One can use a crude version of the prime number theorem to get the upper bound on . )
It is clear that Theorem 1 follows from Theorem 2 and Lemma 3 , so it suffices now to prove Theorem 2 .
Suppose for contradiction that Theorem 2 fails .
Then is divisible by some smaller prime , but is not a power of .
Since is coprime to all numbers of size we know that is not of polylogarithmic size , thus we may assume for any fixed .
As is coprime to , we see that is not a multiple of ( indeed , one should view as being much larger than ) .
Let be a field extension of by a primitive root of unity , thus for some factor ( in ) of the cyclotomic polynomial .
From the hypothesis ( 4 ) , we see that
in for all , where .
Note that is coprime to every integer less than , and thus .
Meanwhile , from ( 2 ) one has
in for all such .
The two equations give
Note that the power of a primitive root of unity is again a primitive root of unity ( and conversely , every primitive root arises in this fashion ) and hence we also have
in for all .
Inspired by this , we define a key concept : a positive integer coprime to is said to be introspective if one has
in for all , or equivalently if , where is the ring homomorphism that sends to .
We have just shown that are all introspective ; is also trivially introspective .
Furthermore , if and are introspective , it is not hard to see that is also introspective .
Thus we in fact have a lot of introspective integers : any number of the form for is introspective .
It turns out in fact that it is not possible to create so many different introspective numbers , basically the presence of so many polynomial identities in the field would eventually violate the factor theorem .
To see this , let be the multiplicative group generated by the quantities for .
Observe that for all .
We now show that this places incompatible lower and upper bounds on .
We begin with the lower bound :
Proposition 4 ( Lower bound on ) .
Proof :
Let be a product of less than of the quantities ( allowing repetitions ) , then lies in .
Since , there are certainly at least ways to pick such a product .
So to establish the proposition it suffices to show that all these products are distinct .
Suppose for contradiction that , where are different products of less than of the .
Then , for every introspective , as well ( note that ) .
In particular , this shows that are all roots of the polynomial .
But this polynomial has degree less than , and the are distinct by hypothesis , and we obtain the desired contradiction by the factor theorem .
Proposition 5 ( Upper bound on ) Suppose that there are exactly residue classes modulo of the form for .
Then .
Proof :
By the pigeonhole principle , we must have a collision
for some with .
Setting and , we thus see that there are two distinct introspective numbers of size most which are equal modulo .
( To ensure that are distinct , we use the hypothesis that is not a power of . )
This implies that , and thus for all .
But the polynomial has degree at most , and the claim now follows from the factor theorem .
Since has order greater than in , we see that the number of residue classes of the form is at least .
But then , and so Propositions 4 , 5 are incompatible .

Fresh evidence has been revealed to support the theory that life on Earth began in space .
NASA 's Stardust probe , a specially - designed - comet ‘ chaser ’ , successfully collected particles shed from Comet Wild 2 back in 2004 , and NASA scientists have since confirmed for the first time that amino acids can indeed be found on these extraterrestrial bodies .
Amino acids , the building blocks of life , form the basis of proteins and are created when carbon compounds and water are energized by particles such as protons .
Samples of Glycine were confirmed by NASA labs after extensive testing .
Dr Jamie Elsila , lead author of a paper on the research , said : “ Glycine is an amino acid used by living organisms to make proteins , and this is the first time an amino acid has been found in a comet .
Our discovery supports the theory that some of life 's ingredients formed in space and were delivered to Earth long ago by meteorite and comet impacts . "
Stardust gathered samples from the comet ’s trail by passing through gas and dust and using a special grid filled with aerogel to collect the debris .
This was parachuted back to Earth in January 2006 and scientists have been analyzing it since .
" We actually analyzed aluminum foil from the sides of tiny chambers that hold the aerogel in the collection grid , " said Elsila .
" As gas molecules passed through the aerogel , some stuck to the foil .
We spent two years testing and developing our equipment to make it accurate and sensitive enough to analyze such incredibly tiny samples . "
Before this announcement could be made , extensive testing took place to confirm that the Glycine did in fact originate in space and to rule out possible contamination from sources on our planet .
This research used isotopic analysis of the foil and successfully confirmed that the comet - based Glycine contained more of the heavier Carbon 13 atoms than Glycine from Earth , which led Elsila to announce :
“ We discovered that the Stardust - returned Glycine has an extraterrestrial carbon isotope signature , indicating that it originated on the comet " .
The next stage would be to gather more information from the main nucleus of a comet , which is likely to contain more complex mixtures of amino acids at higher levels .
This is predictably quite tricky to do , though NASA is optimistic that Europe ’s Rosetta spacecraft , the first designed to orbit and land on a comet , will successfully achieve its goal when it reaches Comet 67P in 2014 , after a ten - year journey .
The Federal Trade Commission has shut down an ISP that it claims is playing host to botnets , spammers , phishing websites , and even child porn .
The company behind the ISP , Pricewert LLC , apparently does business under a variety of names , but the FTC claims that it " actively " recruits criminals in order to carry out illegal and malicious activity online .
As a result , the FTC was able to obtain a temporary restraining order shutting down Pricewert , with a preliminary injunction hearing scheduled for June 15 .
3FN and APS Telecom were just two of the names that Pricewert operated under , and the FTC claims that the company advertised its services " on the darkest corners of the Internet , including a forum established to facilitate communication between criminals . "
In addition to peddling malware and spyware , Pricewert served up porn featuring not only children , but violence , bestiality , and incest .
The FTC even claims to have IM logs showing Pricewert 's senior employees discussing the configuration of botnets with " bot herders , " helping the ISP to control more than 4,500 malicious programs .
The company apparently made efforts to shield its clientele and activities by moving IP addresses frequently and by ignoring takedown requests .
As a result of the company 's illegal activities , the FTC charged Pricewert with the distribution of illegal , malicious , and harmful content .
By the looks of it , Pricewert 's business was very similar to that of Atrivo , which was forced offline in the fall of 2008 after a report came out about the ISP 's numerous illegal endeavors ( though our readers noted that it did n't stay offline for long ) .
Similarly , rogue ISP McColo was shut down in November for its shady spam dealings , resulting in a noticeable drop in overall spam levels for several months .
In addition to the temporary restraining order issued today against Pricewert , the US District Court for the North District of California ordered the ISP 's data centers to cease providing services to the company .
A judge will decide in just over a week whether further action is necessary , but given the available evidence , it seems more likely than not that the FTC will get its wish and Pricewert will be shut down for good .
Whether the ISP 's admins can be prevented from scurrying off to darker corners of the Internet is another question .

No matter what productivity methodology you use to be productive ( GTD , ZTD etc ) , � all of them involve making to - do lists . �
How well you make your to - do list is directly proportional to your productivity levels . �
Here are 2 key principles you need to know :
1 . In in the task , identify the next action clearly .
I had a tendency to add Projects to my To - Do lists , as a result I would face a lot of resistance in taking that project forward . �
I had to learn to keep my Projects on a separate list , and only have Next Actions on my To - Do list .
There�s a certain magic and a feeling of lightness that comes when you identify clearly in each task what the Next Action is to take .�
So ensure that you do not have any projects listed on your to - do list , but you have the next visible next action listed . �
If your project is � Prepare the report on impact of carbon emission on the environment� , your next action would be something like � Search Google for the latest news on Carbon emission ” .
2 . Always start the task with a ‘ Verb ’ .
Read , Email , Call etc
By starting the task with a verb it forces you to clearly define what you need to do to perform the next action . �
The more clearly you �re able to visualize the next action , the easier it will become to perform it .
Conclusion
Once of the main reasons why we procrastinate on our projects is because of the high resistance we face when confronted with huge projects to work on .�
But the reality is that we never work on the project , we always work on � Next Actions � . �
Any project that we work on , it�s always about making a phone call , drafting an email , meeting a person , installing software . �
Once the next action is clearly defined , it fizzles away the resistance allowing you to move forward on the project .

July 23 , 2011 , Havana–Following stirring choral offerings ranging from Ave Maria to We Are the World , 19 US medical students were among those awarded their degrees at today ’s graduation of physicians , nurses and allied health professions of the ...
State lawmakers and prison workers said Thursday that policy changes are needed to lower Oklahoma 's incarceration rate for women — the highest in the nation — and do a better job returning women to their communities and families after they have served their sentence .
" We can have the very best re-entry program in the world .
But that does n't work if we do n't have communities that welcome them back , " Susan L. Sharp , a professor at the University of Oklahoma , said during a public hearing to explore possible legislation .
Sen . Constance Johnson , D - Oklahoma City , said Oklahoma 's criminal justice policies have resulted in incarceration rates for women that are almost twice the national average .
The state 's incarceration rate for women is 131 per 100,000 residents while the national average is 69 per 100,000 .
In addition , 68 percent of women in state prisons are there for nonviolent offenses , including drug offenses and related crimes .
There are about 2,600 women in prison in Oklahoma , a little more than 10 percent of the total prison population , according to state corrections officials .
" As a state we can do better .
As a state , this is one No. 1 we do n't want to be , " said Dr. Laura Pittman , a psychologist and deputy director of female offender operations at the Department of Corrections .
Johnson 's legislative assistant , Gwendolyn Fields , said Oklahoma 's habitual offender law is partly to blame for the state 's high incarceration rate .
" We have an almost warehousing of women in Oklahoma , " said Fields , who has six felony convictions for nonviolent offenses and is a University of Oklahoma student working toward a degree in petroleum engineering .
The habitual offender law allows prosecutors to seek enhanced sentences for felony defendants convicted of two or more felony offenses within the previous 10 years .
Under the law , defendants convicted of a third or subsequent felony can be sentenced to 20 years to life in prison .
Other states have similar laws but require that the earlier convictions be for violent offenses .
" It is a vehicle for arbitrary sentencing , " Fields said , calling for the law 's repeal .
" We 're talking about people who have made two stupid mistakes . "
Johnson , who presided over the hearing , was not immediately available afterward to comment on whether she plans to sponsor legislation to amend or repeal the statute .
Pittman said the state needs to emphasize more the root causes of offenses that most women are convicted of , including drug and alcohol offenses , forgery , and property crimes .
Pittman said it costs $ 15,000 a year to house a female inmate .
She said it would cost far less to sentence nonviolent offenders to rehabilitation and other diversionary programs .
" I believe the state of Oklahoma would be better served if they did n't come to us and they got treatment , " Pittman said .
Sharp said 48 percent of women who were incarcerated in 2008 had no high school diploma and 12.5 percent had no more than an eighth - grade education .
In addition , two - thirds of female prisoners were physically or sexually abused as children and 75 percent experienced domestic violence or rape as an adult .
Sharp also said half of women in Oklahoma prisons are mothers with small children .
Pat Boatwright , a volunteer coordinator who works with female inmates , stressed the need to mentor women in state prisons to relieve anxieties and prepare them to reunite with their families .
" If we do n't get this right , there 's a lot of families with small children who are going to pay the price , " Boatwright said .
Cavs fans can kiss their hopes of bringing Charlie Villanueva to Cleveland goodbye .
After Carlos Boozer decided to return to the Jazz the Pistons decided to pursue Villanueva and it looks like they got their man .
He will make around a $ 1.5 million more than he could get if he signed with the Cavs .
DETROIT ( AP ) - A person with the knowledge of the negotiations says the Detroit Pistons have agreed in principle to contracts with free agents Ben Gordon and Charlie Villanueva .
The person spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday night on the condition of anonymity because NBA rules prohibit teams from announcing free agent signings until next week .
Gordon , the third pick in the 2004 draft by the Chicago Bulls , agreed to a 5 - year deal for at least $ 50 million .
Villanueva agreed to a five - year deal .
His contract is worth at least $ 35 million .
Selling your home ?
Do n’t forget to upgrade your window treatments to sell the house .
An easy way to make your home more attractive to potential buyers is to upgrade your window treatments .
A lot of sellers upgrade everything else but forget to upgrade their window treatments .
This can be be a big mistake for some buyers , especially if you have old grimy mini blinds .
Replacing those blinds
Replacing old blinds can be done in a snap .
In today ’s market people are looking to see more natural light , so do n’t limit yourself with those old dusty mini blinds .
They hardly let anything in .
Replace them with today ’s alternative 2 ″ faux wood blinds .
They are attractive and they let in double the amount of light as mini’s .
They are very popular right now , and can be found at great prices , especially if your sizes fall between 17 ″ - 72 ″ wide and are n’t any taller than 72 ″ .
You can buy those at home improvement warehouse near you and even have them cut the width to fit your windows for you .
Most places do n’t adjust the length for you though .
But in most cases if you can read directions and are handy , as well as the time and patience you can do it yourself .
If your blind sizes do n’t fit in that range then consider custom made blinds .
Just remember , custom blinds take time to be made , so give yourself at least three weeks for custom orders .
Blind replacement cost
So what about cost ?
Every company has a starter price group that while are more expensive than stock blinds , are n’t as astronomically priced as the top of the line .
The great thing about custom blinds is that they are made exactly to your size , so you wo n’t have to shorten the length like you will for those in stock blinds .
If your price conscious look around at who has the best deal .
A lot of window treatment companies offer promos every couple of months .
Bali and Levolor for instance , are two great brands that provide a good value .
Often , they are well priced too , you just need keep your eyes open .
Universidad de Chile striker Juan Manuel Olivera is recovering after he was knocked out during a match and then the ambulance taking him to hospital crashed .
“ It was a tragicomic situation , ” team doctor Patrico Delgado told Radio Cooperativa .
“ He was a bit shocked at first but he has taken it all with a dose of humour .
He will have to rest for around a week and after that he can start training again . ”
The Uruguayan striker ’s misfortune began when he was knocked unconscious after a clash with rival goalkeeper Jorge Rivera in Thursday ’s game away to O’Higgins in Rancagua .
Olivera , who has averaged nearly a goal a game this season for the Chilean champions , was taken to a nearby clinic for an exam , regaining consciousness on the way .
Doctors said the results of the exams were good but ordered him to be transferred to a Santiago hospital and spend the night there as a precaution .
But during the journey his ambulance was involved in a collision with another vehicle .
Media reports said nobody was hurt but Olivera had to wait around two hours for a substitute ambulance which was delayed by rush - hour traffic .
The degree of intermediation by the Federal Reserve in the issuance of US Treasuries hit a record in Q2 , accounting for just under 50 % of all net UST issuance absorption .
This is a startling number , as the Fed 's $ 164 billion in Q2 Treasury purchases dwarfs the combined foreign / household UST purchases of $ 101 billion and $ 29 billion , respectively , over the same time period .
In fact , the Fed was a greater factor in UST demand than all three traditional players combined : Foreigners , Households and Primary Dealers , which amounted to a $ 158 billion in net Q2 purchases .
This dramatic imbalance puts a lot of question marks over how the upcoming hundreds of billions in incremental Treasury purchases will be soaked up , now that QE only has $ 15 billion of capacity for USTs : with Households lapping up risky assets it is unlikely they will look at Treasuries absent some dramatic downward move in equities , while Foreign purchasers , which many speculate are in a game of Mutual Assured Destruction regarding UST purchases , have in fact been aggressively lowering their purchases of Treasuries ( from $ 159 billion in Q1 to $ 101 billion in Q2 , an almost 40 % decline in appetite ! ) .
Will the US make these purchases much more attractive come October when QE for USTs ends ?
And if so , what kind of rates are we talking about ?
One thing is certain : in terms of priorities of the Federal Reserve , keeping the equity market buoyant , is a distant second to ensuring successful auction after auction well into 2010 .
After all there is near $ 9 trillion in budget deficits that need financing over the next 10 years .
From Morgan Stanley :
Flow of funds : The Fed also released its flow of funds data for Q2 on September 17 .
The main points are that : Households reduced Q2 Treasury purchases from their blistering pace in Q1
Foreign accounts reduced Q2 UST purchases as the Fed ramped up Q/ E ops
Bank Q2 purchases remained anemic despite the fall in other lending options
Broker / dealer purchases were high but not sustainable , expect Q3 moderation Households out …
The salient points here include confirmation that the ‘ households ’ bid for $ 377 billion Treasuries in Q1 was a one - time reallocation trade as this account took down a much smaller $ 29 billion in Q2 .
We were afraid that this flow would not be sustainable , as the ‘ households ’ category really includes non-profits and other organizations that simply performed a one - time reallocation trade out of risky assets after their horrid performance in Q4 of last year .
Fed nudges out foreign bid …
What is a bit worrisome at first glance is the slowdown in Treasury purchases by ‘ foreign ’ accounts from $ 159 billion in Q1 to $ 101 billion in Q2 .
Part of this likely reflects the crowding out of foreign investors by the Fed ’s Treasury QE program which bought $ 164 billion Treasuries in Q2 ( or close to 50 % of the quarter ’s net issuance ) after a mere $ 16 billion purchase in Q1 .
We anticipate this crowding out to continue in the Q3 data but for foreign accounts to return in Q4 once the Fed ’s program expires .
Bank buying still not large enough …
While ‘ banks ’ have been ramping up their Treasury holdings with the latest quarter - on - quarter increase of 11 % , the corresponding notional amount of $ 14 billion is still a bit of a disappointment considering the lack of alternative investment opportunities ( e.g. , C&I loans , home equity lines and consumer lending have all decreased in Q2 ) .
In fact , the ‘ broker / dealers ’ category experienced a much larger increase of $ 28 billion in Q2 .
This is generally consistent with the trend we ’ve seen in the primary dealer positioning data from the Fed in for the first half of 2009 , when primary dealers were reducing their Treasury shorts as they were also reducing their riskier longs in order to bring down the size of their balance sheets .
With broker / dealer balance sheets now closer to the right size , we anticipate the broker / dealer buying has slowed down in Q3 .
All else equal , these are precisely the questions that keep the Chairman up at night .
The answers should present themselves quote soon .
Following are excerpts from an interview with Munir Al - Maqdah , head of the " Armed Struggle " Fatah militia in Lebanon , which aired on Al - Quds TV ( Lebanon ) on August 17 , 2009 .
Munir Al - Maqdah : The Fatah convention ratified the unwavering Palestinian principles , upon which all the Palestinian forces agreed during the Al - Aqsa Intifada .
The convention did not deviate from these principles , and President [ Abbas ] talked about them yesterday at his press conference .
He made these principles perfectly clear .
He talked about an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 borders , and stressed Resolution 194 , pertaining to the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their lands and to their homes .
During the convention , he talked about the resistance as well .
We heard the word " resistance , " and we interpreted it as armed struggle and armed resistance , although others might interpret it as political resistance and so on .
I would like to say that the resistance is in trusted hands .
The Fatah resistance will continue to be the spearhead of the struggle , and Fatah will remain in a constant state of revolution , serving as the flame of the armed struggle , until Palestine is liberated and the refugees return to their lands and their homes .
[...]
The political platform and constitution of Fatah do not recognize the so - called State of Israel , let alone the Jewishness of this state .
We do not recognize that artificial entity , the state of Israel , which sooner or later will be removed from the land of Palestine , Allah willing .
[...]
Set the time frame for us , and we guarantee that just like the settlements in the Gaza Strip were wiped out , the settlements in the West Bank will be wiped out through resistance .
[...]
Interviewer :
You have ties with the Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigade , even within Palestine .
Munir Al - Maqdah : Definitely .
During the Al - Aqsa Intifada , it was me who provided the Brigades with money and weapons .
I was among the founders of the Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigade in Palestine .
Interviewer :
Do you still have ties with the Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades ?
Munir Al - Maqdah : I have good relations with all the cadres of Fatah and the Al - Aqsa Brigades in Palestine , and I am in constant contact with them .
[...]
I have no relations whatsoever with Hizbullah .
I respect Hizbullah and its resistance , but I have no political or organizational relations with them .
Interviewer : Perhaps these days , the relations with Hizubllah are maintained by General Sultan Abu Al - Einein ?
There were almost weekly meetings that were made public by the media .
Munir Al - Maqdah :
He has positive relations with Hizbullah , and they hold constant meetings .
I have n't had any meetings with Hizbullah for a long time now , but I respect this resistance , and I always say that whenever there is aggression against Lebanon , our weapons will be at the service of the resistance and of the Lebanese army in defense of Lebanon .
As Palestinians , we must be on the frontline whenever there is aggression against sister Lebanon .
Interviewer :
That is why you have your weapon right next to you .
You have an RPG - 7 there , but without the grenade .
When will you load the grenade ?
Munir Al - Maqdah : I consider this weapon to be the ornament of our houses .
As long as a Palestinian refugee is not on his land and in his home ...
We should keep this weapon until the Palestinian people return to their lands and homes , and in the event of any aggression against Lebanon , we will be on the frontline , like we always have .
Interviewer :
The commander of the Armed Struggle in Lebanon , the Fatah leader , General Munir Al - Maqdah , the No. 1 terrorist in Lebanon ...
You are proud of this title , which you were given by the Israeli government , and I am proud to have interviewed you .
Thank you .

I remember telling my high school friends in Raleigh , North Carolina , that I did n’t really like kids very much and did n’t think I ’d have any when I grew up .
This was in 1996 ; I was fourteen .
Most of the girls I went to high school with married young and started having kids , but I knew it was n’t what I wanted .
I figured that in New York City , I ’d be safe from the pressure to procreate .
After all , every New York girl is exactly like Carrie Bradshaw , right ?
Arriving in Williamsburg , Brooklyn in 2004 , I expected a bohemian paradise full of other young , struggling creative types .
Instead , my neighborhood was overgrown with strollers as thick as kudzu , many pushed by young , fashionable parents balancing a BlackBerry in one hand and a fair - trade coffee in the other .
The difference between New York parenting and North Carolina parenting is merely the trappings .
New York parents think it ’s totally OK to bring their babies to bars , nightclubs , burlesque shows , rock concerts , and even the office .
One parent may have a Vespa and another an SUV , but the “ now that I ’m a mommy / daddy , I know everything ” attitude transcends all borders .
I ’ve seen otherwise - normal adults ( some of whom were once my friends ) with hobbies , careers , and interests turn into zombies who only talk about little Galveston or Kymberleigh ’s most recent bowel movements .
Even some people I know , adamant leftist atheists who consider the mainstream to be evil , ca n’t believe I ’m planning not to have kids —
“ Who ’s going to take care of you when you ’re old ? ” one asked .
You know who ’s going to take care of me when I ’m old ?
Employees at a nursing home .
The same one where your progeny are going to send you .
When people insist on having a kid but refuse to accept any of the sacrifices that go along with doing so , they ’re being selfish while trying to pass themselves off as saintly just for reproducing .
Newsflash : Not every mom is the Virgin Mary .
But you ’d never know from the way that celebrity magazines fawn all over spawning has - been actresses , devoting ten - page spreads to pictures of their new babies .
Or from the fascination with multiple - birth - based reality shows like “ Jon and Kate Plus 8 ” or the upcoming Octomom project .
Meanwhile , those women who have talked about choosing to remain child - free — actresses Cameron Diaz and Marisa Tomei — remain rare .
Corrine Maier ’s book “ No Kids ” — which was just published in the US , two years after it caused great controversy in France — is a manifesto for the joys of childlessness .
Still , the childfree remain somewhat cowed :
Though there are a couple of message boards like Bratfree , where the unburdened can connect with each other , these are dwarfed by the overwhelming number of “ mommyblogs , ” where women attack each other for being bad parents — while not having breakdowns when little Bryden refuses to eat his edamame .
I do n’t feel secure discussing my decision in public .
I ’ve turned to Tumblr blogs like STFU Parents ( “ You used to be fun .
Now you have a baby . ” ) and Why The F Did You Have a Kid ? ( “. . . because you needed some fresh blood for your army of darkness ” ) for moral support and validation .
It ’s 2009 and I still field questions from friends and strangers alike — almost always female — who find it mystifying that a woman without fertility problems is utterly uninterested in procreating .
One friend told me that although she ’d never loved kids , the day that she gave birth and first saw her daughter ’s face , “ a light went on in me . ”
The problem is n’t that I just need to flip a switch inside of me — it ’s that I do n’t even have a switch .
I find kids cute , and I like them in theory .
But I ’ve never had so much as a murmur of a mothering instinct .
I ’m about as maternal as a telephone pole .
I ’m utterly ambivalent about children — and ambivalence is n’t good enough .
You should love your kids , not just tolerate them , and I do n’t have that in me .
No one ever turns the question around and asks why people do have children — especially not the parents themselves — although some of those reasons surely include making one ’s parents happy , conforming to societal expectations , trying to save a marriage , or looking for someone to love you unconditionally .
Of course , it ’s the rare mom who ’s ever willing to admit she might miss her old childfree life .
As far as I ’m concerned , the only reason to have a child should be because you genuinely want to , not because you want to make someone else happy or fill a hole in your life .
I ’m also bothered by the overt gender politics at play whenever someone hears that I ’m not interested in having children .
As much as New Yorkers like to brag about how modern and progressive they are , we still have some pretty antiquated notions about gender roles .
No one ever asks a guy without kids , “ Why not ? ” Nobody wonders how a new dad plans to balance work and family , even when both parents have high - powered jobs .
Men do n’t have to explain their decisions to hire nannies or babysitters the way that their wives do — much less risk the finger - pointing and sanctimony that comes from the Park Slope holier - than - thou school of parenting .
I ’d love to take a “ to each their own ” approach to this matter — if you want kids , have them ; if you do n’t , do n’t — but our child - obsessed society is n’t quite on board with that .
Until then , a personal request .
Remember what you tell your kids :
If you do n’t have something nice to say . . .

The ' Ndrangheta , an Italian mafia syndicate , has been accused by a former member of the gang of sinking dozens of ships loaded with toxic waste , much of it radioactive .
He says a journalist and cameraman were killed to keep them from revealing the activity .
Turncoat Francesco Fonti has identified a wreck located a few months ago by environmental workers as MV Kunsky or Cunsky and says he sunk it himself in 1992 , complete with 100 barrels of radioactive waste .
The gang received £ 100,000 ( $ 162,720 ) for the job .
The wreck was scoured last week by a robot , but could not be identified .
It lies 480 feet below sea level , and is about 330 to 360 feet long .
Its description and location have been found to match an old account Fonti gave authorities three years ago , and environmental detection equipment has been dispatched to the ship , images of which do show barrels in the area .
Fonti claims he blew it up with explosives from Holland and it was used to dispose of Norwegian nuclear waste .
The damage seen by the team working at the site does appear consistent with this version of events .
Prosecutors say it appears the issue is displaying " all the appearances of being a confirmation " .
Fonti says waste was disposed of for businesses across Europe .
Nicola Pace , an Italian prosecutor , said there was evidence of " deliberate sinking of 42 ships with cargoes of waste , including radioactive waste " but there has never been concrete proof .
Investigators will seek more shipwrecks if the mystery vessel does indeed have a toxic cargo .
Over thirty vessels are believed to be in Italian waters .
Both Fonti and environmental group Legambiente have also claimed vessels were sent to Somalia and other developing countries with toxic cargoes , which were either sunk with the ship or buried on land .
Legambiente alleges that local rebel groups were given weapons in exchange for receiving the waste ships .
Fonti claims that Italian TV journalist Ilaria Alpi's 1994 murder alongside her cameraman was because she had seen toxic waste arrive in Bosaso , Somalia .

Jena Pincott describes a study from a few years ago :
Volunteers were asked to identify fifty famous faces , including that of former U.S. president Richard Nixon and actor Winona Ryder .
The photos were digitally altered and shown either without eyebrows or without eyes .
When celebrities lacked eyes , subjects could recognize them nearly 60 percent of the time .
However , when celebrities lacked eyebrows , subjects recognized them only 46 percent of time .
The lesson : eyebrows are crucial to your identity they ’re at least as important as your eyes , if not more so .

Man and Time Love After Love
The time will come

You will love again the stranger who was your self .
Give wine .
Give bread .
Give back your heart

Take down the love letters from the bookshelf ,
the photographs , the desperate notes
peel your own image from the mirror .
Sit .

Oh not because happiness exists ,
that too - hasty profit snatched from approaching loss .
But because truly being here is so much ; because everything here apparently needs us , this fleeting world , in which some strange way keeps calling us .
Us , the most fleeting of all .
. . .
Ah , but what can we take along
into that other real ?
Not the art of looking ,
which is learned so slowly , and nothing that happened here .
Nothing .
The sufferings , then .
And , above all , the heaviness ,
and the long experience of love , — just what is wholly
unsayable .

Indian Space Research Organization ( ISRO ) has developed India ’s answer to Google Earth which is named as Bhuvan .
It means “ Earth ” in Sanskrit language .
Bhuvan is a project fully developed by Indians in ISRO where they have used the Indian satellites to get images .
How To Use Bhuvan
First of all you need to register yourself on Bhuvan registration page .
To use Bhuvan , you need to install a plugin provided on that website only .
That plug - in is of size around 11 MB which will not take much time to install .
Once the installation will be done , go to the Start – Programs and click on “ Bhuvan ” .
It will open the Bhuvan webpage from where you can click on the “ Enter ” button available on the website .
Welcome to Bhuvan !
Why Bhuvan ?
Google Earth is already there .
This is a natural question which will arise in your mind but checkout some of the advantages which are there in Bhuvan and not available in Google Earth .
Comparison detail mentioned below is an extract from timesofindia page ,
Google Earth Bhuvan Zoom levels up to 200 meter Zoom levels up to 10 meter Single layer information Multi- layer information Images upgraded every 4 year Images upgraded every year
No alternate viewing options Options of viewing on different dates Uses international satellites Uses Indian satellites
Bhuvan will help Indian government and people to trace different locations , agricultural needs and many more .
Since the bandwidth and Internet Speed is a big issue in India , that ’s why Bhuvan team has developed it in such a way that it can be browsed on low speed internet connection as well .
Here we have attached some of the screenshots from Bhuvan thru which you can feel the resolution and functionality of Bhuvan .

Current Limitations :
I was facing problem while exploring Bhuvan on Firefox and other browsers .
Now shifted to Internet Explorer and found that it is working properly .
Make Internet Explorer a default browser on your PC and browse Bhuvan over there .
Since Bhuvan is still in development phase ( Beta ) so the image quality is not at its best , we hope that it will provide good quality images in near future .
what do you mean you were unhappy with them ??
they look fine !!
really cute
I would n’t be able to do it anymore because district boundaries in my hometown changed a long time ago , but when I was a kid I used to ride my bike to school nearly every day that weather permitted it .
It ’s a good thing I did n’t live in Saratoga Springs , New York :
SARATOGA SPRINGS —
The first day of school , already a happy and trying event for any student , saw a little additional stress for Maple Avenue Middle School student Adam Marino .
Marino and his mother , Janette Kaddo Marino , left for school by bicycle on Wednesday morning , as they often do in good weather , despite a phone call placed to students ’ homes by school officials , asking parents not to allow students to walk or ride bikes to school .
(…)
One section of the school policy states : “ The Board of Education forbids the riding of bicycles by students to and from Maple Avenue Middle School . ”
Another section also prohibits riding to elementary schools .
In an apparent contradiction , a third section states : “ Secondary school pupils may ride their bicycles to school and shall park them in the racks provided . ”
The policy was written when the Maple Avenue school opened in 1994 , and has never before been reviewed , Superintendent of Schools Janice
White said .
From Southern Beale , a very important point :
Do n’t talk to me about death panels , Sarah Palin .
You , who so carelessly bolstered a lie about healthcare reform to score a cheap political point ; you , the most craven of political opportunists , who fearmongers about some dystopian socialist / fascist fantasyland ; you , who earlier this year were only too happy to accept free medical , dental and veterinary care from the U.S. military for Alaska ’s remote villages ; you , dear lady , are an idiot .
In your free market wonderland everyone somehow manages to get healthcare , even those who are poor or live in isolated areas , though the poor and isolated in your own state required assistance from the federal government .
And despite all of this , you appear blithely unaware that the free market healthcare system we have now does , indeed , have “ death panels . ”
I ’ve been part of a death panel conversation .
I know about death panels .
You have no idea what it ’s like to be called into a sterile conference room with a hospital administrator you ’ve never met before and be told that your mother ’s insurance policy will only pay for 30 days in ICU .
You can't imagine what it 's like to be advised that you need to “ make some decisions , ” like whether your mother should be released “ HTD ” which is hospital parlance for “ home to die , ” or if you want to pay out of pocket to keep her in the ICU another week .
And when you ask how much that would cost you are given a number so impossibly large that you realize there really are no decisions to make .
The decision has been made for you .
" Living will " or no , it does n't matter .
The bank account and the insurance policy have trumped any legal document .
If this is n’t a “ death panel ” I do n’t know what is .
Google shutting down independent Android image developers ?
[ Announcements ] Posted Sep 25 , 2009 14:13 UTC ( Fri ) by corbet
There are reports that Google has sent a cease - and - desist letter to CyanogenMod , perhaps the most active independent creator of alternative images for Android phones since Jesus Freke left the scene .
The issue would appear to be the packaging of Google 's closed - source applications - things like maps , the market application , gmail , etc .
That is all stuff that Android phone owners already are licensed to run .
If some sort of understanding is not reached , this action could have the effect of significantly chilling outside development for Android phones .
Or perhaps it will just motivate the development of free alternatives for those few applications .

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Chinese researchers have managed to create powerful stem cells from mouse skin and used these to generate fertile live mouse pups .

They used induced pluripotent skin cells , or iPS cells -- cells that have been reprogrammed to look and act like embryonic stem cells .
Embryonic stem cells , taken from days - old embryos , have the power to morph into any cell type and , in mice , can be implanted into a mother ’s womb to create living mouse pups .
Their experiment , published in Nature , means that it is theoretically possible to clone someone using ordinary connective tissue cells found on the person ’s skin , but the experts were quick to distance themselves from such controversy .
“ We are confident that tremendous good can come from demonstrating the versatility of reprogrammed cells in mice , and this research will be used to ... understand the root causes of disease and lead to viable treatments and cures of human afflictions , ” said Fanyi Zeng of the Shanghai Institute of Medical Genetics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University .
“ It would not be ethical to attempt to use iPS cells in human reproduction .
It is important for science to have ethical boundaries , ” she said , adding that their study was “ in no way meant as a first step in that direction . ”
No one has ever cloned a human being and while many stem cell experiments in mice have been replicated in humans , not all have .
Led by Qi Zhou at the Chinese Academy of Sciences ’s State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology , the team created iPS cells , using mouse fibroblasts , which are cells found in connective tissue in the skin .
Stem cells are the body ’s master cells , giving rise to all the tissues , organs and blood .
Embryonic stem cells are considered the most powerful kind of stem cells as they have the potential to give rise to any type of tissue .
But they are difficult to make and require the use of an embryo or cloning technology .
Many people also object to using human embryonic stem cells and many countries limit funding for such experiments .
From the skin cells , the Chinese scientists created 37 stem cell lines , and of these , three generated live births .
“ One line can generate such competent mice that the longest living one we have is nine months , ” Zeng told Reuters .
“ It has generated now more than 100 of second - generation ( mice ) and more than 100 third - generation ( mice ) .
It really demonstrates how fertile and strong the system is . ”
The Chinese experiment generated questions and caution from other stem cell researchers not connected to the study .
“ These investigators have , for the first time , unequivocally demonstrated that the iPS lines they have generated are truly pluripotent , ” wrote Andrew Laslett , group leader of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Technology at the Australian Stem Cell Center in Melbourne , Australia .
Pluripotent is a term meaning the cells can give rise to all the tissues in the body .
“ Moreover , the long - term stability of both the iPS cell lines and the long - term health of the mice generated using this procedure are yet to be reported .
It will be interesting to see whether mice generated in this fashion have a higher propensity for tumor formation , ” Laslett wrote .
Among the most controversial of medical issues is the resuscitation of newborns that are unlikely to survive .
The Born - Alive Infants Protection Act ( BAIPA ) , enacted in 2002 , and the enforcement guidelines later issued by the United State ’s Department of Health and Human Services ( DHS ) outlined clinical procedures to be used in the resuscitation and care of infants born between 20 and 24 weeks gestation .
( A normal , full - term pregnancy is 37 to 42 weeks of gestation . )
This act has gained remarkably limited attention , and many neonatologists are not familiar with the act or DHS guidelines concerning its enforcement .
A recent study published in Pediatrics suggested that most neonatologists surveyed did not agree with the legislation , but that it did have the power to change medical practice if it was enforced .
The BAIPA was initially understood to be antiabortion legislation , granting legal status to all live - born infants in the United States , regardless of whether birth was spontaneous , by Cesarean section , or induced by an elective abortion .
Immediately after the passage of the BAIPA , the Neonatal Resuscitation Program Steering Committee issued an opinion that the law should not change neonatology practice with respect to the extremely premature infant .
However , the DHS soon released enforcement guidelines that threatened investigations of violations of long - standing regulations — the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act — if any lay observer claimed that medical care was withheld from a newborn .
The enforcement guidelines did not include a stipulation for a physician ’s medical training and knowledge to prevail over the layperson ’s observations .
With the threat of hefty fines and litigation , many physicians and hospitals worry about the day when the BAIPA will actually be enforced .
The last several decades have seen vast improvements in technology and understanding of neonatal physiology , but surprisingly minor improvements in the actual survivability of extremely premature and low birth weight babies .
Much debate still surrounds the gestational age and birth weight limits used to identify an infant ’s ability to survive outside of the mother ’s womb .
In most cases , survival of infants born at less than 25 weeks gestation is unlikely .
Most practitioners agree that aggressive measures of resuscitation for newborns born at less than 23 weeks gestation is futile and unwarranted .
In such cases , neonatologists are more likely to provide comfort care to the infant and the family until the infant dies naturally .
The decision to resuscitate a newborn that is unlikely to survive is a complex one that should involve physicians , other health care professionals , and parents .
However , these decisions must also be made quickly .
In these cases , timely and appropriate decision - making can decide whether an infant dies , survives with impairment , or survives intact .
The consequences of the decisions — positive or negative –- are almost immediate .
Medical professionals bring their judgment and experience , as well as perceived obligations and legal mandates to the decision - making ; parents bring cultural , personal , ideological , and religious beliefs to the decision - making .
Who should be permitted to make the final judgment of what treatment is in the best interest of the child ?
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that neonatologists perform complete prenatal consultations with parents in the likelihood of an extremely premature birth .
Most physicians are comfortable discussing clinical issues with parents , but far fewer are comfortable discussing quality - of - life issues , expected long - term outcomes , or parental preferences .
Physicians should provide parents with the medical information necessary for informed decision - making , and but should also foster parental involvement in the care of their child .
A framework for newborn resuscitation may be necessary to clarify each practitioner ’s role in the care of likely nonviable newborns , and to aid in decision - making , but the government should not be mandating medical procedures or making therapeutic decisions in a complex life or death decision of a child .

When the wind blows hard in Florida , people take cover .
But the wind does n’t blow hard enough often enough to support wind farms .
“ There ’s not a wind farm within a thousand miles of our office , ” says Mike O’Sullivan , senior vice president of NextEra Energy Resources , an independent power producer that is part of the FPL Group , which is based in Juno Beach , Florida .
That has n’t prevented FPL from becoming America ’s No. 1 producer of wind power .
“ GE , Goldman Sachs , BP -- all the guys you read about -- they do n’t have even a fraction of what we have invested in renewables , even though they run some pretty fancy ads , ” O’Sullivan says .
Perhaps because it ’s tucked away in south Florida , FPL does n’t attract much attention .
But the company , with 2008 revenues of more than $ 16 billion , about 39,000 megawatts of generating capacity , and more than 15,000 employees in 27 states and Canada , has become a leading generator of low - carbon energy .
Notice I did n’t say renewable energy ; about 28 percent of the FPL Group ’s electricity generation comes from nuclear power , which is low carbon , whether environmentalists like it or not .
Among the top 50 electric power generators in the U.S. , FPL ranks No. 8 in terms of carbon emissions per megawatt hour of generation .
Interestingly , it trails PG&E , Exelon , Entergy and Constellation , all of which own nukes .
In its 2009 sustainability report , released this month , FPL says it operates 6,400 megawatts of wind power at 65 locations in 16 states and Canada .
The company is also bullish on solar , which it says is poised for growth , and on nuclear power .
It says :
All told , FPL Group ’s zero-emissions generation avoided 42.6 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2008 .
That ’s the carbon equivalent of removing eight coal - fired power plants or preserving 269,000 acres of forest , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ’s greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator .
Put another way , if every utility in the nation were as clean as FPL Group , total U.S. CO2 emissions would be cut by 20 percent , equivalent to removing eight of every 10 vehicles from the road , according to the company .
Still , when we spoke by phone last week , O’Sullivan made no claims to be “ green . ”
When NextEra , which as an independent power producer sells electricity to other utilities and intermediaries all over the country , decides whether to deploy capital on a new plant , make an acquisition or to use its money to pay down debt or pay dividends , the company aims to maximize its return on capital , plain and simple .
NextEra does n’t make decisions “ based on what we call brag - a - watts , doing it for the headlines or the press release , ” he tells me .
“ The main driver is shareholder value . ”
“ Nuclear and wind drive a large chunk of the earnings , ” says O’Sullivan , even though FPL Group generates more electricity by burning natural gas than from any other fuel .
Besides NextEra , FPL Group also owns Florida Power & Light , a regulated utility that serves customers in Florida .
Wind is a good business because of federal and state subsidies , O’Sullivan says .
About half of the cash flow during the 20 to 25 years life of a wind farm comes from the subsidies and tax breaks , with the other half coming from electricity sales .
The business is “ driven by public policy , ” he says .
On a standalone basis , wind could not compete with coal or natural gas which , of course , benefit from subsidies of their own , not the least of which is that they do n’t , for now , have to pay for the environmental costs of emitting tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
Of course , the climate - change legislation now making its way through Congress would put a price on the right to emit heat - trapping pollutants .
FPL supports carbon controls as a member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership .
In any event , NextEra has told Wall Street analysts that it will invest another $ 2 billion in wind in the next few years .
Finding places to put wind farms wo n’t be a problem , according to O’Sullivan .
While environmentalists have fought new wind farms in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania , those are exceptions to the rule .
“ We are n’t having a land or siting problem in rural or middle America , ” he says .
“ They love wind .
It ’s a cash crop . ”
NextEra is also pursuing solar projects in California and the southwest .
“ It ’s certainly feasible to generate a lot more of our electricity from renewables or nuclear , ” O’Sullivan says .
The big problem for low - carbon energy projects remains cost .
Wind , solar and new nuclear plants are “ not going to be as inexpensive as fossil fuels , ” he says .
That ’s not a coal company talking .
It ’s a wind guy .

After gambling his young presidency on an ambitious domestic agenda , Barack Obamas political insecurity and ideological arrogance now demand passage of a health care reform  bill that will vastly increase the federal governments role in the lives of American citizens .
This could be accomplished in a number of ways , from a Trojan Horse compromise to the so - called nuclear option of budgetary reconciliation .
But make no mistake , it will be accomplished ; despite the vocal protestations of voters across the country .
Look carefully though .
Deaf to budget warnings and terrified of a minor legislative loss , the Obama administration and its statist allies in Congress may inadvertently be committing a much larger strategic error .
The Politically Incorr ... Kevin R. C. Gutzman Best Price : $ 3.55 Buy New $ 8.80 ( as of 02:20 EST - Details )
Their miscalculation stems from a failure to recognize the true nature of President Obamas electoral mandate last fall .
Certainly plenty of Americans share his leftist world view , but many more Obama voters , especially the independents who have since abandoned him in droves , voted for his fiscally conservative platform of efficient government , lower taxes , and more transparency .
With each passing day , it becomes increasingly obvious that is not the change they got .
Instead , the eloquent centrist Americans thought they elected has been replaced by a haughty cuadillo who demands that we all shut up and get on board with his various social engineering schemes .
And always , despite the abysmal economic track record of government , his plans call for more federal control over private industry , including our single - most important industry : Health care .
However , ripping a page from the Bush playbook of condescension and demagoguery is not the way for Obama to gain trust the trust he needs .
Heavy handed federal policy turns voters off even in the best of times , and these are clearly not the best of times .
Outrage over decades of bipartisan waste , fraud , and corruption has been on display for the last six months , and widespread fear over the federal governments motives has driven millions of previously apathetic citizens to vocal and vehement political activism for the very first time .

The Best of Josh Eboch
Once again Larry at The Daily Mirror dug up something interesting from the L.A. Times archives .
It ’s a 1969 article about–gasp ! –a female ranch hand .
What ’s fascinating is the way that , while discussing how she does things that are n’t traditionally considered female , the reporter describes her in ways that emphasize her femininity so we know she ’s not completely un-womanly .
She ’s as cute as all get - out and as strong as a heifer .
She ’s the only female ranch - hand ( “ do n’t call me a cowgirl , it ’s a dude term ” ) …
… ” I was never quite like all the other little girls . ”
Beverly always wanted to be a cowboy–always wore bluejeans to school …
But she also succeeded in remaining ultrafeminine in an impish sort of way …
She bemoans the fact that she has to keep her hair trimmed to a maximum of two inchles all over her head …
And :
Text :
“ I enjoy working , ” she said .
“ I do n’t whine or cry when there is a lot to do .
I love my job . ”
For this she is known as “ comadrie , ” meaning little mother … ”
She ’s also described as “ coy ” :
But to the likely relief of many readers , she goes on to say that probably she eventually will get married .
Reading the entire article , I ca n’t help but suspect that ’s more out of a sense that you have to than a real desire on her part .
She kind of reminds me of my grandma , who I think got married and had kids mostly because what else could a woman do ?
I suspect if she ’d been able to get a job as a ranch hand , she would have happily done that instead .
And while they do n’t call her a “ cowgirl , ” this title from the second page of the article might not be what she was hoping for instead :
Now , if this was just an historical curiosity , I would n’t have posted it .
But the thing is , we still see this type of emphasis on the femininity of women who succeed at things we consider “ men ’s work . ”
For instance , see this post on WNBA player Candace Parker , or Lisa ’s post about Caster Semenya .
Or even just compare the uniforms of male and female athletes .
We ’re more comfortable with women who break some gender rules as long as they maintain their femininity by following other rules .

BEIJING  Trials may begin this week for more than 200 people charged with crimes after riots last month in China ’s far - western Xinjiang region , the state - run newspaper China Daily reported on Monday .
China Daily , an English - language newspaper , quoted an unnamed police source as saying security had already been ratcheted up for the trials , which would be held in the Intermediate People ’s Court in Urumqi , Xinjiang ’s capital , site of the riots .
The charges include vandalizing public property , inciting crowds to cause bodily harm , murder , arson and robbery , the newspaper said .
Investigators were reported to have assembled more than 3,300 pieces of evidence for the trials , including video clips , photographs and bloodied weapons .
At least 197 people died and 1,600 were injured during several days of violence that began July 5 after Uighurs took to the streets to protest the treatment of Uighur factory workers involved in a dispute in southeastern China .
The rioters lashed out at Han Chinese , China ’s dominant ethnic group , who made up most of the dead and injured .
Gangs of Han took revenge on Uighurs in the last days of the violence .

DUCATI have decided to call its Triumph Tiger beater the ' Cayenne ' , the same as the pig-ugly Porsche 4x4 SUV thing .
The bike , currently being ‘ caught ’ out testing on the roads near the factory , is powered by a water - cooled , two - cylinder 1098 cc motor the same as is used in the Streetfighter but the power in taken down from 155 to 140 bhp .
A 20 - litre petrol tank and good riding position should make it popular enough , although the price tag of around £ 12,000 may put a few people off .
Expect to see it at this year ’s big bike shows .
Financial markets , like online communities , are social networks .
Researchers are looking at whether the mechanisms and models being developed to explore collective behavior on the Web can be applied to financial markets .
A team of six economists , finance experts and computer scientists at Cornell was recently awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation to pursue that goal .

“ The hope is to take this understanding of contagion and use it as a perspective on how rapid changes of behavior can spread through complex networks at work in financial markets , ” explained Jon M. Kleinberg , a computer scientist and social network researcher at Cornell .
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Andrew W. Lo , director of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering , is taking a different approach to incorporating human behavior into finance .
His research focuses on applying insights from disciplines , including evolutionary biology and cognitive neuroscience , to create a new perspective on how financial markets work , which Mr. Lo calls “ the adaptive - markets hypothesis . ”
It is a departure from the “ efficient - market ” theory , which asserts that financial markets always get asset prices right given the available information and that people always behave rationally .
Efficient - market theory , of course , has dominated finance and econometric modeling for decades , though it is being sharply questioned in the wake of the financial crisis .
“ It is not that efficient market theory is wrong , but it ’s a very incomplete model , ” Mr. Lo said .
Mr. Lo is confident that his adaptive - markets approach can help model and quantify liquidity crises in a way traditional models , with their narrow focus on expected returns and volatility , cannot .
“ We ’re going to see three - dimensional financial modeling and eventually N - dimensional modeling , ” he said .
J. Doyne Farmer , a former physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and a founder of a quantitative trading firm , finds the behavioral research intriguing but awfully ambitious , especially to build into usable models .
Instead , Mr. Farmer , a professor at the interdisciplinary Sante Fe Institute , is doing research on models of markets , institutions and their complex interactions , applying a hybrid discipline called econophysics .
To explain , Mr. Farmer points to the huge buildup of the credit - default - swap market , to a peak of $ 60 trillion .
And in 2006 , the average leverage on mortgage securities increased to 16 to 1 ( it is now 1.5 to 1 ) .
Put the two together , he said , and you have a serious problem .

I want to be a teacher and help others like myself realise their dreams
Shashi Arya
A dream has come true for 135 young people living in slums across the Indian capital , Delhi .
All have just started classes after successfully getting admission into Delhi University .
Coming from poor families , none of them ever imagined they would go to college .
But it has happened with the help of a local non-governmental organisation .
They have helped them in everything from filling out forms , buying books and paying their tuition fees .
Myriad problems Eighteen - year - old Shashi Arya is a bubbly girl , who loves to tell her story .
We knew we had to build their confidence and tell them that they are no less than anyone else
Asha founder Kiran Martin
Her family lives in one room in a slum in south Delhi .
The lanes leading to her home are narrow and crowded .
Families live cheek by jowl and they face myriad problems including a lack of water and electricity .
There is also the fear of losing their home as the Delhi government is determined to demolish all slums within the city before the Commonwealth Games are held here next year .
Despite all this Shashi is one of the young women who has got into university this year , helped by the organisation Asha .
This is something she never believed could happen .
" Of course I had dreams of going to college , " Shashi says , " but because my family is so poor , all I could think of was getting a job to help them .
" I want to be a teacher and help others like myself realise their dreams . "
When her father refused to pay for her to study anymore , Shashi did it herself by tutoring other children and making money .
She has just begun a BA programme at Maitreyi College with financial help from Asha .
Neglected Another grateful beneficiary of the scheme is 19 - year - old Mahesh Sharma , from a family of six , who is doing his BA in geography .
Opportunities are few and far between in Delhi 's slums Studying was a big problem for him with so many family members living in one room .
Such obstacles are numerous for students from poorer backgrounds , says Asha founder Kiran Martin .
" We have college preparation workshops , because we knew that there 's going to be a problem of integration , " she said .
" Since these children have always lived on the margins of society , they 've in fact never in their lives mixed and mingled with children that are much wealthier than them .
" So what basically we did was try and prepare them because we knew we had to build their confidence and tell them that they are no less than anyone else - and at the end of the day the great equaliser will be how well they do in their exams . "
Most of these students are the first in their families to go to college .
Of the 135 students , more than 40 % are women , who are usually the most neglected when it comes to education in poorer families .

Ubisoft's CEO Yves Guillemot and EA Games president Frank Gibeau have both praised Sony for cutting the price of the PlayStation 3 , making the home console an attractive prospect for the mass market consumer .
" It 's exceptional news , actually .
I think the machine is a great machine , with the Blu-ray ,  commented Guillemot , speaking to GamesIndustry .biz .
" I 'm happy that they were able to move to that [ price point ] , particularly in the UK . "
Sony has reduced the price of its console to EUR 299 in mainland Europe , and GBP 249 in the UK with immediate effect , ahead of the release of slimmer unit due in the first week of September .
" I think it 's awesome , " enthused Gibeau .
" It 's an old line , but it still rings true for us : ' We make the ammunition for the hardware wars ' .
So the lowest priced hardware possible is a good thing for us .
We want to see as big and broad a base as possible , and the Sony hardware is a good piece of equipment . "
The redesign will help the PlayStation 3 shift more units in Europe , said Guillemot  a positive for Sony as well as the industry as a whole  as it now becomes a more attractive purchase to a mass market consumer .
" It 's also going to be a smaller machine , and I think this will help Sony and the whole industry - because everybody will react , and so we 'll be able to see it come to the mass market , " he said .
Gibeau agreed that the new price will allow publishers to reach more consumers .
" Getting into that price point is just going to expand the market for us , especially in Europe .
We have a lot of PS3 games , we 're a good supporter of Sony , we believe in the platform .
We 've got a lot of PSP games coming , and frankly we also support the PlayStation Network with direct - to - consumer releases .
" So we 're strong , committed partners of Sony and I 'm extremely excited about the Slim - I think it looks great .
And the price point will be hot . "
Lower prices will help the current console market sustain a longer lifecycle , said Gibeau , meaning publishers and developers can concentrate on existing hardware rather than invest in future technology .
" The good news is that we still have a lot of price points to go yet - Nintendo , Microsoft and Sony - which points to a longer cycle for hardware this time around .
And again , for us it 's great , because we do n't have to go out and build a whole new set of engines for next - gen , " he said .
I got the last 2 of the 5 sections built last week , sans the corrugated roofing .
Here ’s how I did it , at warp speed :
This marked the first use of my new truck , for 2×4s and small ply panels from Home Depot .
What a joy !
As an aside , when I cut this particular 2×4 to length …
... I made a new friend .
I think it ’s a fat bird .
As another side , whenever I stack up cut 2×4s like this , I get a terrific urge to build a deck , or workbench :
If you need any more asides , read the description I put under this image at flickr as to why so much of the green Douglas fir I ’ve been getting from Home Depot lately smells strongly of lemons when I cut it .
Enough asides .
On to the updates !
Last week I was all finished , sans the roofing …
Home Depot only had the corrugated plastic I picked up previously in 8 ’ lengths in 12 ’ lengths this time .
Now I know a bit more about the dimensions of the new truck ( 12 ’ from windshield to tailgate ) :
And there it is with the roofing .
It was just not quite long enough after cutting the 12 ’ into 4 3 ’ sections , so I used 2 pieces of scrap like shingles in the middle to patch the difference , and nailed everything down .
You ca n’t tell when you ’re out there .
It just looks like one long solid piece , unless you ’re looking for joints .
Other angle :
The keen observer may have noticed this switchbox in a previous image :
This is the first bit of electrical doodadery I ’ve ever wired up .
I mentioned at the end of the previous ( and first ) post in this series that I was adding something ‘ quirky ’ soon , and this is it : rope lighting !
Specifically , it ’s 4 24 ’ sections , which fit rather perfectly across the 20 ’- wide shelves , with 2 ’ available at the ends for wrapping around the 2 ’ depth .
Rope lights are n’t too expensive .
I thought I ’d find nothing appropriate , or something close enough , but not outdoor - rated , or I ’d only find 5 ’ sections , or it would be $ 50 for 10 ’ .
However , it was only $ 15 for 24 ’ .
They had 100 ’ at a savings over buying in shorter sections .
Knowing now what I knew then , I ’d go for that , as I redid these to all chain together in one long 96 ’ rope with a single plug anyway .
The roofing was n’t in place on the last 2 sections when I did this , but now everything ’s hidden on this end properly :
This is also before I zig - zagged things – a decision made when I decided to wire up my own switchbox and use a single outlet and switch to throw all ropes on at once – but it shows that the ropes run along the top edge of the front 2 × 4 shelf supports , via the included clear plastic screw - in C- clips :
So fun !
It ’s like a refrigerator , and I admit it …
I got a little hungry the first time I plugged these all in and lit them up :)
I ’m also reminded of bakery display cases .
This is not helping my diet .
The whole thing is such a beautiful mix of warm ambient light bouncing off of warm wood textures that it immediately made me feel calm .
I ’m a computer nerd usually , inside reading things on the net in a reclining office chair , never going outside .
However , the first night , and at least one other night since , I ’ve just gone out , flipped on the lights , sat on the ground and just relaxed , petting the loudly purring neighbor ’s cat who likes to visit me a few times a day now .
It ’s a real joy having these , and shows me how great it can be to add some aesthetics into a project .
It just makes you want to be around the creations a lot more , and raises quality of life .
This somewhat dreary corner of my yard is now one of my favorite places , and I like to find excuses to go check on things , or shuffle them around , and in that , I think it will help me make my projects everywhere else better , hoping for similar feelings from them .

A Missouri woman has become the first person to be charged with felony cyberbullying in that state after she allegedly posted photos and personal information of a teenage girl to the Casual Encounters section of Craigslist .
Prosecutors said Elizabeth A. Thrasher , 40 , posted the 17 - year - old 's picture , cell phone number , email address , and employer to the Craigslist section , which is frequented by adults looking for anonymous , no -strings - attached sex .
The girl received lewd emails and calls in response , including pornographic pictures from men she did n't know .
The incident began after Thrasher had an extended argument with the girl 's mother , according to authorities .
Eventually , the girl sent Thrasher a message over MySpace .
Thrasher responded by posting the racy ad on Craigslist and making it appear as if it came from the girl .
Thrasher was charged under a law the Missouri legislature passed in response to an unrelated cyberbullying incident that ended with the suicide of 13 - year - old Megan Meier .
In that case , Lori Drew and several accomplices created a fake MySpace account belonging to a boy named Josh and used it to send Meier messages that were friendly at first .
Eventually , they sent a message that had the good - looking boy tell Meier the world would be a better place without her .
Shortly afterward , the girl hanged herself in her bedroom closet .
Drew was later convicted of several misdemeanors in federal court , but the judge overseeing the case has overturned the verdict and said he will acquit her .
At the time , Missouri had no statute that outlawed the behavior .
Under a new cyberbullying law that went into effect last year , suspects can be charged with either a misdemeanor or felony .
Thrasher , who was free on $ 10,000 bond , faces a maximum four years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine if convicted .
An attorney representing Thrasher told The St. Louis Post - Dispatch the Craigslist posting was a practical joke .
The Associated Press has additional details here . ®
Congress Daily reports new CBO estimates show a strong public option would save an additional $ 85 billion compared to a weak one :
In a bid to wrangle concessions from the Blue Dog Coalition on healthcare reform , House leaders Thursday released CBO estimates for liberals ' preferred version of the public option that show $ 85 billion more in savings than for the version the Blue Dogs prefer .
Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin , D - S.D. , a Blue Dog co-chair , said any possible new momentum toward a public option tethered to Medicare rates is , in part , " because of the cost issue " and the updated CBO score .
The original House bill required the public plan to pay providers 5 percent more than Medicare reimbursement rates .
But as part of a package of concessions to Blue Dogs , the House Energy and Commerce Committee accepted an amendment that requires the HHS Secretary to negotiate rates with providers .
That version of the plan will save only $ 25 billion .
In total , a public plan based on Medicare rates would save $ 110 billion over 10 years .
That is $ 20 billion more than earlier estimates , a spokesman for House Speaker Pelosi said .
As Ezra Klein writes , the CBO scoring only reflects the savings to government -- there would be additional savings to consumers .
Moreover , the CBO is estimating savings to the government .
That is to say , the $ 85 billion reflects reduced federal spending on subsidies because premiums in the public plan will be lower .
Savings to individuals and businesses paying lower premiums will be much larger than $ 85 billion , and politically , much more important .
Those who oppose the public option -- Republicans and a diminishing group of Democrats -- really are on the wrong side of this debate .
The public option is n't about creating an expensive new government program that would give Ronald Reagan nightmares -- it 's about making health care insurance cheaper and better for more people .
The public option is a simple idea , it 's a good idea , and it 's popular .
There is no reason it should n't happen .
Investigation Should Proceed Without Interference
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK – Former CIA directors , including some of the architects of the Bush administration 's interrogation policies , today sent a letter to President Obama encouraging him to reverse Attorney General Eric Holder 's decision to investigate whether crimes were committed in connection with the interrogation of detainees in U.S. custody overseas .
The American Civil Liberties Union has called on the Justice Department to conduct a comprehensive criminal investigation into the Bush administration 's rendition , interrogation and detention program .
The following can be attributed to Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project :
" Attorney General Holder initiated a criminal investigation because the available evidence shows that prisoners were abused and tortured in CIA custody .
The suggestion that President Obama should order Attorney General Holder to abort the investigation betrays a misunderstanding of the role of the attorney general as well as the relationship between the attorney general and the president .
Where there is evidence of criminal conduct , the attorney general has not just the authority but the duty to investigate .
The attorney general is the people 's lawyer , not the president 's lawyer , and it would be profoundly inappropriate for President Obama to interfere with his work .
" The attorney general 's investigation should be allowed to proceed without interference , and it certainly should not be derailed by the self - serving protests of former CIA officials who oversaw the very crimes that are being investigated .
If there is a problem with the unfolding criminal investigation , it is that its focus is too narrow .
There is abundant evidence that torture was authorized at the highest levels of the Bush administration , and the Justice Department 's investigation should be broad enough to encompass Bush administration lawyers and senior officials – including the CIA officials – who authorized torture . "
Last we checked , the “ new ” iPod Touch ’s have yet to hit any Apple Stores , and despite Steve Jobs assertions to the contrary , something ’s afoot here .
The most likely explanation is that cameras were , in fact , poised to be in the new iPod Touch models , but that quality issues forced Apple to readjust midstream and simply offer capacity and processor upgrades .
One obvious clue that flew under our radar , but was picked up upon by Seth Weintraub at ComputerWorld , was that the demo for Assassin ’s Creed showcased the ability for users to take a photo of themselves , and attach it to a “ Wanted ” poster within the game .
Clearly , the developers there were banking on new camera equipped iPod Touches .
It ’s also possible that the developers had this feature in mind only for the iPhone , but we doubt it .
Speculating on what sort of technical glitches might have been plaguing the iPod Touch , Weintraub writes that Apple may have had problems fitting the camera into the device , which measures “ just .33 inches thick at its thickets point ” without “ making it weak or susceptible to damage . ”
Also , keep in mind that the logical spot to place the camera would be at the top of the device , similar to the iPhone ’s camera location , which means that the space Apple had to work with was even smaller .
As for Jobs ’ assertion that Apple wanted to make the iPod Touch affordable to the masses , well , Apple already did that in the form of 8 GB model which sells for $ 199 .
While we opined earlier on Apple trying to differentiate the iPod Touch from the iPhone , it ’s also possible that Apple was willing to forgo that differentiation in the interest of taking a giant leap ahead of the upcoming Zune HD , which thus far has been getting pretty strong reviews .
Yesterday we noted that a camera enabled iPod Touch is still very much in the works over at Apple , with the only variable being when that update might be made .
Interestingly , Weintraub writes that he ’s heard that “ Apple wants to have these things in full production by Christmas and that they ’ve made only a few months of camera - less models to tide the market over until the new ones are ready . ”
While Weintraub does n’t cite a source for the rumor , we ’re inclined to hop on board and agree .
There ’s no way that Apple would wait an entire production cycle ( i.e next September ) before introducing an iPod Touch with a camera .
And assuming that Apple does announce an updated iPod Touch sometime in late November , you can bet that the pundits will be out in full force decrying Apple for upgrading a product so quickly .
And so the wait continues …
This is the incredible true story of a physicist who believed he could project himself to another solar system and live as a swashbuckling interplanetary adventurer .
When he was a teenager and living on a Polynesian island , he had read a series of " strange and adventurous " science fiction / fantasy books by an American writer .
The protagonist shared his name , and eventually the physicist started thinking he really was the character .
But he was still able to maintain a dual identity — he sort of " astral projected " into that fantasy world while keeping the appearance of a skinny - tie wearing physicist .
The article was written by the man 's psychiatrist , Robert Lindner , and appeared in Harper 's in 1954 .
( It was also a chapter in Linder 's entertaining case - history book The Fifty - Minute Hour ) .
The physicist , " Kirk Allen " ( his name was changed by Lindner ) , worked in a government research lab , and his superiors were concerned by his behavior ( Allen would often space out at work while his fantastical reveries played out in his head ) so they sent him to Lindner .
I do n't want to spoil the story ( and the excerpt below wo n't spoil it ) .
You can read it in its entirety at Harper 's website ( Part I , Part II ) .
Harper 's kindly opened access to the article at my request , so now anyone can read it for free .
( If you subscribe to Harper 's for just $ ( removed ) in the United States and CAN $ ( removed ) in Canada , you 'll get access to all the archives dating back to 1850 ! )
Kirk read the numerous volumes of his " biography " over and over again .
Soon he no longer needed the books " to refresh my memory , " but was able to recapitulate them entirely in his mind .
While his corporeal body was living the life of a mundane boy , the vital part of him was far off on another planet , courting beautiful princesses , governing provinces , warring with strange enemies .
Now , using his " biographer 's " material as a base , he took off on his own .
Assisted by the maps , charts , diagrams , architectural layouts , genealogical schemes , and timetables he had painstakingly worked out while using the books for his guide , he filled in spaces between the volumes with fantasy " recollections " of his own ; and when this was done , he began the task of his life : that of picking up where his " biographer " had left off and recording the subsequent history of the heroic Kirk Allen . …
For many days I pondered the question of how Kirk Allen could be restored to sanity–and yet remain alive .
For there seemed to be nothing that could compete with the unending gratifications of his fantasy .
Meanwhile Kirk turned over to me all of his records .
It is impossible to convey more than a bare impression of these .
There were , to begin with , about 12,000 pages of typescript comprising the amended " biography " of Kirk Allen .
This was divided into some 200 chapters and read like fiction .
Appended to these pages were approximately 2,000 more of notes in Kirk 's handwriting , containing corrections necessitated by his more recent " researches , " and a huge bundle of scraps and jottings on envelopes , receipted bills , laundry slips .
There also were a glossary of names and terms that ran to more than 100 pages ; 82 full - color maps carefully drawn to scale , 23 of planetary bodies in four projections , 31 of land masses on these planets , 14 labeled " Kirk Allen 's Expedition to – , " the remainder of cities on the various planets ; 161 architectural sketches and elevations , all carefully scaled and annotated ; 12 genealogical tables ; an 18 - page description of the galactic system in which Kirk Allen 's home planet was contained , with four astronomical charts , one for each of the seasons , and nine star - maps of the skies from observatories on other planets in the system ; a 200 - page history of the empire Kirk Allen ruled , with a three - page table of dates and names of battles or outstanding historical events ; a series of 44 folders containing from 2 to 20 pages apiece , each dealing with some aspect–social , economic , or scientific –of the planet over which Kirk Allen ruled .
Finally , there were 306 drawings of people , animals , plants , insects , weapons , utensils , machines , articles of clothing , vehicles , instruments , and furniture .
The reader can imagine my dismay at the sheer bulk of this material ; I do not know if he can appreciate with what misgivings I approached the task of weaning this man from his madness .
Aside from everything else , he was my patient under the most inauspicious possible conditions , for he had not come of his own volition .
The authorities had sent him , demanding he be treated not only for his sake but because they feared that in his disturbed condition he was a poor security risk who could neither be kept on the job nor discharged .
Speculation abounds on the true identity of Kirk Allen .
Alan C. Elms thinks it could be Cordwainer Smith .
It 's more fun for me to think Kirk Allen 's real name was John Carter and that he had fantasized that being on Barsoom , fighting the bad Martians while Deja Thoris stayed at home hatching the eggs containing his and her children .

Marijuana legalization is the hottest topic in the media these days .
MSNBC , CNBC , CNN , FOX , NatGeo , and CBS News have presented special features on marijuana business , medical marijuana , and the marijuana legalization movement .
Google Trends is showing double the interest in searches and news hits for the term “ marijuana legalization ” .
Showtime ’s hit series Weeds , about a suburban mom turned pot dealer , is entering its fifth season .
Everywhere you look , corporate media are happy to profit from America ’s most popular herb .
Unless you want to address marijuana ’s illegality and the lives that are shattered by the effects of marijuana prohibition .
In that case , the corporate media cannot have anything to do with you , even if you want to pay to broadcast the message of ending adult marijuana prohibition .
Case in point : CBS .
At the end of June , CBS ’s new internet radio venture , ChatAboutIt.com , contacted NORML .
One of our advisory board , Ann Druyan , advertised her podcast in Talkers Magazine , an industry journal for talk radio .
ChatAboutIt was interested in hosting Druyan ’s show , but Druyan was n’t interested in the offer .
This is where I come in .
I am a talk radio professional , having hosted my show ( The Russ Belville Show ) on XM Satellite Radio and AM 620 KPOJ in Portland , for almost two years .
I have guest - hosted for the extremely popular Bill Press Show in Washington DC .
For the past year and a half , I have hosted NORML ’s Daily Audio Stash , the organization ’s daily news and interviews podcast .
I contacted ChatAboutIt to discuss creating a new live talk radio show dedicated to this incredibly popular phenomenon around medical marijuana and marijuana legalization called NORML SHOW LIVE .
Throughout the negotiations , the salesman from ChatAbout It was fantastic .
He joined me and NORML ’s executive staff by conference call .
We emphasized that we are NORML , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
We told them that we would have advertisers involved with promoting marijuana – legally , as they are co-ops and dispensaries in California and Colorado – marijuana - themed magazines , doctors , clinics , authors , musicians , and so on .
We told them we would be talking about marijuana legalization , our web page would have marijuana leaves on it , callers would be talking about marijuana , and , oh , by the way , did we mention that the show was about marijuana ?
It ’s all good , we were assured by the salesman .
He said he ’d run it all by his VP and this was fine .
He said we ’d own all our content and we could run all our ads .
We verbally agreed this was a go and all we needed to do was to raise the $ 6,000 necessary to pay for the first two months of broadcast .
We explained that we ’d need to produce some press releases to raise the money .
To be sure we were n’t saying or promoting anything in any way that CBS would not approve , we submitted our release to CBS , which did make some changes .
They approved of our revised release and we posted it on the NORML Blog and front page on Wednesday .
Thursday morning I receive a call from the salesman at ChatAbout It .
“ People higher up ” had seen the release “ on the blogs ” and they “ will not green light your show ” .
Now , CBS has all the right in the world to decide what to put on their airwaves or cyberstreams ; I ’m not crying “ censorship ” .
If they want to pass up affiliation with the most recognized brand in marijuana and a professional live call - in show dealing with the hottest topic in the media , that ’s their call .
What I am crying , though , is “ hypocrisy ” .
See , CBS owns Showtime .
That very same Showtime that ’s aired for the past five years the tale of Nancy Botwin , suburban pot-dealing mom on Weeds .
A show that films many scenes in the legal marijuana clinics and dispensaries in California that would be our advertisers .
A show that just this year signed contracts with NORML to allow display of our trademark in the scenes where it is shown in Weeds .
And it cannot be that CBS is OK with airing a dramatic interpretation of marijuana culture , but afraid of airing a serious news program about marijuana culture .
CBS
News has an entire web special feature entitled “ Marijuana Nation ” ( not - so - coincidentally the tag line of NORML SHOW LIVE ) devoted to all their news coverage about marijuana dating back to Mike Wallace in 1968 .
CBS will show Weeds to make money off of people who like marijuana , but wo n’t allow its banner advertisements for Weeds to be seen on any website trying to keep those marijuana lovers from arrest and a criminal record .
CBS will pepper their news coverage and websites with cannaporn * and cannabusiness , but wo n’t allow a non-profit organization attempting to legalize those industries to have a voice on their networks .
Case # 2 : In addition to hosting NORML ’s podcast and social blog , I am NORML ’s Outreach Coordinator .
In this position I recruit activists from all across the country ( even the US Virgin Islands ) to organize NORML chapters .
These independent affiliates host events , gather petition signatures , and provide education to the community to counteract the anti-marijuana propaganda from the government ( such as our “ drug czar ” recently proclaiming – in California , no less – that “ Marijuana is dangerous and has no medicinal benefit . ” )
I was contacted by the tour manager for the “ Blazed and Confused ” Tour .
The artists performing in the most pro-marijuana concert of the summer are Mickey Avalon , Bob Marley ’s son Stephen Marley , San Diego rockers Slightly Stoopid , and Snoop Dogg , probably the most recognizable person alive associated with marijuana aside from Willie Nelson .
They , particularly Slightly Stoopid , wanted NORML chapters to host marijuana information tables for the concerts and offered us the opportunity for free .
I combed through my chapter listings and got them NORML booths for over half the shows .
At the show in Portland I got to interview Miles from Slightly Stoopid and wander around backstage .
The props for the Stoopid show were two massive five foot skulls with pot leaves on the forehead .
Snoop ’s show featured a huge backdrop reading “ Tales from the Crip ” and marijuana leaves were all around .
Everyone performing at or attending this concert was very pro-marijuana legalization .
Yet this morning I ’m contacted by the tour people who tell me they need to cancel the booth we have scheduled for the show last Saturday in Orlando .
It seems the venue is the Hard Rock , and “ because they are a Universal owned company they are much more conservative than your typical venue . ”
This Universal , of course , is NBC Universal , the parent company to the MSNBC and CNBC networks that reported their highest ratings ever for their marijuana - themed news reports on the burgeoning cannabis business in California .
The same NBC Universal that is happy to sell you Cheech & Chong ’s Next Movie , Dazed & Confused , and Half Baked on DVD .
The same NBC Universal that has no problem allowing Snoop Dogg to get the crowd at the Hard Rock in Orlando to chant “ Legalize It ” , but somehow ca n’t let a couple of college kids in NORML T - shirts hand out educational fliers about why we should legalize it .
Case # 3 : Another marijuana legalization organization , Marijuana Policy Project ( MPP ) , produced an excellent TV ad calling for passage of a bill to tax and regulate cannabis for adults .
The governor had recently called for an open debate about legalization and MPP created this thirty second ad to begin that debate :
Certainly a sober and non-sensational way to debate the issue .
Yet when MPP offered the ad to California stations , Los Angeles ’ KABC ( ABC ) and KTTV ( FOX ) , San Francisco ’s KGO ( ABC ) , and San Jose ’s KNTV ( NBC ) refused to accept the ad .
KNTV said their standards department would n’t approve the ad.
KGO issued an official “ no comment . ” KABC and KTTV did n’t even bother give the courtesy of a “ no comment ” – they would not respond to MPP ’s inquiries .
I ’ve detailed NBC ’s and CBS ’s profiting from cannabis culture .
You ’d think ABC , being a part of the Walt Disney Corporation , would generally shy away from profiting from cannabis culture .
But a little digging shows they own Miramax films , which this year released Adventureland , a comedy about teenagers smoking and dealing weed while working at an amusement park and in 2001 offered Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back , the adventures of two inveterate stoners who wrote a stoner comic book .
FOX for eight years aired That 70 ’s
Show , a ratings hit whose signature sight gag was teenagers sitting in a smoke - filled basement passing around a joint or bong ( never seen , however ) , with the camera focusing on each character as they “ passed the dutchie on the left hand side ” .
So it is OK for the corporate parents of CBS , NBC , ABC , and FOX to profit from movies and TV shows that satirize marijuana culture , but they have a “ standards and practices ” problem with their broadcast affiliates showing 30 seconds of a 38 - year - old woman suggesting we should tax and regulate marijuana .
Keep in mind in these cases , we are talking about one part of the big media company raking in huge profits with shows about the marijuana community , while another part of the big media company refuses the free educational fliers , paid advertisements , and pay - to - play broadcasts BY AND FOR the marijuana community .
Marijuana is the modern day minstrel show – we ’re allowed on the air as long as we keep on our “ greenface ” , shuck and jive ( or would it be “ smoke and pass ” ? ) , and never forget our proper place .
By the way , the NORML SHOW LIVE mentioned in Case # 1 will still be going on the air , as promised , on Labor Day Weekend .
Unlike CBS , we keep our promises to our customers .
The money raised will go into promotions and producing our show through the facilities of BlogTalkRadio.com , which was happy to accept our business , and quite frankly , offers us a better production technology at one - sixth the price .
Tune in every Saturday Night at 9 pm Eastern for two hours of intelligent discussion about marijuana legalization .
* Cannaporn is the news specials that like to show lots and lots of pictures of big green sticky buds and the people smoking them , usually the same stock footage they ’ve run for years with the most stereotypical “ stoner ” types they can find , lots of pictures of bongs and tie dyes , some b- roll from a music festival , or body - armored police helicoptering in to chop down marijuana plants , while intoning the reefer madness du jour about increased potency , psychosis , or clandestine cartel grows and violence that would n’t exist in a legal market .
In other words , not what you will find on NORML SHOW LIVE .

Suppose , for example , that your 30 - gigabyte iPod with video has some problems .
If the device is still under warranty , you send it back to Apple .
If the warranty has lapsed , you can still send it to Apple and it will cost $ 129 to repair or $ 59 for a new battery , which is often the problem .
At Rapid Repair , the highest repair cost would $ 90 , but often runs less if the trouble is minor .
The company also offers to replace batteries for $ 20 .
“ About half our customers buy the parts and do their repairs themselves , ” Mr. Vronko said .
He suggests , though , that once the item is about five years old , it ’s probably not worth fixing .
What if the product is still under warranty , but something that is n’t covered breaks , and you want to get someone to fix it for less than the manufacturer will charge ?
You need to check if the repair company is authorized by the manufacturer .
If it is , then typically the repair can be done and the warranty remains valid if other problems crop up .
Here is another option .
Let ’s say you have a technologically savvy friend who is willing to help you figure out your computer ’s problem .
But she lives in California and you live in London .
There are a variety of services and software that allow you to remotely control a computer .
I checked out a company called CrossLoop , which offers two options .
You can download software from the company ’s Web site that allows you to remotely gain access to another computer system  either MacIntosh or Microsoft Windows  and diagnose the difficulty .
To protect security , said Mrinal Desai , co-founder of CrossLoop , each time you and your friend use the software , you must type in a randomly generated 12 - digit code that is changed for each use .
And both of you have to do it within two minutes .
Out here in the Pacific Northwest , we 're well acquainted by experience with Bill O'Reilly 's utter cluelessness about the cultural and political geography and climate of our region .
But last night on The O'Reilly Factor , he really reached comedic heights .
His big scoop , warranting a full Team O'Reilly Investigation , was the news that the University of Oregon in Eugene is a boiling , roiling hotbed of liberalism -- so much so that only eight people out of the 186 professors surveyed identified as Republicans .
Actually , the survey is a somewhat peculiar clumping that only includes the schools of political science , law , economics , sociology and journalism -- which have a tendency towards liberal - arts profs anyway .
Excluded from the survey were profs in the business , engineering , chemistry or math fields .
One assumes the numbers would look somewhat different with their inclusion .
So this is what has outraged O'Reilly ?
Calling it an " appalling situation , " O'Reilly sicced his ambush camera teams on the hapless provost of the school while he was en route to his car in a parking garage .
Then he spent the next several minutes bashing Eugene and the UofO , with the help of Portland radio host Lars Larson , who was happy to bash his fellow Oregonians .
That 's because , of course , Eugene has for many years been one of those cultural meccas for the hippie / Deadhead / peace / love / understanding crowd .
The UofO campus has long attracted liberals and liberal - minded people , and the cultural climate is the kind that tends not to be very attractive to conservatives .
But then , that 's just the way the Northwest is ; there 's a diverse array of people and cultures out here , and they each have their niches .
The gamut runs from Eugene to Hayden Lake .
One wonders what O'Reilly might find if he were to do a similarly selective survey of the business and engineering schools at Washington State University in Pullman , where the cultural climate runs decidedly in the other direction .
Bet we wo n't see Jesse Watters out there anytime soon .
In other words , O'Reilly is not breaking any news here .
Nor is it anything to get particularly worked up about .
But it is amusing to watch O'Reilly make a complete fool of himself , anyway .
A general purpose JavaScript platform
Narwhal is a cross-platform , multi- interpreter , general purpose JavaScript platform .
It aims to provide a solid foundation for building JavaScript applications , primarily outside the web browser .
Narwhal includes a package manager , module system , and standard library for multiple JavaScript interpreters .
Currently Narwhal ’s Rhino support is the most complete , but other engines are available too .
Narwhal ’s standard library conforms to the CommonJS standard .
It is designed to work with multiple JavaScript interpreters , and to be easy to add support for new interpreters .
Wherever possible , it is implemented in pure JavaScript to maximize reuse of code among engines .
Combined with Jack , a Rack - like JSGI compatible library , Narwhal provides a platform for creating server - side JavaScript web applications and frameworks such as Nitro .

Documentation
Note :
If you are viewing this on GitHub , the links below will not work .
Find the pages listed below in the docs / directory of this repository .
Quick Start
Download Narwhal .
download and extract the zip or tar archive , or
git clone git://github.com/280north/narwhal.git
Put Narwhal on your PATH environment variable .
export PATH=$PATH:~/narwhal/bin , or
, or source narwhal / bin/ activate
Run narwhal or js ( they are equivalent ) .
js narwhal / examples / hello
Look at the options for Narwhal .
js -- help
And for Tusk , the package manager and virtual environment tool .
tusk help
My First Web Server
Create a project “ hello - web ” .
tusk init hello - web cd hello - web
Enter your project as a “ virtual environment ” using activate or sea so that its libraries , binaries , and packages get automatically installed when you run Narwhal .
source bin/activate
or
bin/sea
Install some packages you will need , like Jack , the JSGI standard library for interoperable web services .
tusk install jack
Tusk gets downloaded and installed at “ hello- web / packages / jack ” .
Create your jackconfig.js .
exports.app = function ( env ) { var text =
" Hello , Web ! " ; return { status : 200 , headers : { " Content - Type " : " text / plain " , " Content - Length " : String ( text.length ) } , body : [ text ] } ; } ;
Run it !
jackup
jackup looks for a file called jackconfig.js in the current directory , or you can specify a path to a Jack application .
Open http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser .
Module System Basics
Narwhal “ scripts ” are CommonJS compatible modules , much like Python or Ruby modules .
You do not have to use module pattern boilerplate ; every module has its own local scope .
You can get the exports object of another module by calling require .
var FS = require ( " file " ) ; FS.isFile ( " foo.txt " ) ;
Module identifiers for require come in three flavors : “ top - level ” , “ relative ” , and “ absolute ” .
In the above case , file is a “ top - level ” identifier , so it will load any module called file .js in the lib directory of whichever package comes first in the load path .
Relative identifiers have .
or .. as their first term , and terms are delimited with / .
So , in the foo / bar module , require ( './ baz ' ) will load foo / baz .
Absolute module identifiers should not be used directly , but are produced when you execute a program module outside the module path .
The module is identified by its fully - qualified path , starting with / .
You can export an object by assigning it to exports .
exports.foo = function ( ) { return " Hello " ; } ;
In a module , you also get a module object that has module.id and module .
path properties so you can inspect your own top - level module identifier , and the path of your own module file .
You also get a require .
main property that tells you the top - level module identifier of the module that started the program .
if ( require.main == module ) main ( ) ; var settings = require ( require.main ) ; var FS = require ( " file " ) ; var path = FS.path ( module.path ) ; var indexHtml = path.resolve ( "./template/index.html " ).read ( ) ;
Beyond the CommonJS specification , you also get the print function and the system module object for free .
The print function accepts variadic arguments and writes a single line containing the arguments delimited by spaces to standard output and flushes .
The system module can be explicitly required with require ( " system " ) as is encouraged since it is necessary for CommonJS compliance .
Do not use print or system in standard libraries .

The question to famed Christian evangelist Billy Graham :
How can I know whether a certain religious group is Christian or if it ’s a cult ?
Because we all know it ’s either one or the other …
Anyway , Graham ’s response :
… Cults often claim that they , and they alone , have the truth about God , and they often dismiss other churches as wrong or misguided .
They also may claim that God gave their founder a new revelation that “ corrects ” the “ errors ” of others .
Someone please explain to me why this is not incredible irony .

KFAR TAPUAH , West Bank 
Thirty Israeli couples are on a waiting list to move into the Kfar Tapuah settlement , which teems with children on the hilltops south of Nablus .
Some on the list grew up here .
But there is not an apartment available for sale or rent , or even a stifling trailer to be had .
If Israel built all the housing units already approved in the nation ’s overall master plan for settlements , it would almost double the number of settler homes in the West Bank , according to unpublished official data provided to The New York Times .
The decision of whether to build , and how much , goes to the heart of the tensions between the administrations of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Obama , an unaccustomed and no-budge conflict between Israel and the United States .
Washington is standing firm against any additional settlement construction in the West Bank , including what Israel argues is necessary to accommodate what it terms “ natural growth . ”
That term has been defined vaguely by Israeli officials , meaning for some that settlements should expand to accommodate only their own children .
But Mr. Netanyahu , of the conservative Likud Party , made his own wider position clear on Monday .
He said that while Israel would not allow new settlements and that some small outposts would be removed , building within the confines of established settlements should go on .
MANNINGTON TWP . --
What started for two Penns Grove women as an alleged attempt to score some cocaine ended in their arrest here this week after mistakenly calling a police officer instead of their drug dealer , authorities said .
Alinda Ford and Edna Diaz had allegedly phoned Detective Sgt. Anthony Vanaman of the Salem City Police Department on Tuesday afternoon , though it remains unclear how they made the mistake .
It is the second time in three months a person has inadvertently contacted city police seeking illicit substances .
" I think that it may happen more than it is reported , " said police Chief John Pelura III .
" It 's just that we are proactive enough to follow up on it and make an arrest . "
Police said Vanaman handed the phone to Salem County Prosecutor 's Office Detective Darryl Saunders , who posed as a drug dealer in their conversation and agreed to meet the suspects at a location in Mannington Township .
Ford , 53 , allegedly provided a description of the vehicle she and Diaz , 43 , would be driving as well as the time they would meet to purchase about $ 20 worth of cocaine .
Both women live together in a South Smith Street apartment in Penns Grove .
Members of the prosecutor 's office 's Mobile Enforcement Team and Salem City Police initiated a sting , waiting for Ford and Diaz to arrive at the rendezvous in the Memorial Hospital of Salem County parking lot , police said .
Once they showed up around 5:30 p.m. , Ford and Diaz were arrested and charged with conspiracy to possess a controlled dangerous substance and loitering with the intent to purchase a controlled dangerous substance , police said .
They were released pending municipal court .
This follows a June incident where a 22 - year - old Pennsville man and a 20 - year - old Pennsville woman were arrested on similar charges after accidentally texting an off - duty Salem corporal looking for marijuana .
Stem cells could be inhaled to treat neurological conditions ( Image : Hans Neleman / Stone / Getty )
STEM cells show promise for treating a range of neurological conditions , including Parkinson ’s , strokes and Alzheimer ’s , but it is tricky getting them into the brain .
Perhaps inhaling stem cells might be the answer – if mice are anything to go by .
Other options all have their drawbacks .
Drilling through the skull and injecting the stem cells is painful and carries some risks .
You can also inject them into the bloodstream but only a fraction reach their target due to the blood - brain barrier .

During last week ’s Developer Conference , Eurogamer scored an interview with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe ’s head of developer services , Kish Hirani , and vice president of R&D , Paul Holmam .
Both took the opportunity to not only give even greater insight as to how revolutionary Sony ’s new motion technology is , but also reveal some interesting details about the < a href= ” “ > controller itself .
When asked about the level of precision and accuracy inherent to Sony ’s new product as opposed to the competition , Holman had this to say :
“ It ’s another generation forward , or even a couple of generations .
I know in certain games or applications which are out there , people had to sort of fluff it to make it real for consumers .
But this stuff is super - accurate and the impact of that is incredible .
I think you have to play with it to realise what it will do to games . ”
Strangely , both Hirani and Holman chose to dodge questions relating to Nintendo ’s Wii MotionPlus , simply stating :
“ I do n’t think we should be commenting on the opposition … it ’s not our style . ”
However , once Microsoft ’s [ shal ] Project Natal [ / shal ] came into the discussion , nothing was held back as the two SCEE executives referenced Sony ’s past advancements in camera technology , going just short of labeling Project Natal as a “ posh < a href= ” “ > EyeToy “ .
Further on into the interview , details about the controller suggest that the colored light - up balls , able to display a full spectrum of color , are part of the final design , along with an unspecified number of buttons .
With this incredible combination of light , camera , and motion technology at their disposal , Sony will be able to provide developers with limitless opportunities to spark their imaginations .

Rated 4.5 out of 5 DuckDuckGo
This just in : Netflix appears to be set to launch Watch Instantly for some new devices — namely , the Nintendo Wii console and the little handheld platform from Apple .
The source of this rumor is " an industry executive familiar with Netflix 's plans " who spoke on ( we assume ) the condition of anonymity to Multichannel News .
That executive says that Netflix plans to launch streaming for the iPhone , iPod touch , and Nintendo Wii very soon .
The closest we can come to corroborating this information is that some of us in Orbiting HQ received surveys from Netflix a couple months ago asking us if we would take advantage of streaming to these devices if it were available , and , if necessary , would we be willing to pay a small fee to install the software .
Earlier this year , we heard a similar rumor from a Lionsgate executive that said Wii streaming was coming soon , after the success of streaming to the Xbox 360 .
And in April , Netflix posted a job listing for " engineering leader " for gaming platforms .
It 's not hard to imagine Netflix would extend this feature to the most popular mobile application platform on the planet , as well as gaming consoles .
Netflix currently offers streaming of Watch Instantly content to several devices , including some Blu-ray players , HDTV models , and the dedicated Roku set - top box .
Netflix has also offered streaming via the Web to a computer , but that method relies on Microsoft 's Silverlight — which is n't included on the browsers on either the iPhone OS nor the Wii .
Chances are — given the history of SlingPlayer Mobile — that a dedicated iPhone app would enable streaming over WiFi connections only .
Streaming to the Wii would be a custom " channel . "
We can't say that we 're not a least a little bit excited by the prospect of streaming to either type of device .
Of course , streaming to the Wii would be trivial — those devices are already hooked up to a TV and usually to a network .
Streaming to the iPhone would be fun , even handy in some situations .
Still , we 'd wager about eight times out of ten that you 'd want to stream something — to kill time while waiting in line or commuting via train or bus , for instance — you would be out of range of an open WiFi network .
Someday , perhaps , AT&T will have a network robust enough to live up to the promise of truly mobile broadband with " unlimited " data .

Sexual healing is a myth .
It is not possible to use sex to heal emotional pain ( see reparative therapy ) .
French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan wrote :
I have seen both men and women who have tried to seduce a woman to get from her the nurturing and attention they never received from their mothers .
And I have seen both women and men who have tried to seduce a man to get from him the protection and attention they never received from their fathers .
And in the end it ’s all an impossibility . [ 1 ]

Sexual Healing is also the name of a 1982 song by American singer Marvin Gaye .
A scientific scandal is casting a shadow over a number of recent peer - reviewed climate papers .
At least eight papers purporting to reconstruct the historical temperature record times may need to be revisited , with significant implications for contemporary climate studies , the basis of the IPCC 's assessments .
A number of these involve senior climatologists at the British climate research centre CRU at the University East Anglia .
In every case , peer review failed to pick up the errors .
At issue is the use of tree rings as a temperature proxy , or dendrochronology .
Using statistical techniques , researchers take the ring data to create a " reconstruction " of historical temperature anomalies .
But trees are a highly controversial indicator of temperature , since the rings principally record Co2 , and also record humidity , rainfall , nutrient intake and other local factors .
Picking a temperature signal out of all this noise is problematic , and a dendrochronology can differ significantly from instrumented data .
In dendro jargon , this disparity is called " divergence " .
The process of creating a raw data set also involves a selective use of samples - a choice open to a scientist 's biases .
Yet none of this has stopped paleoclimataologists from making bold claims using tree ring data .
In particular , since 2000 , a large number of peer - reviewed climate papers have incorporated data from trees at the Yamal Peninsula in Siberia .
This dataset gained favour , curiously superseding a newer and larger data set from nearby .
The older Yamal trees indicated pronounced and dramatic uptick in temperatures .
How could this be ?
Scientists have ensured much of the measurement data used in the reconstructions remains a secret - failing to fulfill procedures to archive the raw data .
Without the raw data , other scientists could not reproduce the results .
The most prestigious peer reviewed journals , including Nature and Science , were reluctant to demand the data from contributors .
Until now , that is .
At the insistence of editors of the Royal Society 's Philosophical Transactions B the data has leaked into the open - and Yamal 's mystery is no more .
From this we know that the Yamal data set uses just 12 trees from a larger set to produce its dramatic recent trend .
Yet many more were cored , and a larger data set ( of 34 ) from the vicinity shows no dramatic recent warming , and warmer temperatures in the middle ages .
In all there are 252 cores in the CRU Yamal data set , of which ten were alive 1990 .
All 12 cores selected show strong growth since the mid-19th century .
The implication is clear : the dozen were cherry - picked .
( This oversimplifies the story somewhat : for more detail , read this fascinating narrative by blogger BishopHill here . )
Controversy has been raging since 1995 , when an explosive paper by Keith Briffa at the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia asserted that that the medieval warm period was actually really cold , and recent warming is unusually warm .
Both archaeology and the historical accounts , Briffa was declaring , were bunk .
Briffa relied on just three cores from Siberia to demonstrate this .
Three years later Nature published a paper by Mann , Bradley and Hughes based on temperature reconstructions which showed something similar : warmer now , cooler then .
With Briffa and Mann as chapter editors of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , this distinctive pattern became emblematic - the " Logo of Global Warming " .
IPCC 's Assessment Report from 2001 - with the error bars in grey emphasised
Conservation land should be mined for minerals , says Conservation Minister Tim Groser , who is calling for the " emotional hysteria " over such a suggestion to stop .
Groser said the Government was reviewing technical procedures under schedule four of the Crown Minerals Act , which banned some mining , and no decisions had been made .
But the Government was elected on a platform to balance New Zealand 's long - term economic interests , and mining on conservation land was already happening , he said .
" If you can extract wealth from that [ conservation land ] , that 's what we should do . "
Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee said this week he wanted greater access to valuable mineral deposits in the conservation estate .
Brownlee 's comments provoked outrage from politicians and environmentalists but Groser , who is also Trade Minister , said everyone should " just calm down " .
Tourism was the the most important industry to the conservation estate and that would not change , Groser said .
" When words like `rape ' and `pillage ' come out , people should just take a deep breath , " he said .
" Mining at its worst is dreadful , but mining in a modern , technological way can have a negligible effect . "
Mining could be done in " small , discrete areas " , and deals could be struck to boost pest control and preserve new areas of forest , he said .
A good example of a " win-win " was the Pike River coal mine , near Greymouth , he said .
Last year , the Department of Conservation ( DOC ) awarded Pike River a certificate recognising its environmental consideration in establishing the mine .
Consultant geologist Richard Barker , a branch member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy , said in a March 2008 report that New Zealand metallic minerals and lignite had an in - ground value of $ 240 billion .
Tourism Industry Association New Zealand chief executive Tim Cossar said opening up conservation land to mining interests could put New Zealand 's $ 20 billion tourism industry at risk .
Green Party conservation spokeswoman Metiria Turei called on communities to defend local sites from " pillage " .
Sites at risk included the Coromandel , Paparoa National Park , Kahurangi National Park , Aspiring National Park , Waituna Lagoon and the Awarua Wetlands .
" These are some of the most beautiful places in our country , " she said .
" To allow mining in them is beyond an outrage we need to protect them for our children and future generations . "
Groser said the standard consultation provisions of the Resource Management Act would apply .
However , his office later confirmed DOC controlled only access to mining sites , while the Minister of Energy and Resources granted permits to prospect , explore or mine .
Environment and Conservation Organisations spokesman Barry Weeber said miners enjoyed special status and were not subject to the usual provisions that applied to other activities on conservation land .
The only real safeguards were the prohibitions on surface activity under the fourth schedule of the Crown Minerals Act , which did not prevent mining in conservation parks , marine mammal sanctuaries , or in world heritage areas .

She strongly believes in the Internet 's power to educate , inform and entertain and also to unite people all around the world .
The pact led to the carving - up of Poland and eastern Europe Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has condemned the Nazi-Soviet pact signed a week before Germany 's 1939 invasion of Poland as " immoral " .
In a piece for the Polish paper Gazeta Wyborcza , he also expressed sorrow over the massacre of Polish army officers by Soviet forces at Katyn in 1940 .
His words are seen as a bid to ease tensions with Poland over World War II .
But he also argued the Munich agreement signed by France and Britain wrecked efforts to build an anti-Nazi alliance .
A year earlier France and England signed a well - known agreement with Hitler in Munich , destroying all hope for the creation of a joint front for the fight against fascism
Vladimir Putin
Russian prime minister Mr Putin is among several statesmen attending a service in the Polish port city of Gdansk on Tuesday to mark the 70th anniversary of Poland 's invasion .
" Our duty is to remove the burden of distrust and prejudice left from the past in Polish - Russian relations , " said Mr Putin in the article , which was also published on the Russian government website .
" Our duty ... is to turn the page and start to write a new one . "
Katyn regret Memories of the 1939 pact - in which the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany essentially agreed to carve up Poland and the Baltic States between them - have long soured Moscow 's relations with Poland and other east European states .
Pact that set the scene for war Viewpoint : The Nazi-Soviet Pact Media build up to World War II Within a month of the pact being signed , Soviet troops had invaded and occupied parts of eastern Poland .
" It is possible to condemn - and with good reason - the Molotov - Ribbentrop pact concluded in August 1939 , " wrote Mr Putin , referring to the two foreign ministers who signed the pact at the Kremlin .
It was clear today , he said , that any form of agreement with the Nazi regime was " unacceptable from the moral point of view and had no chance of being realised " .
" But after all , " he added , " a year earlier France and England signed a well - known agreement with Hitler in Munich , destroying all hope for the creation of a joint front for the fight against fascism . "
The Munich Agreement of September 1938 , widely seen as the low point of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 's policy of appeasement , allowed Germany to annex Czechoslovakia 's Sudetenland region .
Mr Putin added that Russian people understood " all too well the acute emotions of Poles in connection with Katyn " .
In 1940 Soviet secret police massacred more than 21,000 army officers and intellectuals on Stalin 's direct orders in the Katyn forest near the city of Smolensk .
Moscow only took responsibility for the killings in 1990 , having previously blamed the massacre on the Nazis .

Mark : Wonder why coffee 's so addictive ?
Probably a government plot ... we 're still talking to conspiratologist Page Griffin about American gullibility ...
Man :
It 's quite remarkable , Mark ...
Americans believe in many things that can't be verified .
For instance , almost half of us believe in ghosts and 40 % in alien abductions .
And that availability to alternative reality is reflected in conspiracy theory .
From truthism , which holds Bush was behind 9/11 , to birthism .
And , of course , we still have many legacy fringe groups like the JFK grassy knollers , the staged moon landingists , etc. Mark : Professor , is there any counter to these powerful theorists ?
Man :
Not really , Mark .
Only the reasonists .
Mark : Reasonists ?
Man :
They believe in an evidence - based world , something called rationalism .
But it 's a tiny group , not so influential .
ALBUQUERQUE , N.M. - David
Young started out working for the city in fleet maintenance .
He ended up prowling Albuquerque 's streets , arresting prostitutes and their clients for the police department 's Special Investigations Division .
At no time , however , was Young a sworn police officer .
A civilian employee of the department for 10 years , he worked as a volunteer reserve officer when he made his arrests .
Under New Mexico law , arresting officers handle misdemeanor prosecutions in metropolitan court .
Young appeared as the prosecuting agent in several cases .
Since news of Young 's role surfaced in late August , the criminal justice system here has been thrown in turmoil .
One prostitution case that he handled was dismissed before it went to trial , and defense attorneys are preparing to appeal nearly a dozen more .
The police department has suspended its reserve program and identified 46 other criminal cases that reserve officers handled , ranging from traffic tickets to domestic violence .
Those other cases may also be challenged in court .
" It 's pretty wild , " said Mary Han , a civil rights attorney the public defender 's office tapped to handle the cases involving Young .
" If you or I were to go out and impersonate a police officer , we 'd go to jail .
...
It 's a real perversion of the legal system . "
Police officials say Young was acting with the blessing of the department -- and always with sworn officers close by .
" This will end up being an attorney discussion and a ruling by attorneys , " said police spokesman John Walsh , who described the issues involved as " technicalities . "
The key question :
What makes someone a cop ?
Young , who has not been accused of wrongdoing , has retained an attorney who said that , like all of the department 's 63 reserves , Young spent time at the local police academy -- more than 700 hours -- learning investigative procedure and other staples of law enforcement .
The attorney , John D'Amato , added that , like full - time police officers , Young goes to the firing range every month to remain qualified to carry a firearm .
D'Amato called his client , who is employed by the department to help police set up electronic surveillance equipment , " more trained and certified in more areas than most police officers are . "
He joined the reserves six years ago .
New Mexico law repeatedly identifies police officers as " salaried " law enforcement personnel .
But Albuquerque police cite one provision that allows a chief to deputize any individual as his agent , saying the law could permit someone such as Young to legally act as a fully sworn officer .
Although state law does not allow reserve officers to make arrests in traffic stops , they are allowed to make other arrests .
But since 2007 , it has been required that reserve officers be accompanied at all times by a sworn police officer .
Back then a top Albuquerque police official warned reserves in the vice unit that they should not be acting alone .
Young arrested 24 people after that warning , although police say he was under supervision .
The Albuquerque Journal , which broke the story , reported that Young was paid overtime during the arrests .
Walsh said the payments might have been for his civilian - side job setting up surveillance .
Police say they tapped
Young to work undercover because the vice unit needs a supply of fresh faces to catch prostitutes and their clients .
All undercover operations are by their nature tightly supervised , Walsh said .
On his police reports , however , Young lists only himself as the arresting officer and does not list an assisting officer .
In many reports and complaints he filed with the court , Young also identifies himself as a police officer or detective .
In a handful , he lists himself as a reserve officer .
He is also listed as the contact for defendants who wish to delay their court appearance .
Han said Young negotiated plea deals in court and occasionally warned defendants about the sentences they could face if they did not admit to their crimes .
Han also noted that in several of Young 's arrests , there is no record of the alleged prostitute asking for money for sex , the probable cause that would be required to prosecute the case .
In the case that was dismissed in August , for example , Young wrote that he drove up to a 45 - year - old woman standing at a " high - prostitution area . "
She asked him if he was a cop and challenged him to touch her breast to prove he was not .
According to court records , Young did touch her .
She then asked him to expose himself .
" I did not expose myself and she did not say anything anymore , " Young wrote .
" She was then taken into custody without incident . "
Young 's activity has become an issue in mayoral race .
In October incumbent Mayor Martin Chavez faces two challengers who are hammering him on public safety .
" It is a taxpayer nightmare , " said Tim McGiven , spokesman for challenger Richard Romero , referring to the city 's liability from lawsuits by those Young arrested .
" We can't just say it 's going to be solved in the courts .
There 's got to be accountability in the force . "
But the mayor 's office has been dismissive of such complaints , saying the case is overblown .
Scoffing at the challenges to Young 's arrests in court , top aide Pete Dinelli told the Journal : " The public defender has conveniently overlooked the fact that these people have been convicted of these charges . "
Police have said they expect to reinstate the reserve program shortly and D'Amato , Young 's attorney , contended the whole case is colored by politics .
" It 's a very dramatic step , " D'Amato said of the suspension of the reserve program , " but it 's a very dramatic time of the year .
Had this happened in the spring of 2010 or the winter of 2010 it would not have been an issue . "

It is in no way appropriate for the words " believe in " to precede the words " evolution " or " global warming . "
I bring up this issue a lot ... to myself .
I do n't have that many friends with whom I have in - depth political discussions .
That 's probably for the best .
I was watching " Frontline " last night on PBS and getting the scoop on the failed attempts of the past three administrations to make the necessary significant changes in environmental policy we need to slow down global climate change .
Obviously some administrations have been less effective than others in this arena .
Ahem .
But I was struck by the frequently - shown video footage of Senator James Inhofe standing on the Senate floor and calling global warming the " greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people . "
While I 'd seen that particular footage before , I had n't ever been quite so disgusted by it .
Not only is it a lie , but it raises the question ?
Why would scientists convene to pull one over on the American people ?
Why woulddo that ?
Why would anyonethat ?
Well , obviously , politics has a lot to do with the " why , " but it also raises the same issues of " belief " that I see consistently with evolution .
People claim to either " believe " or " not believe " in evolution or global warming , the same way people people " believe " or " not believe " in creationism or ... whatever not believing in global warming would be .
If you look up the word " belief " on dictionary.com , you 'll find it means , 1 ) something believed ; an opinion or conviction ; 2 ) confidence in the truth or existence of something not immediately susceptible to rigorous proof ; 3 ) confidence ; faith ; trust ; and 4 ) a religious tenet or tenets ; religious creed or faith .
NONE of these definitions is applicable to science .
You can " accept " or " not accept " what is regarded asby people who are experts in the area , but by saying you " believe , " you are indicating that the issue is one that is not settled , one that requires faith of some sort , one that has no more factual significance than the opposing view .
Evolution is fact .
It is observable in nature and has been proven with an extensive amount of fossil and DNA analysis .
So , you can say to me , " I do n't accept what the scientific community overwhelmingly considers to be fact regarding the process of evolution , " buttell me , " I don' tin evolution , " because I will be left with no choice but to kick your ass .
Likewise , Senator Inhofe can claim he does n' tthat global warming is real , but he would be wrong .
Not just in his assessment , but also his word choice , although he was quite clever when it came to what he actually said .
I do n't think the Senator probably spent all that much time speaking to scientists about the facts regarding climate change or else he likely would n't have made such an embarrassingly inaccurate statement .
But by attaching to word " hoax " to global warming , hethe issue one of " belief . "
You can " believe " or " not believe " a hoax and that takes away some of the pressure to " accept " or " not accept " global warming .
By the way , " accept " it .
And all that was just to say that you should be careful about what you " believe " or " not believe " coming out of a politician 's mouth , especially regarding science .
Unless that politician is Al Gore , because that dude 's got his shit together .
OTTAWA – A military watchdog agency has subpoenaed senior federal officials and is seeking a court order to force the Conservative government to release withheld information concerning the controversial transfer of suspected Taliban fighters into Afghan custody .
The Military Police Complaints Commission is trying to get around what it considers roadblocks to its investigation of allegations that first surfaced in 2007 accusing the Canadian military of handing over prisoners knowing they would probably be tortured .
Sylvain Roy , chief of staff to the commission chair , said the application to the Federal Court involves redacted documents already released to the inquiry .
Investigators believe the records have been overly censored , he said .
" We were not obtaining the documents required to fulfil our mandate , which is to have an open and transparent investigation , " Roy said in an interview .
" That 's why we exercised our powers under the National Defence Act . "
Subpoenas have been served on four former commanders of Canadian troops in Kandahar , the deputy minister and four employees of foreign affairs , and the chief of the Correctional Service of Canada , he said .
Roy would not divulge which of the subpoenas are aimed at uncovering documents and which are intended to summon the officials as witnesses in the commission 's planned public hearings .
He would only say the commission is relying on " co-operation of the parties . "
Federal lawyers have challenged the commission 's authority to hold hearings into the 2007 complaint by Amnesty International and the B.C. Civil Liberties Association , both of which have already fought a pitched legal battle with Ottawa and lost .
The organizations had argued the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom applied to actions of Canadian soldiers oversees , but the court ruled such issues were better governed by international law .
In its attempt to derail the commission inquiry , the federal government has argued that the handling of prisoners is " not subject " to oversight by the military police complaints process , and that the National Defence Act only gives the agency the power to investigate complaints against military police .
A separate Federal Court hearing to clarify the commission 's jurisdiction is set for Oct. 5 and is expected to last about six weeks .
The lawyer for the human rights groups said he suspects federal officials are waiting for the outcome of the jurisdictional challenge before deciding whether to co-operate with the commission .
" Unless and until the Federal Court quashes those hearings , you will see those individuals appearing in the hearing , " said Paul Champ .
Allegations that the Canadian government 's safeguards , meant to protect transferred prisoners from abuse and torture , were inadequate first surfaced in the spring of 2007 .
It 's considered a war crime to transfer a prisoner between countries knowing that they likely face torture .
Officials are trying to avoid scrutiny , said Champ .
" They have refused to disclose documents , they 've refused to provide access to witnesses .
They 've refused to co-operate in general .

" They 've taken the military police complaints commission to court , they 've sued our clients , all with the objective of quashing these hearings , " he said .
The independent military police complaints commission was created in the wake of the Somalia affair , when elite Canadian soldiers tortured and murdered a captured teenager .
The upper echelons of the Canadian military were subsequently faulted for a coverup and command failures .
The perception of anime in Japan .
( It 's not as popular as you might think ) ( 11/13/00 ) silvermask wrote :
Yes , I 'd assume the reason for this is because anime is naturally common in Japan .
In the US it 's something different , something maybe a little rare , so people can see it as a targeted interest .
If you were in Japan and said " I 'm a big fan of anime " people would probably not notice , just as if a Japanese person said " I'm a fan of American sitcoms " because it would be such a wide genre that most everyone would find something that they like .
Both people would probably end up getting a respose like " oh ... that 's nice .... which ones ? " etc .
Actually , I think Vanye 's point was a bit different from your reading of it .
He was saying that , unless you 're a kid , anime is not naturally common in Japan , though it 's probably more common there than American animation is here in the United States .
While manga is ubiquitous , anime is still considered for kids and younger teens by most Japanese people , and if an adult in his twenties said to other adults " I 'm a big fan of anime " I think people would look at that person funny , supposing he might even be an " otaku " ( used here in the stereotypical negative sense , as opposed to the idealistic positive sense ) .
Publicly expressing one 's like of anime in Japan is less like a Japanese adult in America saying " I'm a fan of American sitcoms " and more like him / her saying " I 'm a big fan of Tom and Jerry " .
In Japan , saying that you liked a few anime shows when you were younger is not so conspicuous .
Saying that you enjoyed the latest Ghibli feature is okay , too -- roughly equivalent to saying you enjoyed watching the latest Disney animated film .
Saying that you just bought the deluxe DVD boxset of Lain will possibly earn you a reputation as being obsessed and possibly antisocial .
-_-
It 's a little discouraging to hear that as an anime fan , I know .
From what I understand , anime fans in Japan are still in an uphill battle .
The situation is getting better though .
For example , Toshio Okada , the founder of Gainax , now teaches a course on otaku culture at Tokyo University ( Japan 's number one school ) , helping to bring some mainstream credibility to both anime and its fans , and hoping to encourage a positive definition of the word " otaku " ( as it applies to fans ) to combat the rampant negative stereotyping .
Our fan activities outside of Japan are helping the cause , too , in that the Japanese government now has to admit that anime is one of Japan 's most important cultural exports .
According to a 10/6/2000 article from http://www.animaxis.com:
The content of the Japanese government 's Educational White Paper for the year 2000 was recently made public .
Within the White Paper 's featured cultural themes , animation and Manga have been ranked as varieties of " Art " and given high praise .
This is because the Ministry of Education have now recognized the fact that anime and manga are among the most important forms of artistic expression in the modern Japanese cultural environment .
Especially in the case of anime , the White Paper remarks that : " they are highly recognized and popular abroad , and many anime created in Japan have spread in renown overseas . "
In addition , anime is particularly commended as " Japanese animations are a unique form of expression and display a minute attention - to - detail , due to the craftsmen - like talents of the animators . "
Modern anime has been around for about 40 years now , so this recognition has been long overdue , but I think we can agree it's a step in the right direction .
And it 's great to know that our acceptance of anime outside of Japan is positively influencing the perception of anime in Japan .
In a funny anecdote , Toshio Okada reportedly convinced important people in Japan to watch Ghost in the Shell by telling them it's " so popular in the United States " which is ironic because marketing in the United States tends to mention how critically acclaimed it is in Japan .

A court in Australia has ruled that a quadriplegic man who wants to die can tell his carers to stop feeding him .
The judge in the western city of Perth said the nursing home would not be held criminally responsible .
In a statement , Christian Rossiter said he could not perform any basic human functions and wanted to die .
The ruling sets a legal precedent in Australia , where assisting someone to take their own life can be punishable by life in prison .
Western Australia 's highest judge , Wayne Martin , said the Brightwater Care Group would not be criminally responsible if it stopped feeding and hydrating Mr Rossiter .
Judge Martin said Mr Rossiter was not terminally ill or dying and was capable of making an informed decision about his treatment .
' Living hell '
" I am unable to blow my nose , " Mr Rossiter said .
" I am unable to wipe the tears from my eyes , " said the former stockbroker and outdoor adventurer .
He made a public plea last week to be allowed to end his life which he described as a " living hell " .
" I have no fear of death - just pain .
I only fear pain , " he said .

As you should know , HTC has sunk a huge amount of time ( and money , we assume ) into giving Android a major makeover .
If you 're familiar with the company 's work on Windows Mobile devices , then the look and feel of the new HTC - ified Google OS should make perfect sense to you .
Sense is a good word , actually , since the company calls its new UI the " Sense Experience , " which is really another way of distancing itself from TouchFLO iterations of the past ( though there is clearly a lineage here ) .
Essentially , almost every aspect of Android has been reskinned and tweaked on the Hero .
From the windowshade notification area to the dialer , HTC has left its mark across the device -- and it's a pretty handsome mark .
The general design is much more on par with contemporaries such as the Pre , iPhone , and recent versions of the BlackBerry OS .
You probably know what that means : lots of alpha layers , dark , shiny blacks and grays , and the occasional brightly colored highlight hue .
It 's all extremely slick -- if you did n't know Android well , you might assume it 's a completely different OS ... and maybe that 's what HTC is hoping .
We obviously like the reworked graphics , but it 's annoying to see how the fresh paint job bogs the phone down in places .
In particular , the calendar app which is fairly nimble on standard builds of Android seems sluggish here , and we noticed the same kind of jittery behavior in other apps which function just fine on our Dreams and Magics .
Two other changes of note are somewhat major in the Hero build of Android .
Firstly , as has been widely reported , the phone can access Exchange accounts -- a feature not found on any Google - branded devices ( though present in the Rogers variations of HTC 's other phones ) .
Secondly , the device has an underlying social networking tie - in ( a la webOS ) which can pull in Facebook , Twitter , and Flickr data in various spots on the phone , and also allows you to move media and messages between the services .
What is notable is the fact that the underlying guts here are really no different from Android 1.5 , save for some HTC - specific tweaks such as the company 's onscreen keyboard ( more on that in a moment ) , aforementioned dialer , and other nips and tucks , largely cosmetic .
For instance , instead of providing a tab to pull up your applications , HTC provides a button reminiscent of the Pre 's home icon ( which incidentally does the same thing ) .
Still , there are quite a few functionality tweaks onboard as well , including the addition of multitouch in the Hero 's photo app and standard ( but heavily skinned ) Android browser .
Sorry Google Maps fans -- no love on that front .
Google 's touch keyboard has been completely dashed here in favor of HTC 's iteration , and that 's a good thing ... to an extent .
The keyboard is certainly usable -- even good sometimes -- but it 's hardly a competitor to Apple 's onscreen QWERTY , and not even in the same universe as a physical keyboard .
We know a lot of readers have been on the edge of their seat about whether the Hero 's lack of keys would be a detracting factor , and despite a tremendous attempt by HTC here , it certainly is ( of course we feel similarly about the Magic ) .
We found ourselves regularly frustrated by the speed of typing ( which can sometimes hang painfully , a la iPhone OS 2.0 ) , and some of the auto - correction , which is typically good , but can be maddening when incorrect .
Keep in mind , we really , wanted to like this keyboard , but the more time we spent with it , the more frustrated we became by it .
Trying to tap out an address in Google Maps while walking somewhere , for instance , was a truly unpleasant experience .
On the other hand , HTC has made marked improvements in the phone functionality on the Hero , making the dialer and contact management pages a joy to use .
Getting to number quickly is a cinch since you 're able to use the numeric keypad to call up both strings of numbers and names , and the company has forgone tabbed entries on contacts for a combined recent / missed page coupled with your contact list .
HTC has also improved the music player here ( a badly needed upgrade ) , though like so many other applications on the phone , it feels sluggish when compared to its rivals ' experiences .
We had the same feeling when using the browser -- another spot where the software falls victim to the phone 's underpowered hardware -- the web experience on the Hero was typically slow and frustrating .
Overall , the changes the company has made with Android do make the OS feel more complete and modern , but it seems to be at the expense of performance .
We could almost feel the 528MHz processor struggling to keep us as we paged through seven homescreens of widgets -- most accessing data in the background -- and when we took at a look at the task list , it was clear that most of our memory was being sucked up with scores of little processes .
It seems like HTC has made a software suite for their next generation of phones , but tacked it onto its current one , and the combo is a bit messy at times .
We wo n't knock them for aiming high , but we do n't know how much we enjoy the lag and stutter of the current Hero build .
HTC has loaded the phone with a slew of new applications and widgets -- and the company has made a lot of the right choices .
We 've also felt that one of the really untapped resources Android had was its widget implementation , so it 's really nice to see that HTC has taken up the mantle here .
Unfortunately , these are n't standard Android widgets , so as far as we know , you 're only going to be seeing them on HTC phones .
Of course there are the standard clock and weather widgets ( both beautiful , mind you ) , though the company has provided a number of other options that really do improve the day - to - day use of the phone .
We 're not going to run through every single one , but we do want to mention the notable additions .
To start with , HTC has gone to the trouble of creating it's own Twitter client , Peep .
The application lives in two places on the phone ; the first is a variable sized widget for your homescreen which allows basic functionality like reading recent tweets and updating your status .
The second iteration is a full - on app which offers robust options along the lines of Tweetie for the iPhone .
While the application is excellent at what it does , there is some disconnect between the widget and the program itself .
Like other parts of the OS , Peep seems to be hampered by the slower CPU and limited RAM as well -- scrolling can sometimes be stuttery , and it often takes some doing to refresh its content .
Another notable widget / application combo is Footprints .
The premise is simple : it allows you to quickly snap a photo and geotag your location , then gives you options for sorting the content as favorites , restaurants , shopping , etc .
It 's actually a pretty clever little idea , and for those who travel or are planning a trip , along with that 5 megapixel camera , it 's a nice addition to the phone .
Interestingly , our favorite widgets are actually simple toggles -- switches which allow you to flip services like WiFi , mobile networks , Bluetooth , and Airplane Mode on and off without jumping into your settings screen .
During testing , we found ourselves putting these small , icon-sized micro apps into heavy rotation .
It 's a thoughtful inclusion which shows HTC is actually paying attention to how users operate their phones .
So Flash is kind of a big deal on new smartphones .
The iPhone does n't have it , the Pre does n't have it , BlackBerry devices do n't have it ... but the Hero does .
Unfortunately , in our testing , we found the inclusion actually hurts operation of the phone more than it helps .
When browsing to a site heavy on Flash ( there are many ) , the browser loading times were abysmal .
Furthermore , trying to view videos in - window produced choppy , nearly unwatchable results .
You may have a better experience with lighter kinds of content , but in our opinion the main reason to introduce Flash into a mobile environment is to allow for broader media viewing options , and in the current state of this Flash player , you 're not really going to get much mileage out of it .
The Hero represents a valiant effort from HTC -- though unfortunately , the company appears to have bitten off more than its last - generation hardware can chew .
If this build of Android were to be loaded atop the guts of a 3GS or Pre , the performance would likely be astounding , but fused with the two - year old architecture of previous devices , it 's mostly disappointing .
We 're not saying this is n't the best build of Android on the market -- we think it is .
What wesaying is that this build is a bit too much for a device like the Hero to handle , and that makes for an uneven , sometimes frustrating experience .
Going into the review , we desperately wanted to love this phone , but given the combination of a few poor hardware choices and an OS which outclasses the device it runs on , we can only recommend that you enter at your own risk .
HTC has an explosive entry in the smartphone category with what its done on the software side ... now it just needs the hardware to match .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
More than half of the 9.5 million people who need AIDS drugs cannot get them and 33 million people across the world are still infected with the virus that causes it , a United Nations report said on Wednesday .

Access to drugs , counseling and testing for AIDS has increased , but there were still 2.7 million new infections in 2007 and the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) that causes AIDS remains a major challenge for global health , it said .
Teguest Guerma , an AIDS director at the Geneva - based World Health Organization , noted some progress -- particularly in access to HIV testing and counseling , and getting HIV drugs to pregnant women and those in low - and middle - income countries .
But she said an internationally agreed goal of achieving universal access to treatment by 2010 was unlikely to be hit and required more concentrated effort .
“ We ’re moving toward universal access , but we ’re not there yet , ” she said in a telephone interview .
“ We need to sustain the effort and commitment we have now to move forward . ”
Since the AIDS pandemic started in the early 1980s , more than 25 million people have died from the virus .
There is no cure , but a cocktail of drugs known as highly active antiretroviral therapy can help keep it under control .
According to the UNAIDS report , groups at high risk of infection , including men who have sex with men , sex workers , drug users and prisoners , still have limited access to HIV testing and counseling services .
As a result , only 40 percent of all people estimated to have AIDS are aware that they are infected .
VACCINE PROSPECTS
The report praised an “ unprecedented expansion ” of drug treatment in low - and middle - income countries , where more than 4 million people were receiving drugs by the end of 2008 , up from around 3 million a year earlier .
The greatest gains were seen in sub-Saharan Africa , where around two - thirds of HIV infections occur .
Around 2.9 million people there received treatment in 2008 , compared with about 2.1 million in 2007 .
Pregnant women , who can transmit the AIDS virus to their children , also had better access to tests and drugs .
UNAIDS said 21 percent of pregnant women in low - and middle - income countries had an HIV test in 2008 , up from 15 percent in 2007 , and 45 percent of pregnant women with HIV got medicines .
Companies and non-profit groups , along with governments , have been working to make a vaccine against the virus that causes AIDS , and experts agree a vaccine is the only way to conquer it .
Trial results last week showed that for the first time , an experimental AIDS vaccine protected people from the virus -- but it only lowered the infection rate by 30 percent .
“ We need to continue the research because there is hope for the discovery of a vaccine , ” Guerma said .
“ But for the time being , a vaccine with a modest efficacy cannot be used by itself . ”

When pets who roam do n’t come home

WITH our impressive array of technologies , like GPS and “ smart ” phones , you might think that finding a lost pet is getting easier each year .
Sadly , the odds are still against many missing pets ever making it back home .
Is n’t there some way to ensure that your pet will return safely from his wandering ?
Everyone loves the amazing stories of dogs and cats that travel long distances to find their way back home or even locate their owners in a new city .
Unfortunately , these happy tales are the rare exception to the rule .
For every pet that makes it back after leaving , there are tens of thousands who never live to see home again .
Humane groups and pet industry experts estimate that more than 5 million pets will be lost this year .
One pet in every three will be lost at some point in his or her lifetime .
Of those that roam away from home , less than 17 percent of the dogs and only 2 percent of the cats ever make it back to their owners , according to the American Humane Association .
Sadly , most of the rest will be euthanized in overcrowded animal shelters .
Newspapers and online ads still tell the sad story of some youngster ’s lost pet every day .
Why do we see a continuation of this problem year after year ?
First , despite leash laws and other ordinances , many families are reluctant to chain their dogs or attempt to keep their cats from roaming .
This is especially true in rural
areas .
Compounding the issue is that there are more than 200 million pets in North America and only a very small percentage have some form of permanent identification .
ID tags and collars are easily removed by unscrupulous individuals or even by the pet in some instances .
Microchips help to ensure that the pet has some means of identification , but even these implants are n’t foolproof .
In fact , it is a rare pet that actually has a microchip .
According to industry data , only about 5 percent of all pets in North America have microchips .
And even the pets with chips are n’t necessarily any safer .
When owners fail to register their pet properly , reunions are delayed or even prevented in many instances .
Again , experts from all major microchip companies state that less than 50 percent of chipped pets are registered with correct and current information .
Other forms of identification , such as tattooing , are very rare and obscure .
This fact means that a shelter employee or veterinary office may not even note the presence of a tattoo .
Finally , even though they have good intentions , shelters and rescues are often overwhelmed with pets .
A microchip could be missed during a hurried exam , or a description of your lost pet might not match what the employee sees in front of him .
Despite these overwhelming odds , you can proactively help ensure that your pet will make it safely home .
First , like so many things , prevention and preparation go a long way .
Neuter your pet to decrease his roaming urges and consider using both ID tags and a microchip .
We all want our family members to stay close to home and to heart .
But , like all children , our pets love exploration and adventure , too .
Work with your veterinarian to make sure all your pets are properly identified with tags and / or microchips .

As we gloomily maintain the deathbed vigil for a Government whose end cannot come soon enough , it is the opposite end of the life - cycle that fixates US politics .
Fittingly enough , on the eve of the nine - month anniversary of Barack Obama 's election , America obsesses about the President 's birth , and specifically his birthplace .
The gestation period for any conspiracy theory is far longer than that for human infants , of course , or even elephants .
It tends , in fact , to be endless .
It is 45 years since JFK was murdered , 40 since the first moon walk , and almost eight since the Twin Towers fell , and while the various notions ( second gunman , studio mock - up , Mossad plot ) were conceived almost immediately after those events , they have yet to deliver anything more substantial than lovingly nurtured insanity .
That rag - tag coalition of shock jocks , publicity hungry attorneys , the credulous and simple - minded , plain nutters and above all frustrated racists collectively known as " the birthers " have spent a year banging on about Mr Obama 's arrival in this world , and their successors will be banging on about it long after he 's left it for the next .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
With the hissing wrath of those struggling ferociously to repress the volcanic pressure to screech " uppity nigger " at their head of state , these people conveniently conclude that Obama is n't their head of state at all .
The second article of the US Constitution dictates that " no person except a natural born citizen " can be president , and the birthers argue that since Mr Obama was born in Mombasa , Kenya , he is disqualified .
One army officer , a Major Stefan Cook , refuses to serve in Afghanistan on the grounds that , since Obama is n't rightfully his commander - in - chief , the order to deploy is illegal .
As for his lawyer , if you thought Esther Rantzen cuts an unconventional figure on the national political stage , here 's a bottle blonde to make the old turnip - botherer look like Geoffrey Howe .
Her sobriquet is Queen Bee of Birferstan , and the on - screen mini-biog accompanying a recent appearance on CNN briefly imbued that sober channel with Springeresque exoticism .
" Dr Orly Taitz , " it ran .
" CA Attorney .
Dentist .
Real estate broker . "
As the sublime Jon Stewart pointed out , if you 're contemplating a scam whereby a lawyer wins you enough in damages for botched root canal work to buy the home of your dreams , here 's your gal .
Were it just Orly , whose legal qualification was earned over the internet , and a smattering of fellow narcissist - fantasists , the whole thing might be dismissed as touching idiocy .
After all , if people wish to think that the August 1961 certificate of live birth is a forgery despite verification from Hawaiian officials , the state 's Republican Governor and independent body factcheck.org ; if they want to believe that birth announcements were planted in local Honolulu papers solely to prepare the ground for the day he could illegally enter the US and start his Islamist sleeper march on the White House ; if they choose to trust a carefully edited interview with his Kenyan step - grandmother , cut off before she repeatedly confirms that he was born in Hawaii ... well , that 's their absolute right .
Many of us solemnly believe objective absurdities .
I believe that Tottenham Hotspur is one of the world 's great football clubs , for instance , while a late relative was unswervingly convinced , as recently as 1989 , that Hitler was working as a porter at a block of service flats in St John 's Wood .
Which of us is without a meshugas ?
What is more intriguing about the birther " movement " – even than Orly 's professional range – is the light it casts on the necrotic state of the American right .
Concerns that the Grand Old Party would respond to Obama 's near landslide by aping the post -1997 Tories , and adhering to the Tebbitian doctrine that the only mistake was in not being nasty and insular enough , prove naïve .
The Republicans now make the Tories at their dog- whistling absolute worst seem achingly inclusive .
Who leads them at the minute is a mystery .
Some think it 's Sarah Palin , others the deliriously repugnant Rush Limbaugh , who inevitably joins the other oracles of US radio and TV in keeping the birther debate bubbling .
What leadership there is , so it seems to this ignorant observer across the ocean , comes from the grass roots ... the sort of God fearin ' , gun-totin ' , sister - shaggin ' sweethearts who screeched " terrorist " and " kill him " when John McCain mentioned Obama on the stump .
Unable to compute that America elected a black man , they have decided that he is n't their President at all .
No longer can they use the " n " word or fantasise publicly about lynch mobs .
But they can divert their rage into a bogus legalistic dispute , rejected time and again by the Supreme Court , as freely as they like .
And their elected representatives follow them in dumb terror .
A Huffington Post reporter approached a clutch of Republican congressmen on Capitol Hill this week to ask if they think Obama was born on US soil .
Several scurried away , one at a trot , without replying .
Another spent 20 minutes pretending to examine CDs in a shop to avoid the question .
The only one prepared to answer said that Obama was a natural born citizen " so far as I 'm aware " – an echo of Hillary Clinton doing her genteel bit to foster the myth about him being a Muslim sleeper during the primaries by referring to him as a Christian " so far as I know " .
As Obama suggested after the arrest of the esteemed Harvard professor Skip Gates in his own Washington home , his election was not the magical cure - all some hoped .
But then racism is stubbornly resistant to silver bullets .
I was in Sydney on the day of the 400 m women 's Olympic final , and the Australian media was hyperventilating at the prospect of a Kathy Freeman victory healing all the wounds with the Aborigine people .
She duly won her gold , and we left Olympic Park drunk on utopian dreams .
The next day a colleague of Indian birth related how , outside the stadium that night , the first six empty cabs ignored his hails .
The seventh also drove past before reversing .
" Sorry , mate , could n't make you out properly in the rain , " the driver apologised as he beckoned him in .
" I reckoned you was an Abbo . "
These things take time .
How much is anyone 's guess , but America is waking to the realisation that untold millions are n't even close to accepting the democratic will that put a black man in the White House .
The likes of Orly Taitz will parlay the issue into regular slots on Fox & Friends , countless more will kid themselves that their objection is constitutional rather than racial , and a few will be emboldened to hatch plots to uphold their patriotic ideals via an assassin 's gun .
The Prez , meanwhile , is content to deal with such banalities as healthcare reform , and stay silent on the question of his birthplace .
Politically speaking , this is a gift from heaven , exposing the vicious dementia of the Republican right to a degree of riducule that should help sweep him to a second term .
The wider implications will please him less .
But before we get too smug about British tolerance and racial maturity , perhaps it 's worth acknowledging that , where the most senior elected black politician in American history is Barack Obama , ours remains Paul Boateng .
All of us , it would seem , have a little way to go .

Most of us might have noticed that our sites may look different in different screen resolutions .
Though I have already posted one article on making website layout cross browser compatible , but its also necessary to make your site compatible for different screen resolutions .
The visitors of your site will not have same screen resolution your are using .
So it ’s mandatory to make your site compatible for different screen resolutions .
For example ,
In lower screen resolutions like 800×600 px the website layout will be perfect .
But when you look at your site at a higher screen resolution like 1024×768 px or even higher , the website header or sidebar may be aligned to either right or left .
It ’s all because the designer might have designed the site for a particular screen resolution .
In the screen resolution he was working , the site may look perfect .
But when it comes to higher screen resolution , the theme may be misaligned .
what is the best screen resolution settings ?
One ca n’t design a website for a particular screen resolution , because visitors will have different screen resolutions .
According to me , the best screen resolution on which the designer should be concentrating on should be higher than 1024 px .
For example if you take techieblogger ’s last month stats , most of my visitors are using higher screen resolution .
Some of the web designers use JavaScript to control the screen resolution compatibility .
But it will reduce the site loading time .
Instead of using JavaScript , I will explain how to make your site higher screen resolution compatible by making changes in CSS codes .
CSS controlling the alignment of the layout
Before explaining the original hack , first let me describe about the css code which controls the layout alignment .
margin : auto ;
The simple margin tag in CSS controls the alignment of the site layout in different screen resolutions .
I have selected auto to change the layout alignment in accordance with the visitors screen resolution .
Screen resolution compatible CSS – Blogger users
In order to make changes to your CSS code in blogger blogs , follow the below steps .
step 1 : First go to Layout section of your blog .
step2 : Then navigate to EDIT HTML page
Now add the margin : auto ; tag in the css codes of the following sections .
Header
Outer wrapper
content wrapper
wrapper
Footer
If one more sections are missing in your style sheet , then insert that code in the respective div sections used in your blogger template .
Screen resolution compatible CSS – WordPress Users
To edit the css code in your wordpress blogs , follow the below steps .
first go to appearance option in your wordpress dashboard .
Then go to EDITOR page .
In that page , add the css code margin : auto ; in the following css sections .
Header
Outer wrapper
content wrapper
wrapper
single entry
Footer
how to change screen resolution
For checking your site compatibility with different screen resolutions do any one of the below steps .
how to get a higher screen resolution on windows vista /XP
To change the screen resolution of your PC , do the following steps .
Right click on your desktop , then click the option “ Properties ” there .
A new window will open .
Now navigate to “ settings ” tab .
There you can see a slider to change the screen resolution .
With that slider you can either increase or decrease .
After you chose a particular screen resolution , click apply .
It will give you a warning message click “ ok ” .
Now open the browser and visit your site for compatibility .
how to set screen resolution using keyboard hotkey
You can also check the compatibility of your site with different screen resolutions with simple keyboard short keys .
First go to your blog and do the following :
To reduce the screen resolution , press “ ctrl ” and scroll down the mouse roller .
Or
press ” ctrl ” button and press “ - ” button .
To increase the screen resolution , click “ ctrl ” and “ + ” button or else press ” ctrl ” and scroll up the mouse roller .
With the above keyboards hotkeys , you can check the screen resolution compatibility of your site .
Hope this article will be useful for all web designers who want to create wordpress themes or blogger templates which are higher screen resolution compatible .
If you have any problem with your website layout alignment , then please email me about the issue .
Another instalment of Ask OSNews .
A reader sent us in a question about browser security and privacy .
“ Could you please advise me and your readers on what you consider to be the safest web browser ?
I am considering the term ‘ safe ’ from both a privacy and security stand point . ”
The question further details the importance of this matter .
“ I spend more time on my browser than any other piece of software on any given day .
Primarily because I use it at both at university for research and for entertainment ( i.e. reading articles here ) , ” the question reads , “ The trend these days seems to indicate the browser is becoming more and more of a target rather than the OS . ”
I ’d say that there are two parts to this question .
Not only is it important to take into account the browser itself , but also the platform it ’s running on .
It ’s better to have both a browser and a platform with a proven security track record than to just have a browser with a proven track record in security .
Browser - wise , you are most likely best off with either Firefox or Chromium ( not Google Chrome , but Chromium ) .
I specifically mention these two because you also care a great deal about privacy .
Since Chromium and Firefox are open source , you can be reasonably sure there ’s no weirdness going on inside the code that you have to worry about .
While browsers like Opera and Safari also have a good security track record , their closed - source nature means you ca n’t check the code for privacy - invading weirdness .
I ’m not saying Opera or Safari contain such weirdness – just that you can never be sure .
This extends to the platform aspect of the equation .
There are several hardened Linux distributions out there , which are completely locked - down from a security standpoint .
However , even desktop - oriented distributions like Ubuntu provide you with a safe , secure , and Free / free operating system .
Similarly , while Mac OS X and Windows are / can be secure too , the closed - source nature of these platforms means you cannot check for any privacy - invading stuff in there ( no matter how unlikely it may be ) .
What do our readers have to say about this one ?
August 5 , 2009 — goodtravel
If you ’re reading this post , most likely email plays a major role in your life .
Between work and your friends , you get at least 100 emails a day ( or more , like me ) .
Whenever you ’re on the computer , you leave your email up and get alerted whenever a new message comes in .
That chiming noise that you hear every five minutes starts to fade into the background and is n’t really even an alert anymore …it ’s just standard !
It ’s ok to admit that email dominates you .
Afterall , admiting you have a problem is the first step . 😉
It is important to recognize that your email inbox can be an effective tool yet can also be detrimental to productivity if you do n’t use it right .
I would like to share my evolved process of email management that has taught me some major lessons in not only organization but task management , as well .
Lesson 1 : Do n’t keep your to - do emails in your inbox !
“ I need to take care of this .
I ’ll leave this in my inbox as a reminder to do that later . ” - Joe Schmoe .
Do you ever handle your emails this way ?
For the longest time , my “ Inbox ” = “ Inbox ” + “ To - Dos ” .
I learned very quickly that this causes major problems with clutter and disorganization .
I used to keep my inbox full of random emails that I ’ve looked at but “ will get to later ” .
However , over time you get more and more emails that pile up on top of each other .
One minute you get an email from a co-worker , the next minute you ’re getting an email newsletter to check out the latest sales at your favorite shopping online store .
Email after email , you still try to remember that you have to get back to that email from earlier that day .
Sure , you may be good at checking your inbox frequently , then two days pass … and then a week , and the email inbox is now at 900 emails full–and you never got back to your nagging co-worker that emailed you a week ago ( which is probably the reason why they ’re nagging you ) !
I ’ve heard too many times people say “ I finally got my inbox down to under 100 emails ! ” .
So I ask , is that 100 to - do’s ?
Or is that 15 to - do ’s buried within 85 cluttered emails around it ?
They all BLEND in together and it ’s hard to find those tasks .
Also , which is more important today vs. tomorrow ?
How would you tell with 100 emails anyway ?
Why waste your time sorting through such a mess ?
Do n’t keep your email to - dos in your inbox !
Lesson 2 : Flagging your emails can help , but the clutter still gets in the way !
Outlook , Thunderbird , Gmail , and most all email clients web or client - based give you the opportunity to “ Flag , “ Tag ” or “ Star ” an email .
Some email clients allow you to create custom priorities and categories .
Does that help ?
Let ’s say you have have 100 emails in your inbox and 15 are tagged as to - do’s .
Sure no problem , it ’s only 15 emails to look for .
But what if you have 500 emails in your inbox ?
Now you have to scroll down a long list or many pages of 500 + emails to find those “ tagged ” emails to locate the ones you are looking for .
Then , after completing the task , you have to remember to UNtag it .
Frequently , I would forget to do this and then the 15 out of 500 tagged items would eventually turn into 50 out 500 starred items .
Now , you REALLY do n’t have a clear idea as to what is a to - do out of this cluttered inbox .
Lesson 3 : Organizing your emails into folders will help … but that does n’t solve all of the problems !
So , I decided “ Ok , it ’s time to get organized .
I ’m going to create folders to save all these emails ” .
I created folders by topic or category and then stored those emails that I just want to “ save ” in them .
This kept less emails in the inbox by moving those stored emails into those designated folders .
I still had a problem .
Sure , I moved over the ‘ saved ’ messages , but my to - do emails were still mixed in with emails ‘ coming in ’ .
So this quickly lead me into another method I tried that worked pretty well .
I created a folder structure like this :
* Work To-Do
* Personal To-Do
* Saved
This is keeping it simple with only three folders .
All my to - dos were put into a To - Do folder , depending on work or personal .
Then all saved messages went into the Saved folder .
The Saved folder could have sub -folders if necessary .
The point was to keep ALL EMAILS out of the inbox .
So at any given time , the inbox should be completely empty .
This means , once I received an email , I took action or immediately moved that into the “ Saved ” folder or to one of the To - Do folders .
Sure , that worked great .
Everything was organized , the inbox is always empty unless a new email came in .
No clutter !
However , when times get busy , I would forget to actually LOOK into that Work To- Do email folder and then all of the sudden , 2 days had passed and I still never completed that task .
In addition , I started thinking , “ why even have a “ Saved ” folder ” ?
If you use Gmail , everything is archived anyway and it has such a great search feature built in ( and most other email clients ) that I should n’t need to use “ Saved ” folders .
My current method was keeping me from being as responsive as I had hoped .
Lesson 4 : Email MUST have an action item on a To - Do List !
If not , archive or delete it .
So the system worked for a while , but needed some tweaking for those times when things got busy and I would forget to check that to - do folder .
I adjusted my workflow to make sure that EVERY email I got that required an action was moved into a to - do list !
This seriously means each one of them .
Why ?
Because you can then ORGANIZE and PRIORITIZE your tasks , which mailbox folders do not give you the capacity to do .
Your mailbox of to - dos should only be references for email threads and conversations .
They should not dictate your to - do list .
This is important since many emails include multiple tasks .
If an action could not be created from it , then I archived or deleted it .
End of story .
I found that I would probably only go back to see about 5 % of the emails that I really saved .
The others were just sitting in the Saved folder as a waste of space .
My friend Chinie Diaz ( @chiniehdiaz ) , posted this article the other day :
Why Your Email Inbox Is NOT a Good To - do List [ Zen Habits ]
This article was great because it pointed out the technical reasons as to why your email account should not and cannot function as your To - Do list .
To sum it up , here are the 5 reasons she lists :
1 . You ca n’t change the subject lines .
2 . There might be multiple actions in each email .
3 . You ca n’t re-order the emails ( usually ) .
4 . You ca n’t prioritize your to - dos .
5 . An email inbox contains distractions .
Lesson 5 : Find a Task Management
Tool that works for you
So what Tasks or To - do list tools should you use ?
Well , that could be a whole other topic on its own but for the sake of this blog ( and your eyes because this one in particular is a tad bit long ) I ’m discussing only a few .
What I use currently is Remember the Milk .
I think it ’s fantastic because you can do a lot to manage your to - dos .
You have the ability to create different categories for tasks and tag your tasks to make it searchable and organized .
You can save notes , too which I typically use to copy and paste email threads or URLs into .
One unique option is that you can share tasks with other users on Remember the Milk .
I have convinced some of my co-workers to use it at work .
My wife also signed up to start using it so that we can share our house to - do ’s ( but maybe that was a mistake on my part ) !
My favorite feature is the ability to forward your emails to an address which will automatically create tasks .
This is great if you ’re away from your computer or do n’t have time at the moment to add the new task to your list .
There are other Task Management tools out there .
I have heard of Things for Mac being pretty good and there are a bunch of tools based off of GTD ( Getting Things Done ) , as well .
A simple tool that just came out is Google Tasks , which can integrate with your Google Calendar and Gmail .
If not that , then use PLAIN PAPER !
Sometimes I retreat to the old - fashioned paper and pencil to keep it simple .
Conclusion :
Remember , every email should have some action to it .
Read your email , put the task on your to - do list , then put it in your to - do folder .
If you do n’t choose to keep them in your to - do folder , archive or delete it !
This system of email management ( that has taken me SO LONG to formulate ) has worked very well for me .
However , I am always open to new ideas to improve the way I do things .
Do you have any struggles with email management and productivity ?
Have you tried any of these methods on your own ?
Do you have any advice or methods that you would like to share ?
I ’d love to hear your feedback !

Constructive gem : juggling exponentials
Andrej Bauer
Constructive gems are usually not about particular results , because all constructive results can be proved classically as well , but rather about the method and the way of thinking .
I demonstrate a constructive proof which can be reused in three different settings ( set theory , topology , computability ) because constructive mathematics has many different interpretations .
Let me first introduce some notation :
$ 1 = {0} $ is the singleton set , or the unit .
$ 2 = 1 + 1 = { 0,1} $ is the booleans .
In general , $ [ n ] = {0 , 1 , \ldots , n - 1} $ is the $ n$ - fold coproduct of singletons .
For brevity we will write $ n$ instead of $ [ n ] $ .
In general $ A + B $ is the disjoint sum of $ A$ and $ B $ .
The product $ A \times B$ is the cartesian product of $ A$ and $ B $ .
The exponential $ B^A$ , also written as $ A \to B$ , is the set of functions from $ A$ to $ B $ .
I should warn you that $ 2 $ is not in general isomorphic to the set of truth values $ \ Omega$ , and consequently $ 2 ^A $ is not generally isomorphic to $ \ Omega ^A = P ( A ) $ , the powerset of $ A$ .
Rather , the elements of $ 2 ^ A $ are the characteristic functions of decidable subsets of $ A $ .
Now suppose someone asks you to show that $ 3 ^ \mathbb {N} $ and $ 5 ^\mathbb {N} $ are isomorphic .
If you are classically trained you might say : “ They are isomorphic because they both have the cardinality of continuum . ”
That ’s a quick and dirty proof .
But then you are asked to show that $ 3 ^ \mathbb {N} $ and $ 5 ^ \mathbb {N} $ are isomorphic as topological spaces , and you have to think again .
You could construct an actual homeomorphism , although any self - respecting topologist will notice that both spaces are “ compact , countably based , 0 - dimensional Hausdorff spaces without isolated points , therefore homeomorphic to the Cantor space by a well - known theorem ” .
That ’s the kind of answer I would expect from my topology friends .
And when you are done with that , you will be asked to show that $ 3 ^ \mathbb {N} $ are $ 5 ^\mathbb {N} $ are computably isomorphic , so you will have to think again .
Can we not have a single proof which works in all three cases ?
To find such a proof , you should forget heavy weapons from set theory and topology , and just look at the sets involved .
How they are constructed will tell you what tools to use in your proof .
The spaces $ 3^\mathbb {N} $ and $ 5 ^\mathbb {N} $ are exponentials , so we should use $ lambda$ - calculus !
Recall the exponential laws , where I write equality in place of isomorphism ,
$ ( A \times B ) ^C = A^C \times B^C $ and
$ ( A^B ) ^C = A^{B \times C}$ .
The isomorphism $ i : ( A \times B ) ^C \to A^C \times B^C $ and its inverse $ j$ may be written down explicitly , for example in Haskell :
i :: ( c -> ( a , b ) ) -> ( c -> a , c -> b ) i f = ( fst . f , snd . f ) j :: ( c -> a , c -> b ) -> ( c -> ( a , b ) ) j ( g , h ) c = ( g c , h c )
I will leave the pair of isomorphisms for the other exponential law as an exercise .
There are other isomorphisms which are good to know about ( where again we write equality instead of isomorphism ) :
$ A^0 = 1 $ , $ 1 ^A = 1 $ , and $ A^1 = A$ ,
$ A^ {B+ C} = A^B \times A^C $ ,
$ ( A+B ) \times C = A \times C + B \times C$ ,
$ \mathbb {N} = 1 + \ mathbb{N} = 2 \times \ mathbb{N} = \mathbb{N} \times \ mathbb{N} = \ mathbb{N} + \ mathbb{N}$ .
You should write down Haskell functions which witness these .
The laws are easy to remember and use because they look like the usual laws of arithmetic .
In fact , there is a deep and fascinating connection between the laws of bicartesian closed categories and arithmetic .
Here is how we can compute with exponentials :
$ 5^\mathbb {N} = 5 ^ { 1 + \ mathbb{N}} = 5^1 \times 5^\mathbb{N} = 5 \times 5 ^\mathbb{N} = 4 \times 5^\mathbb{N} + 1 \times 5^\mathbb{N} = 4 \times 5^\mathbb{N} + 5 ^\mathbb{N} $ ,
therefore
$ 5^\mathbb {N} = 4 \times 5 ^\mathbb{N} + 5 ^\mathbb{N} =4 \times 5^\mathbb{N} + 5^{1 + \ mathbb{N}} = 4 \times 5^\mathbb{N} + 5 \times 5 ^\mathbb{N} = 9 \times 5 ^\mathbb{N} $
and now
$ 5^\mathbb {N} = 5 ^{\mathbb {N} \times \mathbb{N}} = ( 5^\mathbb{N} ) ^\mathbb{N} = ( 9 \times 5 ^\mathbb{N}) ^\mathbb{N} = 9^\mathbb{N} \times 5^{\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}} = 9^\mathbb{N} \times 5^\mathbb{N} = 45^\mathbb{N}$ .
This is fun , but how is it helping us to show that $ 3 ^ \mathbb {N} = 5^\mathbb{N}$ ?
Well , if we could also show that $ 3 ^ \mathbb {N} = 45 ^ \mathbb{N} $ we would be done .
Indeed ,
$ 3^\mathbb {N} = 3 \times 3 ^\mathbb{N} = 2 \times 3^\mathbb{N} + 3 ^\mathbb{N} = 2 \times 3^\mathbb{N} + 3 \times 3^\mathbb{N} = 5 \times 3 ^ \mathbb{N} = 5 \times ( 3 \times 3^\mathbb{N} ) = 15 \times 3^\mathbb{N} $ ,
and now we finish off the proof :
$ 3^\mathbb{N} = ( 3^\mathbb{N} ) ^\mathbb{N} = ( 15 \times 3^\mathbb{N}) ^\mathbb{N} = 15 ^\mathbb{N} \times 3^{\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}} = 15 ^\mathbb{N} \times 3^\mathbb{N} = 45^\mathbb{N}$ .
Because we only used the basic exponential laws which are witnessed by constructive functions ( Haskell programs , if you wish ) they hold constructively .
This immediately tells us that :
the sets $ 3^\mathbb {N} $ and $ 5^\mathbb {N} $ are in bijective correspondence because constructive mathematics is consistent with classical set theory ,
the topological spaces $ 3^\mathbb {N} $ and $ 5 ^ \mathbb {N} $ are homeomorphic because constructive mathematics is consistent with the assumption that all maps ( hence also the isomorphisms involved ) are continuous ,
the isomorphism between $ 3^\mathbb {N} $ and $ 5^\mathbb {N} $ are computable simply because they can be written down in Haskell ( or any other decent programming language ) .
I must admit to a little bit of cheating .
I chose $ 3 ^\mathbb {N} $ and $ 5 ^\mathbb {N} $ because they can both be manipulated to $ 45 ^ \mathbb {N}$ .
If you try to show $ 2 ^ \mathbb {N} = 3 ^\mathbb {N} $ you will be probably get stuck ; if not , show me how !
Let us think about the general question of how to show that $ m^\mathbb {N} = n^\mathbb {
N} $ for $n , m \geq 2 . $
We certainly expect this to hold , but what is the “ best ” proof ?
One idea is to first show that $ m^\mathbb {N} = m^\mathbb{N} + m^\mathbb{N}$ , from which it quickly follows that $ m^\mathbb {N} = n \times m^\mathbb {N} $ and $ m^\mathbb {N} = ( n \times m) ^\mathbb{N}$ .
But what is the slickest way to get $ m^\mathbb {N} = m^\mathbb{N} + m^\mathbb{N}$ ?
For which $ m $ and $ n$ does my trick work ?
Observe that
$ m^\mathbb {N} = ( m - 1 ) \times m^\mathbb {N} + m^\mathbb{N} = ( m - 1 ) \times m^\mathbb{N} + m \times m^\mathbb{N} = ( 2 m – 1 ) \times m^\mathbb{N} =$
$= ( 2 m – 2 ) \times m^\mathbb{N} + m \times m^\mathbb{N} = ( 3 m – 2 ) \times m^\mathbb {N} $
and by applying this procedure $ k$ times we get
$ m^\mathbb {N} = ( k m – k + 1 ) \times m^\mathbb {N} $
from which it follows that
$ m^\mathbb{N} = ( m^\mathbb{N} ) ^\mathbb{N} = ( ( k m – k + 1 ) \times m^\mathbb{N}) ^\mathbb{N} =$
$= ( k m – k + 1 ) ^\mathbb{N} \times m^{\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}} = ( m ( k m – k + 1 ) ) ^\mathbb{N} . $
My trick can therefore show that $ m^\mathbb {N} = n^\mathbb {N} $ provided there are $ k$ and $ j$ such that
$ m ( k m – k + 1 ) = n ( j n – j + 1 ) $ .
This is a linear Diophantine equation in $ k$ and $ j $ :
$ m ( m – 1 ) k – n ( n – 1 ) j = n – m$ .
It has a solution if , and only if , the greatest common divisor of $m ( m – 1 ) $ and $n ( n – 1 ) $ divides $n – m$ .
It is easy to find pairs $ ( m , n ) $ for which there is no solution , e.g. , $ ( m=2,n=3 ) $ , $ ( m=3,n=7 ) $ , $ ( m=4,n=9 ) $ , etc .
Perhaps someone can come up with a different trick that always works .
Remember , you are only supposed to use the general laws that hold in bicartesian closed categories , for details see the paper “ Remarks on Isomorphisms in Typed Lambda Calculi with Empty and Sum Types ” by Marcelo Fiore , Roberto Di Cosmo , and Vincent Balat .
A belief in link between Saddam Hussein and 9/11 is a case in point ; false beliefs stirred by current health care debate may be another
BUFFALO , N.Y . --
In a study published in the most recent issue of the journal Sociological Inquiry , sociologists from four major research institutions focus on one of the most curious aspects of the 2004 presidential election : the strength and resilience of the belief among many Americans that Saddam Hussein was linked to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 .
Although this belief influenced the 2004 election , they claim it did not result from pro-Bush propaganda , but from an urgent need by many Americans to seek justification for a war already in progress .
The findings may illuminate reasons why some people form false beliefs about the pros and cons of health - care reform or regarding President Obama 's citizenship , for example .
The study , " There Must Be a Reason : Osama , Saddam and Inferred Justification " calls such unsubstantiated beliefs " a serious challenge to democratic theory and practice " and considers how and why it was maintained by so many voters for so long in the absence of supporting evidence .
Co-author Steven Hoffman , Ph.D. , visiting assistant professor of sociology at the University at Buffalo , says , " Our data shows substantial support for a cognitive theory known as ' motivated reasoning , ' which suggests that rather than search rationally for information that either confirms or disconfirms a particular belief , people actually seek out information that confirms what they already believe .
" In fact , " he says , " for the most part people completely ignore contrary information .
" The study demonstrates voters ' ability to develop elaborate rationalizations based on faulty information , " he explains .
While numerous scholars have blamed a campaign of false information and innuendo from the Bush administration , this study argues that the primary cause of misperception in the 9/11 - Saddam Hussein case was not the presence or absence of accurate data but a respondent 's desire to believe in particular kinds of information .
" The argument here is that people get deeply attached to their beliefs , " Hoffman says .
" We form emotional attachments that get wrapped up in our personal identity and sense of morality , irrespective of the facts of the matter .
The problem is that this notion of ' motivated reasoning ' has only been supported with experimental results in artificial settings .
We decided it was time to see if it held up when you talk to actual voters in their homes , workplaces , restaurants , offices and other deliberative settings . "
The survey and interview - based study was conducted by Hoffman , Monica Prasad , Ph.D. , assistant professor of sociology at Northwestern University ; Northwestern graduate students Kieren Bezila and Kate Kindleberger ; Andrew Perrin , Ph.D. , associate professor of sociology , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill ; and UNC graduate students Kim Manturuk , Andrew R. Payton and Ashleigh Smith Powers ( now an assistant professor of political science and psychology at Millsaps College ) .
The study addresses what it refers to as a " serious challenge to democratic theory and practice that results when citizens with incorrect information cannot form appropriate preferences or evaluate the preferences of others . "
One of the most curious " false beliefs " of the 2004 presidential election , they say , was a strong and resilient belief among many Americans that Saddam Hussein was linked to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Hoffman says that over the course of the 2004 presidential campaign , several polls showed that majorities of respondents believed that Saddam Hussein was either partly or largely responsible for the 9/11 attacks , a percentage that declined very slowly , dipping below 50 percent only in late 2003 .
" This misperception that Hussein was responsible for the Twin Tower terrorist attacks was very persistent , despite all the evidence suggesting that no link existed , " Hoffman says .
The study team employed a technique called " challenge interviews " on a sample of voters who reported believing in a link between Saddam and 9/11 .
The researchers presented the available evidence of the link , along with the evidence that there was no link , and then pushed respondents to justify their opinion on the matter .
For all but one respondent , the overwhelming evidence that there was no link left no impact on their arguments in support of the link .
One unexpected pattern that emerged from the different justifications that subjects offered for continuing to believe in the validity of the link was that it helped citizens make sense of the Bush Administration 's decision to go to war against Iraq .
" We refer to this as ' inferred justification , ' " says Hoffman " because for these voters , the sheer fact that we were engaged in war led to a post - hoc search for a justification for that war .
" People were basically making up justifications for the fact that we were at war , " he says .
" One of the things that is really interesting about this , from both the perspective of voting patterns but also for democratic theory more generally , Hoffman says , " is that we did not find that people were being duped by a campaign of innuendo so much as they were actively constructing links and justifications that did not exist .
" They wanted to believe in the link , " he says , " because it helped them make sense of a current reality .
So voters ' ability to develop elaborate rationalizations based on faulty information , whether we think that is good or bad for democratic practice , does at least demonstrate an impressive form of creativity . "

Correction :
An earlier version of this story erroneously referred to John Walker Lindh as a " convicted terrorist " .
The terrorism charge against Lindh was dropped as part of an agreement under which he pleaded guilty to one count of supplying services to the Taliban , and one count of carrying weapons while fighting against the U.S. - backed Northern Alliance .
He was sentenced to 20 years in prison .
Michael Finton , shown on his MySpace page , is also known as Talim Islan , authorities say .
-- A would - be terrorist was arrested in Springfield , Illinois , for allegedly attempting to detonate a truck bomb to blow up a federal building and kill its occupants , officials said Thursday .
Authorities were waiting Wednesday for Michael Finton , also known as Talib Islam , who unwittingly had been dealing with undercover FBI agents continually monitoring his activities .
Justice Department officials said Finton , 29 , of Decatur , Illinois , drove a vehicle he believed contained a ton of explosives to the Paul Findley Federal Building and Courthouse in Springfield .
He got out of the truck , got into a waiting car with an undercover agent , and then , when he was a few blocks away , attempted to detonate the bomb with a remote - control device .
" When he pushed the button , nothing happened except he got handcuffs slapped on him , " said one Justice Department official familiar with the case .

The truck contained inactive explosives .
Authorities said Finton idolized John Walker Lindh -- an American who was captured fighting for the Taliban in Afghanistan -- and said he wanted to go to a training camp abroad to become a jihadist fighter .
Finton made an initial appearance in court in Springfield on Thursday to face charges of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted murder of federal employees , according to Acting U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Lang .
" This alleged plot drives home the stark reality that we must avoid complacency and remain ever vigilant to threats that violent extremists may pose to public safety , " Lang said .
The affidavit provided in court said Finton had received funds from an individual in Saudi Arabia , which he used for a month - long trip to that country in April and May of 2008 .
The sting operation became active in February 2009 .
Two weeks ago , Finton met with an undercover agent and was told the vehicle he would drive would carry about a ton of explosives .
Finton said civilian casualties resulting from the bombing would be justified , according to the affidavit .
Authorities stressed the plot was in no way related to the terrorist plot unfolding in New York and Denver .

One caveat — I 'm not going to BS you with dreams of open - source and digital textbooks , despite how nice they sound in theory .
I do n't know what uni you go to , but at mine , that 's not realistic .
My professors use AOL .

Every university has a stockpile of free books : the library .
Depending on how irresponsible you are , you might never otherwise enter the library , but this should be your first stop during textbook season .
It is the crux of this whole concept .
Find it
First , you have to find your book at the library , which requires a surprising amount of creativity .
At the basic level , novels and famous works are easy .
When you get into very specific textbooks , it gets harder .
The first thing you should try are the intercollegiate book sharing networks ; they put hundreds of libraries in your range for free .
Libraries frequently get textbooks as part of a donation , and they 're not going to burn them ( unless Follett pays them enough money ) .
Next time you see books that seem obscure , like A Communist Anthology of Native American Poetry or The Children 's Compendium of Short Stories About Pregnancy , know that you can find the material elsewhere .
Selections , collections , and compilations are filled with re-packaged old content — another tactic of evil publishers .
Even books like Freakonomics and The World is Flat are mostly made up of old material .
At the library , you can use online databases or other compilations to piece together your own version of the same book .
You 'll also have to fudge the editions .
The most recent edition of your Conjuring 101 textbook wo n't be at the biblioteca .
Publishers make miniscule changes in a book so that they can release a new edition each year and make more money .
But that means that normally you can get through 92nd edition classes with a 2nd edition text , since the changes are often subtle : page numbers are shifted , chapters are switched , etc .
The best way to wade through an old edition is by looking through the table of contents and finding the old version of the new topic you 're supposed to read on .
Advertisement
If it all fails , hit up the research / reference desk where your school probably employs a lackey whose sole responsibility is to find material for you .
Keep it
Now that you 've found the text you need , you 've gotta keep it for 3 months — and late fees are n't an option .
The most reliable tactic is to rotate different copies of the same book .
When your textbook is coming up for its last renewal , order another copy of the same book from a different library .
You can keep alternating between two or more copies for as long as you need .
Depending on your library 's policies , you might have to order a different edition .
Registering another account at the local non-university library also frees up some rule - bending .
Advertisement
Or put that copying machine to work at your work - study job .
Gamble
I call this " textbook gambling " — that is , with this method you 're not even going to try to find a book until the moment you need it .
A lot of the time you 'll find your professor has added at least a book or two to your syllabus that you never once crack open for class .
You 'll get half of your books for free by not buying books you never use .
Advertisement
Sometimes , teachers will cut a book last - second or the university syllabus requires a certain book for College English , but your teacher does n't use it .
Sometimes , the teachers ' lectures cover all of the reading material and there 's no need to read at all .
These variables can eliminate a lot of your books — so if you 've got the guts for it , skip buying books in advance .
It 's a little tricky ; at any time , the teacher might deploy a surprise reading assignment .
Until you can obtain a permanent copy , ask the TA to make copies of the first few assignments ( tell them you added the class last - second ) .
Advertisement
Between library savvy and a little textbook gambling , you 'll cover 60 - 100 % of your books .
Use the usual tactics to fill in the gaps — i.e. , buy used and borrow as often as you can .

“ You ca n’t make an omelet without cracking a few eggs .
And humanity is just a cracked egg .
And the omelet stinks . ” — Johnny , Naked
Advertisement
The majority of us go through life dodging the essential questions :
Who are we ?
Why are we here ?
Is there a God , and how is His presence ( or lack thereof ) important ?
And what possible significance could our tiny lives — in a tiny fraction of time on a tiny little island in the infinite space of the universe — have in the grand scheme of things ?
Johnny , the bedraggled misanthrope played by David Thewlis in Mike Leigh ’s 1994 masterpiece Naked , ca n’t bring himself to look away .
While others shuffle mindlessly through the London fog , anesthetized by smoking , drinking , fucking , and watching TV , Johnny is a raw nerve , willfully exposing himself to the bleak realities of existence and proselytizing like a street - corner derelict to anyone who will listen — and those who do n’t care to , for that matter .
He ’s poised on the brink of madness — indeed , a couple of his monologues are no more convincing than those of a garden - variety conspiracy theorist — yet he ’s a seeker , too , scurrying to collect every scrap of knowledge he can gather on his way to oblivion .
Emphasis on the word “ scurrying ” :
With his beakish nose and mangy nest of brown hair , Thewlis has the features of an oversized rodent .
It ’s no mistake that Leigh opens the film in a dank Manchester alleyway , or that he later has Johnny cheekily comment that on the streets of London , a rat is always less than 30 feet away .
And like a rodent , Johnny acts as a pestilence to everyone he encounters , spreading misery and heartache , to say nothing of the physical and emotional abuse , and perhaps an STD for good measure .
( “ You do n’t want to fuck me , ” he warns .
“ You ’ll catch something cruel . ” )
Leigh introduces him in the ugliest of circumstances , with a rough tryst against an alley wall that edges into sexual assault , yet it ’s a tribute to the burnished soul of Thewlis ’ performance that Johnny comes away as a more complex , sympathetic creature than events seem to dictate .
Somehow this bullying , ranting , arrogant force of nature transforms before our eyes into an example of humanity at its most fragile and resilient .

After his abbreviated introduction in Manchester , Johnny steals a car and heads off to London , where he lands at the doorstep of an ex-girlfriend named Louise ( Lesley Sharp ) who ’s now logging time in a dead - end office job .
In the meantime , he meets Louise ’s flatmate Sophie ( Katrin Cartlidge ) , a glum sexpot in fishnets whose rock - bottom self - esteem makes her easy pickings for a man of Johnny ’s scruffy charisma .
Not many guys can expect to bed a woman after confronting her with the grimmest of existential scenarios ( “ Have you ever thought that you may have already lived the happiest day of your whole life , and all you have left to look forward to is fuckin ’ sickness and purgatory ? ” ) , but Johnny and Sophie engage in a little rough trade anyway .
How else to while away a dull afternoon ?
The helpless , hapless Sophie follows her self - destructive instincts by falling instantly in love with Johnny , but the tougher , plain - Jane Louise knows him well enough to see through his bullshit .
Theirs is the most complex relationship in the film , tortured by a past that obviously was n’t pretty — when Louise sees Johnny crashing on her couch as if he were an old friend , she ’s clearly stunned by his audacity — and yet suffused with feelings that still run deep .
Leigh is famous for his rigorous technique of working with the actors to create full character histories , and that method pays off in their very first scene together , which instantly suggests their familiarity with each other and a complex set of tensions between them .
In one of his many stunning displays of verbal dexterity , the irascible Johnny slips around Louise ’s question about why he left Manchester :
Advertisement
Johnny has a talent for talking his way into and out of corners — and in this case , avoiding telling the real truth about why he fled to London — but he ’s being honest about his incapacity for boredom , which both animates his fierce intellect and leaves him unprotected and vulnerable .
He ’s impatient with people who have no intellectual curiosity ( i.e. everyone in the film , with one notable exception ) and a complete unwillingness to question the world around them .
Seeing Louise take a normal job in the city like all the other drones drives him crazy , and his frustration manifests itself in ugly ways , as he treats humanity alternately like a cold anthropologist , an abusive misanthrope and sadist , or some combination thereof .
They all become reluctant sounding boards for his philosophical rants , most of which underline the utter pointlessness of existence or speculate about when our brief time on the planet will end .
A few choice bits :
On the human body : “ It ’s the most sophisticated mechanism in the universe , and yet it ’s so fucking quiet , is n’t it ? …
It ’s like this wet , pink factory .
What the fuck are they making in there ?
I mean , what ’s the product ?
You never see any delivery trucks coming and going now , do you ? ”

On evolution : “ If you take the whole of time and represent it by one year , we ’re only in the first few moments of the first of January .
There 's a long way to go .
Only now we ’re not going to spout extra limbs and wings and fins , because evolution itself is evolving .
When it comes , the apocalypse itself will be part of the process of that leap of evolution …
Mankind must cease to exist , at least in material form . ”
On God : “ What if God just put us here for His own entertainment ?
That ’s all we are , just something for him to have a bit of a laugh at . ”

Without playing armchair psychologist too much , it ’s possible to hear a lot of the famously cantankerous Leigh channeled through Thewlis ’ performance .
Beginning with his debut feature , the aptly titled Bleak Moments , Leigh has balanced empathy and warmth toward his characters with a strong jolt of class resentment aimed at Thatcherian social policy .
Johnny is a raw , enormously powerful expression of Leigh ’s darker side — just as the philosophically settled Poppy in last year ’s Happy Go Lucky represents the opposite — and it makes Naked a potent critique of a society that pushes the undesirables to the margins .
Johnny is n’t the only soul edging close to oblivion ;
Naked is filled with characters who are dangerously unsettled , like Sophie , who hangs onto her spot in the flat only because the owner is off on safari , or the many drifters who scavenge the streets of London at night , huddling in doorways to keep from the cold .
Johnny ’s astounding intellect might make him special , but in the end , it does n’t make his situation any easier , or extend him opportunities for upward mobility .
( Not that he ’d accept such opportunities anyway , given his contempt for the professional class . )
The centerpiece of Naked is a bravura sequence that introduces Johnny to Brian ( Peter Wight ) , a sweet - natured night watchman who kindly brings Johnny in from the cold and gets an earful from him in the bargain .
Brian ’s job is n’t to guard people or property , it 's to watch over the empty space within an office building , a task Johnny recognizes as the epitome of pointless tedium .
( “ Someone could break in here and steal all the fuckin ’ space and you would n’t know it ’s gone , would you ? ” )
But Johnny knows a good philosophical space when he sees one , and he finds a perfect audience in Brian , who ’s introspective in his own way , mainly because he needs something to occupy his mind during the long , lonely hours in the building .
( His use of a special wand to mark where he ’s been — and prove that he exists at all , really — is the film ’s bluntest piece of symbolism . )
Brian likes to ponder his future , which will take him away from a job that Johnny says a “ tall chimpanzee ” could be trained to do , but that gets Johnny going on what the future really means and whether it ’s even worth speculating about at all :
Advertisement
As a counterpoint ( or mirror image ) to Johnny , Leigh offers Jeremy ( Greg Cruttwell ) , a Patrick Bateman type who uses his wealth and privilege as a license for abuse , power games , and gross impropriety .
Leigh means to hold up Jeremy as an example of how the rich are excused for behavior that would not be abided from the great unwashed ; when Jeremy assaults Sophie , she knows well enough not to alert the police to the matter .
But to my mind , Jeremy plays into the hands of Leigh ’s harshest critics , who accuse him of inflating his characters into grotesque , life - sized editorial cartoons .
Leigh cannot bring himself to extend a sliver of empathy to Jeremy , with his turtlenecks and expensive coif and mirthless giggle and casual , unmotivated nastiness .
He exists for a narrow symbolic purpose , and it would be a shock to discover that Leigh worked as thoroughly with Cruttwell on devising the character 's backstory as he did with his other actors .
But in Johnny , Leigh and Thewlis have created one of the most electrifying , memorable characters in recent ( or even distant ) memory , a street - corner philosopher who ’s simultaneously a scruffy underdog and a rabid narcissist .
There are times when Johnny ’s intellectual queries and monologues cut sharply into the most basic matters of existence , and others , like an end - of - days rant he directs at the night watchman , that are an assemblage of conspiratorial hooey .
At all times , he ’s a man trying to make sense of the world — though as with any great mind , his ideas , even the bad ones , tend to calcify into unyielding “ truth ” — but Naked treats him with just the right mix of ambivalence and hard - won sympathy .
The closing shot of a beaten but defiant Johnny , limping out onto the street like a wounded animal , is a powerful , life - affirming testament to human resilience .
Maybe there ’s hope for the species after all .

August 27 : The Lovers On The Bridge
September 3 : Slacker
Arguments about the rights and wrongs of economic arrangements often lead us back to fundamental philosophical questions of what people morally deserve and why .
The public furore over the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009 is a case in point .
For years , stock prices and property values had climbed .
The reckoning came when the housing bubble burst .
Wall Street banks and financial institutions had made billions of dollars on complex investments backed by mortgages whose value now plunged .
Once - proud Wall Street firms teetered on the edge of collapse .
The stock market tanked , devastating not only big investors but also ordinary Americans , whose retirement accounts lost much of their value .
The total wealth of American families fell by $ 11trn in 2008 , an amount equal to the combined annual output of Germany , Japan and the UK .
In October 2008 , President George W Bush asked Congress for $ 700 bn to bail out the nation 's big banks and financial firms .
It did n't seem fair that Wall Street had enjoyed huge profits during the good times and was now asking taxpayers to foot the bill when things had gone bad .
But there seemed no alternative .
The banks and financial firms had grown so vast and so entwined with every aspect of the economy that their collapse might bring down the entire financial system .
They were " too big to fail " .
No one claimed that the banks and investment houses deserved the money .
Their reckless bets ( enabled by inadequate government regulation ) had created the crisis .
But here was a case where the welfare of the economy as a whole seemed to outweigh considerations of fairness .
Congress reluctantly appropriated the bailout funds .
Then came the bonuses .
Shortly after the bailout money began to flow , news accounts revealed that some of the companies now on the public dole were awarding millions of dollars in bonuses to their executives .
The most egregious case involved the American International Group ( AIG ) , an insurance giant brought to ruin by the risky investments of its financial products unit .
Despite having been rescued with massive infusions of government funds ( totalling more than $ 180bn ) , the company paid $ 165 m in bonuses to executives in the very division that had precipitated the crisis .
Seventy - three employees received bonuses of $ 1 m or more .
News of the bonuses set off a firestorm of public protest .
The outrage was about lavish rewards subsidised with taxpayer funds to members of the division that had helped bring the global financial system to near - meltdown .
Something was wrong with this picture .
Although the US government now owned 80 per cent of the company , the treasury secretary pleaded in vain with AIG 's government - appointed chief executive to rescind the bonuses .
" We cannot attract and retain the best and the brightest talent , " the CEO replied , " if employees believe their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the US treasury . "
He claimed the employees ' talents were needed to unload the toxic assets for the benefit of the taxpayers , who , after all , owned most of the company .
The public reacted with fury .
A full - page headline in the tabloid New York Post captured the sentiments of many : " Not so fast , you greedy bastards " .
The US House of Representatives sought to claw back the payments by approving a bill that would impose a 90 per cent tax on bonuses paid to employees of companies that received substantial bailout funds .
Under pressure from the New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo , 15 of the top 20 AIG bonus recipients agreed to return the payments , and some $ 50 m was recouped in all .
This gesture assuaged public anger to some degree , and support for the punitive tax measure faded in the Senate .
But the episode left the public reluctant to spend more to clean up the mess the financial industry had created .
At the heart of the outrage was a sense of injustice .
Even before the bonus issue erupted , public support for the bailout was hesitant and conflicted .
Americans were torn between the need to prevent a meltdown that would hurt everyone and their belief that funnelling massive sums
to failed banks and investment companies was deeply unfair .
To avoid economic disaster , Congress and the public acceded .
But morally speaking , it had felt all along like a kind of extortion .
Underlying the bailout outrage was a belief about moral desert : the executives receiving the bonuses ( and the companies receiving the bail­outs ) did n't deserve them .
But why did n't they ?
The reason may be less obvious than it seems .
Consider two possible answers - one is about greed , the other about failure .
One source of outrage was that the bonuses seemed to reward greed , as the tabloid headline indelicately suggested .
The public found this morally unpalatable .
Not only the bonuses but the bailout as a whole seemed , perversely , to reward greedy behaviour rather than punish it .
The derivatives traders had landed their company , and the country , in dire financial peril - by making reckless investments in pursuit of ever - greater profits .
Having pocketed the profits when times were good , they saw nothing wrong with million - dollar bonuses even after their investments had come to ruin .
The greed critique was voiced not only by the tabloids , but also ( in more decorous versions ) by public officials .
Senator Sherrod Brown ( Democrat - Ohio ) said that AIG 's behaviour " smacks of greed , arrogance and worse " .
President Obama stated that AIG " finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed " .
The problem with the greed critique is that it does n't distinguish the rewards bestowed by the bailout after the crash from the rewards bestowed by markets when times were flush .
Greed is a vice , a bad attitude , an excessive , single - minded desire for gain .
So it is understandable that people are n't keen to reward it .
But is there any reason to assume that the recipients of bail­out bonuses are any greedier now than they were a few years ago , when they were riding high and reaping even greater rewards ?
Wall Street traders , bankers and hedge - fund managers are a hard - charging lot .
The pursuit of financial gain is what they do for a living .
Whether or not their vocation taints their character , their virtue is unlikely to rise or fall with the stock market .
So if it 's wrong to reward greed with big bailout bonuses , is n't it also wrong to reward it with market largesse ?
The public was outraged when , in 2008 , Wall Street firms ( some on taxpayer - subsidised life support ) handed out $ 16bn in bonuses .
But this figure was less than half the amounts paid out in 2006 ( $ 34bn ) and 2007 ( $ 33 bn ) .
If greed is the reason they do n't deserve the money now , on what basis can it be said they deserved the money then ?
One obvious difference is that bailout bonuses come from the taxpayer while the bonuses paid in good times come from company earnings .
If the outrage is based on the conviction that the bonuses are undeserved , however , the source of the payment is not morally decisive .
But it does provide a clue : the reason the bonuses are coming from the taxpayer is that the companies have failed .
This takes us to the heart of the complaint .
The American public 's real objection to the bonuses - and the bailout - is not that they reward greed but that they reward failure .
Americans are harder on failure than on greed .
In market - driven societies , ambitious people are expected to pursue their interests vigorously , and the line between self - interest and greed often blurs .
But the line between success and failure is etched more sharply .
And the idea that people deserve the rewards that success bestows is central to the American dream .
Notwithstanding his passing reference to greed , President Obama understood that rewarding failure was the deeper source of dissonance and outrage .
In announcing limits on executive pay at companies receiving bailout funds , Obama identified the real source of bailout outrage :
“ This is America .
We do n't disparage wealth .
We do n't begrudge anybody for achieving success .
And we certainly believe that success should be rewarded .
But what gets people upset - and rightfully so - are executives being rewarded for failure , especially when those rewards are subsidised by US taxpayers . "
One of the most bizarre statements about bail­out ethics came from Senator Charles Grassley ( Republican - Iowa ) , a fiscal conservative from the heartland .
At the height of the bonus furore , Grassley said in an Iowa radio interview that what bothered him most was the refusal of the corporate executives to take any blame for their failures .
He would " feel a bit better towards them if they would follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say , ' I 'm sorry , ' and then do either one of two things - resign or go commit suicide " .
Grassley later explained that he was not calling on the executives to commit suicide .
But he did want them to accept responsibility for their failure , to show contrition and to offer a public apology .
" I have n't heard this from CEOs , and it just makes it very difficult for the taxpayers of my district to just keep shovelling money out the door , " he said .
Grassley 's comments support my hunch that the bailout anger was not mainly about greed ; what most offended Americans ' sense of justice was that their tax dollars were being used to reward failure .
If that 's right , it remains to ask whether this view of the bailouts was justified .
Were the CEOs and top executives of the big banks and investment firms really to blame for the financial crisis ?
Many of the executives did n't think so .
Testifying before congressional committees investigating the financial crisis , they insisted they had done all they could with the information available to them .
The former chief executive of Bear Stearns , a Wall Street investment firm that collapsed in 2008 , said he had pondered long and hard whether he could have done anything differently .
He concluded he 'd done all he could .
" I just simply have not been able to come up with anything . . . that would have made a difference to the situation we faced . "
Other CEOs of failed companies agreed , insisting that they were victims " of a financial tsunami " beyond their control .
A similar attitude extended to young traders , who had a hard time understanding the public 's fury about their bonuses .
" There 's no sympathy for us anywhere , " a Wall Street trader told a reporter for Vanity Fair .
" But it 's not as if we were n't working hard . "
The tsunami metaphor became part of bailout vernacular , especially in financial circles .
If the executives are right that the failure of their companies was due to larger economic forces , not their own decisions , this would explain why they did n't express the remorse that Senator Grassley wanted to hear .
But it also raises a far - reaching question about failure , success and justice .
If big , systemic economic forces account for the disastrous loses of 2008 and 2009 , could n't it be argued that they also account for the dazzling gains of earlier years ?
If the weather is to blame for the bad years , how can it be that the talent , wisdom and hard work of bankers , traders and Wall Street executives are responsible for the stupendous returns that occurred when the sun was shining ?
Confronted with public outrage over paying bonuses for failure , the CEOs argued that financial returns are not wholly their own doing , but the product of forces beyond their control .
They may have a point .
But if this is true , there 's good reason to question their claim to outsized compensation when times are good .
Surely the end of the cold war , the globalisation of trade and capital markets , the rise of personal computers and the internet , and a host of other factors help explain the success of the financial industry in the 1990s and in the early years of the 21st century .
In 2007 , CEOs at major US corporations were paid 344 times the pay of the average worker .
On what grounds , if any , do executives deserve to make that much more than their employees ?
Most of them work hard and bring talent to their work .
But consider this : in 1980 , CEOs earned only 42 times what their workers did .
Were executives less talented and hard - working than they are today ?
Or do pay differentials reflect contingencies unrelated to talents and skills ?
Or compare the level of executive compensation in the United States with that in other countries .
CEOs at top US companies earn an average of $ 13.3 m per year ( using 2004 - 2006 data ) , compared to $ 6.6 m for European chief executives and $ 1.5 m for CEOs in Japan .
Are American executives twice as deserving as their European counterparts , and nine times as deserving as Japanese CEOs ?
Or do these differences also reflect factors unrelated to the effort and talent that executives bring to their jobs ?
The bailout outrage that gripped the United States in early 2009 expressed the widely held view that people who wreck the companies they run with risky investments do n't deserve to be rewarded with millions of dollars in bonuses .
But the argument over the bonuses raises questions about who deserves what when times are good .
Do the successful deserve the bounty that markets bestow upon them , or does that bounty depend on factors beyond their control ?
And what are the implications for the mutual obligations of citizens - in good times and hard times ?
Whether the financial crisis will prompt public debate on these broader questions remains to be seen .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Tiny robots the size of a flea could one day be mass - produced , churned out in swarms and programmed for a variety of applications , such as surveillance , micromanufacturing , medicine , cleaning , and more .
In an effort to reach this goal , a recent study has demonstrated the initial tests for fabricating microrobots on a large scale .
The researchers , from institutes in Sweden , Spain , Germany , Italy , and Switzerland , explain that their building approach marks a new paradigm of robot development in microrobotics .
The technique involves integrating an entire robot - with communication , locomotion , energy storage , and electronics - in different modules on a single circuit board .
In the past , the single - chip robot concept has presented significant limitations in design and manufacturing .
However , instead of using solder to mount electrical components on a printed circuit board as in the conventional method , the researchers use conductive adhesive to attach the components to a double - sided flexible printed circuit board using surface mount technology .
The circuit board is then folded to create a three - dimensional robot .
The resulting robots are very small , with their length , width , and height each measuring less than 4 mm .
The robots are powered by a solar cell on top , and move by three vibrating legs .
A fourth vibrating leg is used as a touch sensor .
As the researchers explain , a single microrobot by itself is a physically simple individual .
But many robots communicating with each other using infrared sensors and interacting with their environment can form a group that is capable of establishing swarm intelligence to generate more complex behavior .
The framework for this project , called I - SWARM ( intelligent small - world autonomous robots for micro-manipulation ) is inspired by the behavior of biological insects .
Images of the robots showing their size proportional to various objects .

“ I look upon them more like a manufacturing way for future robots , ” Erik Edqvist of Uppsala University in Sweden told PhysOrg.com .
“ There are cool experiments going on with flying insects , swimming robots and so on .
But it is time for the miniaturized robots to leave the research laboratories and find useful applications .
That is where this work fits in .
It is an attempt ( with a somewhat small budget ) to try to build robots in a mass - fabricated way . ”
As this was the first test of this fabrication technique , the researchers noted that they encountered some fabrication problems .
The single largest problem was to connect the naked integrated circuit to the flexible printed circuit board by the conductive adhesive .
Also , some solar cells did not stick due to weak adhesion .
At this stage in the production process , the robots were folded manually , but the researchers hope to design a tool to enable a faster and more accurate alignment when folding .
Many of these complications could likely be corrected , with the important result being that the microrobots can be assembled using a surface mounting machine , whereas prior robots have usually been manually assembled with a soldering iron .
In the future , the researchers hope to move from building academic prototypes to manufacturing the robot on a commercial basis , which is necessary for overcoming some of the technical issues .
By mass - producing swarms of robots , the loss of some robotic units will be negligible in terms of cost , functionality , and time , yet still achieve a high level of performance .
Currently , the researchers hope to find funding to reach these goals .
“ Right now the robots need a new ASIC [ application - specific integrated circuit ] and some other redesigns to be able to work properly , ” Edqvist said .

This is unbelievably sad since I 'm reading this in Canada .
Your democrats ( i.e. Obama ) are equivalent to our conservatives in Canada .
You have n't even seen anything CLOSE to socialism in the United States .
Your first mistake is watching FOX news .
Everyone outside the United States ( trust me on this ) , knows that FOX news and people like Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly likes to lie .
It 's sad that so many Americans are blinded by the load of junk FOX news feeds you .
A public option for healthcare in the United States will probably be one of the best things that will ever happen to your country and yet so much of the population tries to blow it .
In a sense , what I 'm saying is Americans do NOT deserve a leader as great as Obama .
Look at Bill Clinton - he did wonders for your country .
I am very pleased to report that , through the Facebook group Stop the AVN , I heard that the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission has determined that the Australian Vaccination Network -- a rabidly antivax group that is spreading misinformation and propaganda about vaccines -- falls under the jurisdiction of the Health Care Complaints
Act and a full investigation is warranted .
As you may remember , a complaint was filed against the AVN , claiming they were dispensing medical advice .
Meryl Dorey , the mouthpiece for AVN , denied that , saying they are not a medical group .
This determination by the HCCC contradicts her ... and the HCCC is the actual official agency that can say that .
I 'm glad to see this !
Dorey says a lot of things that do n't come within a glancing blow of reality ( like the AVN is not antivax , when their slogan is " Love them , protect them , never inject them " ) , so I 'm very happy that they will get scrutinized by the HCCC .
This could result in anything from an official censure to having the AVN shut down completely .
That would n't break my heart , though I know that , like a virus , the AVN would mutate slightly and rise again .
I love free speech , but the cost of free speech is never free .
With words comes responsibility , and the AVN needs to be held responsible for what they say .

Just about a month ago , I got together with my friends for the first time in quite a while for a night of Starcraft .
I remember getting that game when it first came out , along with Brood War , and while I was never obsessed with it , I absolutely loved it .
I 'm way more of a futuristic - setting type of person than something that takes place in the past , so it seemed perfect for me .
There was just one problem -- I. Was .
Horrible .
I still am .
I do n't think I 've ever won a single game of Starcraft or Warcraft on my own in my entire life .
The only way I can even come close to winning is when I 'm part of a team of people who have been playing for years , and who specialize in the strategy genre .
It does n't matter what game in the genre it is , I can't seem to win .
Or come even close to winning , for that matter .
In fact , I 've never even finished any of the single - player Starcraft campaigns to this day .
When I was in middle school , one of the teachers in a computer class I had was really laid back , so we 'd play stuff likeandwhenever we had some downtime , and that 's probably where I played those games the most .
All the computers in the room were always networked , so we were always on big teams .
Well , you know how there are those TV shows and movies where the kids in gym class in school are being picked to be on teams , and the non-athletic kids are always picked last ?
That non-athletic kid was me when it came to downtime in that class .
I was always shuffled from team to team because everyone knew how I played , and I honestly can't say I blamed them one bit . wanted to make me stop playing half the time .
No matter what happened , I was always swarmed from all directions by the enemy , seemingly only a minute or two into the game .
I never even had time to build up a defense .
And that 's when I realized what my one true weakness is when it comes to RTS -- I hate the pace .
I 'm not a strategical player ; I 'm all about run-and - gun .
When it comes to stuff likeI 'm always trying to go faster than I should be .
I always concentrate on nothing but offense , and way too little on defense , leaving my entire base wide open and ripe for the picking .
And you know what really sucks ?
Ithat it 's my weakness .
I just never seem to be able to adjust my play style to do what I know needs to be done , so my suckiness is my own fault .
I 'm always relying on my teammates to come and bail me out , but I 'm always worried that they 'll be slaughtered in the process .
I love RTS games , but I think they actually stress me out more than anything .
You know what type of game I 'm even worse at than strategy ?
Tactical .
No , not like Tactical Espionage Action -- I mean grid - based .
Limited movements per turn , straight - up tactical stuff .
I can't play games likeorto save my life .
The kick in the crotch when it comes to that is the fact that I do n't even know why I suck so badly at them , which means it 's really hard to write about it here .
I think part of it is the fact that most tactical games that I 've seen look like they want to have free - roaming or real - time battle systems , but the grid system restricts that free movement .
Now , I realize the grid system is there purposely , and it 's not meant to restrict anything .
It 's just that when I 'm playing , I feel like I 'm purposely being held back not for the sake of gameplay , but just because the game wants to be a bitch .
It feels like a negative thing to me .
I 'm not saying the games that utilize this system are bad by any means -- I just can't adjust and plan to move along the ground in a thoughtful way .
It goes back to that run-and - gun mentality of mine , I suppose .
Another thing that tends to distract me in tactical games , for lack of a better term , is the sheer size of the fights .
Some of the fights in tactical games tend to last a very long time , and I 'm more of a quick - but - many type of guy when it comes to battles .
I can do long battles , but I much prefer a break now and then instead of just one drawn out battle sequence .
I tend to start falling asleep if it 's the same exact thing for such a long period of time .
I can't remember which game this one friend of mine was playing , but one battle seriously took about 45 minutes from beginning to end .
Come to think of it , maybe that 's another thing that makes me suck at RTS games .
I 'll tell you what , though .
There 's one tactical game that I truly do love and that 'sbecause that game does stuff differently than any other tactical game I 've ever played .
It still limits your movement for the turn you 're taking , but everything is absolutely free - roaming and half the game is a third - person shooter .
As you move , you 're being attacked by all the enemies in range in real - time , and once you 're done , you can take cover and manually aim your weapon to attack .
You have much more freedom than any other strategy / tactical game I 've ever come across and half the time it does n't even feel like it 's a part of that genre .
I 'm good at third - person games , and I think that 's what helps me likeso much .
So there you have it .
I suck at RTS and tactical games , I know this fact , and I 'm fine with it .
I do like what I 've played of them , but I think the pace of them is just too slow for me to ever truly get into them , which is a shame since I 'm extremely excited forI 'm sure I 'll still buy it , but I probably wo n't be winning any games , at least not until I have about four years of practice or something .
I 'll start winning games inoncecomes out .
Bernie Ecclestone 's suggestion that Flavio Briatore deserves no more than " a slapped hand " for sanctioning the deliberate crash which put the lives of a driver , his co-drivers and spectators at risk has encouraged the Italian to mount a legal challenge to his de facto lifetime ban from involvement with motorsport , sources close to the disgraced former Renault team principal said last night .
On Monday , Briatore was effectively banned for life by the World Motor Sport Council ( WMSC ) in Paris for his part in the incident which saw Nelson Piquet Jr crash out of last year 's Singapore Grand Prix , enabling team - mate Fernando Alonso to score an entirely unexpected victory .
Ecclestone , the sport 's billionaire commercial rights controller , said he felt sorry for Briatore , and that the punishment was " too harsh " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Pat Symonds , the team 's director of engineering , was banned for five years , but the team itself escaped with a suspended sentence , a punishment which – given McLaren were last year fined $ 100 m for a far less serious offence – many believe to be almost ludicrously lenient .
It also emerged that Briatore may be able to continue as co-owner of Queen 's Park Rangers Football Club due to a legal technicality .
Although Football League rules clearly state the owner , prospective owner or director of a club should not be " subject to a ban from a sports governing body relating to the administration of their sport " , Briatore 's lawyers may claim the wording of the ban imposed by the WMSC refers to preventing any individual or organisation who works with Briatore being involved in any FIA - sanctioned event , and that as such , he himself has not been banned .
Briatore had already indicated he may challenge the legality of the ban on the grounds of disproportionality , although some legal experts believe his case might have been weakened when he declined the invitation to appear before the WMSC to defend himself .
Nothing is straightforward in Formula One , however , and the fact Mohammed Ben Sulayem , the United Arab Emirates ' automobile club president and an FIA vice - president , has told a local newspaper negotiations were " done " before the WMSC meeting , may give Briatore 's lawyers further ammunition .
Speculation continues regarding the identity of the mysterious " Witness X " , the team member the FIA has revealed provided testimony supporting claims by Piquet Jr that the crash was staged with Briatore 's approval .
The position of Alonso is also coming under increasing scrutiny , although the Spaniard 's denials of any knowledge of the affair during his extremely brief appearance before the WMSC were accepted without further question .
Acknowledgement of his lack of involvement clears the way for Alonso to replace Kimi Raikkonen at Ferrari next season .
Renault themselves are likely to confirm Alain Prost will take over as team principal in time for this weekend 's grand prix , also in Singapore .
Nor is FIA president Max Mosley without his critics over his handling of the affair .
The apparent lack of clarity has led to more calls for a complete change of regime at the FIA .
The strong favourite to replace Mosley when he finally stands down next month is former Ferrari team principal Jean Todt , but the Frenchman is very much Mosley 's man .
The campaign of Finnish former rally champion Ari Vatanen is now reporting a number of new pledges of support .
Apologies if I sound a tad woozy , but yesterday I left Planet Earth for some time and apparently enjoyed exploring some other reality while medical professionals did something fancy with my neck .
It was a minor procedure .
Minor by modern standards , that is .
The doctors casually performed the sort of everyday miracle that would 've seen them worshipped as gods or drowned in the village pond if they 'd done it in medieval times .
But then , medieval peasants would run screaming from anything more complex than a turnip .
Show them , say , a Nintendo Wii , and their minds would pop inside their skulls .
Pop , pop , pop and down they fall , stupid green smocks and all .
Anyway , the fact I 'm sitting here typing this proves nothing went wrong .
Nothing was going to go wrong anyway , but that did n't stop me worrying .
All I knew was this : they were going to stick a needle into my neck , right into the spine .
Not too scary by surgical standards : it would only require a local anaesthetic .
But it was precisely that fact which started my brain whirring .
Presumably , I figured , it was essential to remain still during this kind of procedure if you did n't want to wind up quadriplegic .
I was going to remain conscious throughout .
What if , just at the crucial moment they stuck the needle in , I was seized by some awful Tourettes - like urge to suddenly jerk around on the slab , cackling like a madman in a rainstorm , deliberately severing my spinal cord against the cold , hard spike ?
I 'd have to be crazy to do that , obviously .
But once the thought was in there , I could n't rub it out .
Even if I did n't actually snap and start twitching and flapping around , surely I 'd be lying there fighting the urge , or at the very least fighting to suppress the urge from showing up in the first place ?
The more I thought about it , the more I became convinced I was going to do something appalling .
It was like a mind virus .
Then I had another , even more terrible thought : what if I was lying there , desperately battling this loopy self - destructive brainstorm , when something altogether simpler yet equally destructive happened ?
Specifically : what if I sneezed ?
What if I sneezed just as the needle pierced my spine , and the doctors screamed and the nurses wept and I spent the rest of my life paralysed in bed , like the guy in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly , minus the consolation of having two pretty French women squabbling for my affections ?
I 'd have to spend years staring at the ceiling .
I do n't mind ceilings , but I 've never glanced up at one and thought , " Oooh , I could stare at you for the rest of my life . "
Surely in this day and age , they could at least project films on the ceiling for me to watch ?
But that might be torture : what if they showed me nothing but Adam Sandler movies , and I could n't fast - forward or hit stop , just sit there , blinking angrily , only the nurse has n't noticed ; no , she 's busy looking up and laughing , laughing at the bit where Adam Sandler trips over the bench , or Adam Sandler gets hit on the nose with the basketball , she 's laughing and I 'm blinking and she has n't noticed , and the blinks grow wetter and I realise I 'm weeping , and Adam Sandler tumbles face - first into some dogshit and she laughs again , and I grit my mind and stare past the ceiling , stare past the sky , into deep space , and I focus a mental tractor beam composed of pure magnetic rage on a chunk of rock silently gliding through the blackness , and I stop it in its tracks and draw it towards the earth , a 100 - mile - wide asteroid swooping down to meet us , dragged down by me , until it collides with London , obliterating everything , an extinction - level event , billions of lives worldwide wiped out in the blink of an eye : my eye .
My wrathful blinking eye .
But do n't blame me .
Blame Sandler .
Anyway , in the event , I did n't have to worry about sneezing , or quadriplegia , or my Medusa Touch doomsday scenario , because the injection itself turned out to be fun .
Yes , fun .
Not because I 'm into needles , but because they sedated me – and whatever drug they used was brilliant .
So brilliant I do n't want to know what it was , because I 'd gladly kick a hospital to death for half a teaspoon of it .
In an instant , I understood in my bones why people become heroin addicts .
I went light - headed , then more light - headed , and then I can't remember what happened .
I was dimly aware of being moved back down a corridor .
Before I knew it I was back in a cubicle , wondering whether they 'd even been near my neck at all .
The doctor came in to check on me , and I asked him if I 'd been unconscious .
" No , no , " he said cheerfully , " you were talking a fair bit . "
Talking ?
I was talking ?
" Yes ; we held a conversation with you throughout .
You get a bit of amnesia , but that 's it .
It 's good stuff . "
I 've never had a blackout ; never been knocked unconscious ; never drunk so much I could n't remember the night before .
This wholesale deletion of recent memories is entirely new to me .
And it 's kind of creepy .
During the blank phase , was I still me ?
If not , who was doing the talking on my behalf ?
Roger De Courcey ?
And where was I while this was happening ?
Delivering milk on the moon ?
Window - shopping in the afterlife ?
Hovering over Plymouth ?
Was I dead ?
Dead -ish ?
Or merely very obedient ?
Did they make me do terrible things with vegetables and film it and put it on the internet ?
Time will tell .
Whatever happened , whoever took over thankfully had n't felt the need to flail like a salmon when the spike went in .
Clearly they 're more responsible and less neurotic than I am : they can have the job permanently if they like .
That evening , as I left the hospital , I realised I 'd caught a cold .
I spent the night sneezing and staring at the ceiling , keeping myself entertained by working out how to swear by blinking alone .
UK fighter Paul ‘ Semtex ’ Daley announced his arrival in the UFC last Saturday in some style with a first round demolition of one of the Welterweight divisions top contenders Martin Kampmann .
With his impressive stand - up skills Daley is certainly a welcome addition to the UFC but should he now be considered the UK ’s top fighter in the organisation , or are there others ahead of him in the pecking order ?
In this article https://mmainsight.com looks at the five UK fighters most likely to succeed inside the octagon .
—
Before we get to the top 5 , a few honorable mentions .
Firstly it ’s hard to ignore Paul ‘ Relentless ’
Taylor , who despite featuring mainly on the undercard of UFC events has managed to pick up three ‘ Fight Of The Night ’ awards thanks to his dynamic and exciting approach to every single fight .
With a 3 - 3 record in the organisation Taylor has some work to do to become of the top contenders in the welterweight division but he is undoubtedly a threat to anyone who stands across the cage from him .
Up and coming fighter John ‘ Hitman ’ Hathaway is another of the UK ’s most promising young talents .
The 22 year old turned professional in 2006 and is currently undefeated after twelve fights , including two wins in the UFC .
His last win over Rick Story has now become more meaningful considering his opponent ’s impressive ‘ Fight of The Night ’ victory at last weekends UFC 103 .
Hathaway has shown maturity in his performances that belie his youth and his next fight against fellow brit Paul Taylor will indicate whether he is ready to take the next step up the ladder .
Of course a new crop of UK fighters has recently parachuted into the UFC by way of the Ultimate Fighter reality show .
Ross Pearson , winner of the Lightweight section of the show looks to be a solid , hard working Lightweight that lives up to his nickname ‘ The Bulldog ’ but it is still too early to tell if he can make a real impact in the division .
He wo n’t get an easy road however , his next opponent is Aaron Riley .
James
Wilks won the welterweight section of TUF 9 and his performances on the show were notable first for defeating Che Mills , another talented UK prospect , and secondly for a memorable fight in which he knocked out Frank Lester ’s front teeth !
His most impressive win however came in the finale where he showed some excellent ground skills , dominating a seemingly helpless Demarques Johnson on his way to a first round submission victory .
With a professional record of 6 - 2
Wilks is relatively inexperienced for a 31 year old fighter but has shown potential and it will be interesting to see how he fares against the always tough Matt Brown in his next bout .
With that out the way , heres ’ the top 5 …
—
5. Paul Kelly
With a record of 3 - 1 inside the octagon Paul Kelly has made a solid start to his UFC career .
His first victory against Paul Taylor was a three round classic that found it ’s way onto the UFC ’s Ultimate 100 Greatest Fights show .
Following a submission loss to Marcus Davies at UFC89 Kelly has rebounded , notching up a dominant win over Troy Mandaloniz and then surviving a submission enslaught to claim a win over Rolando Delgado at UFC99 .
The latter fight was his first at Lightweight and he will now be looking to make further inroads into the division with a win against Denis Siver at UFC 105 .

Talk about off the hook .
A Verizon worker reportedly snapped and went berserk on a Queens customer after the man asked for his ID during a house call .
Repairman Robert Benjamin allegedly pummeled Aubrey Isakson , 37 , when the Sunnyside man balked at letting the tech inside of his apartment , according to the New York Post , citing a lawsuit filed in Queens Supreme Court .
" You want to know my name ?
Here 's my name ! "
Benjamin reportedly shouted , pressing his ID card into Isakson 's face .
" The guy essentially snapped , " Isakson , a limo driver , told the Post of the December 2008 altercation .
" He cold - cocked me , hit me two or three solid shots to the head while my hands were down . "
Isakson told the paper that the phone guy bloodied his face and broke his glasses , then grabbed him around the neck and pressed him up against a wall .
Isakson said all he could think was , " ' He 's prepared to kill me . ' "
Luckily he was able to break free and get help in the lobby , but not before he fractured his ankle running down the stairs .
An off - duty cop neighbor grabbed Benjamin , and the techie was arrested and charged with assault .
Isakson thought that Benjamin was going to do real time , but prosecutors offered to dismiss the case if the phone guy stayed disconnected from trouble for six months .
" According to what I was told , there was an error by the DA 's staff , " Isakson told the Post .
" They 're giving this guy carte blanche to do this every six months . "
A Verizon spokesman said that they have " zero tolerance for any sort of unethical or illegal behavior " but noted that Benjamin was n't convicted of any crime .
" In the months since this incident , his conduct ha been blameless , " said Verizon 's Rich Young .
" As a result , we will not take further action . "
Adding insult to injury , two days after the beat down Verizon 's technical service department later called Isakson to say they " figured out what the problem was . "
" They did n't even need to send this guy , " Isakson said .

This has been long overdue .
From Murray Waas :
In an appointment that senior Justice Department officials say demonstrates the Obama administration ’s commitment to reversing the Bush administration ’s politicization of the Department , a U.S. attorney fired by President Bush was reappointed to his old job on Friday .
Daniel Bogden , who was fired in the fall of 2006 by the Bush administration as the U.S. attorney in Nevada , was offered his old job back by President Obama , and was formally nominated on Friday .
Bogden ’s confirmation by the Senate is all but assured :
He has spent his entire adult life in government service , and as a former U.S. attorney was confirmed by the Senate previously .
He was also thoroughly vetted for his new position by the White House Counsel ’s office prior to his most recent nomination , even though he was vetted during his first appointment as U.S. attorney by the Bush administration .
Moreover , he has the backing of both his home - state senators : Harry Reid , a Democrat , and John Ensign , a Republican .
That Reid is a Senate Majority Leader , and that Reid personally suggested to the President that Bogden get his old job back probably , wo n’t hurt matters .
Ironically , Bogden ’s formal reappointment as U.S. attorney comes exactly one day after former Bush political adviser Karl Rove gave sworn testimony before the House Judiciary Committee regarding the firings of Bogden and eight other U.S. attorneys fired by the Bush administration .
A federal grand jury is currently investigating whether Bush administration officials and members of Congress obstructed justice in pressing for one or more of the firings , and also , whether they misled Congress as to why the prosecutors were fired .
Bogden ’s firing in the fall of 2006 is referred to by many in the Justice Department as the firing that came about as a result of some sort of Immaculate Conception :
For two years , the Justice Department ’s two watchdog agencies , its Inspector General and Office of Responsibility , spent 18 months investigating the firings of the nine U.S. attorneys .
When it came to Bogden , however , the investigators were not only unable to determine why he was fired , but even who ordered his firing .
Every single Justice Department official and Bush administration official interviewed by investigators disclaimed responsibility for his firing .
Is n't that typical Bush / Cheney dealings ?
Bogden ’s appointment to his old job by Obama appears to a historical first :
He will be the first U.S. attorney to be appointed and fired by the same President , only to be appointed U.S. attorney again by another President .
How strange it all is and I believe as time goes by we 'll see a lot more of these " irregularities " pop up , do n't you think ?
( co-written by David Neiwert )
across the universe in a lifetime .
with a catch .
If we could accelerate to more than 90 % of the speed of light , we could billions of light years in a human lifetime .
With two major gotchas ...
New Horizons is the fastest spacecraft launched so far by humans .
After a gravity assist from Jupiter , it ’s on a course to rocket past Pluto at 47,000 miles per hour .
At that speed it would circle our world in a little under 32 minutes , make it to the moon in just five hours , reach Mars at its closest point in a bit over one month and get to our nearest stellar neighbor in … 87,633 years ?
Oh .
Ok , maybe it ’s not really all that fast in the grand scale of things .
In fact , when it comes to space travel , it ’s about as fast as a limping tortoise on sodium pentothal .
But what if New Horizons could keep accelerating as close as was physically possible for it to get to the speed of light ?
A 2005 paper on the subject argues that it could cross half the visible universe in half a century .
And of course , since I ’m writing about this paper , you know there ’s some sort of major catch to the whole thing …
When people talk about exploring space , their greatest frustration is that the vast distances involved and how slow our spacecraft travel and could travel according to the laws of physics , make exploring any notable part of the universe in a single human lifetime impossible .
In a straight - line , arithmetical projection , things look very bleak for future interstellar explorers .
Even at relativistic speeds , it would take hundreds , if not thousands and thousands of years to get to their destinations .
However , things do n’t work in straight - line projections when an object is traveling at relativistic speeds according to Einstein ’s theory of special relativity .
The faster an object moves , the slower time flows for it relative to stationary or sluggish observers .
The phenomena is known as a time dilation and we know it really happens after experiments involving atomic clocks and airplanes .
If you ’ve ever flown in an airplane across a good stretch of land , you ’re a tiny fraction of a second younger than you should be if you traveled by car at sea level .
Astronauts experience even greater dilations .
Now , all that is taking place at the speed of a napping snail as far as the universe is concerned .
So to make things a little bit more interesting , physicist Jeremy Hoyl decided to ratchet up both the speed and the timeline to see what will happen if we launch a manned spacecraft able to accelerate by 9 meters every second well into the territory of relativistic speeds and keep on going .
His results show that when the astronauts age by half a century , they would cover almost 15 billion light years .
For us , their trip would take eons and the Sun would consume our world before shriveling into a white dwarf .
On our hypothetical spacecraft however , the astronauts would be a good deal older , but still very much alive and unaware of how fast time passed for the slowpokes on Earth .
By accelerating at a constant 9 m/s/s , not only would their craft be incredibly fast , it would also be a very good simulation of our planet ’s gravity .
The explorers could have showers , relax with a cup of hot coffee without the liquid floating into their faces as a boiling hot bubble , and the other little comforts of home .
In just over a year , they would hit the speed of light .
Computationally .
In reality , even if we ignore how big the power source would need to be to keep firing for over a year , the spacecraft would be stopped by the interstellar medium .
Usually , it ’s just gas and dust scattered in extremely low densities over thousand of light years .
However , when a ship tries to plow through this matter at a significant percentage of the speed of light , the sheer force with which an ordinarily harmless speck of dust hits the hull is multiplied exponentially .
And as the ship barrels on through , it ’s basically sandblasted away .
Not a good start for a trip across the cosmos .
The numbers get even worse if the spacecraft has to cross a solar system .
Bands of dust around stars ’ inner solar systems would vaporize a relativistic rocket going just 10 % the speed of light .
In the craft ’s control room , the crew would never even know what hit them before meeting their high friction doom .
Using time dilation to our advantage is n’t a new idea by any stretch of the imagination , but Hoyl does something innovative with it by showing us how over a long period of time , the phenomenon can give us an amazing return on investment .
Still , what ’s the practical use of taming special relativity to our advantage if the spacecraft would n’t survive the trip in the first place ?

The long - term future of space travel Physical Review D , 72 ( 10 ) DOI : 10.1103 / PhysRev…
Hundreds of fans flocked to the Vikings practice complex late Tuesday morning , awaiting his arrival .
Satellite trucks and cameras littered the grass just across the street from Winter Park .
Security was stationed in the parking lot and on the roof .
A helicopter hovered .
And then at 12:10 p.m. , the focus of long flirtation arrived .
Brett Favre was a Viking .
Coach Brad Childress ended a summer of anticipation when he pulled his black SUV into the parking lot , with Favre perched in the passenger seat .
Fans jeopardized their well - being by racing across the small street en masse to chase Childress ' Escalade into the parking lot .
A single Eden Prairie police officer tried to maintain control .
It was of little use .
Three weeks after Favre told Childress he had decided to remain retired -- and nearly four months after the Favre - to - the - Vikings talk began -- the player considered to be the final piece to a Super Bowl puzzle was on board .
" I completely dismissed it , " wide receiver Bobby Wade said of Favre speculation that constantly swirled .
" I did n't think it was an opportunity . "
Favre , the villain in these parts during his 16 seasons in Green Bay , now seems to be a conquering hero to all those craving No. 4 purple jerseys .
Just over an hour after his arrival , Favre had a two - year , $ 25 million contract in place -- it includes $ 12 million guaranteed this season -- and was on the practice field .
By early evening , Favre and Brad Childress -- " Chilly , " as Favre repeatedly referred to him -- were standing on a podium in the Winter Park fieldhouse , trying to explain how something that took months to end with Favre deciding to stay retired had been rekindled in the course of a day .
" All I want to do is win , " said Favre , who won a Super Bowl and three MVP titles while in Green Bay .
" That 's all I came back for is to win .
There 's nothing like it .
For guys who have played this game -- and sports in general , former players , guys in the latter part of their careers -- they 'll tell you it 's tough .
There 's no substitute for playing on Sundays .
You can't find that .
That 's what I 'm here for . "
Childress , entering the fourth season of a five - year contract , is in a similar boat when it comes to craving victories .
The Vikings have gone from 6 - 10 to 8 - 8 to 10 - 6 in Childress ' first three years and last season won the NFC North before bowing out with a first - round playoff loss to Philadelphia .
But Childress ' teams have never been set at quarterback .
Childress is banking Favre will be able to change that , despite the fact that he will turn 40 on Oct. 10 and that he had surgery on the biceps tendon in his throwing arm ( the right ) in May .
Favre found out after that procedure that he also had a tear in his rotator cuff , but he was told by noted surgeon James Andrews that he should be able to play with it .
We should begin to find out Friday night , when Favre is expected to play in the Vikings ' preseason home opener against Kansas City at the Metrodome .
What changed ?
In late July , Favre called Childress to tell him that he did n't think he could play at a level that was acceptable .
After spending last season with the New York Jets following an ugly exit from Green Bay that began with his retirement in March 2008 , Favre had decided in February that his biceps injury was too much to overcome .
But when the Jets released Favre from their reserve / retired list in late April , rumors began to swirl that he was headed to the Vikings .
The Vikings had been Favre 's top choice last summer , but the Vikings ' arch - rivals were n't going to allow that to happen .
It became more than rumors when the Vikings confirmed their interest in Favre .
Favre , who holds numerous NFL passing records , surprised many with his decision to remain at home in Hattiesburg , Miss .
It was equally surprising to find out Tuesday morning that one of Vikings owner Zygi Wilf 's private planes was in Hattiesburg to pick up Favre and deliver him to Childress , who was waiting at Holman Field in downtown St. Paul .
That came after Childress placed a call to Favre on Monday to take one final shot at getting the future Hall of Famer on his roster .
" I can be persistent at times , " Childress said of his final phone call to Favre .
" I just felt like it was a small window that we had to reconsider adding him potentially to our football team .
I can't tell you , I can't quantify for you how long was too long , or how long was n't enough .
I knew we had a month left now and just thought it was a small window .
We 're still in training camp , and once again the worst he could say is no . "
Working in Childress ' favor had been the reaction of Favre 's daughter , Breleigh , 10 , three weeks earlier .
Favre said Breleigh remained neutral on the subject of him playing again until the news broke that he was going to stay retired .
" After the news broke , she started crying , " Favre said .
" Anybody that 's got children -- I can be chased by five defensive lineman and it does n't scare me , but when my daughter cries , it softens me up .
And she said ' Daddy , I wanted you to go back and win one more Super Bowl . '
And I said ' Oh , why did n't you tell me before ? '
And she said ' Well , I did n't want to make that decision for you . '
" It 's amazing what you learn from your children .
She said , ' Can you go back ? '
And I said , ' Well , it 's too late . '
So I found myself this morning tearing up as I brought her to school and she said , ' Daddy , it 's going to be fine .
You go up there and do what you 've got to do .
We 'll be up there soon enough . '
I think I made the right decision , I really do .
Time will tell .
All I can say is I 'm going to do the best I can . "
A surreal day Vikings players , like many of the team 's fans , followed Favre 's journey from the St. Paul airport to Winter Park -- he and his wife , Deanna , were picked up in the plane by owners Zygi and Mark Wilf -- by watching on television .
Many of them also had found out at the last moment that Favre was coming , and as they looked out the cafeteria windows at Winter Park they saw the chaos across the street .
The former CIA inspector general , John Helgerson , has confirmed that the Bush administration authorised the CIA to use a harsh interrogation method on terror suspect Abu Zubaydah before written legal clearance was given .
This is politically explosive , because the Bush administration has always claimed that it used harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding only after government lawyers had determined they did not amount to torture .
This summer , Panorama , in the investigation Licence to Torture , uncovered its own information that Abu Zubaydah had been waterboarded before written legal clearance came .
Former CIA agent John Kiriakou , who led the team that captured Abu Zubaydah and was monitoring the cable traffic on his interrogation from CIA headquarters , told Panorama the suspect was waterboarded as early as May or June of that year .

The controversial government legal opinion that determined waterboarding was not torture was written in August of that year .
The date of Abu Zubaydah 's waterboarding is a closely guarded secret that no second source would confirm at the time .
John Helgerson , who has spoken now that his classified investigation into the CIA interrogation programme has been released , made his comments in a recent interview with Der Spiegel magazine .
In the interview the reporter stated that Abu Zubaydah had been subjected to " enhanced interrogation techniques " , as practices such as waterboarding are known , before August 1 , 2002 .
" Did the lawyer who signed the memorandum simply authorise a technique months after this technique had already been applied ? " the reporter asked Helgerson ..
" You are basically right " said Helgerson .
" There was some legal advice given orally to the CIA that had then been followed up by memorandums months later " .
In the course of his highly classified investigation into the CIA 's interrogation programme launched in 2003 , Helgerson interviewed more than 100 people and reviewed more than 38,000 documents .
Much of his report is still blacked out , but the parts that have been declassified found evidence of a variety of interrogation abuses including staging mock executions , intimidation using a powerdrill and threatening to kill the detainee 's children in the event of further attacks on the US .
President Obama 's administration has appointed prosecutor John Durham to begin preliminary investigations into whether any of the CIA interrogations of terror suspects were illegal .
Civil rights groups are calling for the investigations to probe officials at the highest level , as the White House was closely involved in authorising the CIA 's programme .
President Obama , however , has signalled that he does not want to be seen to be conducting a witchhunt of his predecessors in government , and it is widely expected that lower level officials will be the ones under the spotlight for now .
It is a graphic image of the harsh realities of war : the fatally wounded young marine lying crumpled in the mud , his vulnerable face turned to the camera .
And it is one the US defence secretary would rather you did not see .
Lance Corporal Joshua Bernard , pictured being tended by comrades in southern Afghanistan , died of his injuries soon after .
Now the release of this record of the 21 - year - old 's last moments has divided America , prompting furious debate over the sanitisation of war at a critical time for the military offensive .
The US defence secretary , Robert Gates , condemned the decision by the news agency Associated Press to publish .
" I cannot imagine the pain and suffering Lance Corporal Bernard 's death has caused his family .
Why your organisation would purposefully defy the family 's wishes , knowing full well that it will lead to yet more anguish , is beyond me .
" Your lack of compassion and common sense in choosing to put this image of their maimed and stricken child on the front page of multiple American newspapers is appalling . "
However , AP , whose photographer Julie Jacobson took the shot after being caught in the middle of an ambush while accompanying marines on patrol , said it had acted only after a " period of reflection " and argued that the picture illustrated the sacrifice and the bravery of those fighting in Afghanistan .
" We feel it is our journalistic duty to show the reality of the war there , however unpleasant and brutal that sometimes is , " said Santiago Lyon , the director of photography for AP .
The row reflects rising tensions over the impact of the death toll on an already wavering American public , with support for the war dwindling and President Barack Obama warned this weekend by leading Democrats that any attempt to send more troops is likely to meet resistance in Congress .
It also recalls the controversy four years ago when the Pentagon finally released pictures of flag - draped coffins returning from Iraq , overturning a ban imposed in 1991 on the US media photographing military caskets in transit .
In that case , the concerns of families were also repeatedly cited as justification for suppressing images of the dead , and they were only published after a freedom of information request by a professor of journalism , who argued that they were a matter of public record .
By contrast , the British media has regularly covered the return of coffins .
In extracts from her journal published by the US website huffingtonpost.com , Jacobson described the moment when she watched a marine lose his life " for the second time in my life " .
" He was hit with the RPG which blew off one of his legs and badly mangled the other ...
I had n't seen it happen , just heard the explosion . "
She described how she heard Bernard calling out that he could not breathe , and his friends telling him he was going to make it .
About 20 American newspapers and some websites used the image , sent out alongside photographs of Bernard 's life in uniform and his memorial service , last week , but it was taken on 14 August when Bernard 's patrol in the village of Dahaneh was ambushed .
He was airlifted to the US base at Camp Leatherneck but died there of his wounds , the 19th American to lose his life in Helmand that month at the height of the fighting .
AP said the images had been shown to his family in advance , but said that reporters had not specifically asked the family 's permission to publish , admitting that his parents had not wanted the photographs to be used .
The son of a retired marine , Bernard , from New Portland in rural Maine , was described as a devout Christian , an Iraq war veteran , a keen snowboarder and an avid hiker .
His father , John , described him as a " humble , shy , unassuming " man who did not smoke or drink and whose main friends were from his church group .
Three weeks before Joshua died , Bernard Snr had written to his congressman expressing frustration at what he said was a change in the rules of engagement to spare civilians , calling the move " disgraceful , immoral and fatal " to American forces in combat .
Asked to sum up his son , John Bernard suggested the words " service and personal honour " .
But as America continues to debate the use of his image , Joshua Bernard has now come to symbolise something more : the suffering inflicted on America 's sons and daughters in uniform , and the unease of fellow citizens forced to confront the grim truth about their deaths .
Lehman Brothers goes bankrupt 15 September 2008
The collapse of Lehman Brothers confirmed that workers in the financial services sector faced a bleak future .
It triggered a series of cataclysmic events in the global financial services sector .
The collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers after 150 years of operation a year ago this week shattered the foundations of the financial system that world stability relies on .
September 15 2008 and Lehman Brothers ’ collapse was not the catalyst of the collapse of the global financial system but is regarded as the moment people realised the system was broke .
Since the moment Lehman Brothers announced that it had entered administration the financial system went into melt - down and took thousands of IT jobs with it .
Banks are the biggest users of IT and what was once a safe haven for IT professionals became treacherous .

The sector has been plunged into its worst crisis with potentially valuable projects wound down because housing developers have run out of money to fund them .
Figures show that 660 archaeologists have lost their jobs since the start of the credit crunch , a sixth of all those employed in the commercial fieldwork sector .
Those who have held on to their jobs work fewer hours for less money – and are still at risk of being laid off .
The highly respected archeological unit at Manchester University closed last month after bosses withdrew funds , blaming the collapse in the construction industry .
The current plight marks an end to the boom years in archaeology , which is highly dependent on money from developers .
Since 1990 , construction companies have had to engage archaeologists in order to secure planning permission on sensitive sites and three years ago 93 per cent of all archaeological investigations had been initiated this way .

A previously unknown Palestinian group calling itself the Al - Quds Army later said it had taken a soldier .
Israel already has one soldier being held captive , Sgt Gilad Shalit , who was captured by Hamas - linked militants three years ago .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Attorney General Eric Holder has asked federal prosecutor John Durham to examine whether CIA interrogations of suspected terrorists were illegal , the Justice Department announced Monday .
President Obama wants the FBI to question terror suspects from now on , sources say .
The move came as senior administration officials said President Obama had OK'd a special interrogation unit to be housed within the FBI , and as a redacted CIA inspector general 's report on interrogation methods was made public for the first time .
Durham has been investigating the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes since January 2008 .
He was initially appointed to do so by then - Attorney General Michael Mukasey .
Holder said he decided to expand Durham 's mandate after examining reports from the Justice Department 's Office of Professional Responsibility as well as a classified version of the 2004 CIA inspector general 's report into questionable interrogation techniques , among other documents .
Watch what tactics a rights group calls " illegal " »
" As a result of my analysis of all of this material , I have concluded that the information known to me warrants opening a preliminary review into whether federal laws were violated in connection with the interrogation of specific detainees at overseas locations , " Holder said in a written statement .
He said he recognizes his decision to open the investigation " will be controversial , " and he reiterated earlier statements that there would be no prosecutions of CIA personnel " who acted in good faith and within the scope of the legal guidance given by " Bush administration lawyers .
" This preliminary review will not focus on those individuals , " he said .
He did not specify a focus for Durham 's investigation .
President Obama issued a statement echoing Holder 's comment that Obama would " look forward and not backward when it comes to issues such as these . "
Then - President George W. Bush authorized " enhanced interrogation techniques " for terror suspects in the years following the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks .
Those techniques , which included the practice of waterboarding -- simulated drowning -- drew sharp criticism from opponents , who said they amounted to torture .
Liberal groups have pushed for an investigation , stressing that it should include those who ordered the use of the techniques .
Prior to his appointment to looking into the interrogation tape destruction , Durham was an assistant U.S. attorney in Connecticut , where among other cases he oversaw the investigations and convictions of a pair of Connecticut mayors .
He also oversaw a federal investigation that broke up a corrupt law enforcement situation in Boston , Massachusetts , that was the basis for the Oscar - winning movie " The Departed . "
Durham was tasked with investigating the destruction of tapes of CIA interrogations of terror suspects .
The tapes were destroyed in 2005 and never handed over to the courts or the special 9/11 commission .
Holder said Durham 's investigation has given him " great familiarity with much of the information that is relevant to the matter at hand . "
Earlier Monday , senior administration officials said Obama approved the establishment of a special unit of terrorist interrogators based out of the FBI .
The move comes in the wake of criticism of questionable CIA interrogation techniques , such as waterboarding and the transfer of detainees to countries where torture is common .
The decision to place the FBI , rather than the CIA , in charge of interrogating suspected terrorists represents a major shift in U.S. national security policy .
The change is based on the recommendation of an interrogation task force that Obama established shortly after taking office in January .
The interagency High Value Detainee Interrogation Group will be overseen by the National Security Council and " draw on interrogators from defense , intelligence , and law enforcement , " a senior administration official said .
The group will be tasked in part with ensuring that future interrogations comply with restrictions outlined in the U.S. Army Field Manual .
The manual provides " adequate and effective means " of conducting investigations , the administration officials asserted , though they left open the possibility of adding new methods based on the latest scientific research regarding what are called " best practices " for interrogation .
" There will be full transparency " regarding " any new techniques that might be allowed " as a result of such research , one of the officials promised .
The State Department also will play a more prominent role in overseeing transfers of suspected terrorists to other countries for interrogation , the official said .
The department will help ensure that suspected terrorists are not abused or tortured .
" The new policies proposed by the Task Force will allow us to draw the best personnel from across the government to conduct interrogations that will yield valuable intelligence and strengthen our national security , " Holder said in a written statement .
" There is no tension between strengthening our national security and meeting our commitment to the rule of law , and these new policies will accomplish both . "
Asked to comment on the transfer of responsibility for interrogations from the CIA to the FBI , two former senior CIA officials said the agency never intended to handle detentions , and that it essentially was forced to do so as a result of its pursuit of suspected terrorists after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
Some of the questionable tactics used in that pursuit were highlighted Monday by the release of a 2004 report from the CIA 's inspector general .
The report outlines the use of multiple unauthorized detainee interrogation methods .
Among the findings : U.S. interrogators threatened a captured al Qaeda operative with a power drill to try to scare him into giving up information .
Interrogators also threatened to kill another top captive 's children in an effort to get the men to talk , the report says .
The gun and drill were used in two interrogation sessions against Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , according to a source familiar with the report 's contents .
Al - Nashiri is accused of plotting the 2000 attack on the USS Cole , which left 17 U.S. sailors dead .
The report says interrogators told al - Nashiri that if he did n't talk , " we could get your mother in here .
We can bring your family in here . "
Interrogators also reportedly told Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks , that " if anything else happens in the United States , we 're going to kill your children . "
Unauthorized detainee interrogation methods also included , among other things , " the making of threats , blowing cigar smoke , employing certain stress positions , the use of a stiff brush on a detainee , and stepping on a detainee 's ankle shackles , " the report says .
The report also states that interrogators staged mock executions -- which are banned by the U.N. Convention Against Torture -- to try to frighten detainees into talking .
In one instance , a gun was fired in an adjacent room to make a terrorism suspect think another prisoner was being killed .
" When the guards moved the detainee from the interrogation room , " the report states , " they passed a guard who was dressed as a hooded detainee , lying motionless on the ground and made to appear as if he had been shot . "
A federal judge in New York had ordered a redacted version of the report to be released as part of a lawsuit filed by the ACLU .
" This is in many ways an old story , " CIA Director Leon Panetta said in a written statement .
" The outlines of prior interrogation practices , and many of the details , are public already .
The use of enhanced interrogation techniques , begun when our country was responding to the horrors of September 11 , ended in January .
For the CIA now , the challenge is not the battles of yesterday , but those of today and tomorrow . "
The interrogations took place in the CIA 's secret prisons before 2006 , when Bush moved all detainees from such facilities to the detention center in the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
A CIA spokesman would not talk about specifics of the inspector general 's report but said all the incidents described in it have been reviewed by government prosecutors .
" The CIA in no way endorsed behavior -- no matter how infrequent -- that went beyond formal guidance .
This has all been looked at ; professionals in the Department of Justice decided if and when to pursue prosecution .
That 's how the system was supposed to work , and that 's how it did work , " CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said .
One of the sources , a former intelligence official who is familiar with the report , said that while the report " reaffirmed " the interrogation program , it " also showed some had strayed off center . "
The official said about a dozen cases of potential misconduct by interrogators were referred to the Justice Department .
Of those , only one person was prosecuted , the official said , with the rest being referred to the CIA accountability board , an internal disciplinary body .
Two people resigned rather than face the CIA board , the official said .
This official said that when CIA leadership found out about the drill incident , they were " angry as hell . "
The official called it " nickel - and - dime foolishness " that was not tolerated .
The individual who used the drill was pulled from the program and " sharply reprimanded , " the official said .
Anthony D. Romero , executive director of the ACLU , released a statement Sunday saying , " Leaked portions of the CIA inspector general 's report offer more proof that government officials committed serious crimes while interrogating prisoners .
So - called ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' like mock executions and threatening prisoners with guns and power drills are not only reprehensible but illegal . "
In anticipation of the release of the report Monday , Romero added , " Releasing the report with minimal redactions is essential to knowing what crimes were committed and who was involved . "

Britain 's leading scientists have challenged the US oil company ExxonMobil to stop funding groups that attempt to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change .
In an unprecedented step , the Royal Society , Britain 's premier scientific academy , has written to the oil giant to demand that the company withdraws support for dozens of groups that have " misrepresented the science of climate change by outright denial of the evidence " .
The scientists also strongly criticise the company 's public statements on global warming , which they describe as " inaccurate and misleading " .
In a letter earlier this month to Esso , the UK arm of ExxonMobil , the Royal Society cites its own survey which found that ExxonMobil last year distributed $ 2.9 m to 39 groups that the society says misrepresent the science of climate change .
These include the International Policy Network , a thinktank with its HQ in London , and the George C Marshall Institute , which is based in Washington DC .
In 2004 , the institute jointly published a report with the UK group the Scientific Alliance which claimed that global temperature rises were not related to rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere .
" There is not a robust scientific basis for drawing definitive and objective conclusions about the effect of human influence on future climate , " it said .
In the letter , Bob Ward of the Royal Society writes : " At our meeting in July ... you indicated that ExxonMobil would not be providing any further funding to these organisations .
I would be grateful if you could let me know when ExxonMobil plans to carry out this pledge . "
The letter , a copy of which has been obtained by the Guardian , adds : " I would be grateful if you could let me know which organisations in the UK and other European countries have been receiving funding so that I can work out which of these have been similarly providing inaccurate and misleading information to the public . "
This is the first time the society has written to a company to challenge its activities .
The move reflects mounting concern about the activities of lobby groups that try to undermine the overwhelming scientific evidence that emissions are linked to climate change .
The groups , such as the US Competitive Enterprise Institute ( CEI ) , whose senior figures have described global warming as a myth , are expected to launch a renewed campaign ahead of a major new climate change report .
The CEI responded to the recent release of Al Gore 's climate change film , An Inconvenient Truth , with adverts that welcomed increased carbon dioxide pollution .
The latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , due to be published in February , is expected to say that climate change could drive the Earth 's temperatures higher than previously predicted .
Mr Ward said : " It is now more crucial than ever that we have a debate which is properly informed by the science .
For people to be still producing information that misleads people about climate change is unhelpful .
The next IPCC report should give people the final push that they need to take action and we can't have people trying to undermine it . "
The Royal Society letter also takes issue with ExxonMobil 's own presentation of climate science .
It strongly criticises the company 's " corporate citizenship reports " , which claim that " gaps in the scientific basis " make it very difficult to blame climate change on human activity .
The letter says : " These statements are not consistent with the scientific literature .
It is very difficult to reconcile the misrepresentations of climate change science in these documents with ExxonMobil 's claim to be an industry leader . "
Environmentalists regard ExxonMobil as one of the least progressive oil companies because , unlike competitors such as BP and Shell , it has not invested heavily in alternative energy sources .
ExxonMobil said : " We can confirm that recently we received a letter from the Royal Society on the topic of climate change .
Amongst other topics our Tomorrow 's Energy and Corporate Citizenship reports explain our views openly and honestly on climate change .
We would refute any suggestion that our reports are inaccurate or misleading . "
A spokesman added that ExxonMobil stopped funding the Competitive Enterprise Institute this year .
Recent research has made scientists more confident that recent warming is man-made , a finding endorsed by scientific academies across the world , including in the US , China and Brazil .
The Royal Society 's move emerged as Chris Rapley , director of the British Antarctic Survey , warned that the polar ice caps were breaking up at a faster rate than glaciologists thought possible , with profound consequences for global sea levels .
Professor Rapley said the change was almost certainly down to global warming .
" It 's like opening a window and seeing what 's going on and the message is that it 's worse than we thought , " he said .
