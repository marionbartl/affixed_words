Wondering how long it'd take for the events of September 11th to go from real life tragedy to thoughtless plot McGuffin ?
Marvel 's new mega-event
Siege demonstrates that the answer is " eight years , and we can kill even more people . "

Marvel Comics ' reaction to 9/11 was both heartfelt and far - reaching , understandable for a company not only based in New York but one so tied to the city in its demeanor and subject matter ( Marvel 's New York state is the setting for the majority of its line , being home for years to Spider - Man , the Fantastic Four , Avengers , X - Men and Daredevil , amongst many others ) :
Not only did they publish the prerequisite memorial special editions ( Heroes and A Moment Of Silence ) , they also created a short - lived line of emergency services comics ( The Call ) , relaunched Captain America as a hero hunting terrorists ( with patriotic covers announcing things like " Fight Terror " and " Never Give Up " ) , placed a memorial logo of the World Trade Center Towers on all of their comics published for more than a year afterwards , and published a very special issue of Amazing Spider - Man where the company 's most well - known character visited Ground Zero to help with rescue efforts , and found that it was n't only the heroes who realized how terrible the terrorist attacks were :

Yes , Doctor Doom crying may have been a little too much - writer J. Michael Straczynski later denied asking for that in the script to avoid a backlash - but the meaning of all of this was clear :
As a company , Marvel Comics had been severely affected by the devastating attacks , and had not only faced up to the reality of such widescale destruction previously fantasized about in their books , but also felt that reality for themselves .
This was a sobered company .
Cut to last week 's Siege : The Cabal , the prelude to next month 's Siege event running across their entire line .
Following September 11th , an increasingly political subtext has crept into Marvel 's superhero lines , whether it's the " Personal Liberty or Safety " question at the heart of Civil War , terrorist sleeper cell paranoia of the run up to 2008 's Secret Invasion or " The People Running Our Country May Not Have Our Best Interests At Heart " theme of this year 's Dark Reign , and it 's been something that 's worked very well for the company : A decade ago , they were coming out of bankruptcy and their future looked uncertain , and now they 're being bought by Disney for $ 400 billion .
Siege : The Cabal acts as prologue to the big Final Act of the uber - storyline that 's been running throughout their titles since 2004's Avengers : Disassembled , and ends with Norman Osborn - onetime Green Goblin and now head of what is essentially Marvel 's Homeland Security department - talking with Norse God Loki about how he can make a pre-emptive strike against the mythical realm of Iraq .

That 's Chicago 's Soldier Field getting destroyed , by the way .
While there 's a game going on , and the stands are full of people .
Considering Soldier Field 's seating capacity is 61,500 , it 's probably safe to say that we 're talking about upwards of 50,000 fictional deaths in the stadium alone , even going with a " Well , it was n't sold out " defense , and that 's ignoring any damage and deaths in surrounding areas .
I think I 'm allowed a W. T. F. around now .
There are so many things that come to mind from seeing this preview , and this amount of devastation for the purposes of getting a plot about good guys teaming up to reform the Avengers going , and to prepare for a new , optimistic status quo called " The Heroic Age " .
Primarily , it 's the thoughtlessness and / or bad taste of the whole thing , especially coming from the publisher who seemed so affected by - or , perhaps , just displayed more of an emotional response to - September 11th ( Which resulted in almost 3,000 deaths ) and seemed to have come to some level of understanding of what an event of that scale actually means ( Hint : It 's not four issues of Cap and Iron Man and Thor getting back together to kick some bad guy ass , True Believer ! ) .
Do n't get me wrong , I understand the difference between fictional death and real death , but that does n't excuse the strange insensitivity here .

Secondly : Killing tens of thousands of people as an excuse to go to war ?
This is supervillainy on a ridiculous scale here , way beyond anything we 've seen in a long time and not only completely removed from the intentional scale and bombast of old school supervillains , but ( a ) literally collateral damage given little thought on the road to Osborn 's true plan , and ( b ) unlike other supervillain 's genocidal plans , apparently completely successful ( I hope that the next scene , not shown in previews , will reveal the Soldier Field destruction to be a fantasy sequence , but somehow I doubt it - And , if it were , it 'd seem even more ghoulish to release these pages to get fans excited about reading Siege : " Look , kids !
WIDESCALE DEATH TWENTY TIMES LARGER THAN 9/11 !
THIS IS THE BIG ONE YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR ! EXCELSIOR ! " ) .
I 'm all for demonizing bad guys , but this is just insane ; even going on the " Well , he 's mentally unbalanced " explanation Siege writer Brian Michael Bendis has been giving in interviews about the character and project , it makes mastermind Norman Osborn into a character that is impossible to sympathize with , and reduces him to almost cartoon proportions and ideas about evil .
All he needs now is a moustache to twirl when explaining his plan to the heroes .
( Second - and - a - half - ly : Killing tens of thousands of people as an excuse to go to war ?
Is this some kind of veiled " The American Right Wing Were Behind 9/11 As A Way Of Motivating People To Back An Invasion Of Afghanistan and Iraq " thing ?
After all , Bendis has said about the plot , " much like we 've seen in our own modern history , it 's not beyond world leaders to fabricate incidents if it serves a purpose . "
Hmm . )

Thirdly :
We 've seen this before , in more than one sense .
Not only is this a deliberate and literal call - out to the accidental explosion that launched Marvel 's Civil War , but the idea of using the destruction of a sports stadium to launch a war is from Tom Clancy 's 1991 novel The Sum Of All Fears ( adapted into a movie in 1999 , but not released until 2002 ) .
Of course , in that case , it 's a neo - Nazi trying to convince the US and Russia to go to war by placing blame on the event on the Russians , but still , the tone - deaf quality of the plot device becomes even stranger when you realize that it 's not even original .
So what to make of Siege 's Destruction McGuffin ?
A sign that , even if the rest of the world has n't gotten over 9/11 , Marvel has managed to move on and enjoy fictional slaughter as a motivator for superheroes to team - up again ?
Proof that cynical shock tactics outweigh genuine emotional responses when it comes to upping the ante in the name of sales ?
A thoughtless plot that leaves a nasty taste in the mouth ?
Maybe I 'm just too sensitive to these kinds of things ; it 's been eight years , after all .
Perhaps I should shut up and hope that they blow up an entire continent next so that Doctor Doom can reveal that he really did only have something in his eye down at Ground Zero .
After all , destroying Antarctica would be really bad - ass , would n't it ?
Maddow also asked Cohen to justify a quote from Gay Children Straight Parents in which Cohen lists a series of reasons on why children may be gay .
Amongst those reasons were divorce , and race .
Maddow asked how race could possibly be a factor and initially Cohen denied that was in the book .
Maddow held the book up , read the page number and the list again at which point Cohen pleaded that she was reading out of context .
Maddow read the preceding paragraph from the book , in which Cohen explains there are several reasons children may be gay etc etc ...
Cohen then challenged Maddow to read the passage following the list , and it had no pertinence to the question .
Finally Cohen just came out and admitted that race has no influence on whether or not a child may be gay .
One of the most electric moments in the interview came when Maddow told Cohen that he had " blood on your hands " because his work was being used to justify the persecution of gays .
It was just riveting .
The overall interview was a masterpiece by Maddow .
She was completely civil as always .
I remarked to my wife following the interview that they both probably got what they wanted .
Cohen was able to throw in several gratuitous plugs for his work , and Maddow was able to dismantle him live on her show .
I know I 've missed several very important moments of the interview which I 'll wish I had remembered as I bashed out this diary , so please leave your impressions of the interview in the comments and I 'll update as appropriate .

Fatal Misconception :
The struggle to control world population
By Matthew Connelly , Harvard University Press , Cambridge , 2008 . 521 pages .
Review by Simon Butler
November 16 , 2009 -- A select group of billionaires met in semi-secrecy in May 2009 to find answers to a “ nightmarish ” concern .
Their worst nightmare was n’t the imminent danger of runaway climate change , the burgeoning levels of hunger worldwide or the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
The nightmare was other people – lots of other people .
The self - styled “ Good Group ” included Microsoft founder Bill Gates , media mogul Ted Turner , David Rockefeller Jr and financiers George Soros and Warren Buffet .
The London Sunday Times said they discussed a plan to tackle overpopulation , something they considered “ a potentially disastrous environmental , social and industrial threat ” .
Yet it was far from the first time that the “ born to rule ” had sought to make rules about who could be born .
The brutal fact is that a policy of controlling global population means controlling the poverty stricken – whether the policy be concerned with fertility or migration .
More than 90 % of projected population growth in the 21st century will occur in the global South .
The highest birth rates are in the very poorest nations .
The same was true in the 20th century .
However , most supporters say population control is a kindness – a benevolent measure that can lift people out of poverty , hunger and underdevelopment .
Cutting population has been put forward by some as a key measure to address ecological decay and prevent runaway climate change .
The simple idea is that fewer people will mean less greenhouse gas emissions .
Controlling population is equated with the very survival of humanity .
The fact that , unlike greenhouse gas emissions , population growth is slowing worldwide ( the UN projects world population growth will peak by 2050 ) does not seem to sway the hardcore populationist lobby .
In response , other environmentalists say a focus on population is a dangerous diversion from the urgent need to transition to a zero- carbon economy and keep all remaining fossil fuels in the ground .
They say population control schemes are not only ineffective but inevitably treat the victims of social and economic injustice as obstacles to a sustainable society .
Dark past
In these debates , few populationists care to reflect thoroughly on the history of population control .
But population control has a dark past , which must be taken into account by everyone who wants to put forward solutions to the ecological crisis .
Matthew Connelly ’s exhaustively researched history on the population control movement , Fatal Misconception , describes what happens when powerful , influential groups decide other groups of people are “ excess ” .
“ This is a story of how some people have tried to control others without having to answer to anyone ” , Connelly says .
“ They could be ruthless and manipulative in ways that were , and are , shocking . ”
He emphasises that population control has never been a global conspiracy .
Rather , it reflects a highly conservative social outlook that treats other people as the biggest problem .
“ In effect , [ populationists ] diagnosed political problems as pathologies that had a biological basis .
At its most extreme , this logic has led to sterilisation of the ‘ unfit ’ or ethnic cleansing .
But even family planning could be a form of population control when proponents aimed to plan other people ’s families . ”
Connelly , an associate professor of history at Columbia University , has no time for the “ pro-life ” religious groups who have opposed population control because they are against contraception or abortion .
The denial of a woman ’s right to control her own fertility is simply another form of population control .
State - run programs to artificially boost population levels are also contemptible .
“ No less manipulative were those who were those who denied hundred of millions more people access to contraceptives and abortion because they wanted them to have more babies ” , he says .
But his book deals mostly with the policies , influence and actions of those who organised to cut population in the 20th century .
Fatal Misconception “ is a history of how some people systematically devalued both the sanctity of life and the autonomy of the individual . ”
Influence of eugenics
A key actor in this history is the US feminist and birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger .
In a 2008 interview with Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio National ’s Phillip Adams , Connelly described Sanger as a tragic figure .
She rose to public prominence in the US before World War I as an outstanding representative of the political struggle for women ’s right to safe abortion .
She was persecuted and hounded by US government authorities for her pioneering stand .
But by the 1920s , she had gravitated from being a campaigner for working - class women ’s rights to a supporter of efforts restrict the right of working - class people to parent children .
In 1925 she said : “ If the millions of dollars which are now expended in the care and maintenance of those who in all kindness should never have been brought into this world were converted to a system of bonuses to unfit parents , paying them to refrain from further parenthood , and continuing to pay them while they controlled their procreative faculties , this would not only be a profitable investment , but the salvation of American civilisation . ”
Sanger ’s shift reflected a political compromise she , along with other early feminist activists such as Britain ’s Marie Stopes , Japan ’s Shidzue Ishimoto and Sweden ’s Elise Ottesen - Jensen , made with the flagging eugenicist movement .
In this period , “ With few accomplishments , less public credibility , and little access to policymakers [ birth controllers ] agreed on the need to ally with eugenicists in every country ” , says Connelly .
The influence of eugenicist ideas became increasingly marked in Sanger ’s public statements .
Connelly records her saying : “ I believe that now , immediately there should be national sterilisation for certain dysgenic types of our population who are being encouraged to breed and would die out were the government not feeding them . ”
During the interwar years , Sanger played a key role in laying the foundations of a global population control movement .
From the outset , the partnership with the eugenicists warped the movement ’s aims .
Its prescriptions for the Third World avoided policies that focused on economic development or women ’s access to education – despite the proven link between these and lower birth rates .
“ But while birth control proponents were quite diverse and usually divided , none took up the cause of women ’s education ” , says Connelly .
“ That would have undermined efforts to forge an alliance with eugenicists , because it would only remind them of how contraception helped educated women avoid contributing to the gene pool .
Instead they could agree that the solution was to find a simpler , cheaper contraceptive that could be used by uneducated people . ”
Population bomb becomes a Rockefeller baby
However , it was n’t until the end of World War II that the population control movement began to build real influence in the halls of power .
In this period , the wealth gap between the capitalist West and the global South developed to unheard of proportions .
But it was also a period of colonial revolution .
Strong nationalist movements in most colonies defeated their colonisers and won independence from European powers in the decades following the war .
The unmistakable poverty in the majority world , along with the periodic rebelliousness of its people , reinforced the support for population control policies in conservative circles .
For those who benefited most from the global status quo , population control measures were a far more palatable alternative to ending Third World poverty or promoting genuine economic development .
“ In the aftermath [ of WWII ] , one might have expected the whole idea of shaping populations for political purposed to be discredited , considering the ways in which Nazis tried to control reproduction ” , Connelly says .
“ Instead , the cause of increasing access to birth control was about to enjoy a remarkable revival .
In the years immediately following World War II it won outspoken converts among the leaders of new United Nations agencies .
Tentatively at first , but with increasing largesse , it gained the support of the world ’s richest foundations .
And it would become the official policy of the largest nations . ”
By the 1960s , record population growth rates in the global South were exploited to win broader support for population control .
Paul Erlich ’s 1968 bestseller The Population Bomb convinced millions that world ’s biggest crisis was overcrowding .
Groups such as the Population Council and the International Planned Parenthood Federation ( IPPF ) had already formed but they now began to attract serious private and government funding .
Two of the biggest private sponsors were the Ford and Rockefeller foundations .
Oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller III served as the Population Council ’s first president .
The formation of this new “ American population elite ” was the subject of a famous 1970 essay by Steve Weissman in Ramparts magazine , titled “ Why the Population Bomb is a Rockefeller Baby ” .
“ In the hands of the self - seeking , humanitarianism is the most terrifying ism of all ” , Weissman concluded .
Controllers , not doctors
Flush with funds and political clout , the search was on for a suitable method for population control on a mass scale .
In the early 1960s , Western - sponsored population control programs in rural India and Pakistan experimented with contraceptives .
But the programs failed , mostly because the villagers themselves saw no reason to take the pills .
The populationists turned to a highly intrusive method : the insertion of intrauterine devices ( IUDs ) into targeted women .
The practice of inserting the spiral or ring shaped IUDs inside a woman ’s vagina was widely discredited in medical circles .
It was known for causing very high rates of infection , pain and bleeding .
Despite this , J. Robert Willson , chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Temple University , told the 1962 Population Council conference IUDs should be rolled out regardless .
“ We have to stop functioning like doctors ” , he said .
“ In fact , it may well be that the incidence of infection is going to be pretty high in the patients who need the device most .
Again , if we look at this from an overall , long - range view ( these are the things I have never said out aloud before and I do n’t know how it is going to sound ) , perhaps the individual patient is expendable in the general scheme of things , particularly if the infection she acquires is sterilisation but not lethal . ”
Willson ’s fellow obstetrician , Alan Guttmacher , an influential figure in the Population Council and IPPF , extolled the benefits of IUDs in a similar vein : “ No contraceptive could be cheaper , and also , once the damn thing is in the patient cannot change her mind .
In fact , we can hope she will forget it ’s there and perhaps in several months wonder why she has not conceived . ”
However , in its broader publicity the population control groups took more care to portray their “ family planning ” programs as a compassionate way to overcome poverty .
But as Connelly notes , “ the most effective propaganda for population control in the period did not threaten or cajole , or invoke poor victims .
It played on the anxieties about crime , contagion and mass migration , but without actually naming them .
It made people feel , viscerally , that it was already too late , and that they were living in a nightmare . ”
By the late 1960s , population control became official US government policy .
US President Lyndon Johnson ( 1963 -69 ) openly tied aid to India with it agreeing to push ahead with a population control program .
He said : “ I ’m not going to piss away foreign aid in nations where they refuse to deal with their own population problems . ”
Johnson ’s successor , Richard Nixon ( 1969 - 74 ) , dismissed democratic freedoms as condition for countries to qualify for aid , but “ population control is a must … population control must go hand in hand with aid ” , he said .
A new phase of population control had opened .
And it was sterilisation of the “ expendables ” , rather than contraceptives or IUDs , that was to become the most used method , with horrendous results .
` War against the poor ’
Western populationist groups had been active in India for decades .
But by the early 1970s , population control advocates had won over much of the country ’s upper - caste political elite .
Remarkably , family planning programs made up 59 % of India ’s total health budget before the 1973 oil shock , Connelly says .
By the mid-1970s , the Indira Gandhi government had declared the country to be on a “ war footing ” to stop population growth .
Gandhi was open that this “ war ” would entail undemocratic measures .
She said : “ Some personal rights have to be kept in abeyance for the human rights of the nation , the right to live , the right to progress . ”
Connelly describes the Indian campaign of as an undeclared “ war against the poor ” .
“ Sterilisation became a condition not just for land allotments , but for irrigation water , electricity , ration cards , rickshaw licences , medical care , and rises and promotions ” , he writes .
“ Everyone from senior government officials to train conductors to policemen , was given a sterilisation quota .
This created a nationwide market , in which people bought and sold , sometimes more than once , the capacity to reproduce .
Of course , for the very poorest , with no money and nothing else to sell , sterilisation in such conditions was not really a choice . ”
Connelly cites figures from the state of Uttar Pradesh .
People from lowest caste made up “ 29 % of the population , but were 41 % of those vasectomised ” .
Government officials soon discovered that offering incentives and disincentives was not enough to meet the ever - rising sterilisation targets set .
More repressive measures became common .
In 1976 , the state of Maharastra proposed jailing parents with more than three children who refused sterilisation .
The central government said it would not block the plan .
In one case , a village in the state of Haryana “ was surrounded by police , hundreds were taken into custody , and every eligible male was sterilised . ”
India ’s state teachers were also brought into the hysterical population control campaign .
According to Connelly , teachers “ like everyone else could be demoted , fired , or threatened with arrest .
They , in turn , sometimes expelled students when their parents did not submit to sterilisation . ”
China
In China , after years of promoting an artificially high birth rate , the ruling Chinese bureaucracy flipped to the complete opposite .
It embarked on its own population control program in 1979 .
For many years couples has to apply to the state for permission to have a child .
One permit from the 1980s said : “ Based on the nationally issued population plan targets combined with the need for late marriage , late birth , and fewer births , it is agreed that you may give birth to a child during [ 198 - ] ; the quote is valid for this year and cannot be transferred . ”
Each Chinese province worked out its own system of incentives and disincentives to meet its population control quota .
Connelly give a typical example from Hubei province : “ If parents had only one child , they were to be given subsidies for health care , priority in housing and extra retirement pay .
The child was also favoured with preferred access to schools , university and employment .
But if the parents had another child , they were required to repay these benefits .
As for those who had two or more children , both mother and father were docked 10 % of their pay for a period of 14 years . ”
But as in India , population control in China also relied on repressive force .
In the “ most coercive phase in the whole history of China ’s one - child policy [ in the 1980s ] all women with one child were to be inserted with a stainless - steel tamper - resistant IUD , all parents with two or more children were to be sterilised , and all unauthorised pregnancies aborted . ”
Defeat of the `old guard ’
As knowledge of the human rights abuses spread , and a determined women ’s rights movement arose ( especially in the South ) , the institutional powerbase of the population controllers in the West gradually receded .
Connelly cites the 1984 formation of the Women ’s Global Network for Reproductive Rights as an important moment in the fightback .
The feminist network of activists “ condemned both abusive population control programs and the efforts to force women to bear unwanted children . ”
The “ old guard ” of the international population control movement suffered a big defeat at the 1994 UN population conference in Cairo .
Under pressure from Third World delegates , the conference formally renounced population control as its aim .
“ The great tragedy of population control , the fatal misconception , was to think that one could know other people ’s interests better than they know it themselves ” , Connelly concludes .
“ But if the idea of planning other people ’s families is now discredited , this very human tendency is still with us .
The essence of population control , whether it targeted migrants , the ‘ unfit ’ , or families that seemed either too big or too small , was to make rules for other people without having to answer to them .
`` It appealed to the rich and powerful because , with the spread of emancipatory movements and the integration of markets , it began to appear easier and more profitable to control populations than to control territory .
That ’s why opponents were correct in viewing it as another chapter in the unfinished history of imperialism . ”
Connelly ends his history with a call for a “ commitment to reproductive freedom , not just a fear of the future … [ the future ] must be both pro-life and pro-choice , combining forces to oppose population control of any kind . ”

Update : In 2012 , Twitter bought Posterous , and killed it one year later .
I am now using Tumblr as an alternative .
Works just as good .
Until one of the big boys will buy Tumblr of course …
One of the great many things one can use Twitter for , is to share pictures “ on - the - fly ” with your social community :
From about anywhere in the world , I can take a picture with my mobile phone and within seconds post it on Twitter , for all my followers to see .
The most popular picture - posting tool is Twitpic .
This free Twitter utility converts pictures Emailed from your mobile phone into a post .
Each time a new picture is posted , a link to it is automatically tweeted from your Twitter account .
I started using Twitpic about a year ago , and in the mean time , racked up about 300 pictures on my Twitpic account .
Each of them had between 30 and 50 viewers .
Some pictures were funny , informative , sweet , frustrating or inspiring .
Some are taken from the mountains , at sea level or while boarding a plane …
I should say , it became pretty addictive , but in a good way .
I started to be more attentfull for the beauty around me .
At first , because I looked for something to Twitpic , later on , I started to feel more open to the beauty and uniqueness of every little thing around me .
Anyway … enough spiritual stuff .
Back to the technical part !
I liked Twitpic .
It was for free , but went down from time to time .
I wondered if I would be able to make a tool like this , using off - the - shelf blog software , and using my own domain name .
While making my series “ How to select your blog platform ” , I stumbled upon Posterous .
Similar to Tumblr , it is not a full blown blogplatform like Blogger , WordPress or Typepad .
Nor is it a microblogging service like Twitter or Identi.ca .
No , I would call Posterous a “ mini- blog platform ” : just like Tumblr , it allows you to easily post and share your post amongst other users .
The niche Posterous fills is that it automates sharing your content amongst other social media services like Facebook , Flickr , Picasa , YouTube , Vimeo , Blogger , WordPress , Xanga and …
Twitter .
Unlike Twitpic , Posterous is a blogging platform , so it allows me to customize the look and feel of “ my ” blog , but also allows me to use my own domain .
So I thought : “ How about using Posterous as an alternative for Twitpic ? ” ….
And it works like a charm :
Here is how to configure Posterous for the same functionality as Twitpic :
1. Register as a new user .
Give your Posterous blog a name like “ alter_ego.posterous.com ” , and ( important ! ) register it with the email address you will be Emailing your pictures from .
2. Next , add an “ autopost ” service to which each Posterous blogpost will be published the moment it comes online .
In my case , I configured my Twitter account as an autopost option :
3 . Take a picture from your mobile , email it as an attachment to “ post@posterous.com ” .
The subject line will become your blogpost ’s title :
Posterous will automatically tweet the post ’s title with the URL ( using the “ post.ly ” URL shortener ) :
With some CSS style customization and adding my domain on my Posterous blog , my end - result is this : “ Shot from the Hip ” , my own Twitpic - like Posterous blog …
A cane toad hiding in a pair of hiking boots made its way from Queensland and past quarantine inspectors into New Zealand .
The cane toad hitched a ride across the Tasman with a woman from Cairns , who flew to Queenstown last week to walk the picturesque Milford Track .
While she was getting a briefing inside a hiking shop , the creature jumped out of her bag .
" It was n't doing much moving , " shop owner Noel Saxon said .
" I think it was probably in a bit of shock .
Flying from Australia to New Zealand in a cargo hold is n't probably that good for you . "
Staff caught the toad and phoned New Zealand 's Ministry of Agriculture and were told to put the toad in a plastic bag and throw it in the freezer .
The cane toad had been inside the woman 's hiking boots .
She had declared the boots at Queenstown Airport and they were checked over and scrubbed with detergent .
But the woman had stuffed socks inside the boots , giving the toad a comfortable hiding place .
New Zealand authorities say cane toads could not cope with the south island 's cold climate and even if it had escaped , it would not have survived in the wild .

The effect was shown in silicon , the standby of the semiconductor industry
The next generation of computers may make use of the " spin " of electrons instead of their charge .
Spintronics relies on manipulating these spins to make them capable of carrying data .
The technique has been shown in a number of materials at low temperatures before .
But researchers writing in Nature have made use of these " spin-polarised " electrons in silicon at room temperature for the first time .
The result could lead to computers that require far less power than conventional ones .
The fact that the effect has been demonstrated in silicon - the material that already underpins the computer industry - means that devices exploiting it could be made on a commercial scale more easily .
The problem with silicon is that , as the individual features on silicon chips get smaller and smaller , they require more and more power to move the charged electrons around to represent 0s and 1s of binary code .
That rise in power also means that future chips will run into problems with heating .
In a spin Spintronics has long been touted as a future potential mechanism for computing , but so far advances have come slowly .
The idea rests on manipulating the " spins " of electrons , which can be either " up " or " down " , a choice between two states that is analogous to the on / off or zero / one of conventional , digital electronics .
This " spin " is n't really a direction the electrons are spinning in , but rather a convenient way to express one of the two " quantum mechanical " states an electron might be found in .
Hard drives already use a spin-sensitive readout device A number of laboratory demonstrations has shown that it is possible to create bunches of electrons with their spins aligned and to detect those spins in a range of materials , most importantly silicon .
However , they have all been at extremely low temperatures .
Now , researchers at the University of Twente in the Netherlands have demonstrated the manipulation and detection of these spin-polarised electrons in silicon at a temperature some 150C warmer than the previous record .
" We 've shown for the first time that this can be done at room temperature , which is obviously something you would need if you wanted to really commercialise this technology , " said Ron Jansen , who led the research .
' First step '
The trick , Dr Jansen said , was careful design of the interface where the electrons enter the silicon - the materials must be pure and of a precisely determined thickness in order to preserve the delicate spin polarisation .
" Let 's say it 's the first real step towards a real working technology , " Dr Jansen told BBC News .
" The next one is actually to build real electronic circuits and show that they are better than the electronic circuits that we have available right now . "
Robert Hicken , a spintronics researcher at the University of Exeter , called the work " an important step in the development of spintronics technology " .
" This tells us that one can now begin to look at room temperature , silicon - based electronic devices ; the exact design of such a device we do n't know yet , but this was a prerequisite for doing it . "
What remains unclear , Professor Hicken told BBC News , is whether spintronics can overcome the problem of heating that conventional electronics faces as individual devices become ever more tiny .

Generate Escaped String Output Using Spirit .
Karma By Hartmut Kaiser
This is another article in the series of “ How To ’s ” providing you with shrink wrapped grammars directly usable in any project .
I ’m going to describe a Karma grammar you can use to generate output for quoted strings , where all contained special characters are properly escaped .
The previous installment of this series ( see here ) is already giving a high level overview of Karma .
This allows us to skip any related introductions and to start right away .
The purpose of the escaped_string grammar is to generate output for any given character sequence while enclosing it in quotes ( i.e. ‘\ ” ’ or ‘ \ ’’ ) and making sure all relevant characters get escaped by pre-pending a backslash ( i.e. ‘
’ will be generated as “ \
” , etc. ) .
Let ’s start with the reverse Parsing Expression Grammar ( PEG ) for this :
esc_str → ' " ' ( esc_char / . / " \\x " hex ) * ' " ' esc_char → & '\a ' " \\a " / &'\b ' " \\b " / &'\f ' " \\f " / &'
' " \
" / &'\r ' " \\r " / &'\t ' " \\t " / &'\v' " \\v " / &'\ \ ' " \\\\ " / &'\ '' " \\\ ' " / & ' " ' " \\\ " "
Any escaped string ( esc_str ) starts and ends with the quoting character ( in this case ‘ ” ’ ) and all characters of the sequence are printed either as an escaped character ( esc_char ) or a printable character or a “ \\x ” followed by the hexadecimal representation of the corresponding character code .
The esc_char will handle any of the listed character codes by generating a backslash followed by the corresponding C - style encoding .
Each of the listed alternatives ( such as &‘\a ’ “ \\a ” ) reads as : if the character has the code ‘ \a ’ print it as “ \\a ” ( a backslash followed by ‘ a ’ ) .
We have seen this before : converting the PEG into a Spirit grammar is a simple and formal step ( we discussed that briefly here ) :
esc_str = ' " ' << *( esc_char | karma : : print | " \\x " << karma : : hex ) << ' " ' ; esc_char.add ( '\a ' , " \\a " ) ( ' \b ' , " \\b " ) ( ' \f ' , " \\f " ) ( '
' , " \
" ) ( ' \r ' , " \\r " ) ( ' \t ' , " \\t " ) ( ' \v ' , " \\v " ) ( ' \\ ' , " \\\\ " ) ( ' \ '' , " \\\ ' " ) ( ' " ' , " \\\ " " ) ;
Note we use predefined Karma facilities here , replacing a straight reverse PEG translation .
We could have defined the rule esc_char in a very similar way as done in the reverse PEG notation above , but decided to use a predefined Karma component , the karma : : symbols < > , instead .
This gives us a nice way of mapping the special characters to their C - style representation .
Conveniently , the symbols generator fails to generate anything if the supplied character is not contained in the symbols table .
The karma :: print is a primitive generator which succeeds generating output for characters satisfying std ::isprint ( ) while failing for all others .
The karma : : hex is a predefined numeric generator emitting its attribute in hexadecimal integer representation .
Generally , Karma generators have the ability to fail generating if some of their preconditions are not met .
This allows to use them in alternatives ( as shown above ) , forcing to try the next alternative if the current generator does n’t handle the output .
In the example above a specific character is first tried to be handled by the symbols generator .
If the character is not in the list of those to be handled by the symbols generator , the next alternative ( karma : : print ) is tried .
If the character does not satisfy std::isprint ( ) ( resulting in the karma : : print primitive to fail ) we use the last alternative as a catch all fallback and emit the character ’s hexadecimal representation .
The overall rule esc_str reads as : ‘ generate any supplied string embedded inside quotes ( ‘ ” ’ ) , convert all special characters into a sequence of a backslash and the corresponding C - style encoding and represent all non-printable characters in C - style hexadecimal character encoding ’ .
Now , as we have the grammar , the next step is to figure out the proper attribute types for the rules .
As written before , attributes in Qi are the types and values we get as the result of converting the input .
Attributes in Karma are the types and values we want to generate output from .
For our example the choice is straightforward and already implied by the goal .
If we assume narrow character representation we get :
karma::rule < OutputIterator , std::string ( ) > esc_str ; karma :: symbol<char , char const *> esc_char ;
We use karma : : rule <> as the non-terminal for storing the output format for the esc_str .
As this is the top level rule we assume std :: string to be its attribute .
As alluded to earlier , esc_char is a karma : : symbols <> instance using one character in the string as the key while storing the C - style representation of that character as its value .
Two of the generator alternatives inside the Kleene Star expose a single char as their attribute .
The third alternative , the ( “ \\x ” << karma : : hex ) exposes an int as its attribute , but this is perfectly compatible with a single character .
This allows the std :: string to be naturally split into single characters , one at a time .
Essentially we are done .
That was not too hard , was it ?
But before we write the ( reusable ) grammar and demonstrate how it needs to be called I thought to make things a bit more interesting .
So far our output format is bound to generate strings quoted using the double quote character ( ‘ ” ’ ) .
Would n’t it be nice to be able to customize the quoting character as well ?
This is interesting for instance if you need to generate Python style strings which come in 3 flavors : quoted with ‘ ” ’ , “ ’ ” , or “ ’ ’’ ” .
So I decided to introduce another features provided by Spirit ’s non-terminals : inherited attributes .
Non-terminals in recursive descent parsers and generators can be seen as being very similar to functions .
Parsers return a value , their synthesized attribute , while generators require a special consumed attribute .
Both optionally may take arguments , their inherited attributes .
Spirit uses the function declaration syntax in order to specify all attributes in a very compact form .
So we make the grammar customizable by ‘ passing ’ the quoting character sequence as an inherited attribute .
We modify the rule esc_str to expect a single inherited attribute ( the quoting sequence ) as a plain char const* , and change the rule definition to use this attribute :
karma::rule < OutputIterator , std:: string ( char const * ) > esc_str = karma::lit( karma::_r1 ) << *( esc_char | karma : : print | " \\x " << karma : : hex ) << karma::lit( karma::_r1 ) ;
The predefined primitive karma :: lit emits its argument as a literal and karma::_r1 is a special predefined placeholder expression referring to the first inherited attribute of the rule on the left hand side of the expression .
Now , as we have all the required pieces in place I ’ll show you how to wrap everything into a karma : : grammar to make it reusable :
template < typename OutputIterator > struct escaped_string : karma::grammar< OutputIterator , std::string ( char const* ) > { escaped_string ( ) : escaped_string::base_type(esc_str ) { esc_char.add ( '\a ' , " \\a " ) ( ' \b ' , " \\b " ) ( ' \f ' , " \\f " ) ( '
' , " \
" ) ( ' \r ' , " \\r " ) ( ' \t ' , " \\t " ) ( ' \v ' , " \\v " ) ( ' \\ ' , " \\\\ " ) ( ' \ '' , " \\\ ' " ) ( ' " ' , " \\\ " " ) ; esc_str = karma::lit( karma::_r1 ) << *( esc_char | karma : : print | " \\x " << karma : : hex ) << karma::lit( karma::_r1 ) ; } karma::rule< OutputIterator , std:: string ( char const* ) > esc_str ; karma:: symbols <char , char const *> esc_char ; } ;
The derivation from Karma ’s grammar type converts the escaped_string type into a generator .
Its member rules define a grammar which makes it usable for emitting quoted strings using arbitrary quoting characters .
The base class constructor gets passed the esc_str rule , which is the top most rule of the grammar to be executed when the grammar is invoked .
The type escaped_string has a template parameter allowing to utilize this grammar with arbitrary output iterator types .
The last missing code piece shows how to invoke the newly created generator .
typedef std::back_insert_iterator<std::string > sink_type ; std :: string generated ; sink_type sink ( generated ) ; std:: string str (" string to escape :
\r\t\ " '\x19 " ) ; char const * quote = " ’ ’’ " ; client::escaped_string < sink_type > g ; karma:: generate ( sink , g( quote ) , str ) ; // this will emit : ’’ ’ string to escape :
\r\t\ " \'\x19 ’’’ < /a>
The function karma : : generate ( ) is another of Spirit ’s main API functions .
In the simplest case it takes an output iterator representing the output target to send the output to ( sink ) , an instance of the generator to invoke ( g ) , and the attribute instance holding the data ( v ) .
We pass the quoting character sequence ( the “ \ ” ” ) as a inherited attribute while invoking the grammar .
This function executes the actual generator operation and returns true if it was successful .
If you want to try out this example for yourself , the complete source code is available from the Boost SVN here .
In the future this example will be distributed as part of the Spirit distribution , but for now it lives in the SVN only .
Additionally , the karma : : symbols <> generator is not yet part of the latest released code ( Spirit V2.1 ) .
You either need to checkout the current version of Spirit from the SVN or download the related file here .
In this case you need to explicitly include it into the example in order to be able to compile the code .
A lot of indie games have just changed their names .
Remember Fez ?
It ’s now Fedge .
Tyler Glaiel ’s Closure is now named Closure : on the EDGE of reality ™ .
The forthcoming iPhone game Critter Crunch is henceforth referred to as Critter Credge .
And the enormously enjoyed Canabalt is now called Canabedge .
Although Atomic Edge Games are n’t too pleased about it all .
Other new games have been announced including Ted Marten ’s Edgeward McEdgington , Secret Exit promises to bring us LEDGE , Steph Thirion ’s Eliss declares a sequel , Edgeliss , Tyler Glaiel is back with a new game , Edgeform : On The Edge Of Insanity , and there ’s rumours of a new game from Dejobaan , EeeeeEEeeeEEEeeEEEEeEEEEEdge!
A Feckless Disregard For Poopieheads .
You may have noticed a pattern .
This is a solidarity movement amongst the indie development community to stand up to the legal actions of Tim Langdell , who has recently launched another attempt to remove a game from Apple ’s iTunes store due to including the word “ Edge ” in its title .
If you did n’t follow the story of Langdell ’s attempt to remove EDGE from iTunes , there is no better place to catch up than Simon Parkin ’s astonishing piece for Eurogamer .
EDGE is back up , after an intervention by EA , but Langdell is now trying the same with a game called Killer Edge Racing .
The movement above is a response to this , a sort of burst - the - prisons protest , with an increasing number of developers standing up to the legal actions from Langdell .
You can follow the list on Touch Arcade .
If you wish to delve deeper into investigations of Langdell , and find some really remarkable discoveries about his business , be sure to follow Chaos Edge .
The posts are long , but they ’re meticulously researched , and carry some hefty surprises .

Lesson # 512 - Agnostics
Money makes the world go round , right ?
Do n't delude yourself into thinking it does n't make religious affiliations go round , either .
They call it tithing for a reason , you know .
Yes , you 've been bamboozled !
Hoodwinked !
You 're being taken for suckers that not only can't count , but whose memories have been washed away by threats of swine flu and reality TV shows .
Do not fret , though .
What I have is PROOF of the great Banking Bamboozle , for all to see .
Now , armed with this proof , all I need for you is to go out and do something about it .
Do n't sit there staring at your screen , thinking " damn , he 's got a point " .
Send a copy of this proof along with your comments to all of your elected officials , congressspersons , senators , bankers , insurers , business partners and the media outlet of your choice .
The other alternative is ...
Maybe the powers that be have a point and threats of swine flu combined with the latest episode of survivor and flowery proclamations of " green shoots " amid 10.2 % unemployment is all it takes to pull the wool over your eyes .
We shall see , shall we ???

The reason why the big banks are being protected at all costs and on the breaking backs of the unemployed taxpayer
The truth behind the Stress Tests and Unemployment The truth behind credit loss assumptions :
Where the hell did the stress test numbers come from ?
The Grand Finale : So , what banks are in trouble and how much trouble are they in ?
A very granular and unprecedented look at the weaknesses of some of the anointed 19 that you cannot get from anywhere else !
You may have seen bits and pieces of stress test analysis in other blogs and news sites , but I doubt if you have seen all pieces of the pie stitched together , as below .
You see , many complain about Goldman Sach's $ 40 billion of bonuses during a time of near depression , but as all who bother to even consider have probably summarized - this government is ran by , and ran for , the capitalist class .
If you even have to ask a question after this statement , you can be rest assured you are not part of that class that the government truly serves .
In preparation for the social mobility thesis behind the protection of the banks below , you should download this handy - dandy model that shows you ( in full detail ) where YOU stand in the grand scheme of socio- economic stratification , or to put it more simply , how much the powers that be believe CNBC can effect your behavior ( quick registration is required , you may choose the free option to subscribe ) - Socio-economic stratification model 156.00 Kb .
For many , going through this model is the equivalent of choosing between the blue and red pill in the Matrix , literally risking an unjacking from the network of make believe .

Social Mobility : The Reason Why the Big Banks Are Being Protected .
Unlike the Jefferson's ,
We 're moving on down !
Social class is defined ( on this blog ) as the amount of control one has over one 's socio-economic environment .
It is much more than money , although money is a large component .
For instance , Barack Obama is in a higher class than Robert DeNiro or Derek Jeter , although Robert DeNiro and Derek Jeter are most likely wealthier ( although that is quite debatable after taking into consideration the value of Obama 's campaign contribution list and membership database from his social networking site ! ) .
Obama 's higher class stems from his ability to exert more control over his socio-economic environment .
The factors that this author uses to determine class combine ( with the associated weights ) to create a " socioeconomic index " :
Socioeconomic Index= ( Occupation X 12 ) + ( Income source X12 ) + ( Income X 7 ) + ( Wealth X 14 ) +
( Education X 7 ) + ( Dwelling area X 15 ) + ( Class Consciousness X 7 ) +
( Housing X 12 )
As you can see , wealth is the largest contributor to the class standing , and coincidentally it is the factor that is the most at risk in this current economic climate .
I believe that there will be a significant entry into the upper middle class by those who were once firmly entrenched into the upper classes !
While that may not seem like a big deal to many , it is damn big deal to those who are moving down the ladder .
This also means , that there will be some space for others to move ( relatively speaking ) up the ladder into the capitalist class .
One man 's ( or woman 's ) misfortune is another 's opportunity .

Higher Upper Class - the Capitalist Class
Social Mobility is the name of the game in times of severe dislocation - times like we are experiencing now .
It is the endgame of the extant capitalist class to convince the populace , both by means of government misinformation and disinformation disseminated through the mainstream media , that the current severe economic dislocation is over and we are well on the path to economic recovery .
Economic recovery in this sense during this period can also be read as the cementing of the status quo for the capitalist class !
Everytime a member of the capitalist oligarchy stumbles from its perch ( usually in times of severe economic dislocation ) , a driven member from a lower rung on the socio- economic food chain rises to takes its place .
The goal of the capitalist class is to prevent that lower rung member from rising " BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY ! "
Hence the " protect the banks at any cost " scenarios that you see coming from Paulson , Geithner , et. al .
The mantra that you hear being preached by the guardians of the gates of the Capitalist Class , saying " we barely averted catastrophe ! " , " The demise of XYZ ( or GS ) bank will bring upon us the end of the World as we know it " , or any other nonsensical drama , is simply propaganda to frighten the sheeple into stepping in line , lockstep behind the minions of the Capitalist Class .
Banks have been failing for thousands of years and the world moved on , without so much as a hiccup in the vast majority of cases .
The world will come to an end as we know it for those members of the Capitalist Class that were closely associated to any bank that fails , which is why you here the aforementioned mantra from the minions of the Capitalist Class .
Hey , I need for those underperforming banks to fail - for they are dragging on the productivity of this country like some royalty receiving wealth and influence from birthright rather than from merit or performance , and the failure of such institutions will enrich this country by allowing the hybrid vigor of the true capitalistic producers ( as opposed to the rigid caste - like capitalist class ) to move into the capitalist rung on the ladder and truly produce value .
The massive amounts of extremely valuable , and apparently low cost ( relatively ) or absolutely free information disseminated from sources such as BoomBustBlog or ZeroHedge are attempts at equalizing the effect of the Capitalist Class Oligarchy , thus enabling social mobility through awareness .
You see , when you are on top of the ladder , social mobility can only mean bad things .
For everyone else , it can hold the promise of better things to come .
Once you are aware of how these things break down , you will see many settings in a different light .

Now , on to those Stress Tests !
Let 's take a walk through recent history ...
Earlier this year , in an attempt to assuage the fear of bank insolvency , the government issued what amounted to " take home " stress tests for the big US banks .
These tests were known as SCAP ( Supervisory Capital Assessment Program ) tests .
I have warned about the inaccuracies of these tests in the spring ( see Welcome to the Big Bank Bamboozle and More - on - Reggie - Middletons - Bank - Stress - Testing ) , but now with the benefit of hindsight I will systematically go through the aspects of these tests which SEVERELY overestimated the strengths of the banks in question , with ample evidence sprinkled throughout .
The Unemployment Figures Used in the Stress Tests Have Proven to be Fantasy , at the Very Best !
The stress tests assumed a worst case scenario for unemployment to be 8.9 % in 2009 ( see pages 8 and 9 in scap_design_and_implementation 286.90 Kb ) .
As the facts stand now , the unemployment rate rose from 9.8 % in September to 10.2 % in October 2009 ( see U.S. Unemployment Jumps to 10.2 % , Prompting Obama to Pledge Fresh Measures ) .
The long - term unemployment rate ( including marginally attached job seekers and workers who are discouraged or part - time for economic reasons ) rose from 17 % in September to 17.5 % in October 2009 .
( U.S. BLS )
As you can see , the major driver of future bank credit losses has been woefully underestimated , and thus the capital requirements of said banks have been woefully underestimated , among other things .
We shall get to that in detail later on in this missive .
For now ...
The stress test assumptions worst case scenario was off by 130 basis points for 2009 and we are currently in uncharted territory since we pierced the worse case scenario for the entire prediction term of the assumption period ( the 10.2 % number was for October and we are trending sharply higher ) .
Even the Federal Reserve was more pessimistic shortly after the government agreed to let most banks pay back TARP and allegedly " passing " the stress tests .
Despite this , last minute epiphany they were still significantly too optimistic .
The U.S. Federal Reserve estimated unemployment at 9.2% - 9.6 % for Q4 2009 and 9%- 9.5 % for Q4 2010 , off by up to a full 100 basis points , but still better than what they allowed the banks to project losses with .
More data tidbits before we move on :
Reggie Middleton said , " I told you so " when this farce first got started : More - on - Reggie - Middletons - Bank - Stress - Testing
The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey ( JOLTS ) :
The job openings rate in August 2009 was unchanged at 1.8 % .
The number of job openings has declined 50 % since the peak in June 2007 .
The hires rate at 3.1 % is at a low and the separation rate remained at a record low of 3.3 % .
( U.S. BLS )
This implies that job losses in recent months have slowed mostly due to lesser layoffs while hiring is still subdued .
Economist Michael Feroli , JP Morgan : The August JOLTS report shows that the number of unemployed / underutilized workers per job vacancy rose to 10.9 in August 2009 .
The continued increase in this ratio will put downward pressure on wages .
The Beveridge curve ( showing the inverse relationship between the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate ) derived from the JOLTS survey is consistent with a rising natural rate of unemployment .
( via the October 9 , 2009 report ' Bad News and Good News in the August JOLTS )
Going forward , the economy needs 100,000 - 150,000 job creation per month to employ the growing labor force , and over 200,000 - 250,000 job creation per month to recover the jobs lost during this recession .
The jobless recovery might therefore keep the unemployment rate high for a few years .
Professor Brad Delong , University of California Berkley :
The increase in the unemployment rate during this cycle has been much greater relative to the contraction in real GDP , implying that Okun 's Law is broken .
( via Macroblog ; 07/23/09 )
Dr. Nouriel Roubini :
All elements of total labor income -- jobs , hours and average hourly wages -- are under pressure , which will impact consumption in the coming months .
The unemployment rate in late 2009 will be higher than what was assumed for 2010 in the adverse scenario of the banks ' stress tests .
This will lead to further delinquencies on loans and securities and lower - than - expected recovery rates .
As people with mortgages lose their jobs , they will have severe difficulties servicing their mortgages .
( 07/02/09 )
Bridgewater Associates : " Normally , labor markets lag the economy because incremental spending transactions are financed via debt , stimulated by interest rate cuts .
But as long as credit remains frozen and in a deleveraging environment , job growth becomes an important leading , causal indicator of demand and other economic conditions .
The deterioration in labor market will continue because companies ' profit margins are so deeply damaged ( amid the slowdown in consumer spending and credit crunch ) that a little bounce in growth wo n't do much to alter their need to cut costs . "
( via Thoughts from the Frontline ; 05/15/09 )
Bloomberg reports that the increase in temporary work hiring may foreshadow an increase in permanent hiring ( see Temp - Worker Increase May Foreshadow Return to US Job Growth Nov. 6 ... ) .
There is another way of looking at that though .
Mary Daly , Bart Hobijn and Joyce Kwok , Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco : Given relatively lower temporary layoffs and greater increase in part - time workers , the " level of labor market slack would be higher by the end of 2009 than experienced at any other time in the post - World War II period , implying a longer and slower recovery path for the unemployment rate .
When the economy rebounds , employers will tap into their existing workforces rather than hire new workers . "
( 06/05/09 )
Senior Economist Edward S. Knotek II and Research Associate Stephen Terry , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City : A banking crisis coinciding with a recession and recent rends in the labor market suggest that " unemployment will recover much more slowly from this recession than past episodes of severe recession may suggest . "
( 08/13/09 )
Professor Edmund Phelps , Columbia University :
The non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment ( NAIRU ) may rise above the current 5.5 % to 6.5 % or 7 % . ( via Bloomberg , May 26 , 2009 )
OCED : The significant increase in unemployment during the recession and in the long term will lead to an increase in structural unemployment by 2010 and beyond .

The truth behind credit loss assumptions :
Where did the stress test numbers come from ?
They came from the guys that were actually being tested .
It 's the world 's largest take - home test !
On several occasions , I have released research that explicit details the default rates , and as an extension , the loss and recovery rates behind residential mortgages in most states in the US ( by combining the default rates with the Case Shiller data ) - see " the open source mortgage default model " , the downloadable , open source default and loss rate model ( free registration required ) : Revised SCAP Assumptions Public Open Source Version 1.1 1.21 Mb and " Green Shoots are Being Fertilized by Brown Turds in the Mortgage Markets " ( these links are must read items - they contain megabytes of government sourced , empirical loss data that directly contradicts what was offered in the SCAP tests ) .
The aforelinked document is also available as a .pdf for download ( with additional commentary ) after a free registration : BoomBustBlog.com 's Realistic Recast of SCAP .
Much of this info came directly from the NY Fed and the FDIC , hence it was readily available to the Federal Reserve and the Treasury as well .
Despite this , the SCAP tests used much more optimistic numbers than the NY Fed 's own findings , and the results are becoming apparent as I type this .
This is a must read document for anyone who has bothered to venture this far into the blog post ( registration required to download ) : BoomBustBlog.com 's Realistic Recast of SCAP .
It was generated using data culled directly from the NY Fed 's and the FDIC websites .

Here are a few key excerpts ...
Geographic breakdown of Alt A loans
Source : New York Fed
I have warned about Alt A loans in the beginning of the year - see The banking backdrop for 2009 .
As of April 30 , 2009 there were nearly 2 mn Alt A loans outstanding , each with an average balance of $ 321,293 , representing $ 651 bn ( down from $ 658 bn in March 2009 ) of total Alt A loans ( avg FICO score of 705 ) .
California with 43.8 % of total Alt A loans ( avg FICO score of 709 ) had the largest share of Alt A loans followed by Florida ( 9.4 % of total Alt A with avg FICO score of 700 ) and New York ( 5.6 % of Alt A loans with avg FICO score of 704 ) .
Is there collusion amongst the banks to drive up the prices of Toxic Assets ?
Last year , the government offered a public / private investment program that used taxpayer funds to assist private investors in leveraging up to purchase toxic assets off of bank balance sheets .
I made immediate , and public , note that this program was rife with possibilities of collusion amongst the banks and loopholes ready to be abused .
I even created a model for congress to peruse which detailed a few of the possibilities .
See ( free registration required ) :
PPIP full model , with collusion and implied leverage 202.00 Kb. Miraculously , within months , toxic asset prices started floating higher .
Hmmm !
I am not saying outright collusion did occur , but it really does smell fishy .
For those of you want to know what the stress tests results of the big banks were if they used the NY Fed / FDIC official loss data , I have run the numbers for you .
It does n't look very pretty in some cases .
This content is paid subscriber - only , except for the two links that have public - lite and public excerpt included !
Let 's walk through the PNC free data , in light of how misleading their latest quarterly report was ( see For those that did n't notice - Reggie Middleton on PNCl Q3-09 Results and then be sure to read At What Point Does Accounting Gimmickery Become an Outright Lie? Let 's Ask PNC ) .
Click any of these graphics to enlarge ...
Notice the amount of leverage that PNC is using if one were to use the NY Fed and FDIC data in lieu of what PNC has proffered through their take home test .
As you can see from above , there is a significant difference between what the government 's SCAP tests reveal PNC will lose and what the government 's NY Fed and FDIC call sheet data says PNC will lose - a very significant difference .
Solely as a result of looking at this chart , one should be willing to demand a second round of considerably more stringent stress testing .
If one were to granularly break down the foreseen losses to PNC 's portfolio using the government data ...
As you can see , going through each major loan category in PNC 's books reveals a much LESS optimistic scenario than ANY portrayed in their SCAP take home test results ...
In an act of near unprecedented generosity , I have included the PNC valuation along with the Blackrock contribution in the free PNC lite public download below ( in alphabetical order ) .
Subscriber content that reveals what the banks truly require in terms of capital and cushions and the actual rate of losses to come .

I would save a crap ton of money !
And eat a lot healthier too .
I might have to go to bed every night at 9 , but it ’s not like I could n’t use the sleep and steady habit anyways .
In all honesty , I ’d give it a shot in a heartbeat .
I do n’t know how long I could last ( or that the Mrs. would even allow it ( she would n’t ) ) , but it ’s definitely something I think about every now and then .
Like , every 30 days when the mortgage is due ;)
Or when my blogger friends talk about doing it themselves !
While I ’m probably the only twenty something actually * wanting * to live back home again , you ’d be hard pressed to deny the sweet financial benefits to such a situation .
Free rent / mortgage , food , cable , internet , phone , homeowners insurance , condo fees , the list goes on and on .
We ’d of course have to revert to 6th grade with all the chores and cleaning up we hated to do back in the day , but it ’s not like we do n’t have to do them anyways , right ?
$ hit , I ’d even move in and pay them half of what our monthly housing costs add up to !
We ’re talking big buckaroos here , friends .
According to our monthly expenses , we ’d save roughly $ 3,000 a month !
My freedom is enjoyable , but is it really worth $ 3,000 ?
And on top of that , all the stuff that un-minimalizes us ?
I gotta admit , if I were n’t married and / or living 2 hours away I ’d at least give it a shot .
That is , if they upgraded from AOL dial - up and got HDTV ;)
Only halfway joking there …
Unfortunately , I ’m afraid those glory days are long gone for us .
We do live farther away and we do have a lot of stuff that ties us down – not to mention the future family we want to start with some baby - making !
While I like it or not , it comes to a point when you really do have to get out there and make something of yourself .
At least according to my dad ;)
For all I know he would n’t let me back even if I tried !
haha… I ’m sure I could convince him ( or have mom do it ) , but I know parents like their freedom just as much as the next person .
Regardless , the financial aspect is extremely intriguing .
I may not be able to take advantage of it myself , but if you ’re in the lucky stage in life I say go for it .
There ’s no shame in saving up and getting your money in order before getting out there on your own – esp.
if you ’ve got some debt piled up already .
You might not find it as exciting as I do , but if you can stick it out for a bit you ’ll have a lot less stress and a lot more fun to look forward to .

If I recall correctly , this project started a year and a half ago in Copenhagen when several of us were talking about the idea of having a modern blogging platform for the Perl community .
Naturally , it had to be written in Perl .
We 've deliberately kept this low - key as we have known others talk about this before , but nothing came of it .
It 's good that we kept it low key because it 's been a long time coming .
There was a private mailing list and we ( participants can out themselves if they choose ) discussed at length the various features we might want .
While we never had complete agreement , a compromise set of things was pretty much agreed upon .
A multi-user blogging platform .
Must be written in Perl .
OpenID support ( for commenting , but not blogging ) .
Tags .
Images ( yay ! )
Syntax highlighting .
The images were very important to me , at least , because sometimes I want to do stuff like have a quick image of a class hierarchy :
And if I want syntax highlighting , I just put it in < pre > < code > tags ( but html escaping is required ) :
sub is_valid_json ( $ ; $ ) { my ( $ input , $ test_name ) = @_ ; croak " usage : is_valid_json ( input, test_name ) " unless defined $ input ; eval { $ JSON -> decode ( $ input ) } ; my $ test = __PACKAGE__-> builder ; if ( my $ error = $ @ ) { $ test -> ok ( 0 , $ test_name ) ; $ test -> diag ( " Input was not valid JSON :
\t$error " ) ; return ; } else { $ test -> ok ( 1 , $ test_name ) ; return 1 ; } }
If you do n't want syntax highlighting , just use < pre > < tt > tags instead .
And , of course , you 'll see tags at the bottom of this post .
There are plenty of minor issues to iron out , so this blogging platform should be considered an alpha , but so far , I like what I 'm seeing .
See also Alternatives to Inheritance .
It 's a repost of a use .
perl post I made and lets you compare what you 'll see here with what you see there .

Trevor Jarvis '
Flying Gate
I met Trevor Jarvis at his home / workshop in July 2003 and spent most of an afternoon talking with him .
He was most kind and showed me his workshop and told me a bit about his operation .
The following information is condensed from a typed sheet he gave me outlining the history of how he came to make Flying Gates .
Trevor had a small engineering business .
In February 1979 , he decided to expand his operation to include bicycle frame manufacture , and T.J. Cycles was born .
Trevor has been an avid Hetchins owner since he was 17 ( he has a curly Experto ) , and had also ridden a Baines with the peculiar rear end known as the Baines Gate design .
Trevor decided that , if he were to make a success of cycle frame building , he would have to offer something out of the ordinary , since the market was already dominated by dozens of frame builders making conventional designs .
The curly Hetchins was still being produced , of course , but the Gate design had fallen into disuse since the closure of the Baines Bros. business in 1956 .
Trevor had been impressed with the ride and responsiveness of the Baines Gate and decided that he would try to revive the design .
He found the remaining Mr. Baines ( originally , the firm had been founded by two brothers ) and secured the rights to the design .
Trevor then registered the design under the name ' Flying Gate . '
It is no small tribute to Trevor 's enterprise that a good many people now refer to the original Baines machines as Flying Gates , although that is not strictly correct .
The original ones were Baines Gates .

I can draw only one of two conclusions : Either the Obama administration 's economic advisers and their Congressional enablers are as dumb as a box of hammers and completely oblivious to the history of the first Great Depression , or they do know and are gambling with the nation 's economy anyway - because they 're afraid the Republicans might draw blood in the next election cycle :
WASHINGTON — Faced with anxiety in financial markets about the huge federal deficit and the potential for it to become an electoral liability for Democrats , the White House and Congressional leaders are weighing options for narrowing the gap , including a bipartisan commission that could force tax increases and spending cuts .
But even the idea of a panel to bridge the partisan divide has run into partisan objections .
Many Democrats , including in the White House , are loath to cede such far - reaching decisions to a commission and doubt Republicans ’ willingness to compromise .
And most Republicans remain adamantly opposed to tax increases , leaving the prospects for any bipartisan approach limited at best .
The proponents , however , are pressing for a Senate vote this month .
“ If we have the same process and the same people , we are going to get the same results , ” said Senator Evan Bayh , Democrat of Indiana , who recently met with Mr. Obama to discuss the idea .
“ The Democratic Party wants to spend more than we can afford , the Republican Party tends to want to cut taxes more than we can afford .
So we are stuck . ”
And of course , the grandstanding Mr. Bayh is the man who loves to agree with the Republicans .
Concerns about the deficit are building even as the White House and Congress continue to add to it with tax cuts and spending to stimulate a still - fragile economy .
Yet those one - time costs do not trouble most economists and market analysts .
The main driver of long - term deficits is the chasm between the benefit programs Medicare and Medicaid , which are growing faster than the economy , and federal tax collections , which are at one of their lowest levels in many decades relative to the size of the economy .
Mr. Obama ’s budget director , Peter R. Orszag , now at work on the president ’s next budget , due in February for the 2011 fiscal year , declined to comment about a bipartisan commission and instead promised that the coming budget would propose additional ways to reduce the deficit beyond next year , when the economy is fully recovered .
Paul Krugman referred us to this just the other day :
Matt Yglesias makes a good point : A lot of politicians and political operatives in DC are very impressed by polling that shows people concerned about the budget deficit .
I think it would be really politically insane for people to take that too literally .
If congress makes the deficit even bigger in a way that helps spur recovery , then come election day people will notice the recovery and be happy .
If , by contrast , the labor market is still a disaster then people will be pissed off .
It ’s true that they might say they ’re pissed off at the deficit , but the underlying source of anger is the objective bad conditions .
But the political argument against focusing on the deficit is even stronger than he realizes — because there are very good odds that even if Obama exhibited iron fiscal discipline , voters would n’t notice .
There ’s a remarkable , depressing paper by Achen and Bartels that includes an analysis of voter views of the deficit in 1996 — by which time the huge deficit that Bill Clinton inherited had been drastically reduced .
Here ’s what voters thought they knew ...
Yep : after one of the biggest moves toward budget balance in history , a majority of Republicans , and a plurality of all voters , believed that deficits had increased .
Not to put too fine a point on it : if Obama succeeded in reducing the deficit , would Fox News or the Washington Times report it ?
The truth is that the truth about budgets plays almost no role in real politics .
Right now , Meg Whitman is campaigning for Governor of California on the claim that state spending has exploded over the last decade — when the fact is that it has fallen drastically in real per capita terms .
Will she pay a price for this ?
Probably not .
So if I were a politician , I ’d focus on providing real improvements in peoples ’ lives , rather than seeking deficit reductions the public wo n’t even hear about .
Not to mention that in 1937 , when FDR , under pressure from the Blue Dogs of his time , cut taxes and spending , it deepened and prolonged the Depression by driving unemployment back into double digits - and led to a major defeat in the 1938 mid-terms for the Democrats .
I ’ve spent a lot of time overseas but really do n’t have any insight on an important question :
Are there other Western democracies whose people hate science and intellectuals as much as Americans do ?
This quote by Chris Matthews this morning on climate change pretty much sums up the prideful ignorance our country seems to love :
“ Is the drive to save the planet hurt because it ’s the baby of the intellectuals ? ”
Jeebus save us if this trend continues for much longer .
P.S. I again highly recommend you check out the book Idiot America : How Stupidity Became a Virtue in the Land of the Free
Hillary Clinton has taken the special relationship to a new level with a gushing appraisal of David Miliband , who the US secretary of state described as " vibrant , vital , attractive and smart " .
The extravagant compliments were delivered in an interview with Vogue magazine , which put journalistic objectivity to one side to describe Britain 's foreign secretary as " tall and dashing " .
The interviewer added for good measure : " I got a crush over the phone in about five seconds partly because of his accent . "
But he was outdone by Clinton , who responded : " Well , if you saw him it would be a big crush .
I mean , he is so vibrant , vital , attractive , smart .
He 's really a good guy .
And he 's so young ! "
Vogue describes Miliband as smitten too , but in a more buttoned - up way : " She applies intellect but also psychology to the dossiers that she 's studying , " he said of Clinton .
" She 's delightful to deal with one on one .
She 's someone who laughs and can tease , and she 's got perspective as well . "
Miliband and Clinton are not the first he - she pair of transatlantic diplomats to hit it off .
Condoleezza Rice took Jack Straw to an American football game , and while neither was as forthcoming as Clinton , Rice 's actions spoke louder than words when she gave up her bed on an overnight flight to Baghdad and slept on the floor of the plane .

We are a little league team looking for a sponsor for the upcoming season .
Email if you are interested in helping out .
Thanks !
From Me to ********@***********.org
Good afternoon ,
I came across your ad looking for a sponsor for your little league team .
I am interested if you still need one .
Let me know , and we can discuss the details .
Thanks ,
Mike
From Joe ********* to Me :
Hey Mike ,
My name is Joe .
I have been the coach of this team and greatly appreciate the offer .
We still do need a sponsor and I would like to hear what you have to offer .
The league will not start up again until mid-April so we will have some time .
Let me know what you were thinking for sponsorship , you can email or call me anytime at (***)***-****
Thanks ,
Joe
From Me to Joe *********:
Joe ,
I am glad to hear you are still interested .
I would like to have my company name on your team 's uniform and fence sign .
How much would it cost to do this ?
Mike
From Joe ********* to Me :
Hi Mike ,
The cost to fully sponsor our team would be $ 800 .
It would cover ordering the jerseys and equipment .
At the end of the season you will be recognized at our ceremony and will receive a framed photo of the team and your own uniform .
What is your company 's name and do you have a website ?
Thanks ,
Joe
From Me to Joe *********:
That sounds reasonable Joe .
I am the founder of an adult film company called BarelyLegalSuperSluts .
We specialize in 18 + amateur pornography and I would like to get our name out there .
We plan on lanuching our site around April , so I think the timing would be perfect with your league .
I can forward you our logo and we will discuss designs for the uniforms .
Mike
From Joe ********* to Me :
Mike ,
Do you realize this sponsorship is for a little league team ?
Joe
From Me to Joe *********:
Yes , you told me that .
I think it is great that I 'll be able to help kids enjoy America 's greatest pastime .
From Joe ********* to Me :
and you honestly expect a bunch of kids to be sporting a jersey that says Barely Legal Super Sluts ?
From Me to Joe *********:
Is it too long to fit on the jersey ?
We could just call them the Super Sluts for short as long as the sign on the field included the link to our website .
From Joe ********* to Me :
No that is n't the problem .
This team is for kids and we can't have them wearing shirts that say Super Sluts on them .
It is highly offensive and the league most likely would n't even allow it .
From Me to Joe *********:
How about we call them the Barely Legal Little Leaguers ?
I would include a free copy of our Super Sluts Slurping Loads DVD for every parent that attends the game .
The DVD features over 3 hours of sluts with hilarious outtakes and alternate endings .
I could even have a few of our stars come out and mud wrestle during the 7th inning stretch .
I think it could pull in a lot more of an audience for your little league .
From Joe ********* to Me :
No !
Thats even worse !
Look Mike
I appreciate you trying to help our team out but this is absolutely the wrong place to be advertising your porn .
If you would still like to contribute you can but we cannot have your company name associated with our team .
From Me to Joe *********:
If this is how you treat every sponsor that wants to help your team out , you will never get any money .
Sooner or later you are going to have to whore yourself out to someone , which is a valuable lesson learned in my Big Sluts : Big Loads DVD .
I could give that one out to the parents instead , due to the educational value .
From Joe ********* to Me :
You just dont quit do you ?
Aint happening so go to hell !

EPISODE SYNOPSIS :
The evil pigeons battle The Supreme Being , challenging Him to a myth - busting showdown .
A man stands outside a Citi bank branch in New York August 13 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. taxpayers could ultimately see a profit of $ 13 billion to $ 14 billion from Citigroup ’s payback of bailout investments , including dividends paid , a U.S. Treasury official said on Monday .
That amount includes the gain on the government ’s 34 percent stake in Citi common shares , which was close to $ 5.8 billion as of Friday ’s close , as well as trust preferred securities with a $ 5.2 billion face value , received in a loss - sharing agreement backing a pool of Citigroup assets .
The official also said the total also includes estimates of nearly $ 3 billion in dividends paid on the government ’s investments in the bank .
Citigroup has struck a deal with the Treasury and U.S. regulators to repay $ 20 billion of government bailout funds , which will include the sale of some $ 5 billion of Citi common stock .
It will sell the rest , about $ 20 billion worth , within six to 12 months .
The official said the biggest variable in the taxpayers ’ ultimate profit will be fluctuations in the value of Citigroup common stock , and the value at which the government sells it over the coming year .
First , an update to the previous message .
Do football games ever get rained out ?
I guess I ’ll find out today .
It rained all night ( with lightning ) , it ’s raining now , and there ’s an 80 % chance of rain for the rest of the day , so I do n’t think it will dry out in time for the game between the University of Kentucky and the Florida Gators .
The good news is that not a drop came in through the leaky back door , the one that gave us problems last winter .
I guess the wind was n’t blowing the right way .
Yesterday I read a strange story from Israel National News , about some coins discovered in Egypt , which are supposedly from the time of Joseph .
They were quoting an article from Egypt ’s Al - Ahram and MEMRI , the Middle East Media Research Institute , translated it .
Normally INN ( also called Arutz Sheva ) is my favorite Israeli news source , but somebody , either INN or Al - Ahram , did n’t do enough research , because I am full of questions and skepticism .
Here is part of the article :
“ … discovered many charms from various eras before and after the period of Joseph , including one that bore his effigy as the minister of the treasury in the Egyptian pharaoh ’s court … ”
An Egyptian paper claims that archaeologists have discovered ancient Egyptian coins bearing the name and image of the Biblical Joseph .
The report in Al - Ahram boasts that the find backs up the Koran ’s claim that coins were used in Egypt during Joseph ’s period .
Joseph , son of the Patriarch Jacob , died around 1450 B.C.E. , according to Jewish sources .
Excerpts from the Al - Ahram report , as translated by Middle East Media Research Institute ( MEMRI ) :
“ In an unprecedented find , a group of Egyptian researchers and archeologists has discovered a cache of coins from the time of the Pharaohs .

An Egyptian paper claims that archaeologists have discovered ancient Egyptian coins bearing the name and image of the Biblical Joseph .
The report in Al - Ahram boasts that the find backs up the Koran ’s claim that coins were used in Egypt during Joseph ’s period .
Joseph , son of the Patriarch Jacob , died around 1450 B.C.E. , according to Jewish sources .
Excerpts from the Al - Ahram report , as translated by Middle East Media Research Institute ( MEMRI ) :
“ In an unprecedented find , a group of Egyptian researchers and archeologists has discovered a cache of coins from the time of the Pharaohs .

And here is my response :
Coins from the time of Joseph ?
Not bloody likely !
First of all , most history texts will tell you that money is a Lydian invention , appearing no earlier than 700 B.C.
We do n’t see coins anywhere else until the Persians started minting Darics , around 520 B.C.
Therefore I would n’t expect to find any Egyptian coins older than the XXVII dynasty .
Second , it would have helped if the story had mentioned which pharaoh was mentioned on the coins .
Probably Thutmose III or Amenhotep II , if the 1450 B.C. date is correct , and they are going by the most widely accepted chronology .
However , I do n’t know of anybody who puts Joseph that late .
Most chronologies have him living around 1662 or 1877 B.C. , which would put him either in the Middle Kingdom or the Second Intermediate Period ( also called the Hyksos era ) .
By the way , last spring they had a fine exhibit of 200 Egyptian artifacts at the University of Kentucky , which had been found a hundred years ago by the great Egyptologist , Sir Flinders Petrie .
Among other things , I saw a black granite statue of an unnamed , tired - looking court official , from the late XII dynasty .
The card on the glass case said he must been been a very important person , to receive a statue that was so realistic .
Because of the date , I ’m guessing that it ’s none other than Potiphar , the former owner of Joseph .
I heard once that the last important Middle Kingdom pharaoh , Amenemhet III , had a treasurer named Ptahwer , and this could be another spelling of the same name .
Third , Moslems also believe that Alexander the Great visited Mecca and practiced Islam .
Since Mohammed was born 892 years after Alexander ’s death , I think it ’s safe to say that the Koran is not a reliable source on ancient history .
Most Moslems are n’t interested in events before Mohammed ’s lifetime anyway , and will dismiss it as the “ Age of Ignorance . ”
On the other hand , the Biblical stories of Joseph and Moses seems to agree with the idea that Egypt had a barter economy ; for example , Joseph taxed the people during the seven good years by taking one fifth of their crops and storing it .
We do n’t hear of him storing gold or silver , and when the Hebrews left Egypt , they took the jewelry of the Egyptians , not their money .
“ It ’s like I ’m PLAYING a movie ! ” Cinematic gaming and you
From the title , I know that YOU know which game I ’ll be talking about in this article , but I assure you that this wo n’t be a one game entry .
There are a lot of other games out there that aim for a cinematic experience other than Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves , though most are nowhere near as effective as what Naughty Dog has pulled off with their PlayStation 3 exclusive .
As the technology used for video games advances , developers gain the abilities to add cinematic elements to their games .
There is no single method for this and each game , depending on the developers chosen style , go about this concept in many different ways .
And now onto the first and very obvious game on the list …
Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves
Firstly , before I say anything about this game …
Chloe = Australian Lara Croft in red ?
I know that you were all thinking it when you saw her .
Uncharted : Drake ’s Fortune is a game that successfully spread its storytelling through cutscenes as well as in - game dialogue and masterful character interactions by some extremely talented actors .
Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves has all that , but oh man is it so much bigger , better , cooler and more thrilling than what the first game ever came close to .
There are still moments when you ’re put into a cutscene , but there are also a lot more moments where the story and character dialogue take place during playable events in the game .
To add to that , 99.9 % of all of the action , including huge explosions and thrilling fight scenes occur while the player is in control .
All of this is bound together in what can be described as a perfect cinematic experience … so much so that Sony brags about it in their commercials for the game .
With the level of quality put into Uncharted 2 , it makes me wonder how Naughty Dog will top themselves with the third game which we all know will come sooner or later .
How can they improve on what already seems to be the best that anyone could possibly do for a series that has taken cinematic gaming to its peak ?
I look forward to seeing it with my own eyes years from now …
Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots
What the Uncharted series does during the game , Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots , as well as previous games in the MGS series , does during some pretty intense ( and long ) cutscenes .
Even the die hard Metal Gear fans stopped for a moment to wonder “ how long is this going to go on for ? ” …
Of course , with MGS4 there really was n’t any other way the story could be told … as convoluted as that story may have ended up being on some levels .
Some may criticise MGS4 for this , though when you think about it , at least they used the in - game engine to present those cinematic moments rather than the usual Full Motion Videos that were quite popular back in the day .
Back in previous generations when several consoles were starting to use CDs , there was a huge rise of FMVs showing up on practically every game that had the development budget to afford them .
I remember a moment when my friend wanted to show off his new PlayStation to me back in the day .
He booted up a game and showed me how awesome the FMV looked .
He seemed to be really proud of how his system could do such a thing , but even back then when I was still a kid , I still knew that this was just a video playing .
The funny thing is that once the game actually started it revealed less than thrilling visuals .
Are FMV cutscenes a bad thing ?
If used well it can be a great cinematic story telling element and also show some great action that , in the past at least , could n’t be achieved with the game engine itself .
Final Fantasy VII comes to mind , though Final Fantasy VIII was the game that really pimped this feature out .
… and these other ones over here !
While some games let you watch a cutscenes in peace , others decide to throw button cues at you out of nowhere .
The first time I encountered the infamous “ quick time event ” was in Resident Evil 4 .
All of a sudden an icon telling me to press the A button flashed on screen while I had my controller resting and then suddenly I was dead .
It may have fooled me the first time but never again .
Later on in the game I was pleased to experience the greatest interactive cutscene I had ever experienced with the knife fight between Leon and Krauser .
What started out as an annoyance suddenly became awesome , and while some people will always hate QTE ’s , when done right , they can make you feel like you ’re a part of that cinematic moment …
Previous Resident Evil games should also be mentioned , though not for the cutscenes themselves , but rather for the in - game camera angles .
Of course many gamers who used to play Alone in the Dark back in the day will recognise these forced perspective camera angles from the original Alone in the Dark on PC .
These camera angles , which are used in quite a lot of different games nowadays to guide the player but also manages to add a cinematic flare to the games as well .
There ’s also been a recent trend with some light gun shooter games for Wii that have their own cinematic elements .
The entire game that is House of the Dead : Overkill is practically homage to every b- grade / low budget horror movie ever made .
On the other hand , Resident Evil : The Darkside Chronicles and Dead Space Extraction , both of which are heavily stylised first person rail shooters that seem to be heavily inspired by the camera shaking style of The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield .
One of the common threads that bind many cinematic games together is that they tend to be associated with more linear based games that have a single story path you must follow from start to finish .
Anything that has particularly heavy story elements suffers from this effect , though in this current generation things have been changing .
There is a PS3 exclusive called “ Heavy Rain ” that , if it can deliver on all of its promises , will lead players through a cinematic non-linear experience that have never been experience before .
I enjoy seeing these kinds of evolutions occur in video games .
I ’m also glad that developers are seeking out new styles of explore and not sticking with the overly used cutscenes that we ’ve been used to for all these years .
I ’m also glad that we ’ve moved on ( mostly ) from using FMVs and are starting to use the in - game engine for cutscenes more and more .
I look forward to see what else developers come up with in the future .
Last week , Jelte van Abbema won the Dutch Design Awards ‘ € 10,000 Rado Prize , which goes to a promising young designer .
One work that caught the judges ’ attention is Symbiosis , a font printed in bacteria .
Van Abbema created the font by stamping bacteria into paper , and then placing the paper in a jury - rigged incubator , which provided the right humdity and warmth for the organisms .
As they multiplied and died , the resulting fonts changed color and shape .
As van Abbema says , bacteria “ transforms the image to something new , ” creating something that is literally alive , changing every minute without ever being tended .
These are early days for experiments like these –most have n’t been much to look at , and they ’ve more often created strange , sensationally hyped news stories than beautiful objects .
For example , there was the artificially grown “ leather jacket ” that had to be “ killed ” because it was growing too fast ; and there was , of course , artist Steven Kurtz , who uses petri dishes in his art installations and was briefly arrested and held on bioterrorism charges .
But van Abbema ’s work is a bit less high concept , and decidely good - looking –and others will surely follow down this path , given how cheap and easy at - home bioengineering has become .
Van Abbema ’s press release says , “ To cause no epidemic he followed a
course at the department microbiology of the university Wageningen . ”
Should we be worried , as experiments like these near the reach of those who are irresponsible or even malicious ?

Irv Miller , public affairs head of Toyota USA , just posted the automaker 's official response to not receiving any 2010 IIHS Top Safety Pick awards .
What 's it say ?
The IIHS did n't test every Toyota and the new test is really hard .
Advertisement
Toyota 's claiming the roof crush test — only applied to three Toyotas — the RAV4 , Camry and Yaris — is harder than federal standards :
" This is the first year IIHS has included its own roof strength tests , which exceed federal standards , for TSP consideration .
All Toyota vehicles meet or exceed Federal Safety Standards for frontal and side impact , roof crush resistance and rollover protection . "
Advertisement
So , let 's get this straight : you 're upset because your cars do n't meet a tougher standard than the federal guidelines — a standard other automakers are capable of meeting — and you expect the consumer to accept that argument ?
Really ?
Seriously ?
But wait , there 's also the fact that the Camry actually passed this much more difficult roof crash test .
So why did n't the mid-size get a Top Safety Pick ?
Well , because , as the IIHS said in their press release late last night ,
" The midsize Toyota Camry would have qualified with good ratings , except for its rear crash evaluation .
This car 's seats and head restraints are rated marginal for protection against whiplash injury .
A change to good would have earned the Camry a Top Safety Pick for 2010 . "

Where 's Toyota 's explanation for why the Camry failed to garner a Top Safety Pick this year ?
It certainly was n't the more - stringent roof crush test .

Members of the Cork city fire brigade transport doctors and nurses to the Mercy hospital
A STATE of emergency was declared in Cork last night after the ESB was forced to open dams which led to widespread flooding in the city .
ESB chiefs defended their actions , claiming they prevented an even greater flood from occurring .
But business and homeowners said they had little warning ahead of the flood that left three buildings in danger of collapse .
The ESB released " large volumes of water " from the dams at Inniscarra and Carrigadrohid , about eight miles from the city centre .
A spokeswoman said that the issue of compensation for flooded homes and business premises " does n't even arise " .
" The action taken by the ESB mitigated damage very , very significantly , by at least a third , by managing the release of the water , " she said .
Earlier , an ESB spokesman said it was not their responsibility to inform the residents of Cork city that they were releasing massive volumes of water from a dam .
He said : " It is not the ESB 's role to manage an emergency situation like the rain or weather . "
He said it was not up to the ESB to inform residents , but up to the emergency services .
Around 700 local authority workers were evacuated from the iconic County Hall , one of the country 's tallest buildings , after they became marooned by rising floodwaters .
A spokesperson for Cork County Council was unavailable last night .
Swollen waters ripped through a quay wall and caused damage to their foundations .
Three hundred students were evacuated from University College , Cork , and in surrounding residences after flooding damaged 14 of the campus buildings .
A total of 43 residents of the 100 - year - old buildings at Grenville Place , opposite the Mercy Hospital , were evacuated and housed in temporary accommodation as city engineers assessed the damage .
Emergency workers had to ferry nurses and other staff to the Mercy Hospital to ensure patients were looked after .
Counting the cost of the devastation begins today as the Emergency Task Force meets to co-ordinate the response to the flooding disaster .
Taoiseach Brian Cowen , Environment Minister John Gormley , and senior government officials met at the purpose - built National Emergency Co-ordination Centre for the first time ever yesterday .
Compensation
Mr Gormley , who visited Cork last night and is in Galway this morning , said it was " far too early " to consider compensation and stressed that " insurance companies have a heavy responsibility " .
He said the Government will look " sympathetically " on the cost of the repair of damaged infrastructure .
But he has given no specifics on a relief fund for affected families and businesses .
And while insurance companies insisted it will be weeks before the full financial impact of the damage is known , one industry source said costs would far exceed the € 100 m paid out after the August 2008 flooding .
Although the clean - up got under way yesterday , residents were told to brace themselves for another deluge .
In a single day , 1,042 insurance claims were lodged with the country 's biggest insurer Hibernian Aviva -- most of them relating to flood damage .
The Defence Forces have been working around the clock .
Over 100 soldiers , 15 trucks , and four flat - bottomed boats helped to evacuate those stranded in Cork City and county , Ennis , Clonmel , and Ballinasloe yesterday .
The water supply to up to 50,000 people was cut off in Cork after fears that Lee pumping station had been contaminated .
Emergency water supplies were ferried to resident of Ballyvolane , Blackpool , Holly Hill , Gurraghnabraher , and the South Douglas Road via tanker .
At 10 am yesterday , workers in ESB began to contact residents in the catchment of the dams , the local authorities and local media , to warn them of the fast rising water .
However , some residents in the city said they received no prior warning .
Dr Con Murphy , whose surgery is on Lancaster Quay in the city , said his offices were under two feet of water .
" My problem is that had I known this was coming I could have helped save some of the stuff from being destroyed , " he said .
" I'm there over 30 years and this is the first time ever there was flooding . "
He said he had " no idea " the water was coming and while he " absolutely " accepted that the ESB had to release the water , he was annoyed that more warning was n't given .
The ESB spokeswoman said the release of the flood water was " ongoing " throughout the day .
Cork Business Association ( CBA ) said it had never experienced such devastation as when a city quay wall collapsed - diverting an entire channel of the River Lee down one of the city 's busiest shopping streets .
North Main Street - packed with boutiques , cafes , pubs and general shops - was left under almost three feet of water at one point .
On the Western Road , a car ended up crashing through the front door of a café after getting caught in the flood torrent .
Cork 's Lord Mayor , councillor Dara Murphy , said the scale of damage yesterday was " absolutely devastating " .

BAGHDAD  Iraq ’s Baghdad Trade Fair ended Tuesday , six years and a trillion dollars after the American invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein , and one country was conspicuously absent .
That would be the country that spent a trillion dollars  on the invasion and occupation , but also on training and equipping Iraqi security forces , and on ambitious reconstruction projects in every province aimed at rebuilding the country and restarting the economy .
Yet when the post - Saddam Iraqi government swept out its old commercial fairgrounds and invited companies from around the world , the United States was not much in evidence among the 32 nations represented .
Of the 396 companies that exhibited their wares , “ there are two or three American participants , but I ca n’t remember their names , ” said Hashem Mohammed Haten , director general of Iraq ’s state fair company .
A pair of missiles atop a ceremonial gateway to the fairgrounds recalled an era when Saddam Hussein had pretensions , if not weapons , of mass destruction .
The trade fair is a telling indication of an uncomfortable truth : America ’s war in Iraq has been good for business in Iraq  but not necessarily for American business .
Apple has a healthy R&D budget for a company of its size and spends quite a bit of time patenting interesting technology .
Sometimes the technology ends up in future products and sometimes it does n't , but the patents always give us a glimpse into what directions Apple is heading .
A recently published patent application for a 3D display that automatically adjusts its view based on the position of the viewer 's head is one such patent .
In " Systems and Methods for Adjusting a Display Based on the User 's Position , " Apple proposes a display that can automatically adjust the point of view and angle of 3D objects , or even 2D objects arranged in 3D space , based on the changing position of the viewer in relation to the display .
Example : imagine you are viewing some 3D object on your monitor .
A sensor could let the computer know when you move your head to the left , and the object would subtly change position and / or rotation so you could see the left side of the object .
Alternatively , you could move your head up so you could see the top better .
The same technique could be used to display 2D objects arranged in 3D space .
Apple uses the example of windows on the desktop ; suppose one window is obscuring details on the window below it .
Moving your head to one side or the other could change the relative positions enough to see whatever details are hidden .
A further refinement to the technique would involve using the sensor to evaluate the environment of the viewer to create more realistic views of 3D objects .
It could map lighting sources and reflections onto the surfaces of 3D objects , giving them an appearance as if they were part of the user 's environment .
A nearby lamp could cast a warm glow on an object , or the user and her surroundings might be reflected in polished surface .
AppleInsider notes that Apple has a history of researching 3D and spatially - oriented interface elements , such as an auto - stereoscopic display , a three - dimensional interface for Mac OS X , and experiments with Wiimote - like controls for the Apple TV .
MacRumors also demonstrates that Apple 's interest in " hyper reality " goes back as far as 1995 .
Less exciting , perhaps , are some recent patents for interface refinements for iPods or iPhones .
One patent describes methods for automatically learning usage patterns for media files and adjusting to user preferences when playing back those files .
Apple offers two examples of how this might work .
For instance , if you usually skip forward past a particular section of a song or movie , that section could be remembered and automatically skipped in the future .
Also , the frequency of listing to particular songs could be used to adjust the " graphical representation " of the songs displayed in the interface , such as displaying more frequently listened to tracks in a larger or bolder font .
Another patent describes an interface to warn users when playback of a certain file may drain the battery in a portable device , perhaps offering options to optimize playback to extend the life of the battery .
If you want to playback a 45 - minute episode of " Buffy the Vampire Slayer " but only have 30 minutes of juice left based on your current settings , then the device would display a warning .
It may also offer to dim the backlight , play a lower - resolution file , or some combination of the two to ensure enough playback time for the whole episode .
Neither of these iPod- related patents are as cool as an automatically adjusted 3D display , to be sure , but they show us that Apple is always looking for better ways to do things — even if it's as simple as picking your favorite song out of a list .
In Oslo , Norway , the second KOffice developer sprint this year has started .
The KOffice developers must be getting used to seeing each other regularly - besides the two sprints there were many other meetings and events with a handful of KOffice developers present .
However , their ' own ' sprints still are special - dedicated to some team building , designing and hard work in a cooperative and positive atmosphere .
Inge assembles the agenda

Topics
The Agenda on the wiki contains some info on the goals of this meeting .
The topics could be split up in three distinct areas : for the developers , the users and the wider world .
The wider world
KOffice is quickly becoming a player in the world of commercial software development , and this means that besides the interested individuals , larger teams and organisations are getting involved in development .
The inherent and incidental differences between what the companies and the community want have to be balanced , discussed , and agreed upon .
This is relatively new for the KOffice community .
For a long time they could decide among themselves what to do , keeping only the users in mind .
Now , commercial interests have a role to play .
It is important to keep the community close to the commercial work and vice versa , solve potential conflicts , communicate openly , and involve both parties in decision making .
This is a challenge .
Other teams within the KDE community have been going through this process , shown it is doable - but it can be a rocky road .
The KOffice team wants to discuss this , gather opinions , and be prepared .
Development
The developers , meanwhile , have something else to discuss as well : the KOffice libraries .
Now external parties are picking them up , essentially realizing the ambitious 2.0 plans , it is time to have a close look at them .
Since the 2.0 release the libraries have been largely ignored - lots of work was spent on finishing the user interface and bringing back the many features requested by users .
However currently there are no guarantees in the area of source and even binary compatibility .
This means using the KOffice libraries is much harder for external parties .
If the KOffice team really wants to fulfill on their promise to create a generic ODF library for Qt / KDE , to be a framework for all kinds of document editing applications and become an important infrastructural part of for example a prominent phone stack , their libraries and especially their API needs to be top - notch .
There will be presentations on library design , metadata and other technical topics , including a move to the Git sourcecode management tool .
Thursday night food Thursday night food
Next release
The last but not least important topic for the meeting this weekend is the upcoming 2.2 release .
The team needs to discuss the release schedule , and plan on getting the release ready for end users .
A clear list of tasks which have to be accomplished and bugs which have to be solved is crucial to guarantee the quality of the upcoming release .
Furthermore , the future KOffice releases will be discussed .
What will the release schedule for the coming versions be , what roadmap is realistic yet challenging , where does the team want to be in a few years from now ?
The first day
The location for the meeting is the former Trolltech office in Oslo - now fully Nokia branded .
Starting time was 9:00 , with an opening from Inge which he used to discuss and decide upon the agenda .
After that the first topic , Git migration , started .
The final decision was to move to Git as soon as possible , but there are some issues to work out .
Basically converting KOffice to Git has been done and it is ready to Gitorious .
However , some subversion branches still need to be converted , a couple of scripts have to be written and of course the whole team needs Gitorious accounts .
The next topic was the release schedule for 2.2 and onwards .
Possible schedules like a 4 month schedule , always - summer - in - trunk and other schemes , in part made possible thanks to the planned Git migration , were discussed .
Nokia working with KOffice team
After the technical discussions , Suresh Chande , Product Manager at Nokia gave a presentation on what Nokia is doing with KOffice .
Nokia has developed a testset of 750 special test documents which will be released soon for testing KOffice and other OpenDocument compatible office suites .
Furthermore , Nokia testers have been testing KOffice and created a list of 600 high quality bugreports they want to share with the community and fix together .
Besides Suresh , visiting Maemo developers Lassi and Mani introduced themselves to the team and joined the discussion , collecting feedback from the KOffice team on various things like coordinating development and planning on KOffice features for the next version .
One decision made was to put the Fremantle user interface ( in the Maemo version currently on the N900 ) in the KOffice source repository .
This GUI will be released by Nokia soon .
Another bit of news was that Suresh will provide 5 N900s to KOffice developers , and the team has to decide who gets one .
More talks
Table tennis during lunch
Table tennis during lunch
After a lengthy discussion about decision making and arbitration , it was time for Olivier Goffhart .
Olivier , Kopete developer , KDE libs developer and Nokia Qt Development Frameworks employee gave a talk about developing libraries , diving deeper into technology .
Why would you put something in a library ?
Olivier considers consistency as one of the most important reasons for that .
He further went through various other issues like designing easy to use API 's , maintaining compatibility et cetera .
The talk ended in a lengthy discussion about libraries and code .
This topic was clearly not done yet , so once lunch was done the developers continued on this track .
After a few hours and some cookies brought by Thomas Zander the team had settled for relatively quiet hacking until it was time for food .
Ending the day
While the day is not over as this is being written , plan was to have dinner together - Pizza always results in a good time .
Then some will surely want beer , while others might prefer sleep .
And the Krita team has planned a meetup at the hotel to finish some discussions .
Tomorrow is another day !
Conclusion
As you see , the KOffice development team faces some serious long and short term decisions .
A face to face meeting is often the best place to decide upon such crucial issues and the team seems to be excited to get going .
This morning has been spend on laying out the plans for the weekend , and your author must say they seem challenging .
It is clear that KOffice however is in capable hands .
The attending team combines a strong vision and great development and design skills with a cooperative spirit and an incredible work ethic .
By GRAIN , October 2009
Take one example .
In August 2009 , the government of Mauritius , through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , got a long - term lease for 20,000 ha of good farmland in Mozambique to produce rice for the Mauritian market .
This is outsourced food production , no question .
But it is not the government of Mauritius , on behalf of the Mauritian people , that is going to farm that land and ship the rice back home .
Instead , the Mauritian minister of agro industry immediately sub -leased the land to two corporations , one from Singapore ( which is anxious to develop the market for its proprietary hybrid rice seeds in Africa ) and one from Swaziland ( which specialises in cattle production , but is also involved in biofuels in southern Africa ) .
[ 2 ]
This is typical .
And it means that we should not be blinded by the involvement of states .
Because at the end of the day , what the corporations want will be decisive .
And they have a war chest of legal , financial and political tools to assist them .
With all the talk about " food security , " and distorted media statements like " South Korea leases half of Madagascar 's land , " [ 1 ] it may not be evident to a lot of people that the lead actors in today 's global land grab for overseas food production are not countries or governments but corporations .
So much attention has been focused on the involvement of states , like Saudi Arabia , China or South Korea .
But the reality is that while governments are facilitating the deals , private companies are the ones getting control of the land .
And their interests are simply not the same as those of governments .
GRAIN has tried to look more closely at who the private sector investors currently taking over farmlands around the world for offshore food production really are .
From what we have gathered , the role of finance capital -- investment funds and companies -- is truly significant .
We have therefore constructed a table to share this picture .
Moreover , there 's a tendency to assume that private - sector involvement in the global land grab amounts to traditional agribusiness or plantation companies , like Unilever or Dole , simply expanding the contract farming model of yesterday .
In fact , the high - power finance industry , with little to no experience in farming , has emerged as a crucial corporate player .
So much so that the very phrase " investing in agriculture " , today 's mantra of development bureaucrats , should not be understood as automatically meaning public funds .
It is more and more becoming the business of … big business .
" What started as a government drive to secure cheap food resource has now become a viable business model and many Gulf companies are venturing into agricultural investments to diversify their portfolios . "
The table outlines over 120 investment structures , most of them newly created , which are busy acquiring farmland overseas in the aftermath of the financial crisis .
[ 3 ]
Their engagement , whether materialised or targeted , rises into the tens of billions of dollars .
The table is not exhaustive , however .
It provides only a sample of the kinds of firms or instruments involved , and the levels of investment they are aiming for .
Private investors are not turning to agriculture to solve world hunger or eliminate rural poverty .
They want profit , pure and simple .
And the world has changed in ways that now make it possible to make big money from farmland .
From the investors ’ perspective , global food needs are guaranteed to grow , keeping food prices up and providing a solid basis for returns on investment for those who control the necessary resource base .
And that resource base , particularly land and water , is under stress as never before .
In the aftermath of the financial crisis , so - called alternative investments , such as infrastructure or farmland , are all the rage .
Farmland itself is touted as providing a hedge against inflation .
And because its value does n't go up and down in sync with other assets like gold or currencies , it allows investors to successfully diversify their portfolios .
“ We are not farmers .
We are a large company that uses state - of - the - art technology to produce high - quality soybean .
The same way you have shoemakers and computer manufacturers , we produce agricultural commodities . ”
-- Laurence Beltrão Gomes of SLC Agrícola , the largest farm company in Brazil
But it 's not just about land , it 's about production .
Investors are convinced that they can go into Africa , Asia , Latin America and the former Soviet bloc to consolidate holdings , inject a mix of technology , capital and management skills , lay down the infrastructures and transform below - potential farms into large - scale agribusiness operations .
In many cases , the goal is to generate revenue streams both from the harvests and from the land itself , whose value they expect to go up .
It is a totally corporate version of the Green Revolution , and their ambitions are big .
" My boss wants to create the first Exxon Mobil of the farming sector , " said Joseph Carvin of Altima Partners ’ One World Agriculture Fund to a gathering of global farmland investors in New York in June 2009 .
No wonder , then , that governments , the World Bank and the UN want to be associated with this .
But it is not their show .
" I ’m convinced that farmland is going to be one of the best investments of our time .
Eventually , of course , food prices will get high enough that the market probably will be flooded with supply through development of new land or technology or both , and the bull market will end .
But that ’s a long ways away yet . "
– George Soros , June 2009
Today 's emerging new farm owners are private equity fund managers , specialised farmland fund operators , hedge funds , pension funds , big banks and the like .
The pace and extent of their appetite is remarkable – but unsurprising , given the scramble to recover from the financial crisis .
Consolidated data are lacking , but we can see that billions of dollars are going into farmland acquisitions for a growing number of " get rich quick " schemes .
And some of those dollars are hard - earned retirement savings of teachers , civil servants and factory workers from countries such as the US or the UK .
This means that a lot of ordinary citizens have a financial stake in this trend , too , whether they are aware of it or not .
It also means that a new , powerful lobby of corporate interests is coming together , which wants favourable conditions to facilitate and protect their farmland investments .
They want to tear down burdensome land laws that prevent foreign ownership , remove host - country restrictions on food exports and get around any regulations on genetically modified organisms .
For this , we can be sure that they will be working with their home governments , and various development banks , to push their agendas around the globe through free trade agreements , bilateral investment treaties and donor conditionalities .
" When asked whether a transfer of foreign , ' superior ' , agricultural technology would be welcome compensation for the acquisition of Philippine lands , the farmers from Negros Occidental responded with a general weariness and unequivocal retort that they were satisfied with their own knowledge and practices of sustainable , diverse and subsistence - based farming .
Their experience of high - yielding variety crops , and the chemical - intensive technologies heralded by the Green Revolution , led them to the conclusion that they were better off converting to diverse , organic farming , with the support of farmer - scientist or member organisations such as MASIPAG and PDG Inc. " – Theodora Tsentas , " Foreign state - led land acquisitions and neocolonialism : A qualitative case study of foreign agricultural development in the Philippines " , September 2009
Indeed , the global land grab is happening within the larger context of governments , both in the North and the South , anxiously supporting the expansion of their own transnational food and agribusiness corporations as the primary answer to the food crisis .
The deals and programs being promoted today all point to a restructuring and expansion of the industrial food system , based on capital - intensive large - scale monocultures for export markets .
While that may sound " old hat " , several things are new and different .
For one , the infrastructure needs for this model will be dealt with .
( The Green Revolution never did that . )
New forms of financing , as our table makes plain , are also at the base of it .
Thirdly , the growing protagonism of corporations and tycoons from the South is also becoming more important .
US and European transnationals like Cargill , Tyson , Danone and Nestlé , which once ruled the roost , are now being flanked by emerging conglomerates such as COFCO , Olam , Savola , Almarai and JBS . [ 4 ]
A recent report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development pointed out that a solid 40 % of all mergers and acquisitions in the field of agricultural production last year were South–South .
[ 5 ]
To put it bluntly , tomorrow 's food industry in Africa will be largely driven by Brazilian , Chinese and Arab Gulf capital .
Exporting food insecurity
Given the heavy role of the private sector in today 's land grabs , it is clear that these firms are not interested in the kind of agriculture that will bring us food sovereignty .
And with hunger rising faster than population growth , it will not likely do much for food security , either .
One farmers ’ leader from Synérgie Paysanne in Benin sees these land grabs as fundamentally " exporting food insecurity " .
For they are about answering some people 's needs – for maize or money – by taking food production resources away from others .
He is right , of course .
In most cases , these investors are themselves not very experienced in running farms .
And they are bound , as the coordinator of MASIPAG in the Philippines sees it , to come in , deplete the soils of biological life and nutrients through intensive farming , pull out after a number of years and leave the local communities with " a desert " .
" Entire communities have been dispossessed of their lands for the benefit of foreign investors .
(…)
Land must remain a community heritage in Africa . " – N'Diogou Fall , ROPPA ( West African Network of Producers and Peasant Organisations ) , June 2009
The talk about channelling this sudden surge of dollars into an agenda for resolving the global food crisis could be seen as quirky if it were not downright dangerous .
From the United Nations headquarters in New York to the corridors of European capitals , everyone is talking about making these deals " win–win " .
All we need to do , the thinking goes , is agree on a few parameters to moralise and discipline these land grab deals , so that they actually serve local communities , without scaring investors off .
The World Bank even wants to create a global certification scheme and audit bureau for what could become " sustainable land grabbing " , along the lines of what 's been tried with oil palm , forestry or other extractive industries .
Before jumping on the bandwagon of " win–win " , it would be wise to ask " With whom ?
Who are the investors ?
What are their interests ? "
It is hard to believe that , with so much money on the line , with so much accumulated social experience in dealing with mass land concessions and conversions in the past , whether from mining or plantations , and given the central role of the finance and agribusiness industries here , these investors would suddenly play fair .
Just as hard to believe is that governments or international agencies would suddenly be able to hold them to account .
“ Some companies are interested in buying agricultural land for sugar cane and then selling it on the international markets .
It ’s business , nothing more ”
Sharad Pawar , India 's minister of agriculture , rejecting claims that his government is supporting a new colonisation of African farmland , June 28 , 2009
Making these investments work is simply not the right starting point .
Supporting small farmers efforts for real food sovereignty is .
Those are two highly polarised agendas and it would be mistaken to pass off one for the other .
It is crucial to look more closely at who the investors are and what they really want .
But it is even more important to put the search for solutions to the food crisis on its proper footing .

Demographers have described Chicago as a ' ' hyper - segregated ' ' city where blacks and whites are less likely to live on the same block -- or encounter each other on the sidewalk -- than almost anywhere else in the country .
Chicago 's Roman Catholic archbishop , Cardinal Francis George , confronted this problem in a powerful pastoral letter last spring .
He admonished priests , nuns and lay people who had refused '' to welcome even Catholic African Americans into parishes and schools . ''
The letter was issued last April -- just a month before Chicago , the third - largest city in the country , experienced an act of racial exclusion that seemed like something out of the distant past .
St. Sabina , a black Catholic parish , was denied membership in the Southside Catholic Conference , an athletic league made up of 21 white Catholic parishes .
The league initially rejected St. Sabina on the grounds that its neighborhood , which is within walking distance of some other league members , was unsafe for whites .
The black parish was eventually allowed to join , but withdrew abruptly last week citing what its fiery pastor , the Rev. Michael Pfleger , has described as ' ' racist ' ' treatment .
His rhetoric angered the archdiocese , which already viewed Father Pfleger as an inflammatory figure .
This year , St. Sabina says , its team was required to play some away games at '' neutral ' ' sites because some schools did not want its students on their premises .
Tension heightened when the league invoked questionable rules that disqualified some St. Sabina players .
When St. Sabina accused a boy from another school of using a racial slur during a game , the league failed to follow its own mediation procedures , which require a meeting between the parents of the children involved .
Frustrated and fearful , the St. Sabina parents voted unanimously to leave the league .
Chicago 's history of segregation and racial hostility has given this event a symbolic importance that goes well beyond sports .
Cardinal George , Father Pfleger and the South Side Catholic Conference need to cool the rhetoric and do their best to restore integration to the parish league .
If white Catholics and black Catholics cannot make peace long enough for their children to play together , the prospects for reconciliation will seem dimmer for us all .
Editor 's note :
We published a new version of this story with updated information on Feb. 26 , 2010 .
Read our more recent report , " GOP health care reform : A simple explanation , updated . "
With the House of Representatives nearing a vote on the Democrats ' health care reform bill , Republicans this week unveiled their own version , a much smaller bill ( 219 pages vs. the Democrats ' 1,990 ) with a more limited scope .
It relies on bedrock GOP principles of consumer choice , no tax hikes , limited government involvement and caps on lawsuits .
But it would have limited impact .
Where the Democratic bill is projected to reduce the number of uninsured people by 36 million by 2019 , the GOP bill would reduce it by only 3 million .
We examined the Democratic plans with our article , Health care reform : A simple explanation , so here we 'll take a similar look at the Republican bill .
Here 's an overview of the Republican plan and how it differs from the Democratic version :
• More limited reach for the federal government .
This is perhaps the biggest difference between the two bills .
Consistent with Republican complaints that the Democratic bills represents a government " takeover " of health care , the GOP bill has no public option — that is , no government - run insurance program , or anything remotely like it .
Nor does the GOP bill include an expansion of the federal - state Medicaid health insurance program for the poor .
The House Democratic bill has both .
The GOP plan has no health care exchange , the government - run marketplace for people who are now uninsured , and it has no Health Choices commissioner , the new post that would run the exchange .
And consistent with Republican fears of government moving toward a system of deciding what treatments patients can receive , the GOP plan , unlike both the House and Senate Democratic bills , does not foster " comparative effectiveness " research that tries to determine which treatments are the most effective .
• No new taxes .
Living up to a key Republican principle , the GOP bill would not impose any new taxes .
By contrast , the House Democratic bill would impose a surtax of 5.4 percent on married couples earning in excess of $ 1 million annually , or individuals making more than $ 500,000 a year .
Under the Senate Finance Committee bill , certain health plans that offer comparatively generous benefits would be taxed .
Those taxes would go to subsidies to help low - income people buy health insurance and other health care expansions .
• No cuts to Medicare .
Republicans , who have seized on proposed Democratic cuts to Medicare Advantage , would not touch the government health care plan for senior citizens .
By contrast , both Democratic bills would cut Medicare Advantage and reduce the growth in Medicare payments by a total of roughly $ 400 billion over 10 years .
Many of these cuts would involve Advantage plans , which are private plans operating under the Medicare system .
These plans are reimbursed by the federal government at a higher rate , and Republicans maintain that seniors who belong to these plans would see reductions in benefits under the proposed cuts .
But Democrats seeking places to cut costs see Medicare Advantage plans as a target , arguing that they are essentially subsidized to an unnecessary degree by regular Medicare beneficiaries and ordinary taxpayers .
They have said the cuts in the growth of Medicare payments will not hurt benefits .
• Medical malpractice reform .
Republicans have long sought to curb medical malpractice lawsuits , which they say needlessly raise health care costs .
The Republican bill curbs malpractice lawsuits by capping noneconomic and punitive damages and making changes in the allocation of liability .
The Democratic bill does not .
• Favoring consumer choice over a guaranteed safety net and minimum benefits .
The Republican plan would try to expand coverage and reduce costs voluntarily , primarily by increasing consumer options , rather than the Democratic method of using government leverage ( such as mandates , penalties and subsidies ) to corral more uninsured Americans into obtaining coverage .
The Republican bill would allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines , something that is currently not allowed , and would allow small businesses to pool insurance coverage through trade associations , an option only allowed for larger companies and labor unions today .
The bill would also expand the use of health savings accounts , which allow allow people to use pre-tax dollars to pay medical expenses .
None of these programs would be mandatory .
Finally , the Republican bill would offer aid to states to establish " high - risk pools , " groups of sicker ( and thus more expensive ) patients who typically have trouble finding insurance today because of restrictions on pre-existing conditions .
It would also boost state - based reinsurance mechanisms that can help insurers that find it too costly to insure such pools .
Democrats , by contrast , would make a more strong - armed effort to reduce the uninsured .
Whereas the Republican bill would offer incentive payments to states that manage to reduce premiums and the number of uninsured , Democrats would make everyone purchase insurance coverage or else pay a stiff penalty if they do n't .
Businesses of a certain size would also have to provide health coverage for their workers or face a penalty .
And the Democratic bill would establish minimum benefit packages and expand existing safety net programs such as Medicaid .
The Congressional Budget Office , a nonpartisan group that estimates the cost of legislation , has confirmed that the bill is quite inexpensive in comparison to the Democratic approach .
The CBO found that the insurance provisions of the Republican bill would cost about $ 61 billion between 2010 and 2019 — a far cry from the $ 1.06 trillion cost during the same period under the Democratic bill .
But when new revenues and spending cuts are factored in , the Democratic bill would reduce the deficit by $ 104 billion over 10 years , compared with $ 68 billion for the Republican bill .
The CBO also confirmed that the cost of health insurance premiums would fall under the Republican plan , partly because of the medical malpractice reforms .
In the market for individually purchased insurance policies , premiums would fall by 5 percent to 8 percent by 2016 .
For smaller businesses , premiums would fall by 7 percent to 10 percent .
And in the large group market , for larger employers , they would fall by up to 3 percent .
Critics have focused on a few aspects of the bill :
• It does n't do much to reduce the uninsured population .
By 2019 , the number of uninsured would drop by 3 million , leaving 52 million nonelderly Americans uninsured .
That means 83 percent of legal non-elderly residents would have insurance coverage by 2019 , roughly the same as it is today .
The comparable coverage rate for the Democratic bill is 96 percent .
The Democratic plan would reduce the uninsured by 36 million , leaving 18 million without coverage .
• It might reduce consumer protections .
The flip side of several of the Republicans ' new consumer options is a decrease in regulation .
If insurance policies are sold across state lines , critics say , there could be an incentive for insurers to locate in the least - regulated states , allowing them to scale back coverage .
And the Republican bill , unlike the Democratic bills , does n't specifically bar insurers from excluding pre-existing conditions , even though that policy has broad support in both parties .
• Its idea of boosting high - risk pools for sicker patients may not be effective .
The states that have tried high - risk pools in the past have not found them to be popular , largely due to the high costs for the consumer .
In theory , experts say , such pools could be subsidized enough to make premiums low enough to be attractive .
But it would be expensive to do so , and many experts say the Republican bill does n't provide enough money to make them work .
The Republican plan calls for $ 25 billion in funding through 2019 .
• It misses an opportunity to trim Medicare spending .
Health care experts have long pointed to the need to rein in the growth of Medicare spending , because if nothing is done , it could eventually eat up an enormous share of the federal budget .
The Republicans ' current stance of protecting Medicare Advantage may be politically popular among senior citizens , but critics say it allows the most generously reimbursed portion of the Medicare system to continue unabated , effectively delaying the fiscal day of reckoning for the program .
( While the Democrats do propose cutting Medicare Advantage , and while they would impose permanent reductions in certain payment rates to the tune of $ 229 billion over 10 years , some critics have called their approach too timid as well . )

Advertisement Clashes between police and protesters continued overnight in Athens as it marked the first anniversary of the fatal police shooting of a teenager .
Riot police fired volleys of tear gas and fought running street battles with demonstrators who pelted them with rocks and set fire to rubbish bins .
However , the protests have been nothing like the riot scenes of last year , a BBC correspondent says .
Six thousand police have been deployed on the streets of the Greek capital .
At one point about 200 masked demonstrators were holed up in Athens 's neoclassical university building , smashing marble chunks off the steps to use as missiles against police .
AT THE SCENE Malcolm Brabant , BBC News , Athens Police officers corralled demonstrators into restricted areas and denied them the chance to run amok .
Snatch squads on motorbikes roamed the streets and carried out a number of arrests .
Some officers were pulled from their machines , and there were reports of bike riding policemen lashing out at people with their truncheons .
The government has carried out a number of reforms designed to give the police a more human face .
But these clashes will not have won them any friends amongst Greek youths .
Many young people , who had their first taste of rebellion last year , remain angry with the authorities .
The overwhelming perception of teenagers and university students is that the force remains institutionally violent .
In pictures : Greek violence City officials said the university dean suffered head injuries when youths raided the building and was rushed to hospital .
Clashes also continued overnight at Athens Polytechnic , where masked youths emerged to hurl rocks and bottles at police , who responded with tear gas .
Earlier in Thessaloniki - Greece 's second - largest city - demonstrators threw petrol bombs at police and smashed the storefront of a Starbucks cafe , Associated Press reported .
To head off trouble , riot police carried out a series of raids on Saturday across Athens , arresting more than 150 people , reports said .
The BBC's Malcolm Brabant in Athens says they have been forming snatch squads to deal with breakaway groups apparently intent on causing damage .
Greece 's government warned it would have a zero tolerance policy towards violence .
" We want to send a clear message , we wo n't tolerate a repeat of the violence and terror scene in central Athens , we wo n't hand Athens to vandals , " said Citizen Protection Minister Mihalis Chrysohoidis .
Memorial service Family and friends of teenager Alexandros Grigoropoulos held a memorial service in the Exarchia district of Athens on Sunday evening to mark a year since his killing .
At one point an anarchist group took over buildings at Athens University
They appealed for calm , but posters had appeared in the capital saying : " We wo n't forget , we wo n't forgive . "
On Saturday , two cars were set alight in the Exarchia .

Mind Control - The BITE Model From chapter two of Releasing the Bonds : Empowering People to Think for Themselves
© 2000 by Steven Hassan - published by Freedom of Mind Press , Somerville MA
Destructive mind control can be understood in terms of four basic components , which form the acronym BITE :
I. Behavior Control II .
Information Control III .
Thought Control IV .
Emotional Control
I. Behavior Control
1. Regulation of individuals physical reality a .
Where , how and with whom the member lives and associates with
b . What clothes , colors , hairstyles the person wears
c. What food the person eats , drinks , adopts , and rejects
d . How much sleep the person is able to have
e. Financial dependence
f. Little or no time spent on leisure , entertainment , vacations
2. Major time commitment required for indoctrination sessions and group rituals
3 . Need to ask permission for major decisions
4 . Need to report thoughts , feelings and activities to superiors
5. Rewards and punishments ( behavior modification techniques - positive and negative ) .
5 . Individualism discouraged ; group think prevails
6. Rigid rules and regulations
7 . Need for obedience and dependency
II .
Information Control
1 . Use of deception a .
Deliberately holding back information
b. Distorting information to make it acceptable
c. Outright lying
2 . Access to non-cult sources of information minimized or discouraged
a. Books , articles , newspapers , magazines , TV , radio
b. Critical information
c. Former members
d. Keep members so busy they dont have time to think
3. Compartmentalization of information ; Outsider vs. Insider doctrines
a. Information is not freely accessible
b. Information varies at different levels and missions within pyramid
c. Leadership decides who " needs to know " what
4 . Spying on other members is encouraged
a. Pairing up with " buddy " system to monitor and control
b. Reporting deviant thoughts , feelings , and actions to leadership
5 . Extensive use of cult generated information and propaganda
a. Newsletters , magazines , journals , audio tapes , videotapes , etc .
b. Misquotations , statements taken out of context from non-cult sources
6. Unethical use of confession
a. Information about " sins " used to abolish identity boundaries
b. Past " sins " used to manipulate and control ; no forgiveness or absolution
III .
Thought Control
1 . Need to internalize the groups doctrine as " Truth "
a. Map = Reality
b. Black and White thinking
c. Good vs. evil
d. Us vs. them ( inside vs. outside )
2. Adopt " loaded " language ( characterized by " thought - terminating clichés " ) .
Words are the tools we use to think with .
These " special " words constrict rather than expand understanding .
They function to reduce complexities of experience into trite , platitudinous " buzz words " .
3 . Only " good " and " proper " thoughts are encouraged .
4 . Thought - stopping techniques ( to shut down " reality testing " by stopping " negative " thoughts and allowing only " good " thoughts ) ; rejection of rational analysis , critical thinking , constructive criticism .

2 . Make the person feel like if there are ever any problems it is always their fault , never the leaders or the groups .
3. Excessive use of guilt
a. Identity guilt
1 . Who you are ( not living up to your potential )
2 . Your family
3 . Your past
4 . Your affiliations
5 . Your thoughts , feelings , actions
b. Social guilt
c. Historical guilt
4. Excessive use of fear
a. Fear of thinking independently
b. Fear of the " outside " world
c. Fear of enemies
d. Fear of losing ones " salvation "
e. Fear of leaving the group or being shunned by group
f. Fear of disapproval
5. Extremes of emotional highs and lows .
6. Ritual and often public confession of " sins " .
7. Phobia indoctrination : programming of irrational fears of ever leaving the group or even questioning the leaders authority .
The person under mind control cannot visualize a positive , fulfilled future without being in the group .
a . No happiness or fulfillment " outside " of the group
b. Terrible consequences will take place if you leave : " hell " ; " demon possession " ; " incurable diseases " ; " accidents " ; " suicide " ; " insanity " ; " 10,000 reincarnations " ; etc .
c. Shunning of leave takers .
Fear of being rejected by friends , peers , and family .
d. Never a legitimate reason to leave .
From the groups perspective , people who leave are : " weak " ; " undisciplined " ; " unspiritual " ; " worldly " ; " brainwashed by family , counselors " ; seduced by money , sex , rock and roll .

How 's that " body image revolution " going for Glamour ?
Baby steps , but moving forward .

Fresh off a wave of positive publicity for its inclusion of non -size - zero models in its pages , Glamour editor Cindi Leive told New York magazine earlier this week , " We 've shot stories for every issue from now through February using fabulous plus - size models , and not just in our feature shoots , but also in fashion and beauty .
One of the plus - size models who was featured in our original story is in one of our two major fashion features in December , and looks amazing . "

This is good news for anyone who 's complained that " love your body " features in women 's magazines are relegated to well - meaning corners , near weight loss features yet sequestered from the pole - like , genetically - anomalous , and hungry types that are the standby .
So let 's take a look at this curvaceous lady in the major fashion shoot in the December issue .
Well , first you have to find her .
I paged through the December issue several times but then had to ask to have the plus sized model pointed out to me .
This is partly because model Amy Lemons , who also appeared in the November nude shoot , shares the pages with some relatively healthy - looking women ( for models ) .
It 's also because she appears to be , at most generous estimate , a size 8 .
The shoot is lovely — exuberant , colorful , even diverse .
But plus size ?
Really ?

Of course , Glamour itself admitted that the term was imperfect , in its November spread :
" At most modeling agencies , any girl larger than a size 4 might have trouble getting work because she wo n't fit the clothes , and over a size 6 she might be moved to the plus division , " says Glamour senior bookings editor Jennifer Koehler .

So what do you guys think ?
Does this count ?

C - 27 is the Canadian anti-spam bill that comes out of committee on Monday .
The opposition Liberals have proposed amendments which appear to have been drafted by copyright and telecom lobbyists .
They would allow for surreptitious installation of computer programs and – even more outrageously – would allow copyright owners to secretly access information on users ' computers .
The bill contains an anti-spyware provision , yet the Liberal motion would allow for the collection of personal information on a computer without authorization if the collection is related to a " investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada . "
Note that that is private sector surveillance , not the police .
On top of these provisions , the Liberals have also tabled motions to extend the exemptions for telecom providers including allow telecom providers to engage in a host of activities – right down to scanning for and removing computer programs – without permission .
With the hearing on Monday , it is critical for Canadians to speak out – yet again – to ensure that C - 27 does not leave the door open to private surreptitious surveillance .
NIAC Redux : A Visionary Future
The decision to close NASA ’s Institute for Advanced Concepts ( NIAC ) in 2007 was a blow to the research community , especially given the fact that the agency ’s Breakthrough Propulsion Physics project had been shelved some years previously .
These twin haymakers to the study of futuristic technologies emphasized the lack of support for spending money on anything beyond the near - term , and reminded us that forty years after the fact , we still ca n’t manage even a return to the Moon .
NIAC seemed to offer better .
Established in 1998 , the Atlanta - based program offered non-NASA scientists a chance to delve into revolutionary space and aeronautics concepts , with a multi-tiered funding strategy and the potential for the best ideas to receive further study within the agency ( or in a number of cases , from sources outside it ) .
NIAC was hardly a budget - breaker , totalling $ 36.2 million spread across the nine years of its existence .
A New Report Looks at Invigorating Research
Now we have a new report on NIAC ’s effectiveness and possible future iterations , one commissioned by the NASA administrator and performed by the National Research Council .
Fostering Visions for the Future : A Review of the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts is available online , either readable there or ( the better choice ) via a quick download .
The report takes a critical look at the current situation :
In the 1980s , under the pressure of limited budgets , NASA retreated from its exciting , risk - taking , high - technology culture .
At present , its big programs , all very costly , relate either to continued low - Earth - orbit human spaceflight with little cutting - edge technology involved , or to the planned return of humans to the Moon in a manner that looks remarkably like the Apollo program with an infusion of existing 21st - century technology .
Today , NASA ’s investment in advanced concepts and long - term technological solutions to its strategic goals is minimal .
What to do ?
Getting research on longer - term technologies back into the NASA playbook is critical .
NIAC not only sparked ideas , but led to solid results .
The program supported 126 phase I studies and 42 Phase II studies in the course of its brief existence , and about 29 percent of the Phase II efforts went on to secure additional funding from NASA and other sources .
The NIAC Web site , still available , offers the corpus of this work .
And the report highlights three projects that appear to have had an impact on NASA ’s long - term plans .
Mini-Magnetosphere Plasma Propulsion
We ’ve looked at M2P2 several times on this site , fascinated with Robert Winglee ’s work on using energy from space plasmas to accelerate payloads .
Winglee ’s team at the University of Washington used Phase II funding to perform laboratory tests on their proposed magnetic - inflation process and to confirm the effect , work that led to further evaluation at Marshall Space Flight Center .
Here ’s a quick precis from the report :
These experiments were able to quantify the performance of the prototype through comparative studies of the laboratory test results with the simulation results and provided strong evidence that the high thrust levels ( 1 - 3 N ) reported in the original description should be achievable for low energy input ( ~500 kW ) and low propellant consumption …
Further testing to measure the thrust levels attainable by the prototype , however , did not confirm measurable thrust .
In the 2001 to 2002 time frame , the M2P2 concept was considered a viable , emerging technology by the NASA Decadal Planning Team and the NASA Exploration Team .
Through peer review , the M2P2 effort was deemed highly innovative and technically competent .
In 2002 , a review panel that included plasma experts concluded there were additional unresolved technical issues that centered around magnet field strengths , mass , and power requirements .
While partially addressed by the M2P2 team , this work came to a stop due to changing priorities within the agency .
Micro-Arcsecond X-ray Imaging Mission
This is Webster Cash ’s work at the University of Colorado at Boulder .
Phase I work validated the idea of using an array of x-ray mirrors on free - flying spacecraft that would be coordinated to focus the x-rays on a set of beam - combining and detector spacecraft .
Additional work at MSFC was promising and the x-ray interferometry proposal went into Phase II funding , being incorporated in 2000 into NASA strategic plans .
From the report :
Dubbed MAXIM , the concept appeared in the NRC decadal survey of astronomy and astrophysics released in 2000 , which identified x-ray interferometry for $ 60 million in funding over the following 10 years .
Cash has selected as a long - range goal to image the event horizon of a black hole .
While the technical implementation remains extremely challenging , the fact that the laboratory demonstration of this capability was published in Nature testifies to the significance of this accomplishment .
Indeed .
The concept seems more than workable , and went on to further study :
NASA has continued support to further define and develop high - resolution x-ray imaging missions , and Cash ’s interferometry concept has remained among the leading contenders .
The MAXIM Pathfinder mission was the subject of a NASA Goddard Space Flight Center ( GSFC ) Integrated Mission Design Center study in 2002 .
In 2004 MAXIM received a $ 1 million 3 - year grant from NASA ’s Astronomy and Physics Research and Analysis Program to further develop the optics for this concept .
Today , the technology of x-ray interferometry that was the subject of the initial NIAC study is the first of three competing methods that NASA is pursuing under its Black Hole Imager mission .
New Worlds Observer
This again is a Webster Cash proposal , and one we ’ve examined under various names ( all incorporating ‘ New Worlds ’ ) on this site ( a search will pull these up ) .
Now we ’re into Terrestrial Planet Finder territory , with a project that was refined through NIAC funding to study pinhole camera and occulting mask designs for direct imaging of planetary systems around other stars .
This one also went into Phase II and the results were strong :
During Phase II , Cash and his collaborators demonstrated suppression performance ( reduction of starlight intensity ) < 10 - 7 in a laboratory test of a miniature occulter .
Both a publication in Nature in July 2006 and the laboratory demonstration testify to the significance and technical competence of the basic concept and the research supported by NIAC .
In fact , the various New Worlds designs Cash has studied make it clear that former NASA administrator Dan Goldin ’s dream of imaging and even mapping an extraterrestrial world is not out of the question in coming decades .
NASA liked this one a lot :
With the completion of the NIAC Phase II study , NASA provided significant additional support for Cash ’s occulter concept , and it is now one of the competitive concepts for the Terrestrial Planet Finder program .
In addition , both Ball Aerospace Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation have made internal investments to further develop the concept in conjunction with Cash and his team .
In February 2008 , NASA announced that a team led by Cash was awarded $ 1 million for the New Worlds Observer as one of its Astrophysics Strategic Missions Concept Studies ( ASMCS ) .
That study has been completed and the results will be used to prepare the New Worlds Observer mission concept for the NRC ’s Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey , Astro2010 .
Solid Results , and a Problem
While these three projects in particular stand out , it ’s interesting to see that fourteen Phase I and Phase II projects received an additional $ 23.8 million in funding from a wide range of organizations , demonstrating ( in the language of the report ) “ … the significance of the nation ’s investment in NIAC ’s advanced concepts . ”
The report also identifies a key problem :
One of the weaknesses of the NIAC program was the lack of sufficient funding to mature the selected concepts to the point that a NASA program could take substantial interest .
By design , NIAC concepts completing Phase II were certainly not at a technology readiness level that allowed adoption by a NASA flight program .
This technology - readiness disconnect between the external innovators and NASA program personnel made infusion of NIAC concepts into future agency missions or strategic plans exceedingly difficult .
The NRC report recommends that NASA reestablish an entity something like NIAC , recognizing that the agency needs open methods to secure access to new mission and system concepts from any source , and not just those developed within NASA .
The agency also needs to develop effective processes for evaluating new ideas for future missions and bringing these ideas to fruition .
A new program , the report calls it NIAC2 , would be a key to this .
Recognize this :
At present , there is no NASA organization responsible for soliciting , evaluating and developing advanced concepts and infusing them into NASA planning .
A new NIAC would help , but would it look like the old one ?
More on this tomorrow .
Last week , the president accused the Netherlands of letting the US military use Dutch islands off Venezuela 's Caribbean coast to prepare for a possible military offensive .
The former paratroop commander said the US military has sent intelligence agents , warships and spy planes to Aruba , Curaçao and Bonaire , which are self - governing Dutch islands .
The small Victorian town of Romsey has won its fight against the poker machines that were destined for the town 's only pub .
The Romsey Hotel won a licence for 30 poker machines but locals fought the decision all the way to the state 's highest court , arguing that poker machines would harm the town .
Nestled in the Macedon Ranges 50 minutes north of Melbourne , Romsey is a laid back , quiet town and locals want to keep it that way .
Their local pub was given the green light for 30 poker machines , but the community revolted , worried they would drain money from young families and businesses .
Since poker machines were first introduced in Victoria , local opposition to stop them has often proved futile , but the Romsey community won the support of Victoria 's Court of Appeal that ruled in March last year VCAT was wrong to ignore community opposition .
Today , VCAT president Justice Kevin Bell ruled any economic benefit of the machines would be far outweighed by their negative social impact .
" On the negative side there is the money which will go out of the town - about $ 2.1 million per annum - of which about 80 per cent will be from new gaming expenditure and the adverse effect on local businesses , " he said .
Residents elated
Sue Kirkegard is a Romsey resident who has helped spearhead the town 's five - year fight against the poker machines .
She says her neighbours will be thrilled with today 's decision .
" So many different people in town used to talk over coffee shops and down the street and at the supermarkets that they really did n't want the glitzy poker machines expenditure and activity in the town , " she said .
" It 's a fairly hard working , ordinary town , but it 's a small town and people do have a bit of care for how life affects each other , still not the big city kind of image . "
She says 30 poker machines would have had a big impact on the town .
" Thirty is a lot for a town the size of Romsey .
Romsey 's a country town , you go for walks and you go outside and you go for meals and at night it 's quiet - there 's no bright lights at midnight , " she said .
Ms Kirkegard says the decision should offer hope to other local communities fighting against big business .
" It is ordinary people who really do n't have much to do with courts and that sort of thing , " she said .
" Ordinary people , whether they have a say in what happens in their local area , how do they do that in relationship to gaming , that 's never been worked through except for this legislation . "
People gambling anyway
But the owner of the Romsey Hotel , Jim Hogan , says today 's decision will hurt local tourism and business .
" It was part of an overall development , a $ 5 million development which would have created approximately 30 full time employees , would 've extended the hotel , including cafes , restaurants , motel , function room , " he said .
Now , he says , that development cannot go ahead .
He says people will gamble anyway , just not at his pub .
" It 's integral , you know , so unfortunately I feel sorry for the population of Romsey the fact that those development dollars will be going to other hotels in the group , " he said .
" They 're gambling anyway .
My opponents have acknowledged that Romsey people , they gamble at one of my other venues at Wallan which is n't far away ... so the money is being spent and it's being outside the town . "
Mr Hogan says 65 per cent of the town supported his hotel 's redevelopment application .
He says it is strange for planning approvals to be decided on a popularity basis and says it holds massive implications for the gaming industry .
" It certainly calls into question the State Government 's 2012 gaming legislation .
There 'll be no new entrants into the market , " he said .
" It makes existing gaming venues monopolies in their area ; it makes them a lot more valuable .
" How the Government addresses that I 'm not sure .
It 's got implications I think to liquor and planning where residents can run a survey and oppose it on feelings of unhappiness . "
The parabolic trend is a curved trend line that captures the acceleration of price .
The trend will eventually develop into a vertical line , which is used to define the end of the rising trend .
The characteristic of the parabolic trend is that the trend collapses very rapidly when price moves to the right of the trend line .
The parabolic trend line is divided into three sections :
In the first section the parabolic trend is difficult to recognize .
In the second section of the parabolic trend the exit signal is a close below the value of the trend line .
The second section of this parabolic trend is currently developing .
The third section of the parabolic trend is more dangerous .
Here the exit signal is a move below the value of the parabolic trend line .
Additionally , there is always a time when the price has no choice .
Price will automatically move to the right of the trend line and signal the end of the trend .
When this develops , the trend collapses very quickly .
The plunge in the oil in 2008 after prices reached $ 140 was characteristic of this parabolic trend collapse .
This is the risk with the gold trend .
When the parabolic trend ends the gold price can move quickly towards support at $ 1,000 .
Generally the leverage impact with gold producers and explorers is about 3 to 1 .
This is an advantage when the gold price goes up .
When the price falls this leverage works in the opposite direction and causes a substantial and rapid decline in the price of gold producers and explorers .

( Rio de Janeiro ) - Police officers in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo routinely resort to lethal force , often committing extrajudicial executions and exacerbating violence in both states , Human Rights Watch said in a report released today .
The 122 - page report , " Lethal Force : Police Violence and Public Security in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo , " examined 51 cases in which police appeared to have executed alleged criminal suspects and then reported the victims had died in shootouts while resisting arrest .
Rio and São Paulo police together kill more than 1,000 people every year in such alleged confrontations .
While some of these " resistance " killings by police are legitimate acts of self - defense , many others are extrajudicial executions , the report found .
" Extrajudicial killing of criminal suspects is not the answer to violent crime , " said José Miguel Vivanco , Americas director at Human Rights Watch .
" The residents of Rio and São Paulo need more effective policing , not more violence from the police . "
Unlawful police killings undercut legitimate efforts in both states to curb criminal violence , much of which is carried out by heavily armed gangs .
In Rio , these gangs are largely responsible for one of the highest homicide rates in the hemisphere .
In São Paulo , despite a drop in homicides over the past decade , gang violence also poses a major threat .
Human Rights
Watch obtained credible evidence in 51 " resistance " cases that contradicted police officers ' claims that victims died in a shootout .
For example , in 33 cases , forensic evidence was at odds with the official version of what took place - including 17 cases in which autopsy reports show that police shot their victims at point blank range .
The 51 cases do not represent the totality of potential extrajudicial killings , but are indicative of a much broader problem , the report concluded .
The report also draws upon extensive interviews with more than 40 criminal justice officials , including top prosecutors who view extrajudicial executions by the police as a major problem in both states .
Official government statistics support the prosecutors ' assessment that the problem is widespread :
The Rio and São Paulo police have killed more than 11,000 people since 2003 ;
The number of police killings in Rio state reached a record high of 1,330 in 2007 and in 2008 , the number was third highest at 1,137 ;
The number of police killings in São Paulo state , while less than in Rio , is also comparatively high : over the past five years , for example , there were more police killings in São Paulo state ( 2,176 ) than in all of South Africa ( 1,623 ) , a country with a much higher homicide rate than São Paulo .
The high number of police killings is all the more dramatic when viewed alongside the comparatively low numbers of non-fatal injuries of civilians by police and of police fatalities .
The São Paulo Shock Police Command killed 305 people from 2004 through 2008 yet left only 20 injured .
In all of these alleged " shootouts , " the police suffered one death ;
In Rio , police in 10 military policing zones were responsible for 825 " resistance " killings in 2008 while suffering a total of 12 police fatalities ;
Rio police arrested 23 people for every person they killed in 2008 , and São Paulo police arrested 348 for every kill .
By contrast , police in the United States arrested over 37,000 for every person they killed in alleged confrontations that year .
" Police officers are permitted to use lethal force as a last resort to protect themselves or others , " Vivanco said .
" But the notion that these police killings are committed in self - defense , or justified by high crime rates , does not hold up under scrutiny . "
In addition to the many " resistance " killings each year by police on duty , officers kill hundreds more while off - duty , often when they are acting as members of militias in Rio and death squads in São Paulo .
Police officers responsible for unlawful killings in Rio and São Paulo are rarely brought to justice .
The principal cause of this chronic failure to hold police to account for murder , the report found , is that the criminal justice systems in both states currently rely almost entirely on police investigators to resolve these cases .
Human Rights
Watch found that police officers frequently take steps to cover up the true nature of " resistance " killings .
And police investigators often fail to take necessary steps to determine what has taken place , helping to ensure that criminal responsibility cannot be established and that those responsible remain unaccountable .
" So long as they are left to police themselves these executions will continue unchecked , and legitimate efforts to curb violence in both states will suffer , " Vivanco said .
The report provides recommendations to Rio and São Paulo authorities for curbing police violence and improving law enforcement .
The central recommendation is the creation of specialized units within state prosecutors ' offices to investigate " resistance " killings and ensure that officers responsible for extrajudicial executions are brought to justice .
The report also details measures that state and federal authorities should take to maximize the effectiveness of these special units .
These include :
Requiring police officers to notify prosecutors of " resistance " killings immediately after they take place ;
Establishing and strictly enforcing a crime scene protocol that deters police officers from engaging in false " rescues " and other cover - up techniques ;
Two - thirds of voters back David Cameron ’s call for the size of the state to be slimmed down , a ComRes survey for The Independent discloses today .
The poll also shows that the Conservatives remain on course for a comfortable victory at the general election , despite a small drop in their lead over Labour .
The ComRes poll puts the Tories on 40 per cent ( up two points since last month ) , Labour on 27 per cent ( up four ) , the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent ( down five ) with other parties on 15 per cent ( down one ) .
There is no sign that the British National Party has achieved an electoral bounce since Nick Griffin ’s controversial appearance on BBC1 ’s Question Time : its support is stuck at just two per cent .

The Tory leadership will be relieved that it has emerged from the party conference season with its lead almost intact at 13 per cent , a fall of two points .
It had feared that the party ’s gloomy warnings of the need for swingeing cuts in public spending would hit its support .
A large majority of voters said they supported Mr Cameron ’s central message to his conference that “ big government ” needed to be scaled back .
Sixty - seven per cent said they agreed with the Tory leader that “ the Government has grown too big and needs a major overhaul to make it smaller ” .
Just 28 per cent disagreed , with his call for a smaller state supported across the social spectrum .
Andrew Hawkins , the chief executive of ComRes , said : “ The Conservatives are on to a winner with this campaign line . ”
Today ’s survey does , however , carry a new warning to the Tories – and a crumb of comfort to Labour – that the Conservative poll rating is relatively “ soft ” .
Nearly half of voters ( 45 per cent ) say they agree David Cameron “ seems likeable , but I am not sure I am ready to see a Conservative government ” , with 49 per cent disagreeing .
Even 38 per cent of Tory supporters agree with the statement , underlining the problem party strategists continue to face in converting hostility to the Brown government into positive support for the Conservatives .

Thirty - six per cent of non-Labour voters also said they would consider backing a party they did not support “ just to try to keep Labour out of government ” .
The ComRes survey suggests the last conference season before the general election has made little difference to the balance of political support in Britain .
Labour had targeted its gathering in Brighton for the start of a concerted fightback against the Tories and Mr Brown won largely positive reviews for his conference speech .
Although a poll rating of 27 per cent marks a modest recovery from the low - 20s over the summer , a 13 - point lead for the Tories would be enough to give Mr Cameron a majority of 66 in a general election .
The Liberal Democrats will be disappointed to have fallen back into the high - teens although their 23 per cent rating last month probably reflected the fact that polling was conducted just days after the end of their conference .
Support for other parties remains at an historic high , reflecting the continuing disillusionment with mainstream parties .
The Green Party , who are targeting the constituency of Brighton Pavilion for an electoral breakthrough at the election , have five per cent support , with the UK Independence Party on three per cent and the BNP on two per cent .
ComRes telephoned 1004 GB adults between 23rd and 25th October 2009 .
Data were weighted by past vote recall .

Sarah Arawo is aware of the problems of having more children .
The mother of seven is HIV - positive and knows there is a risk of passing on the virus to a child ( one of her children already has the virus ) , and because of the recent drought she and her husband , Francis Esweu , would struggle to feed any extra mouths .
Arawo , from Obiol village in Katine , north - east Uganda , wants to stop having children altogether , but she does not know how .
She wants to find out more about family planning , but fears it could lead to conflict with her husband , whom she says is reluctant to use a condom when they have sex .
At the same time , because of her condition , she fears she might experience complications if she takes another form of contraceptive .
Arawo is not alone .
Limited access to family planning services , fears about side effects , opposition from partners and religious beliefs have led to Uganda having the highest unmet need for contraception in east Africa .
And research indicates that this unmet need for family planning is highest among illiterate women like Arawo .
According to Dr Moses Muwonge , the national reproductive health commodity security coordinator at Uganda 's Ministry of Health , 41 % of women in Uganda have an unmet need for contraception .
Rates in neighbouring countries Kenya and Tanzania stand at 25 % and 22 % respectively .
Rwanda has a rate 38 % , while Ethiopia 's is 34 % .
Rates keep increasing , but Muwonge says the ministry has not got enough resources to tackle the problem .
The government will need up to US $ 25 m to adequately meet the contraception needs of its population by 2015 , he added .
" Uganda 's contribution towards funding family planning is negligible .
It is less than 5 % .
Unless donors increase funding , it might not be easy for the country to meet the unmet needs , " Muwonge warned at a health workshop for journalists in Kampala last month , organised by the Uganda Health Communication Alliance ( UHCA ) , with funding from the US - based Population Reference Bureau .
The conference was told that almost half of the country 's one million births a year were unwanted .
Uganda 's annual population growth rate is estimated to be 3.2 % , according to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics .
On average women give birth to seven children , which is already putting a strain on the country 's resources .
The Ugandan government has published a road map to accelerate the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity over the next five years and part of that plan is to see the unmet need for family planning cut to 5 % by 2015 .
Presenting a paper , entitled Stopping stock - outs :
What is Uganda doing to ensure a reliable supply of contraceptives , Muwonge said the government was over dependent on donor funding in this area and even the meagre resources allocated to finance family planning programmes was not always received by the ministry .
" We do not usually get the 100 % allocation .
Out of what is allocated to family planning , only 20 % is actually delivered , " he said .
But it 's not just a question of finance .
Some of the challenges affecting the low take up of contraception include poor adherence to contraceptive procurement schedules by donors and weak supply chains , especially at district levels , where contraceptives are procured by chance , Muwonge said .
Education also plays a part .
Family planning services at government health centres are free , but at times health workers do not prioritise procurement of contraceptives because they believe there to be little demand for family planning services in their area .
That low demand , however , could be because women are not aware of the available options .
Making changes
In Katine , the sub-county in which the African Medical and Research Foundation ( Amref ) is implementing a three - year development project funded by Guardian readers and Barclays , access to family planning has increased over the last year largely thanks to education .
According to Amref , since September 2008 , the number of women accessing family planning services has increased from 1 % to 4.3 % , from 63 to 251 of the 5,909 women of child bearing age in the sub-county .
Village health teams have been trained by Amref on the advantages of family planning as a way of cutting infant and maternal mortality rates , and on the different methods available .
They are now able to advise the community and are also helping to distribute condoms .
In August around 60 women and men attended a session on tubal ligation – female sterilisation - at Tiriri health centre in Katine , run by officials from the reproductive health NGO Marie Stopes .
But there is still a huge unmet need in the sub-county .
Teddy Akello , the nursing officer in charge of antenatal services at Tiriri health centre , said there is a lack of skilled personnel to provide the services .
" Yes we have unmet need for contraceptives here - especially for permanent methods [ female and male sterilisation ] , which result from the fact that there is no skilled personnel to provide that service , " she said .
Instead the health centre is reliant on the contraceptives it orders from the national medical stores , which is limited to condoms , pills and injections .
To help their clients get a wider choice , the health centre recommends them to Marie Stopes in the nearest town Soroti or Mbale .
Last month , 16 mothers received contraceptives from Tiriri .
The most popular method was a course of injections .
Significantly , Akello said she had noticed an improvement in men's attitude towards family planning .

In a recent episode of " This Hour has 22 Minutes , " Marg Delahunty went to a Sarah Palin book signing in Columbus , Ohio .
Delahunty was thrown out , but that did n't stop her from getting Ms. Palin to make a statement .
In an interview with That was all it took for security guards to step into action .
" Four huge big burly guys started pushing , and I pushed back , but I got her attention , and she told us to keep the faith , something like that , and said we 're all trying for the same thing , " Walsh told the Canadian Press .
Walsh and her crew were not about to allow being thrown out of the book signing to put them off , so they waited outside where Ms. Palin 's bus was parked .
When Palin came out of the Borders book store , Walsh reportedly hollered , " Hey , remember us , we 're the Canadians !
We came all the way here from Canada !
When we asked you that question , we did n't hear your answer . "
To Walsh 's surprise Palin strolled over to her and said , " Canada needs to dismantle its public healthcare system and allow private enterprise to get involved and turn a profit . "
Ms. Walsh could n't understand why questions were not allowed at the book signing .
She told Canadian Press , " We 're in a bookstore , at a public event , in a place one would think was a bastion of free speech .
And no one was allowed to ask questions .
What are they afraid of ? "
Canadian comedian Mary Walsh , who plays Marg Delahunty on This Hour Has 22 Minutes , recently got quite close to probably one of the world 's most controversial politicians .
In an interview with Canadian Press , Ms. Walsh talked about meeting Sarah Palin at a book signing .
" We told her we 're from Canada , and we 're just looking for a few words of encouragement for the Canadian conservatives who have worked so tirelessly to destroy the socialized medicare that we have , " Walsh said .
That was all it took for security guards to step into action .
" Four huge big burly guys started pushing , and I pushed back , but I got her attention , and she told us to keep the faith , something like that , and said we 're all trying for the same thing , " Walsh told the Canadian Press .

ESPN's Take
Gerhart 's consistency a cut above the rest By Ivan Maisel
ESPN.com
Editor 's note : Each week this season , ESPN.com will ask one of its Heisman Watch voters to explain his or her picks .
1. Toby Gerhart , Stanford :
The senior is second in the nation in rushing ( 1,736 yards ) and first in scoring ( 26 touchdowns ) .
He never had a bad game and he had plenty of good ones , especially down the stretch .
In the Cardinal 's last four games , when the aches and pains of the autumn have accumulated , Gerhart averaged 29 carries and 185.5 yards per game .
Want a tiebreaker ?
He is an outstanding student .
At Stanford .
Bottom line : Gerhart has the best stats and played the most consistent football of any of the Heisman contenders .
2. Mark Ingram , Alabama : Like Gerhart , the Alabama sophomore is a money player who shrugged off the first contact .
Like Gerhart , Ingram got stronger as games got longer .
In the fourth quarter against South Carolina , Ingram got every one of the 68 yards the Crimson Tide needed to score the touchdown that put the Gamecocks away , 20 - 6 .
Ingram rushed for 1,542 yards , an Alabama record , and 15 touchdowns .
He is the best offensive weapon on the No. 1 team in the nation .
3. Ndamukong Suh , Nebraska :
Most defensive tackles who dominate games clog up the middle of the field so their teammates can make the stops .
The Nebraska senior is so strong and mobile that he does both .
Suh 's 4.5 sacks Saturday night in the 13 - 12 loss to Texas will be remembered as long as quarterbacks run in fear .
He has 12 sacks .
Suh might not overcome the natural bias against defensive players -- it 's hard for voters to take a leap without stats to guide them -- but his play attracted enough attention for him to become a Heisman finalist .
4. Kellen Moore , Boise State :
The sophomore has numbers straight out of EA Sports : 39 touchdown passes , three interceptions , 3,325 yards and the nation 's best efficiency rating of 167.35 .
Moore does n't flinch under pressure .
He finds a way to get the ball to a receiver no matter how big the body bearing down upon him .
Moore , a lightly recruited coach 's son from rural Washington , is so smart that Broncos coach Chris Petersen regularly picks his brain for ideas .
All this , and two more seasons of eligibility .
5. Colt McCoy , Texas :
The senior and 2008 Heisman runner - up overcame a slow start to the season with a fantastic second half , peaking with 479 yards of total offense in the Longhorns ' 49 - 39 defeat of Texas A&M .
That made McCoy the favorite until his offensive line fell apart against Nebraska in the Big 12 championship game .
Still , McCoy has thrown for 3,512 yards and completed more than 70 percent of his passes .
He also is the Longhorns ' second leading rusher with 348 yards .
Try :: Tiny rocks .
Every perl programmer should start using it .
Especially if you 're a CPAN module author and wants to eval { } inside your module ( often to check if an user of your module has some optional module installed , in which case you optimize stuff for it etc. ) , you 're strongly suggested to use this module instead of your own eval { } stuff .
Why ?
If you do eval { } in your module that clobbers the global $@ , and to avoid that you need to local $@ , and then if you want to die ( rethrow ) from local $@ then the exception gets cleared etc ...
Try :: Tiny solves this endless yak shaving and there 're no dependencies at all and works with perl back to 5.005 x .
Anyway , i started using Try : : Tiny ( when nothingmuch himself added this :) ) in Plack and Tatsumaki with so much fun , but last night I experienced one minor pitfall of this module that I might want to share with you .
I had this code :
sub write {
my $ self = shift ;
my $ writer = $ self -> writer || $ self -> init_writer ;
$ writer -> write (@_ ) ;
}
I wanted to catch Broken pipe exception from -> write , so I changed to do this :
sub write {
my $ self = shift ;
my $ writer = $ self -> writer || $ self -> init_writer ;
try {
$ writer -> write (@_ ) ;
} catch {
/ Broken pipe / and $ self->{client_disconnected} = 1 ;
} ;
}
It might be obvious to you but for me it was n't at first , and I wasted about 15 minutes to figure out what 's wrong with that code .
Yeah , the use of @_ in the try { } clause .
it 's internally implemented as try sub { ... } so the content of @_ is changed when it 's executed .
Lots of clever modules on CPAN that exports DSL sugars ( including my own Web : : Scraper ) shares the same problem .
At least you have to be careful not to use @_ in the block , by assigning the @_ content into some lexical variables before you construct the block ,
( Well maybe Try : : Tiny can add a workaround to save the @_ in the caller stack but i'm not sure if it's a doable without black magic like DB : : args and whether it 's right thing to do anyway )
Anyways ,
Try :: Tiny is a great module if you care about this tiny thing .
Enjoy .
UPDATE : this is now mentioned in Try : : Tiny POD docs .
FUNTUA , Nigeria ( Reuters ) -
For residents in his home town , it was Umar Abdulmutallab ’s foreign education , not his roots in Muslim northern Nigeria , that radicalized him and led him to try to blow up a U.S. passenger plane .
The 23 - year - old London - educated Nigerian was charged on Saturday in the United States with trying to blow up Northwest Airlines flight 253 as it approached Detroit from Amsterdam on Christmas Day with almost 300 people on board .
The son of a highly respected banker , Abdulmutallab ’s actions shocked Nigeria ’s wealthy elite and residents in his family ’s predominantly Muslim northern hometown of Funtua .
“ Everyone knew the Mutallabs and the father is honest , generous , helpful and above all a prominent banker .
I cannot see why his son should be involved in this act , ” Funtua resident Ibrahim Bello , 65 , said , close to the Mutallab family home .
Like other elders from the community , Bello said Abdulmutallab ’s schooling abroad meant he had been brought up outside the customs of northern Nigeria , a region with a history of moderate Sufi Islam .
“ My only advice to the elite is to allow their children to mingle with the children of the masses so that he will have some of the traditional morals and values that ( the elder ) Mutallab himself enjoyed , ” Bello told Reuters .
Behind him , a group of elderly men were listening to the local Hausa language services of the BBC and Voice of America radio stations , eager to hear the latest developments .
FOREIGN SCHOOLING
Abdulmutallab is from a privileged background in Africa ’s most populous nation , where most of an estimated 140 million people live on under $ 2 a day .
His father , Umaru Mutallab , retired earlier this month as chairman of First Bank , the country ’s oldest , after a distinguished career in finance .
Like many children from rich Nigerian homes , Abdulmutallab spent his formative years abroad .
Information Minister Dora Akunyili said he had been living outside Nigeria “ for a while ” and only returned on the eve of the attack .
“ We were shocked when we heard a report from one of the international radio stations that the son of Mutallab is involved in an act of terrorism in the United States , ” said Ahmed Ibrahim , one of Abdulmutallab ’s contemporaries .
“ But many of us did not know the children of the Mutallabs because they did not grow up here in Funtua , ” he said , sipping Coca - Cola under the shade of a tree .
The Mutallab home in Funtua , more than 250 km ( 155 miles ) north of the capital Abuja , is a single - story brown and white building behind big gates , larger than surrounding houses but not ostentatious .
Abdulmutallab was educated at the British School in Lome , Togo -- a boarding school mostly serving expatriates and students from around West Africa -- before studying engineering at University College London ( UCL ) , where he is believed to have lived in a multi-million dollar city - center apartment .
One friend who knew him in London said he kept himself to himself and always wore a skullcap , rare among young Nigerian Muslims who usually wear such caps only on religious occasions .
Nigeria ’s
This Day newspaper said he had been given the nickname “ Alfa ” -- a local term for an Islamic scholar -- while at school in Togo , for his preaching to other students .
He also made two trips to Yemen during his student days for short Arabic and Islamic courses , according to a family friend .
PRECEDENTS
If Abdulmutallab was radicalized outside Nigeria as many of his compatriots believe , his case would have precedents .
Ahmed Saeed Omar Sheikh , or Sheikh Omar , who was sentenced to death in Pakistan in 2002 for the killing of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl and suspected of links to the September 11 , 2001 attacks , came from a similarly privileged background .
Born in Britain in the early 1970s , Omar was the son of a wholesale clothes merchant from Wanstead in northeast London who went to an expensive school but dropped out of one of Britain ’s top universities , the London School of Economics .
Nigeria ’s predominantly Muslim north has seen bouts of religious unrest .
But while some Western diplomats have expressed concern that its huge population and widespread poverty could attract foreign Islamic extremists , there has been no conclusive evidence of such a presence in the country .
Clashes between security forces and a radical Islamic sect called Boko Haram -- which wanted a wider adoption of sharia ( Islamic law ) -- killed hundreds of people in the northern Nigerian city of Maiduguri in July .
But Islamic jurisprudence in Nigeria is based on the moderate Maliki school of Sunni Islam and Boko Haram ’s ideology is dismissed by the country ’s Muslim leaders and most believers .
Young Muslims who grew up in Funtua insist it was Abdulmutallab ’s life overseas , which they view as alien , not Nigerian Islam that gave rise to his extremist views .
“ We the children of the masses in this country , we do n’t know anything about terrorism because our parents are poor .
They do n’t have the money to take us abroad , ” said 25 - year old student and Funtua resident Usman Mati .
Rock band Rage Against the Machine ended Simon Cowell ’s four year domination of the Christmas charts tonight after a hugely popular Facebook campaign helped the Los Angeles nu-metallers snatch the Christmas number one slot from X - factor ’s Joe McEdlerry .
More than half a million people downloaded the band ’s famously anti-authoritarian and expletive laden track “ Killing in the Name ” in what was seen as a broad protest against the increasing influence of manufactured pop music .
It is the first time a non-X - Factor song has made it to Christmas number one for four years and represents a major snub to the show ’s creator Cowell who angrily described the campaign to deny him another number one slot as “ very Scrooge ” .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
X - Factor winner McElderry was less than a year old when Rage Against the Machine stormed onto the LA rock scene in 1992 with their self - titled debut album which went triple platinum and effectively gave birth to the nu-metal rock scene by blending heavy metal guitar riffs with politically charged rap lyrics .
Earlier in the week he listened to “ Killing in the Name ” for the first time and described it as “ dreadful ” .
But last night the 18 - year - old Geordie singer , whose cover of Miley Cyrus ’ “ The Climb ” sold 50,000 fewer copies than his rivals , was noticeably more magnanimous in defeat .
" Fair play to the guys who have organised the Facebook campaign - it 's been exciting to be part of a much - hyped battle and they definitely deserve congratulations , " he said .
" This time last year I never thought for one minute that I 'd win The X Factor , never mind about having a debut single out , so I 'm just delighted to be in the charts . ”
Speaking on BBC Radio 1 ’s Chart Show , Rage frontman
Zach de la Rocha said his band getting to number one said “ more about the spontaneous action taken by young people throughout the UK to topple this very sterile pop monopoly and less about the song and the band .
We are very proud to have had the song chosen as the vehicle by which to do this . "
Krissi Murrison , editor of the NME , which publicly backed the anti-X - Factor campaign , hailed Rage ’s victory .
“ It proves not only that the public have better taste than Simon Cowell gives them credit for , but that it there is actually an alternative to the pap we have been fed by X Factor for the past six Christmases , ” she said .
Overturning the X - Factor ’s dominance of the Chritmas charts , she said , was no mean feat .
“ The assumption was obviously that no - one could topple the combined power of ITV and X Factor - especially not a grassroots campaign with zero marketing budget .
But this just proves that anything is possible .
Does this mark a permanent change ?
Yes , and one that X Factor have brought on themselves .
The public has had enough of them hi-jacking the charts with second - rate karaoke cover versions , and this is our way of showing that . ”
For the past four years the Christmas number one has effectively been a forgone conclusion and this year was expected to be no different when McElderry won the latest series of X - Factor .
But a Facebook group called “ Rage Against the Machine for Christmas No 1 ” quickly transformed itself into a major grassroots protest against the X - Factor attracting more than 980,000 followers .
The campaign took on an increasingly anti-corporate and pro-social justice tone with followers encouraging each other to donate to the homeless charity Shelter which received £ 65,000 in public donations .
Rage Against the Machine also lent their support to the campaign , promising to donate their royalties to Shelter and to play a thank you gig in the UK next year if the campaign was successful .
Despite the growing success of the campaign most bookies still expected McElderry to be this year ’s Christmas number one and made him the favourite .
By Friday Rage Against the Machine were a mere 9,000 copies ahead of McElderry but as the Saturday midnight cut off point for the Christmas number one slot loomed , Rage fans went into a download frenzy according to industry insiders .
Steve Wheeler , from Recordstore.co.uk , one of the largest independent music online traders , said : “ Between 8 pm and midnight there was a sudden jump in the number of Rage downloads .
I think people suddenly realised the race was a lot closer than they thought and that they could effect some meaningful change . ”
Bookies are set to make a major loss from the Rage victory .
Rupert Adams , from William Hill , said .
“ We ’ll probably take quite a hit , quite possibly a six or seven figure hit .
The last time we had such an unpredictable Christmas number one was with Mr Blobby which badly stung bookies because no - one expected that track to win . ”
A BBC spokesperson said Radio 1 and Radio 6 would continue to play the clean edit of “ Killing in the Name ” which cuts out the 17 swearwords at the end of the song .
Radio
Two will not play the Rage track but will play McElderry .

WITCH , or the Harwell Dekatron Computer
I 've just knocked together this page quickly to put up some photos of the Harwell Dekatron Computer , known from 1957 onwards as WITCH .
This computer was designed and built over the course of two years between 1949 and 1951 , at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Oxfordshire , UK .
For more details have a look at its Wikipedia entry or at the page dedicated to the computer at the Computer Conservation Society website .
At the time of its retirement in 1974 it was the oldest computer in the world still in continuous use , and was proclaimed by Guiness World Records to be the “ Most durable computer in the World ” .
Unlike the computers that we use every day , WITCH computed in base 10 using Dekatrons .
These Dekatrons formed the volatile memory ( RAM ) of the computer .
The cathode in a Dekatron which was glowing allowed one simply to read the value ( between 0 and 9 ) being stored in that Dekatron , making it an ideal early computer for teaching .
These Dekatrons were arranged into lines of 9 , the first representing the parity ( plus or minus ) of a stored number and the following eight its digits .
The numbers that WITCH could store were therefore between - 9.9999999 and 9.9999999 , even in its heyday this was not the most powerful of machines ; its attraction was that it was incredibly reliable .
Whilst other computers in the fifties needed continuous nursing , WITCH was left for days at a time , running merrily whilst people went on Christmas holidays and the like .
My grandfather , Cecil Ramsbottom was in charge of the running and maintenance of WITCH when it moved to the University of Wolverhampton ( Wolverhampton and Staffordshire Technical College at the time ) in 1957 .
Here it was renamed to WITCH , Wolverhampton Instrument for Teaching Computing from Harwell .
Here 's a photo of him ( on the right ) with the machine :
Today , WITCH is being restored to its former glory , after several decades in storage , at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park .
Our family ( my grandfather 's four children and their children ) visited a few days after Christmas 2009 to hand over the key to Tony Frazer , who 's leading the project to restore the computer .
There were formerly a number of keys in existence but all the others appear to have been misplaced and they “ thought we were going to have to hotwire it ” .
Below are some of the photos that I took on the day .

Fool that I am I did n't get a photo of the complete machine , but there are several such pictures on the CCS website .
One of the Dekatrons on test ( not part of the machine ) .
Dekatrons in the memory store .
One memory store .
Each row of nine Dekatrons stored one number , each bank stored ten numbers .
Four memory stores .
There were nine stores in total ( as you can see in the photo with the key in it ) .
Looking down WITCH .
The accumulators .
These did the actual number crunching .
The accumulators from the front .
Behind one of the memory stores ( in my grandfather 's writing ) , the names of the people who designed , built and used the computer at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment .

The six tape readers were how programs and data were input to WITCH .
You can't do computing unless you 've got power !
The key fitted and everyone breathed a sigh of relief .

The dollar will still be the world ’s dominant currency in 10 years ’ time because the United States will still be the world ’s most important economy , the head of the IMF said on Monday .
However , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the managing director of the International Monetary Fund , said he could not see 30 or 40 years into the future .
Answering questions put by university students , Strauss - Kahn said the outlook for the global economy remained fragile .

Paul Goble reports :
Industrial production in Central Russia fell by 20 percent during the first nine months of 2009 as compared to the same period a year earlier , the result , one analyst says , not so much of the international financial crisis than of Vladimir Putin ’s pursuit of “ an energy empire ” and his attacks on businessmen who might invest in industrial development .
Novyye Izvestiya reports that industrial production had fallen in Russia as a whole by 14.5 percent , with the central region being among the hardest it , with automobile and machine - building there down 30 to 60 percent , construction down 20 percent , and the number of businesses down 30 percent .
Commenting on that report , Kasparov.ru observer Yury Gladysh says that it was important to go beyond saying that “ we warned you ” this would happen to a close analyst of why the situation is so dire and why it is unlikely to change unless there is a fundamental shift in state policy .
A major reason for the unprecedented decline in industrial production in Central Russia , he suggests , is the concentration of machine - building plants there and their inability to compete , the result of policies going back to Soviet times that have been exacerbated by Vladimir Putin ’s focus on gas and oil development .
Forty years ago , Gladysh points out , Soviet planners focused on heavy machine building plants rather than its lighter forms , thus limiting the ability of these firms to adapt .
And more recently , the Russian government has failed to invest in industry and worse has created conditions in which few industrialists are willing to take the risk of doing so .
Given the government ’s incarceration of Mikhail Khodorkhovsky , Gladysh continues , “ not a single normal businessman will begin to invest money in production when he knows that in the case of success , he can be deprived not only of these funds but also of freedom and even life itself . ”
But there is an even bigger problem for Russia , he adds , if it is to prevent the de-industrialization of the economy and hence the degradation of the society .
That is “ the Putin plan ” which “ unfortunately is being successfully introduced into life , ” as the recent statistics show .
While production in the industrial centers of Russia continues to fall , the regions where natural resources are extracted continue to show “ stormy economic growth , ” because of the export of gas and oil .
If that pattern continues , Gladysh suggests , Russia will be reduced to a raw materials supplier to “ the industrially developed powers . ”
“ Stopping that course of development can occur only if there is a change in the existing administrative system , which [ since Putin came to power ] is oriented toward the creation of a mythical ‘ energy empire , ’ ” Gladysh concludes .
“ But that task , ” as he points out , “ already goes far beyond the limits of pure economics

If there is a tragedy in war ( besides all the killing ) , it is that there must be a loser .
Currently , we all know who that loser is .
Drew Wolf , who still has a red Peanut M&M lodged so deeply up his nose that hospital doctors were unable to extract it .
" It will probably melt after a while , " they told me .
( I had to drive him to the hospital . )
" Maybe put his head under a heat lamp for a bit . "
The other loser , of course , is the Demoman , who JUST SLIGHTLY trails the Soldier in overall kills .
So tonight is the Demoman 's update : no Soldier information whatsoever .
New weapons ?
Read all about 'em .
New comic ?
No Soldier to be seen .
Go get 'em , lads .
This war ai n't over yet .
The famous backyard photo of Lee Harvey Oswald .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Dartmouth Computer Scientist Hany Farid has new evidence regarding a photograph of accused John F. Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald .
Farid , a pioneer in the field of digital forensics , digitally analyzed an iconic image of Oswald pictured in a backyard setting holding a rifle in one hand and Marxist newspapers in the other .
Oswald and others claimed that the incriminating photo was a fake , noting the seemingly inconsistent lighting and shadows .
After analyzing the photo with modern - day forensic tools , Farid says the photo almost certainly was not altered .
" If we had found evidence of photo tampering , then it would have suggested a broader plot to kill JFK , " said Farid , who is also the director of the Neukom Institute for Computational Science at Dartmouth .
" Those who believe that there was a broader conspiracy can no longer point to this photo as possible evidence . "
Farid added that federal officials long ago said that this image had not been tampered with , but a surprising number of skeptics still assert that there was a conspiracy .
The study will appear in a forthcoming issue of the journal Perception .
Farid and his team have developed a number of digital forensic tools used to determine whether digital photos have been manipulated , and his research is often used by law enforcement officials and in legal proceedings .
The tools can measure statistical inconsistencies in the underlying image pixels , improbable lighting and shadow , physically impossible perspective distortion , and other artifacts introduced by photo manipulators .
The play of light and shadow was fundamental in the Oswald photo analysis .
" The human brain , while remarkable in many aspects , also has its weaknesses , " says Farid .
" The visual system can be quite inept at making judgments regarding 3 - D geometry , lighting , and shadows . "
At a casual glance , the lighting and shadows in the Oswald photo appear to many to be incongruous with the outdoor lighting .
To determine if this was the case , Farid constructed a 3 - D model of Oswald 's head and portions of the backyard scene , from which he was able to determine that a single light source , the sun , could explain all of the shadows in the photo .
" It is highly improbable that anyone could have created such a perfect forgery with the technology available in 1963 , " said Farid .
With no evidence of tampering , he concluded that the incriminating photo was authentic .
" As our digital forensic tools become more sophisticated , we increasingly have the ability to apply them to historic photos in an attempt to resolve some long - standing mysteries , " said Farid .

On Monday , Al Jazeera reported that a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said the group accepted responsibility for only some of the recent suicide bombings in Pakistan , laying the blame for others , including a deadly attack on a market last month that killed more than 100 civilians , on the American security firm formerly known as Blackwater .
The spokesman claimed that the firm , now called Xe , was involved in an attempt to discredit the militants by staging deadly attacks .
This video report from Al Jazeera includes shots of of Azam Tariq , a spokesman for the broad alliance of Pakistani militant groups known as the Tehrik - i- Taliban , saying , “ I want to tell the people in Pakistan and the Muslim nation that the Tehrik - i - Taliban are not responsible for the bombings , but Blackwater and Pakistan ’s spy agency are behind them . ”
According to The Associated Press , the spokesman tried to pass off blame for two recent attacks that were particularly deadly , saying :
The dirty Pakistani intelligence agencies , for the sake of creating mistrust and hatred among people against the Taliban , are carrying out blasts at places like the Islamic university , Islamabad , and the Khyber bazaar , Peshawar .
The A.P. also reported that the video , posted on YouTube on Sunday , bore the logo of Al Qaeda ’s media wing , As - Sahab .
The A.P. noted that this was “ the first time the Taliban spokesman has appeared in an As - Sahab video , ” suggesting that there are “ growing links between the two groups . ”
An earlier report on the Web site of The Daily Times , a publication based in Lahore , said that the spokesman had also suggested that the ruling Pakistan People ’s Party was involved in the attacks , adding , “ All these killings by the infamous Blackwater are aimed at maligning the Taliban . ”
On Monday , Issam Ahmed of The Christian Science Monitor reported from Peshawar that some Pakistanis were ready to believe that the American private security firm is the enemy , rather than the Taliban .
Mr. Ahmed reported :
The company ’s operatives are often viewed by Pakistanis as akin to C.I.A. agents , and local conspiracy theories sometimes assert that the U.S. with the help of Blackwater , rather than the Taliban , are responsible for the suicide attacks . [ … ]
According to Faizullah Jan , a lecturer at the department of journalism and mass communication at the University of Peshawar , such conspiracy theories are fed by Pakistan ’s mainstream media and the proliferation of underground jihadist media outlets .
“ In such an environment anything which is seemingly obvious is not real , and anything which is hidden is deemed to be real , ” he says .
Indeed , it is not hard to find reports in Pakistan ’s media that blame American private contractors and the intelligence agencies of other countries for terrorist attacks in the country .
Last month the Web site Pakistan Daily reported that a former chief of staff of Pakistan ’s army had claimed in a television interview that Blackwater was involved in the assassination of Pakistan ’s former prime minister , Benazir Bhutto .
The same Web site published an editorial days later claiming that the attacks killing Pakistani civilians were carried out by “ Blackwater Talibans ” working on behalf of “ the underground drug mafia controlled by the Zionists . ”
Pointing to an even broader conspiracy the same writer suggested ,
Pakistan is under the attack of various Talibans which include Indian Talibans , Israeli Talibans , Karzai Talibans … British Talibans and American Talibans which of course include Blackwater .
The fact that the United States government has employed the private security firm to work in secret inside Pakistan makes it hard to knock down the wilder conspiracy theories .
My colleagues James Risen and Mark Mazzetti reported in August :
From a secret division at its North Carolina headquarters , the company formerly known as Blackwater has assumed a role in Washington ’s most important counterterrorism program : the use of remotely piloted drones to kill Al Qaeda ’s leaders , according to government officials and current and former employees .
The division ’s operations are carried out at hidden bases in Pakistan and Afghanistan , where the company ’s contractors assemble and load Hellfire missiles and 500 - pound laser - guided bombs on remotely piloted Predator aircraft , work previously performed by employees of the Central Intelligence Agency .
They also provide security at the covert bases , the officials said .
Weeks after that news broke , it became fodder for the Pakistani journalist and blogger Ahmed Quraishi , who dug into the Web site of the United States Training Center , which calls itself “ a Xe company , ” and noticed that job applicants were directed to a form — posted on the Web site Blackwaterusa.com — that includes Urdu and Punjabi in a list of languages that prospective contractors might speak .
Mr. Quraishi took one look at that form and jumped to publish his conclusion that “ hiring continues as we speak for agents and for people with military training who can speak Urdu , Pakistan ’s national language , and Punjabi , spoken by the natives of Pakistan ’s largest populated province . ”
Mr. Quraishi took no note of the fact that the list of languages applicants might be proficient in also includes German , Italian , Thai and sign language .
One imagines it wo n’t take long for conspiracy - minded Pakistanis reading Sunday ’s report in The Los Angeles Times that the C.I.A. has been bringing “ ISI operatives to a secret training facility in North Carolina ” to notice that the Web site of United States Training includes a photograph of its center in Moycock , N.C. above a statement that the company “ is currently training select military and other government groups from U.S. - friendly nations . ”
Perhaps picking up on the popular mood , Pakistan ’s prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , reportedly blamed foreign militants for the violence during a meeting with leaders of the Mehsud tribes from Waziristan on Tuesday .
According to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn , Mr. Gilani “ said foreign militants of Arab , Uzbek , Afghan and Chechen origin were operating in the country and were involved in terrorist activities . ”
Dawn also reported that the prime minister said that the tribesmen , despite their links to the former Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud , were blameless :

With less than two weeks before Election Day , Harrisburg mayoral candidate Linda Thompson spent part of Friday fielding questions about her finances .
Thompson called a news conference at Loveship , the headquarters of her nonprofit organization , a day after being interviewed about her finances and a failed Loveship project .
Thompson has said that she voluntarily left a job with the Urban League of Metropolitan Harrisburg and received unemployment compensation .
After leaving the job in late 1999 , she enrolled in an entrepreneurial employment program and was allowed to receive unemployment for a year while she received training , she said .
She used the money to open Loveship and pay rent , she added .
She and her campaign manager , James Ellison , did not respond to a detailed list of follow - up questions e-mailed to them .
She also did not respond to a request for a copy of her resume or last year ’s tax returns .
But records at the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission , which handles discrimination claims , shed some more light on Thompson ’s departure from the Urban League .
Shannon Powers , a spokeswoman for the commission , said that Thompson filed a complaint against the Urban League of Metropolitan Harrisburg on Dec. 8 , 1999 .
The complaint alleges that Thompson was discharged on the basis of her gender .
She also said that the terms and conditions of her employment and her wages were different from others ’ based on her gender .
The commission started an investigation on Jan. 31 , 2000 , Powers said .
No public hearing was held , and nothing in the record indicates that Thompson filed a lawsuit against the Urban League , Powers said .
The case was closed on Nov. 11 , 2003 , Powers said .
A check of the electronic database Lexis - Nexis , as well as a search of the Pennsylvania court system , does not show that Thompson ever filed a lawsuit against the Urban League .

ATLANTA 
In the two weeks since the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , embraced a proposal that would allow states to opt out of a new government health insurance plan , state leaders have begun debating whether to take part , and the question has emerged as a litmus test in some campaigns for governor .
The proposal , which is being woven into the Senate health care bill , would shift some power to the states and would foist upon state leaders the burden of a choice that , in some cases , could pit principle and politics against pragmatism .
States would be given the right to opt out of only the public plan , not from the tax increases needed to subsidize coverage for the uninsured .
The bill that passed the House on Saturday night includes a nationwide public plan without an opt - out provision , a difference that would be settled by a conference committee .
Several state officials said that if Mr. Reid ’s proposal carries the day , many governors are likely to accept the new plan rather than incite an ideological battle mirroring the fight in Congress .
Wife beaters ' register : Women have the right to know about violent past of their lover , say police
Controversial : Under the plan , police would warn a woman if their partner had a history of domestic violence
Men with a history of domestic violence could be put on a register so that any future partners can be warned about them .
The controversial plan , which is being drawn up by the Association of Chief Police Officers , would list around 25,000 suspected and convicted serial wife beaters .
Police would approach women with the information if they are notified that a man on the register has moved home .
Alternatively , women could be given the right to ask about the past of a man they are with .
A small number of pilot areas are already trying out a similar system in relation to sex offenders .
That policy has been named ' Sarah 's Law ' because it was set up in response to a campaign by the mother of Sarah Payne , the girl murdered by known paedophile Roy Whiting .
Police chiefs admit the abuse register plan is controversial .
Men might be put on the list - and be forced to tell police when they move house - simply for facing accusations from two women .
No court convictions would be required .
The plan might lead to a man being dogged for decades by old convictions .
Also , the policy could be extended to cover all types of violence , not just domestic abuse .
Officers , who produced the plan on the orders of former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , insist more needs to be done to protect women from violence .
Britain has some 25,321 serial domestic abusers , according to Wiltshire Chief Constable Brian Moore , who led the review .
He said : ' If these serial perpetrators exist in the way our research suggests they do , then is it reasonable that the next potential victim has the right to know about the serial perpetrator coming into their household ? '
The register has echoes of the sex offenders ' register .
But Mr Moore said inclusion would not be automatic following a domestic abuse allegation , as is the case with a sex offence .
He said he wanted to balance civil liberties with the need to protect vulnerable women .
In a 100 - page report , the police association also suggested that violent men who drive their wives to suicide could be charged with killing them .
Poll Should police use more of their resources on ' low level ' domestic abuse ?
No Yes Should police use more of their resources on ' low level ' domestic abuse ?

Yes 309 votes Now share your opinion
The new offence of ' liability for suicide ' would be used where women have taken their own lives after a prolonged campaign of domestic abuse .
They say it would help to tackle socalled ' honour violence ' against women trapped in forced marriages .
Evidence suggests south Asian women under 30 living in the UK are two - and - a - half times more likely to kill themselves than white women .
It is estimated that a third of women who commit suicide are victims of domestic violence .
In other proposals , new ' go - orders ' would allow courts to ban men from their homes for up to two weeks even if they are cleared of offending .
In considering a right to know policy , the report said police chiefs were keenly aware of worries about the state holding personal data .
It added : ' Nevertheless , we consider it important for the safety and wellbeing of individual members of the public who are in a relationship with a dangerous person that the potential victim has the right to know about relevant information so that informed choices about personal safety can be made . '
Women 's groups said police would be better served prosecuting violent men for their first offence than coming up with legislative ideas .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said : ' These proposals will stimulate important debate about how we can reach our future goal of preventing these cowardly crimes but also how to protect victims of domestic violence and tackle the abusers in the shorter term . '
Theresa May ,
Tory spokesman on women , said : ' No woman should live in fear of violence .
What is needed is a coordinated and comprehensive strategy with prevention as the key priority . '
An alternative newspaper in Denver , Colorado , Westword , is seeking a marijuana critic .
More than 120 people have applied for the job to review the drugs legally available in the state 's medical dispensaries .
One condition : the critic must have a medical ailment that allows him or her to buy and use marijuana at one of Colorado 's 100 dispensaries .
And the pay , unlike the job , is not expected to be high .
There are already several online reviewers of cannabis , such as marijuanareviews.com and weedmaps.com .

Last time we heard from Roland Emmerich about plans for a second Independence Day movie , he said that Fox was balking at putting up the money for Will Smith to be part of the film .
At today 's press day for , I asked Emmerich both about the status of the funding and his reason for wanting to make the movie to begin with .
Emmerich had said not 10 minutes earlier , in a roundtable interview , that sequels were silly , but he says thatis different : " I think everybody has a defining moment or a defining film who works in this business .
It 's the one I think I will be remembered for .
I kind of think it would be great to do .
" As for why it 's taken so long to get the sequel started , you can blame George W. Bush .
" In , it was about a king who leads his country into a fight against an outside invader .
I did n't want to make that movie during the Bush years .
It was not thought that George W. Bush would have made a great king .
Now with Obama , it 's another story .
" He also confirmed that , as in the first film , the plot ofwould focus on the President and his efforts to lead the country .
We know that Emmerich cast Danny Glover as the President inas a nod to Obama , but who knew the real President was the inspiration to bring Bill Pullman back as well ?
In video below , Emmerich talks more about the funding troubles for the film and why Fox would hesitate to bring back Will Smith , even though Emmerich says plainly " I will not make the movie without Will Smith . "
He also talks about his plans to use new technology on the second film .
Sounds like things are still at loggerheads in actually getting the movie going , but despite Emmerich 's promise thatwill be his last disaster movie , we can probably count oncoming along at some point .
One of the great unanswered questions in the history of beer is why it took 9,000 years or so after brewing began for brewers to start using hops .
Today there are very few beers made without hops .
They give beer flavour and , most importantly , they keep it from going off .
The shelf life for unhopped ale can be as short as a fortnight or so before it starts to spoil and sour .
Hopped beer can last for years .
But it took many millennia for brewers to discover this , though they had been using a huge range of other plants to flavour their ale in the meanwhile : the bushy , aromatic moorland shrub bog myrtle , for example , the grassland weed yarrow , the hedgerow plant ground -ivy , even rosemary and sage .
The first documented link between hops and brewing comes from Picardy in Northern France , in 822 , where Abbot Adalhard of the Benedictine monastery of Corbie , in the Somme valley near Amiens , wrote a series of statutes on how the abbey should be run .
The many rules covered areas such as the duties of the abbey ’s tenants , which included gathering of firewood and also of hops – implying wild hops , rather than cultivated ones .
Adalhard also said that a tithe ( or tenth ) of all the malt that came in should be given to the porter of the monastery , and the same with the hops .
If this did not supply enough hops , the porter should take steps to get more from elsewhere to make sufficient beer for himself : “ De humlone … decima ei portio … detur .
Si hoc ei non sufficit , ipse … sibi adquirat unde ad cervisas suas faciendas sufficienter habeat . ”
It is important that the Corbie statutes should link hops with beer brewing , because hops had other uses they might have been collected for : to make dyes , for example ( brown dye from hop sap and yellow dye from the leaves and cones ) .
The stems can also be used to make ropes , sacking and paper .
Thus any mentions in old documents of hops being collected from the wild , or even cultivated , does not mean automatically that the hops were going into beer
But Adalhard ’s statutes do not say whether the hops were being used to preserve the beer , or merely to flavour it ( the way brewers today dry - hop their beers ) .
Proof that hops were being used the way they are today , as a preservative , does not come for three more centuries , at another Benedictine establishment at Rupertsberg , near Bingen , in the Rhineland .
About 1150 , Abbess Hildegard of Bingen ( 1098 - 1179 ) , mystical philosopher and healer , published a book called Physica Sacra , which translates best as “ The Natural World ” .
Book I , Chapter 61 , “ De Hoppho ” , or “ Concerning the hop ” , says of the plant : “ It is warm and dry , and has a moderate moisture , and is not very useful in benefiting man , because it makes melancholy grow in man and makes the soul of man sad , and weighs down his inner organs .
But yet as a result of its own bitterness it keeps some putrefactions from drinks , to which it may be added , so that they may last so much longer . ”
By itself this does not prove hops were used in beer , just “ in drinks ” ( in potibus in Hildegard ’s original Latin ) .
But in a later chapter , on the ash tree , the abbess wrote : “ If you also wish to make beer from oats without hops , but just with grusz [ gruit ] , you should boil it after adding a very large number of ash leaves .
That type of beer purges the stomach of the drinker , and renders his heart [ literally ‘ chest ’ or ‘ breast ’ ] light and joyous . ”
Clearly Hildegard knew about brewing beer with hops .
The passage also suggests that Hildegard knew about boiling wort , without which just adding hops is not much help in keeping away “ putrefactions ” .
What probably kept the usefulness of hops from being discovered for so long is that the bittering , preserving resins in hop cones are not very soluble , and the hops need boiling for a long time , around 90 minutes , for what is called isomerisation – the physical change in the hop acids to a more soluble form of the molecule – to take place .
Nobody would have boiled hops that long , and thus discovered the isomerisation , without a prior good reason ( it takes a lot of fuel , a precious commodity when you have to gather wood by hand , to boil quantities of water for an hour and a half ) .
How was it found out that a good long boil improved both the flavouring and the preserving ability of hops ?
One possibility is that a dyer , boiling hops to dye cloth , made the discovery that the dye water had a pleasant bitter taste , and told her friend the brewer .
But this is just a guess .
When exactly hops began to be cultivated for putting into beer , rather than just being gathered wild from forests , is surprisingly unclear .
German sources today claim that hop gardens appear in records dating from the second half of the ninth century in and around Hallertau , in Bavaria , Southern Germany , which is still the world ’s largest single hop - growing area .
However , they do not specify exact documents in which these hop gardens are mentioned , which makes it impossible to rely on their assertions .
The best evidence seems to be that commercial hop cultivation happened in Northern Germany first , and not until the 1100s or 1200s , feeding the breweries of the Hansa trading towns , which were exporting hopped beer from at least the 13th century onwards .
( Merchant beer brewers in North German cities eventually became rich enough to join the local aristocracy , something not found in Britain until the 18th century ) .
The buyers of this beer brewed in cities such as Hamburg and Bremen included the richer inhabitants of Flanders and Holland .
Local brewers in the Low Countries reacted by brewing hopped beer themselves , and by the 1360s or thereabouts
Dutch towns were growing hops to supply their brewers .
From around 1390 brewing of hopped beer took off in Holland , with Flanders following a decade or so later .
The first import of Low Countries “ beere ” into England seems to have come in 1362/63 , when James Dodynessone of Amsterdam paid a toll on beer at Great Yarmouth in 1361 - 62 .
( There is a reference in the Norwich Leet Roll of 1288 - 9 to cervesiam flandrensem , or Flanders ale , which “ Ricardo Somer ” , Richard Summer , was fined 2s for selling occulte , secretly , thus depriving the bailiffs of money due on the ale of ale .
However , this was probably too early to be a hopped brew ) .
Further mentions of beer imports followed , gradually increasing in frequency : Henry Vandale ( a man with a Dutch - sounding surname ) bought four barrels of “ beere ” in London in 1372 .
A ship ’s captain named Clays Johanson arrived in London in July 1384 with a cargo that included earthenware dishes , Holland linen cloth and beer .
Other records of beer imports in the late 14th century come from Newcastle , Scarborough , Lynn , Ipswich , Winchelsea and Sussex .
At the end of the 14th century Great Yarmouth was importing 40 to 80 barrels of beer a month , while in 1397 - 8 Colchester imported 100 barrels of beer .
However , the first brewer of the hopped drink in England does not appear until 1412 , when Agnes Smyth , “ Dutchman ” ( sic – and “ Dutch ” meant “ German ” at this time , rather than “ person from the Netherlands ” ) , was making beer in Colchester .
The English beer trade seems to have stayed in the hands of immigrants from the Low Countries for the next century , as the conservative - minded natives stuck to their unhopped ale .
As a result , the first beer brewers in England apparently imported all their hops from across the Channel , with no attempt to cultivate the plant here until early in the 16th century .
When exactly the first hops were grown in England is , again , uncertain – dates given by different writers range from 1511 to 1524 .
But the place where they were first planted was almost certainly Kent : one tradition says the first hop garden was established in 1520 , in the parish of Westbere , near Canterbury .
By 1569 English hop cultivation was sufficiently advanced for one agricultural writer , the Sussex landowner Leonard Mascall ( or Mascal ) , to claim that “ one pound of our hoppes dried and ordered will go as far as two poundes of the best hoppe that come from overseas . ”
Five years later , in 1574 the first book in English solely devoted to hop growing was written by a 36 - year - old Kentish landowner called Reynolde ( or Reginald ) Scot .
His A Perfite Platform of a Hoppe Garden , filled with woodcut illustrations to aid the less literate Elizabethan farmer , went to three editions in four years .
By 1577 hop cultivation had reached Herefordshire , where a “ hoppyarde ” was running at Whitbourne , near Bromyard .
The differences found in the terminology used between the West Midlands and South East England – hop yard for hop garden , hop kiln for oast house , crib rather than bin for the container the hops are picked into , for example – suggest hop - growing was started independently in the two places .
In 1655 hops were being grown in at least 14 English counties , including Somerset , though Kent accounted for a third of the total crop .
The use of bitter hop alternatives such as broom and wormwood was banned by Parliament in 1710 to ensure brewers did not try to avoid the new hop tax of a penny a pound .
However , although it was reckoned an acre of hops would bring in more profit than 50 acres of arable land in a good year , the hop farmer ’s life was more insecure than any other branch of agriculture .
An old Kentish rhyme said of hops : “ First the flea , then the fly / Then the mould , then they die . ”
Annual yields swung wildly : 1.57 million pounds of hops in 1726 , for example , 20.39 million pounds the following year .
John Banister of Horton Kirby in Kent , in a book called Synopsis of Husbandry , published in 1799 , identified a long list of different types of hop , including “ the Flemish , the Canterbury , the Goldings , the Farnham etc . ”
Goldings is still regarded as one of the great English hops , though it now comes in several varieties : it was supposedly propagated from an especially fine plant spotted not long before 1790 by Mr Golding of Malling , who was still alive in 1798 .
Stourbridge fair , just south of Cambridge , was the biggest hop mart in England in the late 17th and early 18th century .
By the late 18th century Southwark , in London , which was handily placed on the road up from Canterbury , had become the country ’s most important hop centre .
( When “ three - letter ” telephone exchange names were introduced in London before the First World War , Southwark ’s was HOP – even today , many Southwark telephone numbers still contain the numerical equivalent , 407 . )
There were 35,000 acres of hops under cultivation in Britain by 1800 , and 50,000 by 1850 .
Hop farming hit a peak of 71,789 acres in 1878 , with hops grown in 40 English counties , though the tiny Scottish hop industry , which operated in just five counties , disappeared in 1871 , and Welsh hop growing ended in 1874 .
Hops from Farnham in Surrey were regarded as the finest , followed by Kentish hops , though some brewers paid a premium for North - Clay hops grown on the stiff clays of Nottinghamshire , which were reckoned to be the best for strong keeping - beers .
New varieties of hop were still appearing : Bramling , an “ early ” variety of Goldings , named after the hamlet near Canterbury where it was discovered , was introduced about 1865 .
According to later writers , Richard Fuggle of Brenchley , Kent unveiled the hop variety that still bears his name , the second great English hop , in 1875 , though this has since been thrown into doubt .
The first Fuggles plant supposedly originated from a seed thrown out with the crumbs of a hop - picker ’s lunch at George Stace ’s farm in Horsmonden , Kent in 1861 .
A book on English hops published in 1919 listed more than 30 different hop types .
However , tastes were changing away towards sweeter , less - hopped milds , and at the same time imports of hops from Europe and the United States were increasing .
total hop acreage plunged to 51,000 in 1900 , a drop of almost 30 per cent in 22 years .
The restrictions on brewing of the First World War also hit the industry , and by 1918 there were just 16,000 acres under cultivation .
At the beginning of the 20th century it was realised that the soft resin content in hops , that is , the part that contains the alpha acids , which was first measured in 1888 , was the best test of the keeping qualities they would bring to beer .
Gradually brewers began to buy hops on their soft resin content , and growers began to plant varieties that contained a higher proportion of soft resins .
Researchers at Wye College , near Ashford in Kent cross - bred English hop varieties with native American hops , which generally have twice the alpha acid content of Europeans , but a “ fruity ” aroma English brewers had looked down upon .
One , Bramling Cross , born in 1927 of a female Bramling hop with a wild male hop from Manitoba in Canada , has become appreciated for its “ blackcurrant ” nose .
Others have had the fruitiness bred out , and the high alpha acid kept in .
Many hop varieties in use today in Europe , the United States and Australia are based on hops first developed at Wye College .
However higher alpha acid content in the hops means fewer hops are needed in the beer means fewer hops need be grown .
Total hop cultivation in England in 1976 was 17,000 acres .
By 1997 it was just 7,500 acres , with 2,400 acres in Kent , 2,300 in Herefordshire , 870 in Worcestershire , 300 in Sussex and tiny amounts in Surrey , Hampshire and Oxfordshire .
In 2006 that total had dropped to only 2,400 , just two per cent of the worldwide acreage .
A woman drove off in an unmarked Hoboken police car early Saturday morning , police said .
At 2:33 a.m. , a police officer in civilian clothing stepped out of the black Crown Victoria at 220 Seventh St. , because he noticed three people urinating in public , according to police reports .
As he was writing summonses for the three individuals , a cab driver notified the officer that a woman had gotten into the police car .
When the officer turned around , he saw the car speeding off , police said .
The car was found , abandoned , at 1033 Bloomfield St. , police said .
The case is still under investigation , police said .
COPENHAGEN --
The UN climate chief says Canada is leaving a difficult past behind and is a constructive negotiator in the current process to find a new global climate change pact .
When asked whether Canada has been hindering an agreement , as domestic and international critics have charged , Yvo de Boer , executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention for Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) , said no .
“ Canada has been negotiating very constructively in this process , ” Mr. de Boer said Wednesday .
“ Canada has a tough period behind it in terms that Canada did rise and ratify the Kyoto Protocol , but its main trading partner the United States , did not , which left it in a very unbalanced situation . ”
But Mr. de Boer added he hopes the global talks result in a “ strong and ambitious Canadian target . ”
Although Canada said it would abide by the terms of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , its greenhouse gas emissions actually increased by about 26 % between 1990 and 2007 .
Going forward , the country ’s climate change target -- a 20 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2006 levels by 2020 -- is nearly identical to that of the U.S .
Canada has now been the target of an international campaign by environmental groups who say the country has done little to halt its rising emissions and its future targets are too weak .
Just a few days into the Copenhagen meetings , it appears that some provinces will go to great lengths to distinguish their climate change policies from those of Ottawa .
In a roomful of international media Wednesday morning , a senior staff member from B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell ’s office handed out a polished package highlighting British Columbia ’s commitment to reduce emissions by 33 % by 2020 , with a tag line that the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in 2010 will be the “ greenest ever and carbon neutral . ”
Mr. Campbell is pictured shaking hands with former U.S. president Bill Clinton , who has praised B.C. ’s implementation of a carbon tax .
A news release quotes Mr. Campbell saying that he will be in Copenhagen next week to support the federal government and also to “ represent British Columbia as a sub-national jurisdiction that is taking significant steps towards addressing climate change . ”
In B.C. , Mr. Campbell said it ’s important for provincial leaders to be at the Copenhagen conference .
“ We can give national leaders a sense of confidence that this [ commitments on reducing climate change ] can be accomplished and that they ’ve got willing partners who are trying to accomplish these things , ” he said this week .
“ One of the lessons from Kyoto is you do n’t get very far in Canada if you do n’t include the provinces , ” he said .
“ The Kyoto Protocol was done without any provincial input , there was no discussion about it . ”
Federal Environment Minister Jim Prentice invited all premiers to the conference in Copenhagen this year , the premier said .
Mr. Campbell , who will be speaking at multiple conference events , will be in Copenhagen from Dec. 14 - 16 .
Other premiers , such as Quebec ’s Jean Charest , Manitoba ’s Greg Selinger , Nova Scotia ’s Darrell Dexter , and Nunavut ’s Eva Aariak , will also be travelling to Copenhagen .
With both Prentice and Prime Minister Stephen Harper hailing from Calgary , critics have said Canada ’s greenhouse gas reduction targets are being managed by the Conservative government to protect the continued growth of Alberta ’s oilsands .
The oilsands now make up about five % of Canada ’s total emissions , but Environment Canada predicts oilsands emissions will be the largest contributor to Canada ’s emissions growth in the near future , and could triple by 2020 .
Canadian negotiators note that environmental critics do not consider Canada ’s special circumstances — including the country ’s rapid population growth in the last two decades .
The meetings in Copenhagen this week and next are part of a United Nations process to find an agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol from 2012 onwards .
The early days of the conference are focused on a number of detailed , technical discussions before environment ministers and world leaders begin arriving this weekend and early next week .

When UC Davis Vice Chancellor Celeste Rose resigned under pressure last summer , the university gave her a new job with a new title , a $ 20,000 a year raise -- and very little responsibility .
In fact , Rose , 55 , is n't required to do any work at all .
As part of a secret legal settlement negotiated to avoid a potentially embarrassing lawsuit , UC Davis promised to keep Rose on the payroll as the " senior adviser to the chancellor " for two years at an annual salary of $ 205,000 , plus all the benefits of a senior manager , including health care , severance pay and a growing pension .
Yet her new job has no formal job description or regular duties .
She gave up her office on campus .
And UC promised not to fire her , no matter how little she does .
If Rose quits , she is still entitled to receive the remainder of her two years ' salary under the agreement .
In addition , UC Davis agreed to give her a $ 50,000 " transition payment " to help her find a new job , a letter of recommendation and a promise to tell reporters that she voluntarily resigned from her old position .
But in apparent violation of university policy , members of the governing Board of Regents were not told of the settlement and were not asked to give their approval .
In fact , the June 1 agreement was handled so quietly that UC Davis spokeswoman Lisa Lapin said only a few people on campus know about it .
" It 's another instance of high compensation not being disclosed , " said UC Davis law Professor Daniel Simmons , chair of the UC Davis Academic Senate .
" This is the kind of disclosure that harms the university , because these issues always become public at one point or another . "
As The Chronicle reported last month , the University of California last fiscal year gave employees hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses , administrative stipends and other hidden compensation .
In the wake of those stories , the Legislature has scheduled hearings into the issue next year , and UC President Robert Dynes formed a task force to look at revising the university 's disclosure policies .
Regent Joanne Kozberg , who was named co-chair of the task force , said she 'll have the group look into why regents were n't told about the UC Davis agreement .
" If there is a policy , it has got to be followed , " Kozberg said .
" If there is a violation , it needs to be looked into . "
Rose 's attorney , Melinda Guzman , said Rose received the settlement after threatening to sue the university for racial and gender discrimination .
Rose is African American .
The dispute began in February when UC Davis Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef told Rose in a private meeting she needed to resign at the end of June .
Guzman said Vanderhoef did n't offer a reason for the decision , which Guzman claims is part of a pattern of discrimination at the campus .
" The facts were compelling , " Guzman said .
UC has had a " repeated failure to either recruit or retain minority executive managers at the UC Davis campus . "
UC Davis officials denied they discriminated against Rose or any other executives .
But citing privacy rights surrounding personnel issues , they said they could not comment on Rose 's claim that she was essentially fired without a reason .
" If she and her attorney wish to say things , that 's their right , " said Dennis Shimek , associate vice chancellor of human resources at UC Davis .
" But that does n't make what they are saying accurate . "
Regardless of the merits of her claims , UC Davis quickly agreed to settle .
Campus officials declined to put a dollar value on the agreement , but it could be worth more than half a million dollars , including benefits .
The salary and transition payment alone add up to $ 460,000 .
In addition , it could potentially give her an additional $ 20,500 in severance and boost her annual pension by as much as $ 17,000 a year .
UC said the regents were never told of or asked to approve the settlement , despite two policies that seem to require it .
Under university policy , two key regents ( the board chairman and the chair of the finance committee ) must approve settlements of litigation or legal claims of more than $ 250,000 , including those that do not involve a lawsuit .
And the full board must approve settlements of more than $ 500,000 .
But UC spokesman Paul Schwartz said there was no need for them to know about the accord .
That 's because , he said , it 's actually a " separation agreement " -- not a settlement .
However , both the text of the agreement and the cover letter provided by UC Davis refer to the deal as a " settlement agreement . "
Rose 's attorney called it a settlement agreement .
And both sides said the deal was prompted by Rose 's legal claims of racial and gender bias .
Rose agreed to drop those claims as part of the agreement .
Separately , the regents are supposed to approve any raises or new appointments involving a salary of $ 168,000 .
Rose 's new salary of $ 205,000 was well above that threshold .
Schwartz did n't offer any explanation for why the regents did n't review her new salary .
Regardless of what the policy says , Regent John Moores said that the regents should have been told .
" It should be UC policy to fully inform the regents of the settlement of all litigation , whether real or threatened , " Moores said .
It 's unclear how many other similar agreements UC has signed without notifying the regents or the public .
Schwartz said there have been others , but could n't say how many .
Meanwhile , Rose 's attorney says her client is ready to work , but is still waiting for her first assignment .
She said UC Davis has only approached Rose about one possible project since she started the new job July 1 , and the details were vague .
UC Davis officials countered that they asked Rose to work on several assignments , but Rose rejected them .
According to the legal settlement , Rose and Vanderhoef , the UC Davis chancellor , must mutually agree on any duties .
Still , both Rose 's attorney and UC Davis agree that it was the school 's idea to give her the new job as a special adviser .
UC Davis officials said they wanted to take advantage of her extensive experience , which includes 22 years working for the university system .
Rose spent seven years as UC Davis ' vice chancellor of university relations .
" Celeste has considerable expertise in government relations and in fundraising , " said Vanderhoef .
" In her new role , she will continue to help us refine our campaign initiatives as we prepare to launch our first comprehensive fundraising campaign . "
However , Guzman , Rose 's attorney , said UC Davis only offered her the new post " when faced with a complaint and the threat of a lawsuit . "
The proposal comes after a Facebook fan page draws thousands of users following the attack
The Italian government has proposed introducing new restrictions on the Internet after a Facebook fan page for the man who allegedly attacked Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Sunday drew almost 100,000 users in under 48 hours .
But the planned clampdown on Internet hate speech sparked a heated debate over censorship and freedom of expression , leading Interior Minister Roberto Maroni to execute a partial U - turn Wednesday .
Maroni and Justice Minister Angelino Alfano promised swift action to punish those who instigate violence on the Web , suggesting the government might pass an emergency decree Thursday to create new sanctions for the offense .
But Wednesday , Maroni was at pains to reassure the public that any new legislation would be fully debated in parliament and would not curtail freedom of expression .
The controversy followed the creation of several Facebook pages praising Massimo Tartaglia , the mentally disturbed man accused of hitting Berlusconi in the face with a statuette of Milan 's gothic cathedral , sending the prime minister to the hospital with broken teeth and a broken nose .
Lawmakers from Berlusconi's People of Freedom party argued in parliament that the attack on the prime minister was the result of a climate of hate generated by virulent opposition criticism and expressed outrage that so many Italians could justify such a serious physical assault .
Facebook , which has been criticized for its slow reaction to previous complaints about groups that praised the Mafia or were titled " Let 's Kill Berlusconi , " moved rapidly to eliminate the most offensive sites .
" Promoting violence or posting threatening content is not permitted on Facebook , " the company said in a statement .
" We will take quick action to respond to reports and remove any content reported to us that makes direct threats against an individual . "
Maroni originally indicated the government was considering measures that would speed up the removal of offensive material -- by allowing police to appeal directly to a judge without passing through a prosecutor -- impose fines on hate crime offenders , and introduce filters to prevent access to sites that instigate violence .
Members of his own party , however , were quick to warn against any curtailment of Internet freedom , suggesting that current laws already provide sufficient protection against the criminal use of the Web .
" Beware of the ' China Syndrome ' , of the temptation of preventive censorship , " wrote the online magazine ffwebmagazine .
it , controlled by Berlusconi 's restive ally Gianfranco Fini , the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies .
" The act of a madman ( and the idiocy of those who praise him ) cannot call into question , even in the most distant way , our freedom of expression . "
Pierferdinando Casini , leader of the opposition Christian Democrat Union ( UDC ) , warned against introducing illiberal measures in the wake of the Tartaglia controversy .
" In the United States Obama receives constant intimidation via Internet but it never occurs to anyone to censor the Net , " Casini told parliament Tuesday .
Speaking in a video - chat on the Corriere della Sera Web site Wednesday , Maroni praised Facebook 's rapid intervention to take down the most offensive pages .
" The collaboration of the service provider is fundamental .
I want to avoid that my 12 - year - old son , when he navigates online , could come across pages that exalt terrorism , Mafia or pedophilia , " Maroni said .
The interior minister said he intended to create a working group representing all Internet stakeholders to develop a collaborative approach to tackling Internet crime .
Opponents of Berlusconi have also had reason for complaint following the Tartaglia attack .
As well as sites advocating violence against the prime minister , Facebook users have created a site called " Let 's bludgeon Antonio Di Pietro ( one of Berlusconi 's fiercest critics ) to death " .
By Tuesday it had amassed some 90,000 members .
Opponents of the prime minister were also irate when they discovered that their names had been corralled into groups expressing solidarity with Berlusconi .
The Rome daily La Repubblica reported that 2 million people who had joined a group in support of the Abruzzo earthquake victims found themselves diverted Tuesday into a pro-premier group .
Facebook has so far proved popular in Italy , notching up some 12 million active users in the 15 months since the Italian language site was introduced .
Angelo Bonelli , the head of the Green Party , said Wednesday his supporters would be staging a protest in front of parliament Thursday , despite a banning order from Rome 's police chief .
" We will protest anyway , peacefully and civilly , because what is happening to Internet and to WebTVs is an authoritarian crackdown unworthy of a democratic country , " Bonelli said .
The writer of 2004 German film Downfall has described as " tremendously amusing " the plethora of parodies featuring a ranting Hitler reacting angrily to various topical bad tidings - including the news he 's been banned from Xbox Live , and Frank Lampard is signing for Inter Milan .
The net meme may , Variety suggests , have started in 2006 , when one DReaperF4 " posted a clip on YouTube in which Hitler , in Spanish subtitles , loses it over a flight - simulator game " .
Since then , the world has been treated to a constant stream of alternative versions of varying quality , highlights including Adolf letting rip at grammar , er , strict police ...
Somwehat churlishly , Constantin Film AG has moved to get the reworkings removed from YouTube on copyright grounds .
Screenplay writer and producer Bernd Eichinger , though , expressed his admiration for the clips , and told Variety : " I find those parodies tremendously amusing .
Obviously , the film and this scene in particular is a real fire - starter for people 's imagination .
What else can you hope for as a filmmaker ?
" My favorite one so far is when Hitler is having his tantrum over his losses in the real estate crisis .
Hitler 's real crisis at the time was also about a gigantic real estate loss : the loss of all those territories he had conquered , fueled by false credit and driven by avarice , megalomania and barbaric ruthlessness .
And then history 's Dow Jones came crushing down on him …
I find this parody so funny because it 's historically relevant . "
Well , we 'll conclude by offering our particular fave , which sums it all up nicely :

In a recent conversation with Facebook ” Anarcho ” - Capitalists I ’ve been asked to provide an explanation of my beliefs starting from “ First Principles ” .
As my initial answer did n’t seem to be enough , the same question was later posted , once more , in a location I could n’t access .
I think this deserves an explanation on why it is entirely the wrong kind of question to ask when trying to understand Libertarian Socialism .
The confusion I believe starts from the way the Propertarians start to build their worldview .
From what I understand about this point ( and of course , I may be wrong – but concise information on this is not easy to find online ) they declare a few particular normative propositions as inviolable or “ true ” , call them axioms or “ first principles ” and then build their ethical system from there .
There ’s no clear agreement on this but the axiom of Self - Onwership seems to be the primary basis on which the ideology is built .
There are others like the Non-Aggression principle ( Also called Zero- Aggression principle .
NAP or ZAP ) which may follow from Self - Ownership or may be asserted standalone .
I wo n’t go into details on why those “ first principles ” are flawed at the moment ( soon though ) .
The point is to explain why such propertarians expect someone to state their first principles initially so that they may grasp the concept .
They just ca n’t contemplate a different way to reach a social framework than by starting from such “ axioms ” and when Anarchists point out that we do n’t have any , they are unable to compute , as can be seen from the quote ( from the discussion I linked above )
The implication is that logic is optional .
She ’ll deny it , of course , and say that she ’s just not doing logic in the way that the oppressive capitalists demand , but it still amounts the the notion that logic itself is seen as a kind of oppression .
It ’s a religion .
The obvious flaw in this reasoning is that it is asserted that those first principles are the result of pure logic and therefore impossible to be flawed ( thus the label of “ axiom ” ) .
Of course if one starts from this assumption it is understandable that when someone else denies the necessity of “ axioms ” to base a socioeconomic theory on , they can be seen as denying logic itself .
But this is merely begging the question .
And this is where the biggest problem lies in this perspective .
Using scholasticism ( i.e. pure logic ) to understand reality has been discredited for a while now and empiricism and inductive reasoning took its place .
No matter how perfect one ’s logic can seem , it ’s very likely that some small errors or wrong assumptions have entered into it at some point , therefore leading to the wholly wrong results .
Without empiricism thus , it impossible to find logical errors as there is nothing to compare the results with .
Thus ( many ? most ?
Well me at least . )
Libertarian Socialists reject this perspective in favour of what has been shown to actually work in understanding and predicting reality .
Science and Materialism .
Talking for myself here , I find no reason to start from a principle of self - ownership ( even if it was n’t inconsistent ) when I have the far better option to start from a ( meta ? ) ethical question : “ What bring the best results for the maximum amount of people ? ” .
Starting from this question and then using scientific knowledge ( on how humans behave and how human societies tend to work ) we can try to compile a socioeconomic system which will achieve this result .
Adding a “ first principle ” such as the NAP or self - ownership would thus only come into the picture if it followed from the original question .
Looking at it this way , one could call the Anarchist opposition to hierarchy and authority as a sort of “ first principle ” but not in the same absolute way as the AnCap ones are asserted but simply as means to an end .
And this is in the end why it ’s completely misguided to ask an Anarchist what their “ first principles ” are .
The most likely answer would be “ Why do I need them ? ” and this is a perfectly valid response .
To preempt those who would express the sentiment that having “ First Principles ” is obvious :
It is not .
The burden of proof is on people who assert that such principles are necessary to prove why this is so .
An argument from obviousness just does not cut it as it ’s far from obvious to me and many others .
I get the impression that people who assert that such first principles are necessary , are those who saw them expressed somewhere and immediately latched onto them as something that made obvious sense .
Yes , it may make obvious sense but this does not make it an absolute or an objective fact of reality .
There ’s always the chance that there ’s holes in the reasoning , or it does not make sense in some contexts .
What I ’m trying to say that even if something is making sense , it still does not validate the concept of “ first principle ” .
This is akin to saying that because the golden rule makes sense , the Christian god exists .
It simply does not follow .
It is similarly flawed thus to accept only a different set of first principles in order to counter your own ideology .
It ’s like a Christian asking someone trying to explain evolution to him , to first state which other deity they assert instead of the Christian god .
A perfectly valid answer to both questions is still “ None . ”

JPMorgan Illustrates What Banks Do When They Have Money
And it is n’t lending it out cheap :
JPMorgan will on Thursday unveil a £ 1bn deal to buy Cazenove , the UK broker with which it has had a joint venture for the past five years .
The bank is to pay about 535 p a share in a deal in which David Mayhew , widely recognised as one of the City ’s best - connected corporate advisers , will retain the title of chairman of the Cazenove brand .
Last year myself and Stirling both noted that what would be done by banks if they were bailed out is to horde their money , not lend it out cheap , and save it to buy up competitors , make leveraged plays and so on .
That is EXACTLY what has happened .
Exactly .
During a downturn , if you have money , you do n’t want to lend it out for low gains when you can buy up competitors , cheap .
You do n’t want to lend it out cheap , when you can make leveraged plays off the bottom of a stock and commodity market which is bound to go up because trillions are being poured into it by central banks .
You want to take that money , and buy things while they are cheap , not lend it out for 4 or 5 % returns , when you can make many many times that .
Why , exactly , governments expect banks who have better ways to make money to act like retail banks who do n’t have any other way to make money but lend out at prime +3 or 4 percent is beyond me .
They think they ’ll do it out of gratitude for being bailed out , or some sort of sense of civic duty ?
Most politicians may be stupid , venal and corrupt — but it ’s that very greed and venality which means they should understand that banks will do no such thing .
Banks will do it only if they are forced to do it .
Remove retail banking from investment banking , insurance and brokerage services , and disallow any risky games on the markets for retail banks .
Remove all special facilities from non retail banks because Goldman Sachs should not be doing highly leveraged plays with free money from the Federal Reserve .
And reinstitute serious leverage limits , not just for retail banks but for everyone .
As for retail banks , if they do n’t lend to the public at rates approved of by the Federal Reserve and Congress , they too should lose their access to special facilities .
Banks are given the valuable right to borrow money for almost nothing , and to , in effect , print money by lending out money they do n’t have .
Those are privileges which are given to them in the expectation that they will use them to benefit the economy .
If they refuse to do so , they should lose the privileges .
None of this is rocket science .
Those of us who predicted both the crisis and what the bungling of the crisis would cause , however , are precisely the people who are not listened to by those in power .
Obama is having his jobs summit , and forget nobodies like me , he is n’t even inviting somebodies like Stiglitz and Krugman .
If you ’ve been right down the line , then you are precisely the sort of person who is n’t “ serious ” and should n’t be listened to when it comes to what it takes to fix the problem .
Why ?
Because everyone knows that fixing the problem will end the gravy train for a lot of very rich people .
A lot of very rich people who give a great deal of money to Democrats in general , and gave a lot of money to Obama in particular .
If the cost of keeping that gravy train and the donations it enables going is tens of millions of unemployed people , well , so be it .
Because serious people know that real change is n’t going to happen under Obama or under this Democratic Congress , so there ’s no point in even talking to people who might suggest it .
Plus ca change .
Plus c’est la même chose .

Got milk hormones ?
( Natural News )
An industry report claiming that the genetically - engineered hormone Recombinant Bovine Somatotropin ( rBST ) is safe has received criticism from the Cancer Prevention Coalition ( CPC ) for its dubious findings .
Funded by producers of rBST , the report was conducted entirely by industry - paid consultants rather than by independent , credible scientists , indicating it is fallacious .
Dr. Samuel S. Epstein , chairman of the CPC , lambasted the report for failing to recognize the grave , scientifically - proven dangers imposed by rBST .
Author of the 2006 book , Dr. Epstein stated the report was " blatantly false " .
One of the primary effects of rBST on cows is that is causes them to become seriously ill with various diseases including mastitis , an infection of the udder that ultimately contaminates milk with pus .
Commonly branded as Posilac , rBST unnaturally increases milk production at the expense of the cow 's health , the repercussions of which are passed on to the consumer .
Monsanto , the original creator of rBST , was forced to reveal the truth that rBST induces roughly 20 toxic effects , all of which end up tainting the milk with disease .
When farmers then treat these illnesses with antibiotics , those too end up in the milk that is eventually drunk by unsuspecting consumers .
Research has also revealed that rBST - treated milk is both chemically and nutritionally different than natural milk and that traces of the hormone end up in the milk .
Those who drink rBST - tainted milk readily absorb the hormone in their digestive tract which is then assimilated into the blood .
Milk from rBST - treated cows contains unnaturally high levels of natural growth factor ( IGF - 1 ) which inhibits the body 's natural defense mechanisms designed to fend off cancer .
Well - documented scientific studies have implicated the hormone in precipitating prostate , breast , and colon cancer .
CPC has been working for decades to eliminate rBST from the milk supply .
In 1990 , the group issued a warning in conjunction with over 40 other organizations about the dangers of rBST .
The warning fell upon deaf ears at the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) which continued to accept the flawed notion that rBST was safe in spite of its proven dangers .
In 2007 , CPC sent a petition to the FDA entitled " Seeking Withdrawal of the New Animal Drug application for rBST " , which was endorsed by several farmer and consumer protection groups .
Citing Congressional concerns about the hormone that date back to the 1980s , as well as countless studies illustrating the toxicity of rBST , these groups labored to reform the FDA 's flawed position .
Unfortunately , the FDA ignored the facts and continues to keep the interests of industry as its priority at the expense of consumer protection .
Dr. Epstein 's recommendation , especially for children who are most susceptible to cancer - causing additives like rBST , is to choose organic milk if they are going to drink milk at all .
Organic milk is not allowed to contain rBST or any artificial hormones and is the best alternative to conventional milk that may be tainted with rBST .
Organic , is the most preferable option as it is a whole , living food rich in beneficial enzymes , probiotics , and other nutrients that get destroyed during pasteurization and homogenization .
Many believe raw milk is a perfect food rich in essential vitamins and high in protein .

* Healthcare overhaul clears first Senate hurdle
* Democrats deliver 60 votes to move to debate on bill
* Senate debate will open on Nov. 30 ( Adds reaction , details )
By John Whitesides
WASHINGTON , Nov 21 ( Reuters ) - A sweeping healthcare overhaul narrowly cleared its first hurdle in the U.S. Senate on Saturday , with Democrats casting 60 party - line votes to open debate on the biggest healthcare changes in decades .
In the first Senate test for President Barack Obama ’s top domestic priority , Democrats unanimously backed a procedural motion to open debate over the opposition of 39 Republicans .
Republican George Voinovich did not vote .
Democrats needed 60 votes to approve the motion in the 100 - member Senate and had no margin for error -- they control exactly 60 votes .
The Democratic victory was assured earlier in the day when the party ’s last two holdouts , Blanche Lincoln and Mary Landrieu , said they would support the motion but would not commit to backing the final bill without changes .
“ I believe that it is more important that we begin this debate to improve our nation ’s healthcare system for all Americans rather than just simply drop the issue and walk away , ” Lincoln said in a speech hours before the vote .
The debate will begin on Nov. 30 and is expected to last at least three weeks .
The House of Representatives has passed its own version , and differences in the two would have to be reconciled in January before Obama could sign a final measure .
The healthcare reform bill would expand coverage to millions of uninsured and bar insurance practices like denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions .
The legislation would spark the biggest changes in the $ 2.5 trillion healthcare system -- which accounts for one - sixth of the U.S. economy -- since the 1965 creation of the Medicare government health insurance plan for the elderly .
The stakes are high for Obama , with his political standing and legislative agenda on the line less than a year into his first term .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama was gratified by the vote and “ looks forward to a thorough and productive debate . ”
During a formal roll call , senators sat at their desks and called out their votes as their names were read .
Visitors in the galleries cheered when the final tally was announced .
The healthcare overhaul still faces significant challenges , with Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid trying to accommodate competing views in his party on issues like abortion , a government - run insurance plan and efforts to rein in costs .
Republicans also have vowed to delay or block the bill , which they condemned as a costly government intrusion in the private sector that would raise insurance premiums , reduce consumer choices and raise taxes .
DEBATE UNDER WAY
“ The healthcare debate is now officially under way on this 2,074 page , multi-trillion - dollar healthcare experiment , ” Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said .
He said the final Democratic holdouts had to “ twist themselves into a pretzel ” to justify voting to move ahead on the bill .
Almost all Senate bills that clear the first hurdle eventually pass , he said .
“ The easiest time to change this bill , if you were serious about it , is right now , ” McConnell told reporters .
“ The time of maximum leverage would have been before tonight ’s vote . ”
Landrieu and Lincoln , moderates from conservative Southern states where the overhaul is unpopular , said they simply wanted the debate to begin so they could work for more changes .
Lincoln , who faces a tough re-election battle next year , said she opposes the government - run insurance option included in the bill and will not vote for final passage if it remains .
“ I ’m not thinking about my re-election , the legacy of a president or whether Democrats or Republicans are going to be able to claim victory , ” she said .
Landrieu said she wanted to change the bill to make healthcare more affordable , ease the burden on small businesses and rein in the growth of costs .
“ There are enough significant reforms and safeguards in this bill to move forward , but much more work needs to be done before I can support this effort , ” Landrieu said .
Landrieu and Lincoln had been showered with attention by Reid and Obama administration officials as they pondered their vote .
In her Senate floor speech , Landrieu defended her successful effort to win more funds in the bill for Medicaid , the government health program for the poor , for her home state of Louisiana .
“ I am proud to have fought for it , ” she said .
“ But that is not the reason I am moving to debate . ”
The Senate bill would require virtually all Americans to buy insurance and would set up exchanges where they could choose among various options .
It would offer subsidies to help low - income workers pay for the coverage .
Republicans have criticized its tax increases to help pay for the expanded insurance coverage .
It would also raise the Medicare payroll tax on high - income workers , which is used to finance Medicare , and impose a tax on high - cost “ Cadillac ” insurance plans .

The First Edition is a corrected and somewhat revised version of the original version published by Springer Verlag in 1988 , which is out of print .
This corrected version is made available with the permission of Springer - Verlag .
Its form was frozen in March 2009 , but I will continue to correct any errors that come to my attention .
The Second Edition is a major revision of the original .
Permission is hereby given to freely print and circulate copies of this book so long as it is left intact and not reproduced for commercial purposes .
The author would welcome all typos and comments .
Errata to First and Second Editions
As detailed in the above link , the statement of Lemma 9.2 ( Lemma 8.8.2 in the First Edition ) is incomplete and the proof is incorrect .
The statement is corrected and a new proof provided in the erratum ( and it has been incorporated directly into the first edition ) .
As a result , the proof for Theorem 9.3 part ( f ) ( Theorem 8.3.1 in the First Edition ) is not correct .
The details may be found in the erratum .
The author is grateful to Tamas Linder for pointing out the problem .
SEGA has officially announced that Yakuza 3 will be hitting western shores in March 2010 .
Released exclusively on the PS3 in Japan on February 26 , 2009 , Sega was initially reluctant to release the game for the western audience but months of requests from fans of the series , has led to a change of plans .
Sean Ratcliffe , VP of Marketing , SEGA of America , said in a statement ,
Since its release in Japan , gamers in the west have wanted to know whether SEGA would be releasing Yakuza 3 in the west .
Today I ’d like to tell all the Yakuza fans .
We ’ve heard you .
We ’re bringing it .
Get ready for your initiation into the Japanese underworld !
The game was well received by most critics , Japanese gaming mag Famitsu rated the game 38/40 and Eurogamer gave it a respectable 8/10 .
Yakuza 3 will feature the game ’s original Japanese voiceover with full English subtitles .
The transition to the PlayStation 3 has allowed SEGA of Japanâ€™s CS1 team to add an unprecedented level of environmental detail and realism to the game â€ “ a hallmark of the series that fans have come to expect .
In this action - adventure sequel , players will take on the role of Kiryu Kazuma to explore rich and realistic environments , take part in a multitude of unique mini-games and experience the deepest combat experience in the series yet .
In addition to the familiar Tokyo haunts from the first two games , fans will also discover a completely new setting on the tropical island of Okinawa where , accompanied by his adoptive daughter Haruka , Kazuma manages an orphanage .
However , he is allowed no respite in this idyllic retreat and before long he is once again forced to deal with his sordid past .
Came across the amazing work of Kyoichi Tsuzuki who has photographed Generation X Tokyoites in Japan who have been obsessed with a brand or designer .
Apartments in Japan are generally pretty small compared to what you can find in North America and their homes are hoarding boxes for their obsessions .
You ’d imagine that people who are collectors for seemingly meaningless , overpriced , materialistic items would be unhappy , but Tsuzuki says that for them , it has the opposite effect .
He calls them “ Happy Victims ” .
The photos went into a book called Tokyo Style .
As interviewed by Theme ( highly recommended you read the interview ) , he said :
With the work that you do , what really fascinates you ?
What fascinates me most is imbalance .
You are taught that it ’s nice to have a hobby , but also that you have to think about balance — 30 % of your income should be spent on your home , 15 % on your hobby , 20 % on your food , whatever — to have a harmonious lifestyle .
But some people lose their balance .
They spend like , 80 % on their hobby .
I like that !
That might sound stupid , but that ’s energy .
A harmonious life does n’t have energy .
So that sort of imbalance encourages me .
These young people could move out to the suburbs and have better rooms ; if they did n’t spend so much money on clubbing and mobile phones , they might be able to have a better lifestyle .
But they do n’t , that ’s not their interest .
I like that they know the power to step out of balance .
Whether it ’s in their home or with fashion .
The subject might change , but it ’s that lack of balance that makes me interested .
It is interesting to read his viewpoint and to see what he sees instead of what we are conditioned to see .
( An Anna Sui Happy Victim )
Granted , I have a bit of an affinity ( and utter fascination ) with these photos , as I am the type of girl who really takes fashion and style to heart .
I probably have what people might term a small obsession with hoard - like tendencies towards jewelery and clothing .
So I can absolutely relate to having things that make me happy .
I am not going to lie and say I ’m some sort of Zen Minimalist who has nothing at all , because that could not be farther from the truth .
I just have the things that do make me happy .
With everything else , I am pretty low key .
Not much in my bathroom , not interested in decorating my home , I own a fair bit of technology but but only the things that I really do use often .
If not , I just donate it to my family .
I even live in a super small apartment with my boyfriend .
We live , eat , sleep and work in exactly one space .
I do n’t hang anything on my walls because it would make the place even more cluttered .
People find it weird , uncomfortable and hard to believe it could be comfortable .
Some have even called it devoid of personality , warmth and comfort .
But it simply could n’t be farther from the truth for me .
It all depends on your perspective .
As Tsuzuki says :
Rich people with big spaces — when there ’s more than one level in the house , and all these walkin closets — it does n’t really show what you have .
But in a three - meter by three - meter room , everything shows .
The room becomes a part of yourself .
While others find my lifestyle very stark , bare and minimalist … .
I think of myself as just putting my money and my energy in keeping what gives me the most pleasure .
I think Tsuzuki sums it up perfectly for me in this answer :
I do n’t want to say it ’s stupid , but imagine it : A very small room , the person does n’t have a lot of money but they spend all their money on books , and they fill their small room with books , you would n’t say they ’re stupid .
Right ?
But a small room filled with Comme des Garçons , looks really stupid , no ?
That is our prejudice — that the person who spends all their money on books looks better than the person with Comme des Garçons .
There ’s a hierarchy : Books have the highest position , then records , and fashion is kind of on the bottom .
But it ’s all the same .
It ’s how your passion flows .
( A Happy Victim to Martin Margiela )
This guy in the above picture does n’t even eat or cook in his apartment because he does n’t want the food smells to get anywhere close to coming near the fibers of his precious collection .
This one is sort of sad for me .

According to Wikipedia , a sloop - of - war was a small sailing warship with a single gun deck that carried up to eighteen cannons .
However , as the rating system covered all vessels with 20 guns and above , this meant that the term sloop - of - war actually encompassed all the unrated combat vessels including gun-brigs and cutters .
This novel , written by Douglas Reeman under his pen name Alexander Kent , takes place in 1778 .
This was the year when the young Richard Bolitho ’s future changed .
It was the year in which the American War of Independence changed to an all - out struggle for freedom from British rule – and the year when Bolitho took his first command as a captain , on HMS Sparrow , a small , fast and well - armed sloop of war .
As the pace of war increased , the Sparrow was called from one crisis to another – and when the great fleets of Britain and France converged on the Chesapeake , Bolitho had to throw aside the early dreams of his first command to find maturity in a sea battle that might decide the fate of a whole continent .
Sloop of War follows a format that Kent also used writing as Douglas Reeman in H. M. S. Saracen , i.e. with two separate and almost stand - alone parts to the novel .
In Sloop of War , the separation in time between the two halves is much briefer .
With Sloop of War , a quite stunning and delightful novel – packed with action and intrigue – Alexander Kent has clearly established himself as an author with virtually no equal today in writing stirring and authentic stories of the eighteenth - century Navy .
The fate of Europe 's cookie law became improbably entwined with a debate over file - sharing .
To cut a long story short , it broke free .
On 26th October , it was voted through by the Council of the EU .
It can not be stopped and awaits only the rubber - stamp formalities of signature and publication .
The vote 's result was announced by way of a whisper .
It featured at the tail end of an 18 - page Council press release ( PDF ) that first had to address fishing quotas , train driving licences and a maritime treaty with China .
I 'm afraid we missed it .
There was no attempt to bury this news – but the hushed tones of its reporting were consistent with the media attention it has received to date .
There has been almost no fuss about this little law , despite the harm it could do to advertising , the lifeblood of online publishing .
It also threatens to irritate all web users by appearing at every new destination like an over - zealous security guard .
Here 's what 's coming .
The now - finalised text says that a cookie can be stored on a user 's computer , or accessed from that computer , only if the user " has given his or her consent , having been provided with clear and comprehensive information " .
An exception exists where the cookie is " strictly necessary " for the provision of a service " explicitly requested " by the user – so cookies can take a user from a product page to a checkout without the need for consent .
Other cookies will require prior consent , though .
So almost every site that carries advertising should be seeking its visitors ' consent to the serving of cookies .
It also catches sites that count visitors – so if your site uses Google Analytics or WebTrends , you ’re caught .
You could seek consent with pop-ups , if you ’re happy to ignore accessibility guidelines that discourage pop-ups – though users ' browsers may block pop-ups by default , which risks confusion .
Or you could do it with a landing page that contains a load of information and some choices .
The choices for users could be :
Give me a load of cookies , now and in future visits , and let me get where I wanted to go in the first place – and please do n't interrupt me like this again .
Cookies sound evil .
I 'm going to use American sites instead , because they do n’t scare me with this cookie nonsense .
I do n't want cookies from your advertising partners , but I 'll gladly pay for an ad - free version of your site .
What 's that you say ?
I need cookies for that too ?
OK , but just a few please .
You need to ask each new visitor just once , of course – until the visitor deletes his ' consent ' cookie .
Like a blow to the head , that action will cause your site to forget that you 've actually met before and you 'll welcome the visitor like a stranger .
Between now and 26th April 2011 , the date this law must come into force across the EU 's 27 member states , two things will happen .
The Directive will be transposed into national laws ; and we 'll get guidance from regulatory bodies .
Each of these steps is an opportunity to mitigate the impact of this misguided law .
Our Government could take a bullet for Digital Britain .
It could interpret the Directive creatively or , to be pedantic , wrongly .
Doing that allows businesses to comply with UK law while putting the UK Government in breach of European law .
The European Commission then makes threatening noises before hauling the UK before the European Court of Justice for a shoeing , a process that generally takes a few years to resolve .
( The UK is mired in such a battle right now over the original version of the cookie law – it's just that it's not the cookie provisions in dispute . )
I doubt this will happen .
The new law amends an existing Directive , passed in 2002 .
The UK's implementation of that Directive was faithful and , given some MPs are pleading to make all behavioural advertising opt - in , there may be political will for an opt - in approach to all cookies .
Perhaps that was the motive in the EU passing this law – I really do n’t know .
If it was , behavioural advertising could be managed without wielding a sledgehammer that cracks almost all cookies .
Lawmakers should identify any harms they see in today ’s practices and legislate against the harms .
To legislate against the technology is unnecessary , short - sighted and destined to fail .
The 2002 Directive is not so different from the new law at first sight : it said that cookies should come with a " right to refuse " .
The UK implementation reproduced these words precisely .
But the Information Commissioner 's Office took a pragmatic view , saying that the right to refuse could be given after the delivery of the cookie .
Compliance was easy : you just had to put some information in your privacy policy .
The new law turns that upside down .
So a better prospect than a faulty implementation of the revised law is that our Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) publishes pragmatic guidance again .
The ICO might be motivated to do that : the cookie law is likely to be as irritating for consumers as it is for business .
This wo n't be easy , though : the new wording gives limited room for manoeuvre .
The wriggle room , such as it is , probably does n’t lie in saying that advertising or traffic monitoring are ‘ strictly necessary ’ to provide the free service ‘ explicitly requested ’ .
A better prospect is a weird recital to the Directive that suggests " the user 's consent to processing may be expressed by using the appropriate settings of a browser " .
It 's not a get - out - of - jail - free card by any means .
Remember , it 's only a recital , not an article .
Recitals are meant to explain the lawmakers ' rationale and sometimes they 're used to resolve ambiguities .
They are not meant to contradict the business end of the Directive – and this recital sounds like a contradiction ( which smacks of bad drafting ) .
We 've heard a different view of what the recital might mean , but to many it will look like a place of shelter .
Subject to whatever our domestic law says , and our ICO ’s guidance , some businesses might be tempted to hide in the confused wording of that recital .
If I was desperate to avoid landing pages and pop-ups , I would too .
The risk you run is a £ 5,000 fine , unless the penalties are increased ( which the new Directive invites member states to do ) .
That 's a gamble that many will consider worth taking because the alternative might be to haemorrhage ad revenues .

If you 're starting a new business , hiring on a shoestring budget , or simply sprucing up your home office , you 'll need some new office gear , and you probably wo n't want to spend much .
Believe it or not , Craigslist is n't just for used couches and one - night stands ; it 's also exceptionally good for finding standard office furniture ( cubicles , desks , chairs , and so on ) at unusually low prices .
However , Craigslisting is an art in itself , so we 've got some tricks that will help you seal the deal on whatever used gear your new office needs .
The Budget
Buying a basic , no - frills office chair and desk at OfficeMax will run you at least $ 170 , a phone / fax machine will cost another $ 60 , and brand - new cubicle units may be tagged at anything from $ 500 to $ 3000 apiece , depending on configuration , wall height , and filing options .
Spend a few minutes on Craigslist , however , and you 'll find plenty of office furniture that sellers need to get rid of for cheap -- or even free .
The trade - off is your time .
Though you could find a chair , a desk , a fax machine , and even some cubicles in Craigslist 's ' Free Stuff ' section , you have to be fast to pick up , because in many instances the stuff is simply left out on the street for the vultures ( that 's you ) to pick over .
We 'll help you streamline your search process and seal the deal , but be aware that bargain hunting on Craigslist can be a time - consuming process -- and you might be better off investing that time elsewhere in your business .
When budgeting for your Craigslist searches , figure time into the calculation :
If you end up spending an extra 3 hours to save $ 20 , you might have been better off buying the furniture at full price in the first place .
In short :
The goal is to get on Craigslist , get the deal , and get on with your workday .
The Search
Let 's start with searching .
Unless you have all the time in the world , you should n't begin by aimlessly browsing the ' For Sale ' sections ; instead , zero in on the relevant categories ( ' Furniture ' , ' Business ' , and ' Free Stuff ' are sensible choices ) and then start searching .
Try entering a general query ( " office furniture " ) in ' Free Stuff ' just to see what 's available at the lowest price of all .
If nothing comes up , move on to ' Furniture ' and ' Business ' .
In those three categories in the San Francisco Bay Area , I got 600 results for " office furniture , " so I decided to pare down the search results by checking the ' has image ' tag ; I figured that if the seller could n't be bothered to post an image , I probably would n't want the item anyway .
I also set the minimum price to $ 2 because I did n't want to see ads from furniture dealers submit their listings with a tagged price of $ 1 but do n't actually list any prices in the ad .
Generally speaking , furniture dealers charge higher prices than furniture owners do -- you can check them out for yourself in the ' Furniture by Owner ' and ' Furniture by Dealer ' categories .
If your needs are more specific -- a set of filing ( or " file " ) cabinets , for example , or a receptionist 's desk -- the search process is substantially easier .
Start by narrowing the search results with your price range ( and desired location , if applicable ) and then scroll through the search results .
As the " filing cabinet " / " file cabinet " example suggests , it 's a good idea to conduct separate searches for alternative terms for the same item if both names are common .
A search for " filing cabinet " produced 15 results , while a search for " file cabinet " generated 31 matches , with only four entries repeated from the " filing cabinet " list .
( A search for " file filing cabinet " returned only those four overlapping entries . )
Craigslist allows you to specify a search as the source for an RSS feed ( more on that here ) , so just click the big yellow RSS button and add it to your reader of choice to stay current without actively prowling Craigslist every 10 minutes .
On the other hand , services like Craiglook and Search Tempest offer alternative Craigslist search functions that cater to power users , like slightly more refined search options ( search terms to exclude , for example ) and the option to search other nearby Craigslist portals .
If you live in the San Francisco Bay Area and are willing to drive 250 miles , for example , Search Tempest will include Craigslist search results for the region stretching from Stockton to Sacramento .
Free Day is January 7th , 2010 !
Pocket $ 100 worth of free stuff !
No really .
It 's coming on January 7th .
We 're opening up our doors and letting anyone take $ 100 worth of free goodies .
Also , a reminder that SparkFun will be closed at the end of this week !

You can blame it on Chris Anderson 's book Free .
After reading his book , I started kicking around the idea of what we can do that 's ' free ' .
Sure , we have free bits ( open - source hardware designs , available code , etc. ) , but we do n't have free physical widgets .
Now combine that with our love of creating shear havoc ( AVC , C&D letter , Portable Rotary Phone ) , and you get Free Day .
Nobody gives away a free physical thing .
There 's always a catch .
So up front : you have to pay shipping .
Other than that , it 's open season .
$ 100 max per household
You pay shipping
Limit of $ 100,000 in giveaways for the day
Starts 9 AM MST January 7th , 2010
Ends 11 PM MST January 7th , 2010 ( or when we hit $ 100 k , whichever comes first )
Rainchecks for popular items will be allowed
Why are we doing this ?
It 's not that I want to create hell for the shipping , production , and the IT teams at SparkFun .
There 's a multitude of reasons .
First and foremost , we want to give back .
We 've had a stellar year in 2009 , and it 's all because of you .
So please , have a beer ( or a Stepper Motor Driver ) on us .
Second :
We wish we could sponsor more groups but we do n't have a sound way of selecting appropriate projects .
Because we can't afford to say yes to everyone , we have to say no to everyone .
It pains us every time we have to do it .
So this is a way for us to evenly enable all the students and great minds of the world to pickup a $ 100 worth of free gear .
Go for it !
Third : Free Day will possibly create a maelstrom of site traffic , the likes of which our servers have not seen .
At the beginning of December , 2009 , SparkFun will be graduating out of its high - chair and moving into a server cluster .
We are excited to have the breathing room , and Free Day will help us evaluate just how much breathing room we 're getting .
We 'll do everything in our power to keep the site up but please understand that the site may go down .
Fourth :
We turn 7 years old !
SparkFun is now over 70 employees and is the ripe old age of 49 ( in business and dog years ) .
We 'd like to celebrate our birthday with a party .
More nitty gritty details :
There is no special code to type in .
But you get only one order on Free Day , so spend it well !
order on Free Day , so spend it well !
Only one $ 100 credit per household .
We ask that you respect this limit and do n't try to abuse this gift .
There is no minimum or maximum order .
You can spend more than $ 100 , the balance of which will be charged to your method of payment .
Only Credit Card and Paypal orders will be eligible for the $ 100 credit .
We do n't want to have people tying up inventory with POs , wire transfers , checks in the mail , or lost faxes .
You will see whether or not your order qualifies for a credit in the checkout process .
Free Day does not apply to our distributors .
Sorry !
Gift Cards can not be bought on Free Day .
Any returns from Free Day will be exchanged for the same item .
Every order is n't going to ship on Free Day , or for a few days after .
We 've got extra tape guns on hand , but please be patient and give us some time to catch up !
We are ratcheting up inventory for Free Day , but backorders ( a.k.a. rainchecks ) are allowed on most items ( some items we simply can't get anymore ) .
We 'll get you your goodies just as soon as we can get them back in stock .
As we usually do things here at SparkFun , these rules are open for revision .
We may need to tweak them as our astute users point out how silly we are .
If we have to make any changes to the rules , we 'll let you all know here on our homepage .
So mark January 7th , 2010 on your calendars - it 's Free Day !
On another less exciting note , we want to remind everyone that SparkFun offices will be closed Thursday , November 26th and Friday , November 27th in observance of Thanksgiving !
We will not be shipping any orders these days , but you can place orders as usual .
Happy holiday season to all of our customers and for those of you traveling this week , be safe !
Cheers !
Imagine Charles Wesley attending a Christmas morning service today and hearing that his great hymn , " Hark ! The Herald Angels Sing , " would be sung .
As the congregation started singing , he would be momentarily confused , because his original began , " Hark how all the welkin rings / Glory to the King of kings , " and was not sung to the Felix Mendelssohn tune we use today .
By verse three , Wesley might get his bearings .
But when " Born to raise the sons of earth / Born to give them second birth " proved to be the last verse , he would be confused again .
He 'd likely exclaim , " But that 's not the end .
I went on to write this :
Adam 's likeness , Lord , efface ,
Stamp thy image in its place ;
Second Adam from above ,
Reinstate us in thy love .
Let us thee , though lost , regain ,
Thee , the life , the inner man ;
O , to all thyself impart ,
Formed in each believing heart . "
Then he might ask , " Why do n't you sing that verse ? "
A Good start
As evangelicals , we know how to answer the question , " Are you saved ? " :
If we have believed in Jesus Christ , we are saved — right there , right then .
Sometimes , though , the way we talk about salvation makes it sound like little more than a get - out - of - hell - free card .
With our emphasis on what sinners like ourselves are saved from , do we know what we are saved for ?
Is salvation solely about us and our need to be forgiven and born again , or is there a deeper , God -ward purpose ?
The leaders of the ancient church thought so , speaking regularly of salvation in a way that may sound strange to many evangelicals , but which Wesley alluded to in some of his hymns .
In particular , they envisioned salvation as theosis , an ongoing ...

TL Interviews Dustin Browder Text by Kennigit
I recently had the opportunity to sit down for a 30 minute interview with StarCraft II Game Director , Dustin Browder .
The man needs no introduction - especially to a community of gamers who spend so much time discussing the decisions he and the SC2 development team have made .
Dustin gave some really great and detailed answers and it was a pleasure talking with him .
I 'd like to thank CW Jung ( Community Manager ) and Bob Colayco ( PR Manager ) , who helped us set up this interview .
Enjoy !
( help a brother out ! )
Teamliquid.net :
First of all thanks for taking the time to do this interview .
I know you guys are really busy with development .
Dustin Browder : Oh , it 's our pleasure man .
TL : Dustin , we know you 've worked at a number of other studios on other franchises including RTS titles – how early in life did you decide you wanted to make games ?
DB : Well , when I was 10 I got a copy of Dungeons and Dragons for Christmas and I think by age 12 it was the center of my life .
So I did n't know what kind of careers were available in games at that time .
There were n't a lot of video game design positions back in 1982 / 83 , but I knew I wanted to do something with this .
And then it was n't until I was in college that I found out there were these positions where this stuff could be done .
Even then it was n't until I was out of college and looked around a bit to see that companies were starting to hire designers – guys specifically for content as opposed to just for engineering .
TL : So you would say DnD was one of the biggest influences in deciding you wanted to make these sorts of products ?
DB : Absolutely .
TL : I know you 've said you play a lot of other games to keep up with what other developers are doing – you mentioned Dawn of War 2 .
What types of influences do you get from SciFi movies , TV shows etc ?
DB : Oh of course , we 're always looking at everything all the time and trying to get inspiration from wherever we can .
You look at Starship Troopers or Aliens where there is obvious influence on what Blizzard has done .
We are obviously watching everything we can get our hands on to try to create moments in games .
We 've got a mission in game now that 's largely inspired by 300 , which obviously is not a science fiction movie but has those core dramatic moments that we really really enjoy .
And that is one of the great things about being a geek and being in this business – it's something that comes naturally .
This is not stuff that I would n't be doing if I was an accountant I would still be wanting to do this .
I 'd still be going to see Zombieland as many times as I could – I 'm just fortunate enough to work in a business where that has huge benefits .
TL : You had said in previous interviews that you basically had to relearn how to design games when you moved to Blizzard .
What sort of challenges did you face when getting acquainted with the range of skill levels in the StarCraft community ?
DB : It was a pretty huge challenge .
The games I 've made before look like Blizzard games ... but they 're not ( laughs ) .
And I had played quite a few Blizzard games but I have n't played them as competitively as I would have liked .
After I got here I sort of saw the difference in quality level but also depth of the gameplay and the detailed experience the players have while playing it ... and all the fine control that goes into a ‘ craft experience as opposed to games made by other studios .
And so it was really , really challenging to relearn – I think the hardest part was learning that I HAD to relearn it .
That was sort of a difficult pill to swallow ( laughs ) .
Once I got over that , it came very quickly – it became very obvious what had to happen .
I 'm also really fortunate to be surrounded by such a great bunch of guys – guys like [ senior game designer ]
Mike Heiberg and [ executive vice president of game design ]
Rob Pardo and even guys like Jeff Kaplan [ who was game director ] on the World of Warcraft team .
I 'm surrounded by a group of guys who are so talented , who ultimately just by osmosis you can pick up so much from .
One of our great strengths at this point is that we 've been able to attract , really , really AAA talent to the studio – guys that really know their stuff .
Then we are able to just teach each other as we go .
I 'm able to have lunch with Jeff Kaplan and [ game director ]
Tom Chilton whenever I want and I tell you , I learn something new everyday from those guys .
Not just about World of Warcraft , but other games as well , including what works and what does n't work in this business and what we should be shooting for .
TL : Obviously we are a StarCraft Progaming community , how much of an influence has progaming been in the development cycle and can you give us any examples ?
DB : It 's been pretty enormous .
You know , when we announced the changes to rallying and multiple unit selection stuff we knew that was going to be kind of a big deal .
I do n't think we appreciated how big of a deal it was going to be .
And then the discussions that resulted from that on your site and other sites around the community were very educational for us in what we were trying to accomplish .

You look at Starship Troopers or Aliens where there is obvious influence on what Blizzard has done .
We are obviously watching everything we can get our hands on to try to create moments in games .
We 've got a mission in game now that 's largely inspired by 300 , which obviously is not a science fiction movie but has those core dramatic moments that we really really enjoy .
And that is one of the great things about being a geek and being in this business – it's something that comes naturally .
This is not stuff that I would n't be doing if I was an accountant I would still be wanting to do this .
I 'd still be going to see Zombieland as many times as I could – I 'm just fortunate enough to work in a business where that has huge benefits .
It was a pretty huge challenge .
The games I 've made before look like Blizzard games ... but they 're not ( laughs ) .
And I had played quite a few Blizzard games but I have n't played them as competitively as I would have liked .
After I got here I sort of saw the difference in quality level but also depth of the gameplay and the detailed experience the players have while playing it ... and all the fine control that goes into a ‘ craft experience as opposed to games made by other studios .
And so it was really , really challenging to relearn – I think the hardest part was learning that I HAD to relearn it .
That was sort of a difficult pill to swallow ( laughs ) .
Once I got over that , it came very quickly – it became very obvious what had to happen .
I'm also really fortunate to be surrounded by such a great bunch of guys – guys like [ senior game designer ]
Mike Heiberg and [ executive vice president of game design ]
Rob Pardo and even guys like Jeff Kaplan [ who was game director ] on the World of Warcraft team .
I 'm surrounded by a group of guys who are so talented , who ultimately just by osmosis you can pick up so much from .
One of our great strengths at this point is that we 've been able to attract , really , really AAA talent to the studio – guys that really know their stuff .
Then we are able to just teach each other as we go .
I 'm able to have lunch with Jeff Kaplan and [ game director ]
Tom Chilton whenever I want and I tell you , I learn something new everyday from those guys .
Not just about World of Warcraft , but other games as well , including what works and what does n't work in this business and what we should be shooting for .
It 's been pretty enormous .
You know , when we announced the changes to rallying and multiple unit selection stuff we knew that was going to be kind of a big deal .
I do n't think we appreciated how big of a deal it was going to be .
And then the discussions that resulted from that on your site and other sites around the community were very educational for us in what we were trying to accomplish .
“ The benefit you guys bring to the game , the passion and knowledge this community brings has been a huge benefit working on the game .
It 's had a huge influence and I think it has made the game a lot better . ”
I do n't have specific examples , which I know you want and would love to give them to you because you 've certainly earned it .
I do n't have specific examples of units you guys have come up with or a specific post that I 've read that I thought “ Oh we need to put that in the game ! ” and went ahead and did that .
Really almost nothing in the work we do here survives the development process – I do n't ever come up with an idea ( well maybe rarely ) – almost never , that goes right into the game and that 's it .
I 'll get an idea and I 'll take it to a designer and we 'll talk about it and say “ that 's kind of cool , we 'll see how we feel about it tomorrow ” .
We go back the next day and say “ you know what , I like it but maybe we should change this from protoss to zerg and maybe it should be plus armor instead of % damage lost ” .
It will slowly get tuned and it goes through me talking with the designers , talking with Rob Pardo , talking with the lore guys , the artists , the balance guys .
At that point it 's changed so much that was it really my idea ( laughs ) ?
I dunno ...
I guess , technically I said the words that started the whole thing but it's not really my idea anymore – it has no relationship to what I originally said at the beginning .
At that point , it 's evolved into something that is really tight and good and hopefully we would like in the game .
So there is definitely stuff you guys have said that has spurred conversation – that have created things that have gone into the game but there 's no sort of one idea that we took right off a post and put in the game .
But the influences are real and are really serious and have been extremely helpful .
I 've often said and will continue to say that StarCraft II specifically has been extremely fortunate to have you guys watching over it .
The benefit you guys bring to the game , the passion and knowledge this community brings has been a huge benefit working on the game .
It 's had a huge influence and I think it has made the game a lot better .
TL : I think you 'll make a lot of nerds really happy with that .
DB : It 's the way it is man !
TL : To follow that up , what types of challenges do you face when trying to balance the needs of the casual player versus the rage of hardcore players like in the progaming community .
You had mentioned the macro mechanics being a big one .
DB : Sure that 's definitely a big one – it's a place where we feel we can definitely do better but it then does break other systems .
You know a great example I love reading on Teamliquid and elsewhere were not so much that you guys were missing clicks – some people said that and I did n't agree with that – but that we were missing the difference between a macro player and a micro player .
That we were destroying the sense of style of the player .
I could be playing a micro game and you could be playing a macro game with both the same race , and we are still playing a very different game from one another .
And when I saw that I was like “ Ohh ! ” I was opening my eyes like “ Thanks !
THERE IT IS !
That 's great !
That 's genius !
That 's exactly what we need to try to accomplish ” .
So yeah , it 's always a challenge .
It 's very easy to make units and abilities and missions and UI that appeals to the hardcore gamer .
It 's also very easy to make those kind of decisions that appeal to the very casual gamer .
The real challenge is making it easy to learn and difficult to master , which makes everybody happy .
The casual gamer has learned it easily , the hardcore guy is finding it very difficult to master .
And like I 've said before , and you see this in World of Warcraft all the time – there 's not a hardcore gamer and a casual gamer , there 's a continuum .
Casual gamers can and will become hardcore gamers if you let them .
If you create a game that 's easy to learn , the casual guy will come and sit down and play .
And if you make it really difficult to master , what you are allowing him to do is play week after week , month after month and still learn something new .
Then there 's always some reason for him to come back and so he 'll become a hardcore gamer over time .
I can't tell you how many soccer moms I 've raided with – it 's ridiculous .
These people according to conventional gaming wisdom would never be hardcore gamers , but they have better gear than I do !
And I 'm the archetype of a hardcore gamer , buying 3 or 4 games a month and staying up into the wee hours of the morning to play .
Yet here are the soccer moms out there with their purple gear and epic mounts .
I do n't have specific examples , which I know you want and would love to give them to you because you 've certainly earned it .
I do n't have specific examples of units you guys have come up with or a specific post that I 've read that I thought “ Oh we need to put that in the game ! ” and went ahead and did that .

“ Thanks !
THERE IT IS !
That 's great !
That 's genius !
That 's exactly what we need to try to accomplish . ”
So what is that ?
I do n't know but it's not the usual breakdown between casual and hardcore .
You 've made a game where they are allowed to get into it and enjoy it easily but they have a lot of trouble mastering it and become us .
So that is the goal , and that is always challenging .
That 's when it 's easy to come up with something for the casuals but does n't have any depth – so what 's the point ?
It 's very easy to come up with something that has a lot of depth and nobody will understand .
So we definitely go back and forth , and that 's one of the reasons it takes us so damned long to make our games .
Cause this stuff is hard – we 're smart guys but we 're not geniuses , so we have to work at it and put a lot of effort into it .
So we just grind on it until we 've got it to a place we are happy with .
TL : Up until Blizzcon we had heard a lot about the Queen and in previous interviews , yourself and other members of the development team had said they found Zerg to be the be pretty weak .
Now when we got to Blizzcon we played and released an article where we had said we found the Queen 's macro mechanic to be extremely powerful ( perhaps too powerful ) .
So a big discussion spurred from that about why was the development team finding Zerg to be so weak vs. our play test .
Now obviously we only had a limited amount of time with the build , but do you have any thoughts on that ?
DB : Well yeah , there 's a couple of possibilities .
One is that you guys may not have had as much time to play with it as we did .
Certainly the Queen stuff is very obvious how powerful it can be – we 've certainly found specifically at tier 2 , the Zerg lack legitimate ways to really push an advantage .
The Mutalisk has been running into a little bit more trouble with stalkers than say it would against dragoons .
Where using Blink and Warp
In are fundamentally game changing kinds of moments that suddenly change the relationship between these old units .
Certainly having watched some of the games played at Blizzcon , there 's a lot of stuff which you guys are n't using yet which is only to be expected .
You have n't really had a chance to get your hands on it for that long – you would be gods among men if you could sit down at this game and master it in 3 days .
I really hope you do n't !
( laughs )
That would really suck and we would n't have done our job if that was the case .
Obviously you guys are very skilled though so I do expect you to go through the cycle stuff of understanding very very quickly .
I would guess that maybe you are n't seeing what we 're seeing cause you have n't had enough time with it .
The other possibility of course is that we 're wrong , and you guys are correct .
And because we have n't gone to beta yet , maybe we are seeing the wrong thing .
Now while you guys do n't have enough time with it , we have a lot of time but we have a very limited player pool .
We 've expanded to the studio at large , but the studio at large is not all playing with one another .
The Diablo team is playing like crazy but they are also playing mostly with each other .
Cinematics is playing a lot but they are mostly playing with Cinematics .
We do get some cross team play but not enough that would be necessary to really shake things up and show us what 's going on .
So it 's very possible that you are correct even with your limited play time .
But simply , we have too limited a player pool and we are not pushing it as much as maybe we should .
So who knows ?
We 'll find out when we get to beta what the reality of that stuff is .
It does n't really ... well it matters to me right now and we are going to keep working on it , but we 've got plenty of time for those kinds of adjustments .
TL : When Starcraft 2 releases and the Battle . net ladder goes live will the dev team be actively seeking to make tweaks to official maps to promote racial balance ?
Or will they be trying to release standard maps and then tailoring the races like that .
For example if you look at some of the classic maps that are still played where there is relative balance from the game balance versus some modern progaming maps that are designed with dramatic features to alter how they are played upon .
DB : We 're gonna choose a selection of map types – to start with we 'll probably start with some very limited set of maps that we feel are pretty similar at a basic level and we 'll test our balance on those .
We 'll start releasing a wider set of map types probably – that may change of course - during the beta to see what kind of maps are the most fun .
We will initially be tailoring the races a little bit more to the maps rather than doing a lot of map stuff to affect the races .
But it will depend what is easiest and best for us , so we may change our mind on that .
So what is that ?
I do n't know but it's not the usual breakdown between casual and hardcore .
You 've made a game where they are allowed to get into it and enjoy it easily but they have a lot of trouble mastering it and become us .

“ I can't tell you how many soccer moms I 've raided with– it 's ridiculous .
These people according to conventional gaming wisdom would never be hardcore gamers , but they have better gear than I do ! ”
Like “ wow this game would be perfectly balanced if only we did this to the maps ” ( laughs ) .
So yeah we are definitely looking at making a standard set of maps that we riff on in a lot of creative ways and then tailoring the balance like that .
I really do feel like using map balance as a method of racial balance is something that the community has quite correctly evolved because we are n't doing a lot of patches .
And so you guys have taken over the balance for us in many ways by doing the map balance which I think is glorious and I think you do a great job .
But initially we wo n't be doing that because we know we can patch and will be patching frequently .
So initially we 'll be doing the balancing with the races themselves .
As time goes on we may evolve , I do n't know right now .
We may evolve into a similar type of formula where we are doing more with map balance but we may not .
Certainly for the next few years with the expansions we are going to be doing a lot of stuff with the races .
TL : Are there any gameplay paradigms that you as a developer see in Starcraft : Broodwar that , whether that be progaming , personal etc that you are actively trying to prevent in Starcraft 2 ?
For example sitting back and turtling in TvP .
Is there anything like that that you think “ that is not something we want to see ” ?
DB : It 's a little broader than that , but yeah all types of play that are extremely predictable where it's a given what you must do is what we are trying to disrupt .
Now we know that you guys are smart , and we know that you guys in the community are looking for ways to win the easiest , fastest and safest way possible .
So we know those things are going to happen anyways .
We know that at some point there 's going to be the ultimate Zerg build versus the ultimate Protoss build and that 's just what you should do .
But we 're going to do everything you can to make it as flexible as possible to do everything creatively on your feet at the time .
So you can't just become complacent and memorize a build and just run with it .
It 's going to be kind of a constant arms race .
We 're going to be looking for ways to make it a flexible game where there 's always new decisions to be made and always creative problems being presented to you .
At the same time , the community is going to be looking to break that – you guys are going to be looking for ways to make just one build that always wins .
Because that 's what I always want to do - always win .
So that 's going to be the challenge for us , and again it 's not that we are trying to destroy anything specific to the original Starcraft , but we are trying to limit anything that comes up where its like “ that 's the obvious move . ”
TL : OK , Blizzard has recently been making moves into the world of E - Sports - you have a dedicated E - Sports team now .
With Starcraft 2 , will you actually be organizing and sponsoring SC2 events or will you be leaving that to 3rd parties , either professional or in the community ?
DB : I think Bob [ Editor 's Note : Bob Colayco , Blizzard PR Manager for SC2 ] is going to answer this one .
Bob :
You know , we have an E - Sports team for a reason and I think you 're going to see some 3rd party stuff as well , but we definitely like to get hands on with our own things .
If you look at what we 've done with WoW Arena , we do have the tournament realms and we do regional finals that we run and we sponsor .
And then there 's the grand finals which we have at Blizzcon , so I think you 're going to see a mix of things .
I can't say anything specific
DB : I think the important message for the community with this one would be , that we love the 3rd party tournaments as well .
We love watching those , going to them and seeing them live etc .
So we want to do stuff as well , and we want to promote E - Sports overall .
Like “ wow this game would be perfectly balanced if only we did this to the maps ” ( laughs ) .
So yeah we are definitely looking at making a standard set of maps that we riff on in a lot of creative ways and then tailoring the balance like that .
I really do feel like using map balance as a method of racial balance is something that the community has quite correctly evolved because we are n't doing a lot of patches .

We love watching those , going to them and seeing them live etc .
So we want to do stuff as well , and we want to promote E - Sports overall .
“ We are trying to make this game as complete – like if nobody buys any other product , this game needs to be awesome .
Like if Blizzard gets hit by a meteor tomorrow and we all die , at least Starcraft 2 was awesome – that 's what it needs to be . ”
We want E - Sports to grow and grow and grow – ideally with our game of course , but even in the wider world of everybody 's games .
We think E - Sports is an important component of what video games could become , and we want to take this opportunity with Starcraft 2 to push E - Sports forward .
But , we really hope that lots of people out there see how fun it is and jump on board to make their own tournaments for our games or whoever 's games .
As long as we have a lot of E - Sports out there , we 'll have more E - Sports players , more sites and bigger sites .
It 's just good for the business overall and because we put so much energy into it , it 's good for us .
So we are really hoping that E - Sports , in the States specifically and in Europe as well takes off like it has in Korea where it 's huge .
We see that opportunity like “ wow this is so fun , there 's no reason this could n't be a world - wide phenomenon ” instead of one limited to a few places in the world .
TL : What is your design philosophy with regards to expansions , and have you hit a point where you have to say “ OK we 'll have to put this in the expansion ” .
And then , how do you decide “ this is something we can patch in ” versus “ this deserves its own separate product ” ?
DB : We have n't gotten to that point yet where we are designing stuff exclusively for expansions , but we have n't been throwing anything out .
If we have something that does n't fit right now but we think it 's cool , we 'll ear mark that as “ possible expansion ” .
Like at this point we 're going to be done with the original Starcraft 2 here , Wings of Liberty when they rip it out of our cold dead hands .
We are going to put every ounce of energy into this release and then we 'll worry about the expansions .
So if we have an awesome idea that will just not squeeze in , sure , we 'll earmark that for expansion .
But we are always watching to say “ hey does that suddenly fit ? ” and if it fits , we 'll put it in the ship .
TL : You already touched on this next one but with StarCraft II and the expansions are you designing it with a Global scope for the multiplayer the way we consider StarCraft + Broodwar now ?
Are there units that you think “ that could work in the future , but we can leave it for expansion ” .
DB : No we are n't leaving any intentional holes , is that what you are asking ?
TL : Yeah .
DB : No we are n't doing anything where we think “ there 's a hole here but we can fill it with the expansion ” .
We are trying to make this game complete – like if nobody buys any other product , this game needs to be awesome .
Like if Blizzard gets hit by a meteor tomorrow and we all die , at least StarCraft II was awesome – that 's what it needs to be .
Then with the expansions there 's just going to be more , and we are going to tune and tweak the gameplay and give you some more strategic options , but we are definitely not looking at this like we are going to intentionally leave blanks that can be filled later on .
That would probably be pretty lame ( laughs ) .
No , we are definitely thinking of them as separate products , like “ here is a great game .
Here is ANOTHER great game .
It 's like the other game , but great in its own right . ”
TL : Typically balance feedback has been given to developers by word of mouth – typically through forums .
Is the development team going to have any sort of method by which high end / high ranking players can directly give their feedback ?
DB : Yes ... yes .
TL : Can you give us any more ?
DB : I do n't know what we are exactly going to do , but we 've already been in discussion with some of the high ranking players around the world .
We talked to people at Blizzcon and I think we sent a professional build overseas so some of the high ranking players could take a look at it and I 've gotten the feedback from them on that .
But we are definitely going to be opening up ... I do n't know how we are exactly going to do it , whether it be a special secret forum or if we 'll do email or what .
We 'll definitely be talking to the high ranking folks , the guys who have traditionally been really great at our games and see what they think .
TL : You 've been asked before about HLTV type functionally in StarCraft II and had noted that it was on a wishlist but were n't sure that it would be there at launch .
Given that Beta has been pushed to 2010 , is this something we can expect with the final product ?
DB : I do n't know at this point which features for Battle .
net are going to make the release .
There 's a minimum set which I know is going to make it .
Then obviously there 's going to be features we patch in , and ones we do with the expansions .
Some of that is still swirling around , like which ones make which cut at which time .
Those guys are working really hard to bring the best possible feature set with the game launch , but there 's definitely stuff that 's going to be put off to the expansions and patches .
Bob :
One thing I wanted to say before we get off that topic - I really want to emphasize that people are used to seeing Battle .
net only get overhauled with each product release , but there 's going to be a concerted effort to do more in between releases with patches .
We want E - Sports to grow and grow and grow – ideally with our game of course , but even in the wider world of everybody 's games .
We think E - Sports is an important component of what video games could become , and we want to take this opportunity with Starcraft 2 to push E - Sports forward .
But , we really hope that lots of people out there see how fun it is and jump on board to make their own tournaments for our games or whoever 's games .
As long as we have a lot of E - Sports out there , we 'll have more E - Sports players , more sites and bigger sites .
It 's just good for the business overall and because we put so much energy into it , it 's good for us .
So we are really hoping that E - Sports , in the States specifically and in Europe as well takes off like it has in Korea where it 's huge .
We see that opportunity like “ wow this is so fun , there 's no reason this could n't be a world - wide phenomenon ” instead of one limited to a few places in the world .
We have n't gotten to that point yet where we are designing stuff exclusively for expansions , but we have n't been throwing anything out .
If we have something that does n't fit right now but we think it 's cool , we 'll ear mark that as “ possible expansion ” .
Like at this point we 're going to be done with the original Starcraft 2 here , Wings of Liberty when they rip it out of our cold dead hands .
We are going to put every ounce of energy into this release and then we 'll worry about the expansions .
So if we have an awesome idea that will just not squeeze in , sure , we 'll earmark that for expansion .
But we are always watching to say “ hey does that suddenly fit ? ” and if it fits , we 'll put it in the ship .
No we are n't leaving any intentional holes , is that what you are asking ?
No we are n't doing anything where we think “ there 's a hole here but we can fill it with the expansion ” .
We are trying to make this game complete – like if nobody buys any other product , this game needs to be awesome .
Like if Blizzard gets hit by a meteor tomorrow and we all die , at least StarCraft II was awesome – that 's what it needs to be .
Then with the expansions there 's just going to be more , and we are going to tune and tweak the gameplay and give you some more strategic options , but we are definitely not looking at this like we are going to intentionally leave blanks that can be filled later on .
That would probably be pretty lame ( laughs ) .
No , we are definitely thinking of them as separate products , like “ here is a great game .
Here is ANOTHER great game .
It 's like the other game , but great in its own right . ” Yes ... yes .
I do n't know what we are exactly going to do , but we 've already been in discussion with some of the high ranking players around the world .
We talked to people at Blizzcon and I think we sent a professional build overseas so some of the high ranking players could take a look at it and I 've gotten the feedback from them on that .
But we are definitely going to be opening up ... I do n't know how we are exactly going to do it , whether it be a special secret forum or if we 'll do email or what .
We 'll definitely be talking to the high ranking folks , the guys who have traditionally been really great at our games and see what they think .
I do n't know at this point which features for Battle .
net are going to make the release .
There 's a minimum set which I know is going to make it .
Then obviously there 's going to be features we patch in , and ones we do with the expansions .
Some of that is still swirling around , like which ones make which cut at which time .
Those guys are working really hard to bring the best possible feature set with the game launch , but there 's definitely stuff that 's going to be put off to the expansions and patches .
One thing I wanted to say before we get off that topic - I really want to emphasize that people are used to seeing Battle .
net only get overhauled with each product release , but there 's going to be a concerted effort to do more in between releases with patches .
“ There 's going to be some juicy stuff in between the actual product releases as we go forward . ” - Bob Colayco Again ...
I hate to bring the World of Warcraft analogy again but it is pretty analogous to the World of Warcraft content patches .
There 's going to be some juicy stuff in between the actual product releases as we go forward .
DB : We 've seen what WoW has done for our games and our community , and we have a pretty good history of patching – not always what the community would want , but we try to do well .
I think WoW has shown us what we can accomplish and the value it has for us , so we are trying to make the RTS team behave a little bit more like that in terms of how we get content patches over time .
We 'll see how we do .
Bob :
That 's for Battle . net features .
DB : Right .
TL : One last question here .
I went to the community summit at Blizzcon and had a chance to ask Tony Hsu [ EN : SC2 Producer ] this question – I wanted to hear your thoughts .
A lot of people 's jobs and careers even outside of Blizzard rely on the success of Starcraft 2 , does that immense pressure ever get to you ?
Do you ever have one of those “ .... whoa ... ” moments ?
DB : Oh yeah it 's terrifying , no question .
We are very aware of the importance of the product to a lot of different people but also to gamers at large .
We know how much they are expecting of this product , how good they want it to be etc .
At a certain point though , you have to put the horse blinders on and say “ look here 's what I 'm going to do .
I 'm going to make the best game that I can possibly make , for as many people as I possibly can .
But it 's got to be about the game and about the product .
I 'm not going to worry a ton today about a specific IGR ( Internet Game Room ) or whatever ” .
But you do take it into consideration , and it is absolutely terrifying to consider how many people need and want this product to be great and how much pressure there is to make something that is going to fulfill everyone 's expectations .
TL : I have to ask quickly about the beta – there had been hints that it would be coming in the first few months of 2010 .
What types of numbers would we be looking at for the first wave ?
And is there any sort of format for how new players will be added later on ( bulk waves , trickle in etc ) ?
DB : I do n't think I have the answer to that question , it would be a better question for Chris Sigaty as he usually keeps that stuff .
I also know that those numbers will change over time and we will decide as the beta goes forward how many people to invite based on how well we are doing with our server load , player activity etc .
It will be a little bit organic – there is n't sort of a secret document somewhere that I can read to you and say “ Oh there 's the whole plan ! ” .
We 're going to play it a little bit by ear as we go .
TL : Thanks very much – I really appreciate you guys giving us all this time since I know you are all very busy .
DB : We 'll hey thanks a lot man , it 's always a pleasure to talking to you guys .
You always have really great questions – it's just really fun talking to Teamliquid specifically .
Thanks for talking to us today .
TL : Thanks very much guys , I 'll let you get back to work !

The fact that we still have some people like this is the reason that America has n't permanently gone down the rat hole of history .
Question :
It 's eight years after 9/11 .
Why is the news media only just now telling the story of these brave folks who sailed into the debris cloud to rescue survivors while everyone was running the other way ... and then stayed for four days to pump water from the Hudson River - the only source of water in Lower Manhattan in the days after the 9/11 attacks .
By the way , when George Jr. arrived for his photo op , FEMA told the boat it had to disappear for " security " reasons .
The stories I could tell .... don't get me started .
But do get Jessica 's book .
She 'll tell you the whole story and more .
It 's about the dignity of manual work , everyday heroism , making and fixing things that matter , cool boats , and putting out fires .
Come on .
What could be better than that ?
( Also , pages 60 to 61 have some on - the - ground observations about 9/11 you may never have read anywhere else . )
Google " My River Chronicles " by Jessica DuLong .
( Yes , she 's as cute in person as she looks in the video .
She 's also a Coast Guard licensed marine engineer . )
NEW YORK —
A white sheet of paper tacked to a fence outside a Harlem church has one line written on it : Carlos lite - mover – mudanzas .
It has a drawing of a truck and a phone number .
A man ’s voice answers the number .
Yes , he ’ll use his truck to move people ’s belongings .
It ’s a way to earn some cash .
Is this a registered business he reports for taxes ?
No answer .
He quickly hangs up .
Inside the church , a moseying custodian says certainly , many of the women who come to the Thursday night meeting have informal businesses .
They sell food and makeup from their homes .
A grandmotherly woman with a sweet smile arrives .
“ No , ” she says , that ’s not true .
She quickly shakes her head with a furrowed brow .
Pinning down the informal economy is as tough as catching a fake Louis Vuitton vendor running from the police .
But it ’s huge in the United States – larger than the official output of all but the upper crust of nations across the globe .
And , due to the recent recession , it ’s growing .
Whether that ’s good or not depends entirely on one ’s point of view .
The rise of the informal economy is either the flourishing of entrepreneurship among America ’s poorest or a drag on legitimate businesses that play by the rules .
Here , on Harlem ’s Malcolm X Boulevard , you can find both .
Perhaps the biggest surprise about America ’s shadow economy is its size .
Long associated with colorful street hawkers in the developing world , the shadow economy makes up a larger portion of the economies of countries like Greece ( 25 percent ) or Mozambique ( more than 40 percent ) than it does in the US .
But because America ’s economy is so much bigger , its shadow economy amounts to nearly 8 percent of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) – in the ballpark of $ 1 trillion , estimates Friedrich Schneider , an economics professor at Johannes Kepler University in Linz , Austria .
That ’s bigger than the GDP of Turkey or Australia .
There ’s nothing particularly ominous about the shadow economy – at least , not the one Professor Schneider measures .
He does n’t include illegal activities like drug trafficking or counterfeiting .
The transactions he looks at involve the legal production of goods and services that are not taxed and may violate labor laws .
Ironically , as recession shrinks the official economy , the informal one is growing .
“ People have less ability to earn money in the official economy .
They work in the shadow economy , ” Schneider says .
“ It will grow this year by 5 percent , at least , ” in the US .
Licensed and unlicensed on Malcolm X
Along Malcolm X Boulevard , street commerce is thriving .
Vendors of incense , books , and nuts – many of whom have the proper licenses – line the sidewalks on a sunny day .
One Harlem vendor is working doubly hard , dodging pedestrians as he runs with his cart along the street .
Why wo n’t he pick a corner and stop , like the licensed street carts ?
He has to stay on foot to avoid the police , he yells as he passes .
Inside his cart : packages of white tube socks .
The positive view of such vendors is that informal work provides a space for entrepreneurship .
That fits with the findings of Robert Fairlie , an economist at the University of California at Santa Cruz .
When he calculated his most recent “ index of entrepreneurial activity ” for 2008 , he found an uptick in business creation in the US – but only at the lowest income levels .
It seems “ when the recession hit , you got a lot of people going into necessity business , ” he says in an interview .
The informal sector is also a safety net for the poor .
“ The informal economy is really something that emerges out of necessity , ” says Carolina Valencia , associate director of research of Social Compact , a Washington - based nonprofit that estimates shadow economic activity to show low - income neighborhoods ’ market strength to new businesses .
“ It makes sense that poor people and [ immigrants ] without the necessary paperwork would be more involved in these activities . ”
Hard times for legitimate business
Here in Harlem , 10 percent of income is earned informally , Social Compact estimates .
But its mom and pop shops have taken a severe beating .
From July 2008 to the end of June this year , over a third of the neighborhood ’s small businesses closed , according to the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce .
“ Competition is competition , ” says Gene Fairbrother , the lead small - business adviser in Dallas for the National Association for the Self - Employed .
But competition from producers who do n’t pay taxes and licensing fees is n’t fair to the many struggling small businesses who play by the rules .
Mr. Fairbrother says he ’s seen an increase in the number of callers to his Shop Talk show who ask about starting a home - based business , and many say they ’re working in a salon and would rather work out of their homes or that they want to start selling food from their kitchens .
Businesses facing this price pressure should promote the benefits of regulation , he advises , instead of trying to get out from under it .
Dual economies
There are two informal economies , says Saskia Sassen , a sociology professor at Colombia University in New York .
“ You have a poverty kind of informal economy , and you have an informal economy that feeds into the high end , ” she says .
These are creative professionals such as freelance designers and performers .
It ’s the first group , however , that ’s much larger in terms of manpower , she adds .
It is so dispersed that the US Bureau of Economic Analysis judges it is n’t worth the resources to measure its output when it makes its regular GDP calculations .
So while the US government is chasing the other side of the untaxed coin – wealthy Americans who avoid taxes by stowing their income abroad – a crackdown on the domestic informal economy does n’t seem to be on the American agenda anytime soon .
For one thing , it ’s a daunting prospect .
The Internal Revenue Service or local tax authorities would have to track down thousands of elusive small vendors and follow up for payment to equal , by one estimate , the $ 100 million a year that the US could gain by taxing several hundred holders of Swiss and other foreign bank accounts .
For another , it may be discouraging an activity that keeps lower - income Americans employed .
Off - the - books work “ is probably neutral to good , ” says Alfonso Morales , a professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Wisconsin at Madison .
He argues that formal and informal economies are linked and cannot be neatly separated .
“ People who make their money in unregulated businesses probably spend it in regulated ones , ” he says .

We ’ve often observed an odd quirk in the behavior of political partisans ; they tend to exaggerate even when they could make their point without doing so .
The most recent example is the weekend protest in Washington , D.C. , at which a very large number of people turned out to criticize the Obama administration .
Fox News reported that " tens of thousands " turned out , as did all major news outlets .
The Washington , D.C. , Fire Department put the number between 60,000 and 70,000 , or over 75,000 , depending on the news organization reporting .
The New York Times said the number was " well into the tens of thousands " and that " the magnitude of the rally took the authorities by surprise , with throngs of people streaming from the White House to Capitol Hill for more than three hours . "
That ’s not a small group .
And yet , organizers claimed that 1.5 million attended .
And they quoted ABC News as saying the same thing , which ABC News did not .
The 1.5 million figure ( and even larger ones ) have since been picked up and repeated by conservative bloggers , usually attributing the number to ABC News .
If the 1.5 million figure is accurate , it would rival the 1.8 million who were officially estimated to have attended Barack Obama ’s inauguration in January , which stands as the largest crowd ever seen in Washington .
No precise count is possible for such gatherings ; people do n’t pass through turnstiles and nobody takes attendance .
Even using aerial reconnaissance and sophisticated analysis of crowd density has its pitfalls , and that was n’t done for the Sept. 12 protest .
But for the record , and until better evidence comes along , here ’s what has been reported about the size of the Sept. 12 event :
The Atlanta Journal - Constitution reported :
Atlanta Journal - Constitution : [ Protest organizer Debbie ]
Dooley estimated the size of the crowd , which stretched for blocks and spilled over to the National Mall , at 1.5 million , but that was unlikely based on the size of crowds at previous events in the capital .
The Associated Press estimated the crowd ’s size in the tens of thousands .
And indeed , The Associated Press lead its story with this :
AP : Tens of thousands of protesters fed up with government spending marched to the U.S. Capitol on Saturday …
Fox News agreed , reporting :
Fox News :
The tens of thousands of protesters marched to the U.S. Capitol chanting various slogans and waving posters …
The Wall Street Journal reported :
WSJ : A spokesman for D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services estimated the crowd at " in excess of 75,000 " people .
Local and federal law enforcement authorities do n’t provide crowd estimates .
ABC News reported :
ABC News : [ A ] pproximately 60,000 to 70,000 people flooded Pennsylvania Ave , according to the Washington DC Fire Department .
Crowd Inflation
Nevertheless , the event ’s organizers claimed that ABC ’s estimate was 1.5 million , and many conservative bloggers picked this up and repeated it , without checking .
But that is not true .
ABC never said that , and later reported :
ABC News : Matt Kibbe , president of FreedomWorks , the group that organized the event , said on stage at the rally Saturday that ABC News was reporting that 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance .
At no time did ABC News , or its affiliates , report a number anywhere near as large .
ABCNews.com reported an approximate figure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters , attributed to the Washington , D.C. , fire department .
In its reports , ABC News Radio described the crowd as " tens of thousands . "
Kibbe later apologized for attributing the number to ABC News , writing on his blog : " With a dead IPhone , I had been shown tweets from a number of different folks behind the stage citing the ABC estimate .
They did n’t say it .
I regret misrepresenting the network , as their coverage that day was fair and honest . "
But he maintained that crowd estimates in the " tens of thousands " amounted to " misreporting the significance of the event . "
Organizers of such events , regardless of their partisan leanings , commonly claim higher numbers than public officials or news reporters estimate .
When the National Park Service produced an official estimate that 460,000 had turned out for the so - called " Million Man March " in 1995 , organizers threatened to file a lawsuit .
After that , Congress prohibited the Park Service from making official estimates .
Meet the New Healthcare Boss
In a recent article for Tikkun , Dr. Arnold Relman argued that the versions of healthcare reform currently proposed by “ progressives ” all primarily involve financing healthcare and expanding coverage to the uninsured , rather than addressing the way current models of service delivery make it so expensive .
Editing out all the pro forma tut - tutting of “ private markets , ” the substance that ’s left is considerable :
“ What are those inflationary forces ? … [ M] ost important among them are the incentives in the payment and organization of medical care that cause physicians , hospitals and other medical care facilities to focus at least as much on income and profit as on meeting the needs of patients … .
The incentives in such a system reward and stimulate the delivery of more services .
That is why medical expenditures in the U.S. are so much higher than in any other country , and are rising more rapidly … .
Physicians , who supply the services , control most of the decisions to use medical resources … .
“ The economic incentives in the medical market are attracting the great majority of physicians into specialty practice , and these incentives , combined with the continued introduction of new and more expensive technology , are a major factor in causing inflation of medical expenditures .
Physicians and ambulatory care and diagnostic facilities , are largely paid on a piecework basis for each item of service provided . ”
As a healthcare worker , I have personally witnessed the kind of mutual log-rolling between specialists , and the endless addition of tests to the bill without any explanation to the patient , that Relman writes of .
The patient simply lies in bed and watches an endless parade of unknown doctors poking their heads in the door for a microsecond , along with an endless series of lab techs drawing body fluids for one test after another that ’s “ been ordered , ” with no further explanation .
The post - discharge avalanche of bills includes duns from two or three dozen doctors , most of whom the patient could n’t pick out of a police line - up .
It ’s the same kind of log-rolling that takes in place in academia , with professors assigning each other ’s ( extremely expensive and copyrighted ) texts , and systematically citing each other ’s works in order to game their stats in the Social Sciences Citation Index ( I was also a grad assistant once ) .
You might also consider Scott Adams ’ account of what happens when you pay programmers for the number of bugs they fix .
One solution to this particular problem is to have a one - to - one relationship between the patient and a general practitioner on retainer .
That ’s how the old “ lodge practice ” worked .
But that ’s illegal , you know .
In New York City , John Muney recently introduced an updated version of lodge practice : the AMG Medical Group which , for a monthly premium of $ 79 and a flat office fee of $ 10 per visit , provides a wide range of services ( limited to what its own practitioners can perform in - house ) .
But because AMG is a fixed - rate plan and does n’t charge more for “ unplanned procedures , ” the New York Department of Insurance considers it an unlicensed insurance policy .
Muney may agree , unwillingly , to a settlement arranged by his lawyer in which he charges more for unplanned procedures like treatment for a sudden ear infection .
So the state is forcing a modern - day lodge practitioner to charge more , and thereby keeping the medical and insurance cartels happy — all in the name of “ protecting the public . ”
How ’s that for irony ?
Regarding expensive machinery , I wonder how much of that is embedded rent on patents and regulatorily mandated overhead .
I ’ll bet if you removed all the legal barriers to a bunch of open - source hardware hackers reverse - engineering a homebrew version of it , you could get an MRI machine with a Factor Twenty cost reduction .
More generally , the system is racked by artificial scarcity , as Sheldon Richman observed in an interview a few months back .
Licensing systems that limit the number of practitioners , and arbitrarily impose levels of educational overhead beyond the requirements of the procedure actually being performed , fall into this category .
That ’s why dental hygienists ca n’t set up independent teeth - cleaning practices in most states , and nurse - practitioners are required to operate under a physician ’s “ supervision ” ( when he ’s out golfing ) .
No matter how simple and straightforward the procedure , you ’ve got to pay amortization on a full med school education and residency .
Drug patents have the same effect , increasing cost per-pill by about 2000 % on average .
As Jesse Walker argues at Reason , even if 100 % single payer were passed , it would “ still accept the institutional premises of the present medical system ” : on the one side , an “ artificially limited ” number of providers , organized through a giant bureaucratic hospital ; on the other , an enormous bureaucratic financing entity ( whether a nominally private member of the insurance cartel , or a government bureaucracy like Medicare ) .
That ’s why it ’s much more important to change the way delivery of service is organized than to reform finance .
The news comes the same week as Gov. Sanford was censured but spared impeachment by a House subcommittee investigating allegations that Sanford misused campaign money , and state planes and other assets .
Those allegations came to light after the governor secretly left the state for five days in June to visit his Argentine lover .
... In her court filing , Jenny Sanford said “ the defendant has engaged in a sexual relationship with a woman other than the plaintiff ( Jenny Sanford ) .
The plaintiff has not condoned that relationship and is informed and believes that she is entitled to a divorce ... on ground of adultery . ”
The first lady ’s filing said she “ is informed and believes that all ... matters between the parties ” -- custody of the couple ’s four sons and division of their assets -- ” will be resolved by agreement , which agreement will be presented to the court for approval and adoption . ... ”
While both Sanfords -- who married in Florida in 1989 -- regularly are described as multi-millionaires , Jenny Sanford is , in fact , the wealthier .
She is an heir to Skil saw fortune , while his wealth is largely based on illiquid land holdings .
In February 1989 [ Donald " Buz " ]
Lukens was outed by an Ohio TV station reporter on a Columbus woman 's charge that he had been paying her daughter for sex over the past three years .
The girl , Rosie Coffman , was only thirteen years old when the affair with the congressman began .
Lukens was eventually indicted and found guilty , not for rape but for contributing to the delinquency of a minor and given a slap - on - the - wrist sentence of thirty days in jail .
Refusing to resign in the face of the scandal , he was defeated in his re-election bid .
While completing his lame - duck term in Washington , Lukens was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct , this time fondling a Capitol elevator operator .
He resigned in disgrace .
One of the biggest -- and least reported -- scandals of the late - eighties was broken by the Washington Times , the conservative , Moon or Unification Church - backed newspaper .
The first inkling of a scandal was a report about a male prostitution ring operating in the DC area .
Additional reports kept expanding on the story .
The paper claimed that Craig Spence , a Republican lobbyist , took youthful prostitutes ( one fifteen years old ) and clients on late - night tours of the [ Reagan ] White House .
It claimed that Reginald de Gueldre , a Secret Service agent , arranged the tours [ at the order of Vice President Bush aide Donald Gregg ] ; it also reported that the Secret Service " furloughed " three White House guards tied to the episode .
It reported that Spence hosted lavish parties for the Washington rich and powerful at which cocaine and other illicit pleasures were provided .
Also named in the scandal were Paul Balach , White House political personnel liaison for Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole , and Charles Dutcher , the Reagan administrations ' associate director of presidential personnel ; both charged prostitute services to their credit cards .
[ And you thought that Salahi thing was a big deal ! ]
However , the story took a bizarre twist when the paper linked the Washington goings - on to a ring that was trafficking children from Nebraska orphanages for sex orgies with Republican officials and other social worthies .
It identified Lawrence King , Jr. , an African - American Republican who operated the Omaha - based Franklin Community Credit Union , and Harold Anderson , then publisher of the Omaha World - Herald , as the ringleaders .
The scandal reached its " climax " when Spence , who had been indicted on [ crack ] cocaine and gun possession charges , was found dead in a Boston hotel room .
Hypocrisy was one of the social virtues that underscored the Clinton era and no one better expressed it than Calvert .
A tireless supporter of the Christian Coalition and " family values , " he took a principled stand against Clinton : " We can't forgive what has occurred between the President and Lewinsky . "
However , in 1993 , this upstanding citizen was caught naked in his car getting a blowjob from a hooker , only to be apprehended by the police when he attempted to flee .
He later pleaded for mercy , complaining that his father had recently committed suicide , his wife had left him and he did not know that the woman was a sex worker .
Adding insult to injury , his ex-wife denounced him for refusing to meet his child - support payments .
Yesterday South Carolina First Lady Jenny Sanford filed for divorce against tango - crazed Governor Mark .
The grounds : adultery .
Fortunately , no one ever took Sanford 's fake quest for a Biblical state -- with a sort of a South Carolina version of Sharia law -- seriously .
Otherwise he might get stoned -- and not the way his former Treasurer Tom " Teabagger " Ravenel gets stoned A little hanky panky charged to the taxpayers down in Buenos Aires is small potatoes compared to some of the stuff I 've been reading in David Rosen 's new book , Sex Scandal America .
Although " powerful congressmen , " writes Rosen , " are protected by certain privileges , " sometimes things go startlingly wrong , even for them .
Lukens was caught on camera trying to make a deal with Rosie 's African - American mom at a McDonald's .
Lukens , who had paid Rosie $ 40 for sex , appealed his conviction on the grounds that she was already a delinquent when he seduced her !
Appropriately enough John Boehner , one of the most blatantly corrupt men to ever serve in the House of Representatives , beat Lukens in the Republican primary and followed in his political footsteps .
( He was later convicted on bribery and conspiracy charges for actions he took while in Congress ; not Boehner , Lukens . )
But Lukens ' story is nothing compared to one going on at the heart of the Republican Party simultaneously .
Ever hear the name Craig Spence , Craig J. Spence ?
Although just a big shot Republican operative and lobbyist and not a member of Congress , he was kind of the Patrick McHenry of his day , in terms of providing powerful gay Republicans with boy - toys .
Like McHenry 's business / love partner , Spence was found dead in a hotel ... suicided .
Back to Rosen 's book :
Many of these people are dead or retired .
Not so with a sick and corrupt current Republican congressman , Ken Calvert , who represents an Inland Empire district , CA - 45 .
Calvert is widely considered one of the most hypocritical members of the California Republican congressional delegation .
Rosen looked into his case as well : Last year voters nearly retired Calvert -- even after Boehner came to his rescue by assigning him to the Appropriations Committee , where he was able to amass a huge war chest .
Last year Calvert spent $ 1,150,432 in his re-election campaign , while grassroots Democrat Bill Hedrick only managed to spend $ 191,461 , though nearly getting as many votes .
This year the two will face off again .

ATHEISTS have accused the Brumby Government of discriminating against them by refusing to fund the movement 's global conference in Melbourne but giving $ 2 million to a religious conference .
The Parliament of the World 's Religions begins on December 3 at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre .
It has received $ 2 million from the Federal Government and $ 500,000 from Melbourne City Council .
The Atheist Foundation of Australia says it approached all three levels of government for a total of $ 270,000 for its conference , to be held at the same venue early next year , but has received no funding .
'' This is a world - class event with world - class academic and intellectual speakers , '' foundation president David Nicholls said .
'' If I was the Catholic Church they'd be all over me like a rash .
This is an ideological decision . ''

The United States and Britain voiced disagreement Saturday over a proposal that would impose a new tax on financial transactions to support future bank rescues .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain , leading a meeting here of finance ministers from the Group of 20 rich and developing countries , said such a tax on banks should be considered as a way to take the burden off taxpayers during periods of financial crisis .
His comments pre-empted the International Monetary Fund , which is set to present a range of options next spring to ensure financial stability .
But the proposal was met with little enthusiasm by the United States Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner , who told Sky News in an interview that he would not support a tax on everyday financial transactions .
Later he seemed to soften his position , saying it would be up to the I.M.F. to present a range of possible measures .
“ We want to make sure that we do n’t put the taxpayer in a position of having to absorb the costs of a crisis in the future , ” Mr. Geithner said after the Sky News interview .
“ I ’m sure the I.M.F. will come up with some proposals . ”

During one of his Obama is delusional rants on his radio show today , Rush Limbaugh let his racism slip out again .
This time his target was Indians .
Limbaugh said , “ I do n’t know if he really believes it , but if he does , we in heap big doo doo , a little Indian lingo there .
” This comes from the same guy who once said that Indians should stop complaining , because they have casinos .
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :

Limbaugh said , “ Let me tell you something , the scariest thing when Obama told Oprah that he gave himself a B + and went through all those reasons why , the economy is coming back , we kept ourselves out of Great Depression , the world loves us , if he really believes what he said , if he really believes what he said he ’s accomplished , we are being led by a deeply delusional person .
That ’s scary , and I am dead serious about this .
If he really believes it , I do n’t know if he really believes it , but if he does , we in heap big doo doo , a little Indian lingo there . ”
The joke about Indian lingo goes hand in hand with his rant against Native Americans in September .
Limbaugh said , “ I am beginning to understand why Gadaffi ’s translator collapsed .
If I had to translate any of these people , I ’d go nuts too .
They make liars out of you , what is the holocaust , 90 million Indians , 4 million left .
They all have casinos .
What is there to complain about ? ”
This is why it is tad unbelievable to accept Limbaugh ’s claims that he is not a racist .
It is also interesting that Limbaugh managed to find something to be afraid of in the White House Christmas special that aired last night .
Maybe Limbaugh ’s real fear was based on the fact that there is an African American president ?
The Christmas at the White House special was a fairly fluffy hour .
There was n’t anything controversial in it at all .
I do have to admit that I was a little surprised that Obama gave himself a B +.
I would grade his first year as more of C+ myself , which could move to a B+ depending on how healthcare turns out .
Limbaugh somehow manage to turn a Christmas special into an attack on Obama and a racist joke about Native Americans .
2 . Their language is universal .
So they refuse to even try to speak ours when they get lost over here .
( 80 per cent do n’t even want to take a phrase book on holidays with them ! ) ... but they look at you condescendingly if you speak English badly .
Now that we have an idea of what Minimalist Homes are all about , and having looked at some examples , it ’s time to put it into practice .
There is no right or wrong way
You have to understand that there is no right or wrong way .
You can decide to just make your room look exactly like one of the pictures you see in a magazine that appeals to you , or you can decide to make an effort to keep the kitchen table clear , and to stop shopping at yard sales to bring home knick knack decorations .
But if in the event you are still unsure about what to do , here are steps to help you on your way to achieving the sought after Minimalist Look .
The 12 Steps to Achieving a Minimalist Look
Do not Try to do every Single Room at once .
You are going to bite off more than you can chew , and it ’s just asking for trouble .
Actually , it ’s technically impossible unless you get Clean Sweep to come to your home and move everything out on the lawn on neat little blankets , with a horde of helpers the show pays for .
You just ca n’t do the entire house at once all by your lonesome .
So do n’t try .
Take it one room at a time , focus on it , get it to where you want it to be , and then move on to the next .
Do not try to Work on every Single Detail in the Room .
If you start in the kitchen , do n’t start trying to take the junk drawer unless you have a whole day set aside for it .
( Read : Saturday Project : Clean out your Junk Drawer ) .
You will exhaust yourself , stress yourself out , and want to give up on this whole ordeal .
Once a Room is Finished , it ’s Off Limits to any Additions .
Do n’t start shifting clutter from one room to another .
If one room looks incredible , and you start on the second room , but then shift a little tiny end table , or three , to spoil the look of the first room , you are just fighting against your own efforts and will exhaust yourself .
Make it a rule :
Once a room is finished , it ’s off limits to any additions .
How about Starting with the Outside first ?
Sometimes the easiest thing to do , is to wet your feet .
So head outside , and start by raking the leaves , or fixing up the soil bed and patting the flowers back into place , and making it look clean and tidy on the outside .
You ’ll probably get a surge of energy from your accomplishment , and decide to head inside to do the first room in your home .
Start by Moving the Big Stuff .
Like furniture .
Take a look at your room , survey what you need and do n’t need in that room , and start hauling things out to the garage for your next big garage sale .
Keep some pieces of plain , simple furniture , and keep the colours simple and neutral .
No heavy , wild crazy patterns here , unless it ’s the ONLY one of its kind in the room .
Let ’s say you ’re in the living room .
Do you really need 4 end tables and a coffee table ?
Probably not .
Can you get rid of the end tables and just keep the coffee table ?
Or vice versa ?
Think about where you can put that furniture ( or sell it ! ) after you move it out of the room .
Maybe another room needs an end table and you were just about to splash some cash on a new one .
Even if you JUST move a couple of pieces of furniture out , and re-arrange what you ’ve got left , it might shape up to look pretty decent just the way it is .
Clear the room and Add until Satisfied .
Clear the room completely , then add back the essentials ( arranged of course ) , until you are satisfied with the room .
It may just be adding the couch and two side tables back into the room , but the rest has to go somewhere else .
Preferably , out of your home .
If you really feel like the room is too bare , and not functional enough , you can add back in a piece or two .
But remember to STOP before it gets back to the way it was before .
Maybe a Simple De-cluttering is enough .
It could be that you just need to clear the floors , surfaces and walls .
Move all the stuff of the floors .
All those stacked books , DVDs , CDs , stuffed toys .
Whatever .
Clear off the flat surfaces and file away your papers .
Leave only one single vase with a bloom in it for decoration ( or none at all .
I personally hate vases because I ’m very clumsy . )
Take down all the stuff hanging on your walls except one or two pieces of artwork .
Keep it Simple .
Simple artwork is the best , either a painting , drawing or photo , framed with a solid colour .
Do n’t forget to leave some walls bare , or else it wo n’t be very minimalist .
Simple decorations is also recommended .
One or two is enough .
You do n’t need an army of decorations for people to know that you enjoy decorating .
Keep it Out of Sight .
Maybe you CAN ’T get rid of all the papers .
I ’d suggest tucking them into file folders , and neatly filing them into drawers or cabinets .
Out of sight , out of mind .
Just make sure you know where to find them again .
My sister used to keep her receipts in a kitchen drawer .
She would come back , and stuff ALL of her receipts in the drawer .
I was at the house the other day , I opened the drawer , and I shrieked in fright .
She came in and explained her filing system .
The next day , we bought a filing box and I forced her to put everything in there .
Plain is the Name of the Game .
Window treatments , wall papers , walls , floors , rugs , and fabric on furniture .
All of these items should have neutral colours .
It might seem boring , but if you enjoyed looking at those pictures of neutral , clean looking spaces , neutral plain colours are the way to go .
If you have anything busy or bright , it ’s visual clutter .
You will look at that crazy patterned chair you took from Aunt Mae and get an immediate headache .
Alternatively , you can also keep pops of patterns and colours in a SINGLE piece of furniture in the room .
Maybe an armchair .
Do n’t go crazy .
You want colours that soothe the eye .
Beiges , dark browns , deep blues and deep greens are my favourites .
Re-visit and Eliminate .
After a room is done , give yourself a pat on the back and a celebratory glass of wine .
Wait a couple of days , and then look at the room again with a renewed sense of elimination .
You may decide to store your magazines out of sight in a covered box , or get rid of that footstool by the couch .
You may even decide to simplify even more , and get rid of more pieces of furniture you thought you needed , but really do n’t use at all .
Whatever it is , give your rooms a once - over ever so often .
It also helps keep you in check .
A Logical Place for Everything , and Everything in its Place .
Pots , stay in the kitchen .
I know it sounds strange to be saying that , but I ’ve seen homes where the kitchen supplies were stored in the living room .
What the heck !?
If you must , label your kitchen cupboards with little stickers ( or tape , my mom is a fan of masking tape ) to let you know where your pots go , your plates , your cups , your deep fryer and your wine .
Now that you ’re finished , survey your best efforts , congratulate yourself on embarking on this minimalist adventure and smile with happiness when people come in and ooh and ahh over your home .
Here ’s an example of a green NYC apartment that is absolutely perfect .
The wall of leaves are real plants to provide oxygen and the place is eco-friendlied to the max .
Mercenaries and assassins :
The real face of Obama ’s “ good war ”
By Bill Van Auken
12 December 2009
Reports that mercenaries employed by the notorious Blackwater - Xe military contracting firm participated in CIA assassinations in Iraq and Afghanistan have further exposed the real character of so - called “ good war ” that is being escalated by the Obama administration .
Citing former employees of the firm and US intelligence agents , the New York Times reported Friday that Blackwater gunmen , ostensibly contracted as security guards , “ participated in some of the CIA ’s most sensitive activities — clandestine raids with agency officers against people suspected of being insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan and the transporting of detainees . ”
These “ snatch and grab ” operations — many of them involving killings of individuals suspected of participating in the resistance to US occupation — “ occurred on an almost nightly basis during the height of the Iraqi insurgency from 2004 to 2006 , with Blackwater employees playing central roles , ” the Times reports .
Both the Times and the Washington Post quoted unnamed intelligence officials and ex-Blackwater operatives as asserting that the involvement of the company ’s mercenaries in assassinations and abductions was not planned .
Rather , they claimed , it was a matter of the division of labor between CIA operatives and private guards supposedly hired for the purpose of protecting them becoming “ blurred . ”
According to the Times , the Blackwater guards “ were supposed to only provide perimeter security during raids , leaving it up to CIA officers and Special Operations military personnel to capture or kill suspected insurgents . ”
The newspaper added , “ But in the chaos of operations , the roles of Blackwater , CIA and military personnel sometimes merged . ”
The pretense that armed Blackwater contractors , most of them former US Special Operations troops themselves , would be used merely as security guards for CIA personnel is absurd on its face .
Whatever justification was given for the contract , the “ skill set ” that Blackwater offered was precisely that of highly trained assassins .
A spokesman for Blackwater - Xe responded to the press reports by insisting that there was never any contract for the firm to participate in raids with CIA or Special Forces troops “ in Iraq , Afghanistan or anywhere else . ”
He added : “ Any allegation to the contrary by any news organization would be false . ”
The absence of a contract spelling out Blackwater ’s role in assassination missions is hardly surprising , given that the mercenary outfit ’s chief attraction for the CIA is precisely its ability to act without regard to any government oversight or regard for civil or military law .
As the Post put it , citing a retired intelligence officer , “ For government employees , working with contractors offered ways to circumvent red tape . ”
Blackwater ’s role as an extra-legal extension of the Central Intelligence Agency tasked with dirty operations with which the CIA did not want its employees directly associated is more than evident .
An article published in the current ( January ) edition of Vanity Fair , written by Adam Ciralsky , a former CIA attorney , cites intelligence sources in reporting that Eric Prince , the multi-millionaire Republican founder - owner of Blackwater , was not merely a private contractor , but a “ full - blown asset ” recruited by the agency precisely for such operations .
The central role played by Blackwater in the CIA ’s activities became increasingly clear as key agency officials left the CIA and took up positions in Blackwater ’s management .
These included J. Cofer Black , the former head of the agency ’s Counter Terrorism Center , Enrique Prado , the center ’s former chief of operations , and Rob Richer , formerly the second - in - command of the CIA ’s clandestine service .
In Iraq , Blackwater ’s employees acted with complete impunity , killing large numbers of civilians without being held to account by either the Iraqi regime or US military commanders .
The scope of this violence came to public attention in September 2007 , when a convoy of Blackwater operatives stopped in Baghdad ’s Nisour Square and without provocation opened fire on unarmed civilians , killing 17 Iraqis .
Six of the Blackwater mercenaries have been charged by federal prosecutors with voluntary manslaughter over the killings .
One of them has pled guilty and is expected to testify against the others in a trial starting in February .
Meanwhile , the company is being sued in separate civil cases brought on behalf of 70 Iraqis over killings by the firm ’s employees in Iraq .
Two ex-employees of Blackwater have filed affidavits in these cases charging that company head Prince may have either murdered or ordered the murders of individuals cooperating with the Justice Department ’s investigation of the firm .
Friday ’s report in the Times follows a series of revelations that have surfaced since last June , when CIA Director Leon Panetta briefed Congressional intelligence committees about a covert assassination program involving Blackwater , which he claimed to have only just discovered and terminated .
Panetta asserted that the program had never been implemented .
Until then , it had been kept secret from Congress , reportedly on the orders of former vice president Dick Cheney .
It was subsequently revealed that employees of Blackwater , since renamed Xe Services in an attempt to shed the firm ’s infamous reputation , were actively involved in an ongoing assassination program on the Afghanistan - Pakistan border , carried out by means of Predator drones .
The Blackwater mercenaries were assembling and loading the 500 pound bombs and Hellfire missiles used to carry out so - called “ targeted killings , ” which have taken the lives of hundreds of civilians .
In addition , they provided security for the drone bases and according to some reports , participated in intelligence operations that determined the targets for the attacks .
There have been at least 65 such aerial assassination strikes in Pakistan since August 2008 , with a reported death toll of over 625 people .
Some estimates put the number killed at over 1,000 , many of them women and children .
Most of these attacks have taken place since the Obama administration took office .
In addition to the more than 30,000 additional US troops being sent into Afghanistan , Obama has authorized the CIA to dramatically escalate the drone attacks .
US officials have also warned the Pakistani government that these attacks are to be extended beyond the tribal areas on the border with Afghanistan into Baluchistan , and potentially against the crowded city of Quetta , where Afghan Taliban leaders have reportedly taken refuge .
It is far from clear , based on the Times report , to what extent Blackwater ’s role in targeted assassinations , both from the air and on the ground , is continuing .
Since 2001 , the firm has netted over $ 1.5 billion in government contracts , providing armed mercenaries for the CIA , the State Department and the Pentagon .
One thing is certain , assassinations of the kind involving Blackwater mercenaries are going to be carried out on a far greater scale as part of Obama ’s escalation of the US war in Afghanistan .
These plans were hinted at by Central Command chief Gen. David Petraeus during his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday .
“ There ’s no question you ’ve got to kill or capture those bad guys that are not reconcilable , ” Petraeus told the senators .
“ And we are intending to do that . ”
The general continued , “ In fact , we actually will be increasing our counterterrorist component of the overall strategy . ”
He said that additional “ national mission force elements ” will be arriving in Afghanistan by next spring .
The “ elements ” cited by Petraeus include Special Operations units like the Army ’s classified Delta Force , as well as CIA hit squads and , in all probability , mercenary forces like those fielded by Blackwater .
Gen . Stanley McChrystal , tapped by Obama to direct the Afghan war , was previously the head of the super - secret Joint Special Operations Command , which consists of such special forces troops and assassination squads .
Petraeus said that McChrystal could brief members of the Senate committee on this element of the Obama surge in a closed session .
It is noteworthy that the controversy in the major media is centered on whether the use of Blackwater mercenaries to hunt down and murder individuals suspected of opposing the US occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan represented an illegitimate use of private contractors in carrying out a core government function .
The murders themselves are not an issue .
In 1976 , President Gerald Ford issued an executive order barring the CIA from directly carrying out assassinations or contracting them out to others .
The decision followed a wave of public outrage over a series of revelations of CIA assassination plots around the globe that earned the agency the epithet “ Murder , Inc . ”
In 2001 , President George W. Bush overturned Ford ’s ruling , issuing his own intelligence finding that such restrictions no longer applied in the “ global war on terrorism . ”
The Democrats offered no objections , and the media has treated it entirely as a matter of course , while blacking out any serious reporting on the resulting carnage and victims .
As with every other essential question , President Barack Obama has adopted Bush ’s policy .
“ Targeted assassinations , ” extraordinary rendition , the use of mercenaries , all of the sordid crimes carried out under the Bush administration continue .
These brutal methods are about to be unleashed with redoubled force against the peoples of Afghanistan and Pakistan as Obama oversees new war crimes .

Baghdad , Iraq ( CNN ) --
The Iraqi government Friday demanded the withdrawal of an Iranian " armed group " that it says seized an oil well in southern Iraq on Thursday night .
Iran is denying any takeover took place .
The Iraqi government issued a strong statement deploring the act after Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki headed an emergency meeting of Iraq 's National Security Council to discuss the situation .
" The council stressed that such incidents would be considered a violation of the border and violated Iraq 's sovereignty and its territories and calls upon Iran to pull out the group from well No. 4 and take down the Iranian flag from the tower of the well immediately , " Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said in the statement .
Senior Iraqi government sources initially referred to the Iranians as " security forces , " but the official Iraqi government statement later called them an " armed group . "
Drilled in 1979 , the well is in Iraq 's Maysan province , east of Amara , near the Iranian border .
It is within the province 's Fakka oil field , the Iraqi government said .
Al - Dabbagh said in the statement that the Iraqi government had summoned the Iranian ambassador in Baghdad , Hassan Kazemi Qomi , to inform him officially about the incident and asked him to provide a note to Iran 's Foreign Affairs Ministry " to address such a violation . "
The statement said the Iraqi government called upon Iran " to resolve all border problems through diplomatic dialogue and avoid the use of military force in order to preserve our common security and bilateral relations between the two countries . "
An official at the Iranian Embassy in Baghdad had said earlier that Iraqi authorities had not yet contacted them .
Iraq and Iran share a long border , and high - ranking committees from both countries handle all border matters , an Iranian Embassy official said .
Iraq and Iran fought a bloody eight - year war that ended in 1988 in a cease - fire with no clear victor and parts of the border under dispute .
But political , economic , cultural and religious ties between Iran , a predominantly Shiite Muslim nation , and Iraq , a majority Shiite Muslim nation , greatly improved after the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003 .
At the same time , there has been widespread concern among Iraqi and U.S. officials that Iran has been providing Iraqi insurgents with material for roadside bombs during the Iraq war .
The report of the oil well incident comes several days after the Oil Ministry 's two - day auction of oil fields .
Aimed at increasing Iraqi oil production , deals were struck for seven of the 15 fields offered .
There also had been oil bidding in June .

Pakistan 's military began its offensive in South Waziristan in mid-October
Pakistan 's prime minister has said its military has completed an offensive against the Taliban in the tribal region of South Waziristan .
Yousuf Raza Gilani told reporters in Lahore the operation might now move north to the Orakzai region , where many militants are thought to have fled .
The Pakistani army has not yet commented on Mr Gilani 's remarks .
However , correspondents say Mr Gilani 's words do not mean the army is pulling out of South Waziristan .
Military sources have told the BBC that the army is still facing pockets of resistance there .
The Pakistani military launched its offensive in South Waziristan , in the tribal area bordering Afghanistan , in mid-October .
Air strikes
" The operation in South Waziristan is over .
Now there are talks about Orakzai , " Mr Gilani told reporters in televised remarks on Saturday .
The BBC's Orla Guerin in Islamabad says the prime minister did not elaborate on the scale of any possible offensive in Orakzai , also in the lawless tribal belt .
The military operation in South Waziristan was the biggest in years , our correspondent says , with 30,000 troops sent into battle .
The army has managed to drive many militants from their main bases but their leaders have not been arrested and are thought to have escaped into other areas .
Hundreds of people have been killed in revenge attacks around Pakistan , she adds .
A number of air strikes have targeted militant targets in Orakzai in recent weeks .
The United Nations says more than 40,000 civilians have left their homes in Orakzai and are in need of humanitarian assistance .

Colleagues of the government drugs adviser sacked by Alan Johnson say they have " serious concerns " about his decision and whether they can continue .
Two drugs advisory panel members quit in protest when Prof David Nutt was fired for comments on cannabis policy .
Others have questioned whether they can continue in " good conscience " .
The home secretary denied reports that there will be a review of the council 's role and told MPs he would meet members to discuss the situation " shortly " .
Prof Nutt , chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , was sacked on Friday after using a lecture to say that cannabis was less harmful than alcohol and tobacco .
He also said it had been upgraded from class C to class B - against the council 's advice - for political reasons .
Earlier in the year he suggested that taking ecstasy was no more dangerous than horse riding .
In a statement to MPs , Mr Johnson said the reason for sacking Prof Nutt was not " the work of the council but because of his failure to recognise that ... his role is to advise rather than criticise " .
DEPARTING ADVISERS
Prof David Nutt - chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs Dr Les King - part - time adviser to the Department of Health , senior chemist on ACMD Marion Walker - clinical director of Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust 's substance misuse service , Royal Pharmaceutical Society 's representative on ACMD

He added that he had " lost confidence in the professor 's ability to be my principal adviser on drugs " .
Mr Johnson said Prof Nutt had " acted in a way that undermined the government rather than supporting its work " .
But he added that the advisory council , set up in 1971 , had been " invaluable to the successive governments it has served " .
The letter sent by the council to the home secretary says that , while not all remaining 28 members have been reached , " it is clear that a majority of the council have serious concerns " about Prof Nutt 's dismissal and the body 's future .
' A poodle '
It also says : " For some members these matters are of such seriousness as to raise the question whether they can , in good conscience , continue on the council .
" In this situation members wish for clarity and assurances about how the ministers view the council 's advice and will view the council 's advice in the future . "
One member , Dr Les King , resigned on Sunday in protest at Prof Nutt 's sacking .
Another , pharmacist Marion Walker , has also resigned .

Dr King told the BBC he did not think the panel could continue .
He said ministers had used the council as " a rubber stamp , as a poodle , by coming to the advisory council with a pre-determined agenda about drug classification " .
The prime minister 's spokesman said Mr Brown fully supported Mr Johnson but said Mr Brown had not been personally involved .
For the Conservatives , shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said Mr Johnson 's decision had been " the right one " , as some of Prof Nutt 's comments had been " particularly ill - judged " , but criticised the " unseemly row " .
But Liberal Democrat spokesman Chris Huhne said Prof Nutt 's comments had been " in no way contrary " to the code of practice for advisers .

Patients with coronary heart disease who practiced the stress - reducing Transcendental Meditation ® technique had nearly 50 percent lower rates of heart attack , stroke , and death compared to nonmeditating controls , according to the results of a first - ever study presented during the annual meeting of the American Heart Association in Orlando , Fla. , on Nov.16 , 2009 .
The trial was sponsored by a $ 3.8 million grant from the National Institutes of Health - National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute , and was conducted at The Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee in collaboration with the Institute for Natural Medicine and Prevention at Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield , Iowa .
The nine - year , randomized control trial followed 201 African American men and women , average age 59 years , with narrowing of arteries in their hearts who were randomly assigned to either practice the stress - reducing Transcendental Meditation technique or to participate in a control group which received health education classes in traditional risk factors , including dietary modification and exercise .
All participants continued standard medications and other usual medical care .
The study found :
• A 47 percent reduction in the combination of death , heart attacks , and strokes in the participants
• Clinically significant ( 5 mm Hg average ) reduction in blood pressure associated with decrease in clinical events
• Significant reductions in psychological stress in the high - stress subgroup
According to Robert Schneider , M.D. , FACC , lead author and director of the Center for Natural Medicine and Prevention , " Previous research on Transcendental Meditation has shown reductions in blood pressure , psychological stress , and other risk factors for heart disease , irrespective of ethnicity .
But this is the first controlled clinical trial to show that long - term practice of this particular stress reduction program reduces the incidence of clinical cardiovascular events , that is heart attacks , strokes and mortality . "
" This study is an example of the contribution of a lifestyle intervention — stress management — to the prevention of cardiovascular disease in high - risk patients , " said Theodore Kotchen , M.D. , co-author of the study , professor of medicine , and associate dean for clinical research at the Medical College .
Other investigators at the Milwaukee site included Drs. Jane Kotchen and Clarence Grim .
Dr. Schneider said that the effect of Transcendental Meditation in the trial was like adding a class of newly discovered medications for the prevention of heart disease .
" In this case , the new medications are derived from the body 's own internal pharmacy stimulated by the Transcendental Meditation practice , " he said .
Fast Facts on Coronary Heart Disease
• Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) is the leading cause of death in the United States
• There are nearly 1.5 million heart attacks per year in the US , according to the American Heart Association
• An American will suffer a heart attack every 34 seconds
• Coronary heart disease is also the leading cause of health care costs .
More than $ 475 billion is spent annually on treating CHD , including :
-$ 100,000 for each coronary bypass surgery
-$ 50,000 for each angioplasty
-$ 30,000 for each diagnostic cardiac catheterization
• There are nearly 500,000 coronary artery bypass grafts and 1.3 million angioplasties performed every year
• Stress is thought to contribute to the development of CHD

Three tools are better than one for New Caledonian crows when it comes to attaining a treat , a team from the University of Oxford reports .
Captive crows were presented with four horizontal tubes .
One of the tubes contained some out - of - reach food ; the others contained long and medium - length hooks - but again , these were all out of beak 's reach ; a shorter hook - like tool was positioned nearby .
The researchers found that the birds picked up the short tool , then used this to grasp the medium tool , which they then employed to retrieve the longest tool from the tube , with which , finally , they could drag out the tasty morsel .
These birds , which are found on the Pacific island of New Caledonia , are known to use tools in the wild , but this study , published in the journal PLoS One , builds on their tool - using repertoire .

General principlesChords and Chord namesReading tabs ( reading my tabs ) FingeringFingerpickingOpen/alternate tuningsHarp KeysScreen settings
General principles
Just a few words about the principles that ( mostly ) have been followed in making the tabs on this site .
First of all : this is a guitar site , not a " chord " site .
The ideal " readers " I have in mind are the average ( or average - to - good - to - very - good ) guitar players , playing for their own enjoyment ( let 's not talk about the neighbours - just love them ) .
That means on the one hand that I transcribe the songs into what is convenient to play on a guitar , not necessarily into what is actually sounding -- in other words : I use the capo , just like Bob Dylan himself .
Just because a song happens to be played in the key of Eb major , does n't mean that it has to be tabbed in that key , when it is actually played in " C major " with a capo on the third fret .
2 . A corollary of this is that my aim is not just giving the chords of a song , but also to figure out as exactly as possible what is being played in the version up for study .
3 . On the other hand there is the problem of the " piano songs " and the " full band songs " .
Whereas Dylan prefers ( or preferred ; things have changed ) the keys of C major and G major on the guitar , he delights in odd , awkward keys with lots of black keys , especially C# major ( or Db major ) , when he's at the piano .
In these cases it is of course impossible to reproduce exactly what is being played .
I still use a capo ( of course ) .
In the " full band songs " - especially in later years - Dylan usually just plays the chords , in any position , usually with barre chords somewhere up on the neck .
This means that there are three main types of tabs / chord - files on this site , corresponding with three kinds of arrangements : ( 1 ) The solo acoustic songs , or songs where the guitar work is of some prominence .
Here exactness is a goal .
( 2 ) Then there is the big group of songs where no particular instrument is prominent , least of all Dylan 's guitar .
Here the aim of the tabs is to present an approximation of what is going on in the song , rather than figuring out exactly what Dylan is playing ( which in these cases is quite uninteresting , actually ) .
( 3 ) The piano songs constitute a sub-division of this group .
Many of the tabs are of rare live songs .
I presume that anyone who would want to use the tabs already knows what the songs sound like .
Therefore , more specific performance indications , apart from the fingerings , are considered unnecessary .
Chords and Chord Names
Chords and scales - a little theory and some terms .
A chord is a selection of tones which are perceived as a unity and not just as several notes sounding at the same time .
It gets its special character to a large extent thanks to the place the tones have in the tonal system , which , slightly simplified , means the hierachical system of relationships between the relevant tones of a song or a style in general .
In C major , the tone c is more central than a , which again is more central than f sharp .
It is customary to arrange the available tones in a scale , a " ladder " , and to refer to them according to their position in the scale .
The keynote is called " prime " , the tone above it " second " , the next " third " , etc .
Thus , the tones in a C major scale would be called :
------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------0------1---- -----------------------------0-----2------------------ ---------0------2-----3------------------------------- --3--------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
c d e f g a b c' prime second third fourth fifth sixth seventh octave
The most weighty tones in the scale are the prime ( or unison ) , the fifth , and the third ( in C major : c , g and e ) .
Then follow the remaining tones in the main scale ( d , f , a , and b ) , and lastly the tones that are extraneous to the scale : the semi - tones ( f sharp , e flat , etc . )
I mention the fifth before the third , but they are important in different ways .
The fifth is stable , a loyal companion to the prime , always there , not without its conflicts , but they are always resolved , and always in favour of the prime – somewhat like a good old ( or bad old , depending on the perspective ) patriarchal marriage .
In fact , one might consider all music within the western musical tradition ( until the late nineteenth century in the art- music tradition , and until this day in the popular traditions ) as nothing more than a play with the balance between these two scale steps .
As I said , the fifth is always there .
When you strike a string , it will vibrate in many different ways .
The whole string will swing and produce the loudest tone .
But all the possible equal divisions of the string will also swing , and produce overtones .
The difference in sound between different instruments is caused by different constellations of overtones – which are strong and which are not .
The division of the string in two ( at the twelfth fret ) will sound an octave higher , i.e. with a tone of the same pitch class , which will strengthen the basic tone further .
But the division in three , at the seventh fret , will produce the fifth .
( Exercise : strike a bass string while touching it at the seventh fret , but without pressing it down .
Then play the open string , and you should be able to hear the fifth in the full tone of the open string . )
Thus ,
If you play a c , you will also hear a g .
The third is a different matter .
Where the fifth gives support and reenforcement , the third adds character .
It is unstable , at times nervously shimmering , other times over - earthly sonorous .
It can not be defined as easily as the fifth .
It lies two divisions above the fifth in the series of overtones ( on the fourth fret , with the string divided in five ) and therefore sounds less strongly than the fifth .
Furthermore , it exhibits a peculiarity of the tonal system which has plagued theoreticians since the days of Pythagoras : if one stacks four fifths on top of each other – c - g , g-d , d - a and a-e – one might think that one gets to the same e as when one divides a string in five , but one does n't – one gets to a tone that lies considerably higher ( c. a quarter of a semi- tone , which is quite a lot ) .
This is not really a problem , but an opportunity : tension is the mother of all development , and the third is as tense as it gets .
The most significant difference between the fifth and the third , though , is that , whereas there is only one fifth , there are two possible places for the third .
Both c-e and c-e flat are thirds , but one is major , the other minor .
The third is the interval which decides the most fundamental character of a chord : whether it is major or minor .
C-e -g is a C major chord , c-e flat - g is C minor .
The same distinction can be drawn on the second , sixth , and seventh steps , whereas the prime , the fifth , and the fourth can only be ( violently ! ) augmented or diminished .
For " losers , cheaters , six - string abusers " ( ai n't we all ... ) .
The tabs present what is being played , by trained and proficient musicians ( yes , I 'm counting in Dylan ) .
On the one hand Dylan is an ideal artist for a beginner , since he always uses quite simple and logical chord shapes , and licks and tricks that let him get maximum effect from minimum effort .
Still , the beginner may run into problems , with strange chord names , barre chords etc .
Here 's just a few cheats .
(1) All chords , basically , go back to the three fundamental chords in a key ( in C : C , G and F ) and their minor relatives ( Am , Em , Dm ) .
Most frequent are the variations to the dominant chord , i.e. the chord on the fifth step above the key note ( G in this example ) , where the variations are different ways of creating and sustaining tension before the return to the key note .
That means that " strange " chord names can often be replaced by the simple chord without all the fuzz behind it ( Gb+ , E7 - 10 , Dm7 - 5 , Cadd9 become Gb , E , Dm , C ) .
This does not happen without loss : the " fuzz " is there for some reason ( e.g. the E7 - 10 is the quintessential blues chord , which is minor and major at the same time ; it is an E chord , but the plain E does not get the same effect ) , but functionally the plain chord will usually do the job adequately .
2 ) Chords can be replaced with their relatives .
When I was nine , before I had the finger strength to play barre chords , I discovered that I could replace most F chords with Dm or Am - one of those would usually work .
Now I know that the reason why it works is that they both share two out of three chord tones with F , which often is enough .
I do n't recommend this method , however ( unless you 're nine ) .
It is cheating , and the only person you 're fooling , in the long run , is yourself .
(3) Some songs are consistently noted with chords like Ab , Eb , Bb etc .
That is because they are played with those chords , as barre chords , and in those cases I 've seen no reason to introduce a capo .
The easiest way to avoid those barre chords , is to drop all the bs , and play E , B , A instead .
This only works if all chords have a b attached to them , though .
Other chords you 'll have to transpose based on the thorough knowledge of the outline of the fretboard that you 've gained , e.g. from the figure below .
Chord short - hand .
I usually present the chords used in the song , unless it should be obvious ( someone who does n't know how to play a C major chord probably does n't have anything to do in here anyway ... ) .
Chords are presented with one number for each string , beginning with the lowest ( 6th ) string .
An open string is 0 , a finger on the 3rd fret is 3 etc .
An unused string is marked by ' x ' , and strings that are disregarded are marked '- ' .
Thus C major looks like this : x32010 , and the recurring fill in " Blood in my Eyes " like this : x32010 -53--- -64--- -75---.
Bass notes .
I prefer to write the chords with the key note as the lowest bass note in the chord .
Thus , even though C major can be played 032010 or 332010 ( and often should be ) , either of the tones on the 6th string will disturb the " C- majority " of the chord , and is better left out , unless they are explicitly wanted , e.g. in a running bass progression .
A chord with a bass note other than the keynote is indicated with a slash between the chord name and the bass note : C/g is a C major chord with G as the lowest tone : 332010 .
The slash and the bass note can be used alone to indicate a bass progression against a sustained chord : C / b /a /g .
I usually use lower - case letters for these bass tones , because it looks less ugly .
Chord names .
In general I use the following system ( exemplified with C chords throughout ) : Major chords C : Minor chords : Cm .
The following table explains the additional symbols and chord types .
All the examples are variants of C . Third = the third note of the scale from the key note , fifth = the fifth note of the scale , etc .
Since there are only seven different steps in the scale , the second is the same as the ninth , the fourth is the same as the eleventh etc .
In chord names one will usually use the higher of these , except where the basic triad is altered ; e.g. C9 and not C2 ( but Csus4 and Cm7 - 5 ) .
The reason for this is that " sophisticated " chords are considered as extensions of the basic chord with selections from the stack of thirds above it : c - e - g continues Bb - d - f- a , which are the 7th , the 9th , the 11th and the 13th .
The convention is that a single number ( e.g. 11 ) indicates the last member of the stack to be included , not just a single tone : C11 consists of the all the tones in the stack , up to the eleventh .
Symbol Name Example Meaning 7 ( minor ) seventh x32310 the minor seventh is added to the root chord .
Note that " minor " here refers to the tone on the seventh step ( which can be both major and minor : Bb and B ) , not to the chord itself - cf. the " m7 " chord below .
Note also that " 7 " always refers to the minor seventh .
If the major seventh is used , it has to be indicated with " maj7 " .
maj7 major seventh x32000
The major seventh is added to the root chord .
Whereas the seventh chord usually has a dominant function , i.e. is used to lead back to the chord five steps lower ( C7 - > F ) , the major seventh is rather a colouring of the chord , without this " driving " effect .
m 7 x35343
The ( minor ) seventh is added to the minor chord .
Cf. the " 7 " chord above .
m7 - 5 x34340
The fifth of the m7 chord is lowered by a semitone .
9 ninth x32330
The ninth and the seventh are added to the root chord .
+ ( aug ) augmented x32110
The fifth is raised by a semitone ( half step=one fret ) o ( dim ) diminished x34242 A stack of minor thirds .
Since all the intervals in the chord are equal , any of the tones can function as root .
Thus : Co=Ebo=F#o=Ao .
Hence , there only exists three different dim chords .
11 eleventh x33333
The seventh , ninth and eleventh are added to the root chord .
Since these three tones make up the chord on the tone one step below the root ( for C : Bb ) , this chord usually functions as a conflation of these two chords .
6 sixth x35555
The sixth is added to the root chord .
sus4 suspended fourth x33010
The third is temporarily " suspended " : raised to the fourth , and left there hanging in wait for a resolution back to the root chord .
Thus , in a true sus4 chord , the third is not included .
If that is the case , the chord would be called add11 or add4 .
sus2 x30010
Same as the previous , only that the third " hangs " below , on the second .
7-10 x3234x
The blues chord par exellence .
Since it contains both the major and the minor third , the chord corresponds to the ambiguity of the third step in the blues scale .
This chord is usually called 7+9 ( or 7 # 9 ) , but since the extra tone really functions as a low third ( =tenth ) and not a raised second , I prefer the name 7 - 10 ( the raised ninth and the lowered tenth are of course the same tone on the guitar , although they are functionally different .
Subtleties , subtleties ! ) .
add
Any added tone that does not fall within the stack of thirds , upon which the rest of the system is based .
-x / +x Lowers / raises a scale step by a semitone ( one fret ) .
E.g. Cm7 - 5 and C7+13 .
Note : " + " does not mean that the 13th is added , but that it is raised .
5 " Power chord " x355 xx
A chord containing only the prime ( the root ) and the fifth .
In other words : a chord without the third .
Since the third is the tone that defines whether a chord is major or minor , the " power chord " is neutral in this respect .
( iii ) x35553
A chord in the third position , i.e. fingered so that it begins in the third fret .
Thus , the quality of the chord is not changed , only its sonority .
( I have not been quite consistent concerning this notation , mostly due to the fact that the parentheses are space - consuming . )
I usually also prefer simple names to " exact " names .
A chord like 3x3211 should perhaps ( but not necessarily ) be called G11 , but I prefer to call it F/g , since that more immediately says what is to be played ( and because it retains the ambiguity inherent in the chord , between the subdominant and the dominant , which is so central to Dylan 's tonal language ) .
See Blood in my Eyes for a more extreme case .
( I 'm beginning to change my mind on this , though .
In the more recent tabs , you 'll see G11 more often than F/g ) .
Approximated chord names are written like " G6 " ( x33000 ) or F#m7 ' ( 202200 ) for brevity .
Any chord can be fingered in many different ways .
" C " does not " mean " x32010 - that is just the simplest and usually most convenient way to finger it .
To get from chord name to a chord , you have to know where the tones are positioned on the fretboard .
The tones are distributed on the strings as follows ( e ' is the lightest string , E is the darkest ) :
e ' | | - f'- | - f# '| - g ' - | - g# '| - a'|- b || - c ' - | - c# ' | - d '- | - d # '| - e'| - g ||- g#-|-a--|-bb-|-b--|-c'|- etc. d ||-d#-|-e--|-f--|-f#-|-g-|-
A || - Bb-|-B--|-c--|-c#-|-d-|- E || -F--|-F#-|-G--|-G#-|-A-|-
To find a chord like Am / f# ( the most important chord in Trying to Get to Heaven ) , start with the basic chord ( Am ) and search out the bass tone ( f# ) on one of the darkest strings , where it can be played .
In this case there are two possibilities : on the 4th string :
e ' | | - f'- | - f# '| - g ' - | - g# '| - a'| b ||- c' -| - c# ' | - d ' - | - d # '| - e'| g || - g# -|- a --|-bb-|-b--|-c'| d ||-d#-| ( e ) -|-f--|- f# -|-g-| A || - Bb-|-B--|-c--|-c#-|-d-| E || - F--|-F#-|-G--|-G#-|-A-|
or on the 6th :
e ' | | - f'- | - f# '| - g ' - | - g# '| - a'| b ||- c' -| - c# ' | - d ' - | - d # '| - e'| g || - g# -|- a --|-bb-|-b--|-c'| d ||-d#-|- e- -|-f--|- f# -|-g-| A || - Bb-|-B--|-c--|-c#-|-d-| E || - F--|- F# -|-G--|-G#-|-A-|
The second fingering is probably the best one , since it produces a fuller chord , and since you can use all the strings - unless you precisely want the higher sound , in which case the first fingering is better .
In that case xx4555 is a third alternative .
It even has the advantage of having the key note ( A ) on the highest string , thus emphasising it .
In the same way we can find the fingering for the chord Bm7 - 5 .
First find the tones :
Bm = b , d , f# .
Add the 7th ( a ) and lower the 5th ( f# -> f ) , and we have the tones b , d , f and a .
e ' | |- f ' - | - f # '| - g ' - | - g# '|- a' |- b || - c ' - | - c# '|- d' - | - d# '| - e'| - g || - g#-|- a --|-bb-|- b --|-c'|- etc. d ||-d#-|-e--|- f --|-f#-|-g-|- A || - Bb-|- B
--|-c--|-c#-|-d-|- E ||- F --|-F#-|-G--|-G#-|- A -|-
We probably want the key note ( b ) in the bass , which in practice leaves us with the alternatives x2323x , xx( 3)435 or x2x231 .
( Note : Am / f # and Bm7 - 5 are actually chords of the same type .
Am / f# is the same chord as F #m7 - 5 .
Try it ! )

Reading Tab
The principles I 've followed in the tabs have varied a little over the years , but the following points apply , as a rule , to all files :
The rhythm is indicated above the tab , with dots for each beat and : for the heavier beats :
: . . . : . . .
In the cases where an even finer subdivision is needed , a comma is used :
: . , . , . , .
As far as possible I let the tabs be a graphical image of the rhythms , so that two spaces are of equal duration anywhere in the tab .
That way one can easily differentiate between the triple time feel of this example
: . . .
|-0---0--------------------|
|-1---1(0---0-0---0-0---0 ) -|
|-0---0(0---0-0---0-0---0 ) -| |-2---2-3---3-4---4-5---5--| |-3---3-5---5-6---6-7---7--|
|--------------------------|
and the square rhythms of this ( both from Blood in My Eyes ) :
: . . .
|-0--0---------------------|
|*1--1-(0--0--0--0--0--0 )-*|
|-0--0-(0--0--0--0--0--0 )--|
|-2--2--3--3--4--4--5--5---|
|*3--3--5--5--6--6--7--7--*|
|--------------------------|
Repeats are indicated as in the previous example , or written out ( " x3 " )
Sometimes I 've indicated rhythms also in the " chords " part of the files .
Then the bars are indicated , and the main pulse within each bar .
I 'm sorry to say that I have n't followed any consistent system to denote subdivisions of the beat , but I 've often joined such chords together with a hyphen :
| A . . . | D . A . |E A/e - E . . |
The last bar would be tabbed :

Open / alternate tunings
For some of the songs , Dylan uses alternate or open tunings .
An open tuning is a tuning where all the strings are tuned to a chord , whereas alternate tunings are other ways of altering the tuning .
Open tunings
There were tuned instruments before the guitar 's ancestors .
They were usually tuned in open fifths , usually with drone strings and one or two melody strings .
The baroque lute was tuned as an open d minor chord ( with additional bass strings ) .
The main advantage of the fourths / third tuning that we use , is the possibility of creating simple fingering patterns for many different chords in the same position .
An obvious consequence of open tunings is that playing is more limited to the key to which the open strings are tuned .
The benefits are quite simple chord shapes , at least for the basic chords , which makes it easier to do fancy things on top of those chords ; furthermore , unless one produces the other chords by simply putting a barre across all the strings , there will usually be open , sounding strings in all chords , thus giving a handy set of fancy - chords - with - very - long - names .
The most common open tunings ( and the only ones encountered in Dylan 's production ) are open D , open E and open G .
Open D and E are basically the same tuning , only one tone apart .
Open E gives a brighter sound , which may be preferable , but it has the nasty side - effect of also producing the sharp sound of a broken string more often , and of putting extra strain on the neck of the guitar , so it is recommended to tune to open D and use a capo on the 2nd fret .
Open D/E is encountered in a number of the songs on Freewheelin ' , and the entire Blood on the Tracks was originally recorded in this tuning .
For a more thorough presentation of Dylan 's use of the open D/E tuning , I refer to my introductory notes on Blood on the Tracks .

Open G is the most common slide guitar tuning , popular among delta blues players .
Since Dylan was an old delta blues player himself in his early carreer , you 'll find a few songs in this tuning .
The only song on this site , though , is I Was Young When I Left Home .
Open G D G d g b d '
Open A . Two songs uses a completely different tuning : the Freewheelin ' outtake Wichita , which I 've written more extensively about in the blog , and One too many mornings .
Open A
E A c# e a e' ( Wichita Blues ) or
E A c# e a c# ' ( One Too Many Mornings )
Alternate tunings
Again , there are really only three different tunings to keep track of in Dylan 's catalogue : drop D , drop C and double drop D ( to my knowledge he 's never played " drop dead " ) .
They all involve the 6th and deepest string : in drop D , the 6th string is tuned one step down , and in drop C , two steps .
In double drop D both the 1st and the 6th strings are tuned down to D .
Standard tuning E A d g b e' Drop D D A d g b e' Drop C C A d g b e'
Double drop D D A d g b d '
All these tunings have their own distinct sets of chords , always centering around the deepest bass tone .
An example is the chord G . In drop D tuning , the central chord is D ( 000232 ) .
Thus the natural way to finger G is 020033 .
In drop C , on the other hand , the central chord is C ( 032010 ) , and the most comfortable version of G is 220001 .
This is a G7 chord , and this is consequently the only tuning in which Dylan consistently uses the dominant 7th chord , which he usually shuns .
Another instructive example is Desolation Row , where drop C is used on the album , drop D in the live shows of 1965 / 66 .
The three tunings had their periods .
Double drop D is a thing of the early days .
Since the third in the D chord ( on the first string ) is gone , it 's a perfect tuning for modal , folky songs like Ballad of Hollis Brown or John Brown , or blues tunes like Rocks And Gravel , Motherless Children , West Texas and Quit Your Low Down Ways .
Drop D is also favoured in the early days .
It is not as insistently a D - ish tuning as double drop D - it is more versatile , used both as a folky , modal tuning as in Barbara Allen or Masters of War , and as a way of varying the sound of standard three - chord songs like Mr Tambourine Man .
Drop C is the favoured tuning in 1965 / 66 , both solo , with Robbie in hotel rooms and with the band on stage .
It gives a very forceful fundament , thanks to the doubled C in the bottom .
The merit of all these tunings is the fuller sound they produce .
This may be a need felt by a solo acoustic act , but in a band , there is a bass player to fulfill that function .
Double drop D disappeared very early , and there are no drop C songs after the 1966 tour .
But on two songs he has been faithful to drop D , throughout his carreer : " It 's alright ma " and " A Hard Rain 's A - Gonna Fall " .

Fingering
The F word .
Uh , chord .
You will not get far in the world of Dylan songs if you can't finger it .
In general , what one can say about the F chord applies to all chords where you need to finger all the strings .
There are four ways :
Barre chords .
This requires a strong index finger , but , perhaps even more , a relaxed hand : you should not press too hard either .
Your hand should know ( from experience ) just how hard you have to press to make all the strings sound clean , but without straining you hand .
Use your thumb .
Any classical guitar teacher would kill me for saying this ( and then he would kill you for following my advice ) , but in a sense , while they shoot me through the head , they are also shooting themselves in the foot .
The reason for the " thumb always behind the neck " rule is to ensure economy of means , maximum of flexibility with a minimum of physical effort , but if you do n't need to play chords like 243115 , which you do n't ( it can be done , though ... ) , the most economical thing is to use the thumb .
The switch between C=332010 and F=133211 is much , much easier and smoother with the thumb -F than with the barre - F .
Again , you do n't have to push very hard to get the sound you need .
( Besides , there is no way on earth you are ever going to look as cool as Keith Richards if you only play barre chords . )
Use only some strings , and / or open strings .
You do n't always have to finger all six strings .
If you play with an emphasis on the bass , you can do with 133xxx , or if you need the full chord or a brighter sound , xx3211 is perfectly acceptable .
In the latter case , you can even play x03211 , since a is part of the F chord .
A similar case is B flat , a terrible chord to finger the ordinary way ( x13331 ) , but much more playable as xx0331 or x5333x .
This is not limited to " standard " barre chords ; a chord like A benefits strongly from a barre treatment ( with or without the first string ) , both because it is easier , and because you can then easily switch to D / a=x04232 .
A half barre on the middle strings ( A=x02220 with the index finger bent at the last joint ) is a handy technique to have acquired .
Cheat .
Try some closely related chords instead , like D minor or A minor , or allow some open strings ( x03210 , e.g. ) .
G major .
This chord should be fingered with the middle , ring , and little fingers .
This leaves the index finger free to do other things , or to move in position for the C chord which is very likely to follow , at least in Dylan 's idiom .
This is particularly true of the embellishing figure G - C/g - G ( 320003 - 3x2013 - 320003 ) which you will find all over Dylan 's output .
Watch Joan Baez do that with the " index - finger G " in Renaldo & Clara ( or is it the Hard Rain TV special ? ) , then go and rehearse the " pinky G " instead ( I cringe everytime I watch that sequence ) .
And again , cheating can be a good thing .
You may not need the first string : 32000x is perfectly legitimate , and should it happen to sound anyway ( 320000 ) , no big harm is done - you 're just playing G6 instead ...
Dampening .
Sometimes you have to dampen some strings .
To play G11=3x3211 you need both the sixth string , which is the only g in there , and all the others , but you do n't want the a on the fifth string .
You have to mute it with the ring finger .
F6 is an even trickier chord .
It has to be played 13x231 , because you need both the c and the d .
Again , the ring finger does the muting .
( Another alternative is to play xx3535 ) .
“ How on earth . . . am I supposed to play 355443 from ‘ In the Garden ’ ? ” Answer : you 're not .
You pick some of them , perhaps different strings each time .
It 's a bit mean of me to write a chord like that , but my intentions are good .
Incidentally ( and you are never going to need this for playing Dylan ) , 243115 can be played with a " twisted barre " , with an index finger that covers both the two 1s ( second and third string ) and the 2 on the sixth string .
The chord can be called F#mmaj9 - 5 . ( Exercise 1 : find out why .
Exercise 2 : find other names for it .
[ " Gerald " is not a legitimate answer . ] )
Fingerpicking
Although he does n't use it much these days , many of the old songs use what I call " standard fingerpicking " .
I do n't know if there is such a thing , but here is what I mean , as an example .
( Chords : G and C. ' h ' in the second measure means hammer - on )
G . . . C/g . . .
|-3---------------|-----------3-----| ring finger
|-----------0-----|-0h1-------------| middle finger
|-------0-------0-|-------0-------0-| index finger
|-----0-------0---|-----2-------2---| thumb
|-----------------|-----------------| ( thumb )
|-3-------3-------|-3-------3-------| thumb
The variations are of course unlimited , but the main principle is as rock solid as the thumb ought to be :
The thumb alternates between the bass strings , and the other fingers fill in .
For examples of different patterns , more or less fully written out , see the following files :
Girl of the North Country ( several versions , fully written out )

Christer Svensson has compiled the following list of harmonica keys to Dylan 's songs .
This is by no means conclusive or based on years and years of programming or web design , just some general hints and tips .
1 . This site is best viewed with a browser .
Preferably any browser .
All the files are in valid xhtml - format , thanks to Heinrich Küttler , who did a tremendous job , cleaning up years ' worth of dubious markup .
This means that they should display correctly regardless of which browser you use .

2 . I use style sheets ( CSS ) consistently .
This gives me the opportunity to suggest some formatting , based on what I consider the best way of rendering the tabs and the articles .
3 . Some of the tabs may be too wide to be seen comfortably on the screen , or for printing .
I have n't been consistent with the number of characters per line ( my apologies for that ) , and the left frame narrows the main window , of course .
The brutal solution is to move the bar between the two windows ( click on it , hold and drag ) .
Or use a smaller text size ( " View " menu ) .
3 . Since the tabs are in a fixed - width font , you may want to adjust the default setting for these if you print out the pages .
How to do this , varies depending on the browser you 're using .
The default usually is Courier .
I 've noticed that this font gives very thin letters , which may be difficult to read ( especially at candlelight , around a campfire , or wherever people play Dylan ) .
I much prefer Lucida Console , which gives thicker letters and less widely spaced tab lines .
That is the default font for the tabs .
Again , you can change that in the browser settings .
* Alberta lowers deficit forecast 38 pct to C$ 4.3 billion
* See higher income from investments , royalties , taxes
* Raises oil price forecast , drops nagas expectations
CALGARY , Alberta , Nov 26 ( Reuters ) -
The oil - rich Canadian province of Alberta lowered its budget deficit forecast on Thursday due to higher than expected revenue from oil royalties , corporate taxes and investments .
In its fiscal second - quarter budget update , the Alberta government said it expects a deficit of C$ 4.3 billion ( $ 4.04 billion ) for the current fiscal year , down from its first - quarter forecast for a C$ 6.9 billion shortfall and from the C$4.7 billion deficit it predicted in its April budget .
“ It ’s a good news story but a deficit is still a deficit , ” Iris Evans ’ the province ’s finance minister , said on a conference call .
Alberta ran 14 straight budget surpluses until breaking its string last year as oil and gas prices plunged , reducing the government ’s take from the energy industry .
It expects to return to surplus in the 2012 - 13 fiscal year .
Government revenues for this fiscal year are now expected to be C$ 32.6 billion , up from a first - quarter estimate of C$ 29.6 billion and the budget forecast of C$ 31.6 billion .
Strengthening oil prices have boosted the province ’s expected royalty revenue .
Evans now expects to reap C$ 5.9 billion from nonrenewable resource production , a C$ 1.7 billion rise from its second quarter estimate but C$ 346 million less than its budget forecast due to low natural gas prices .
Alberta now expects oil prices to average $ 67.51 a barrel over the fiscal year , up from its $ 55.50 budget forecast .
Natural gas prices are pegged at an average C$ 3.25 per thousand cubic feet , down 41 percent from the budget estimate .
Corporate taxes are expected to be C$ 3 billion , up C$ 553 million from the budget forecast , while the estimate for investment income rose 89 percent to C$ 3.4 billion .

Check out the video of former WWE Diva and Playboy model , LaTasha Marzolla getting her second MMA win .
Move over Gina Carano , Marzolla is taking the female MMA fighting world by storm .
LaTasha Marzolla is now 2 - 0 in MMA competition .
Marzolla has looked great in two bouts , including her recent decision win over undefeated Kate McGray .
The win comes from a recent Tuff - N - Uff Future Stars of MMA Event .
The female MMA fighting is widening by the day .
The popularity of MMA and Gina Carano has inspired an upsurge in female MMA fighters .
While Carano was such a novelty early on because of her great looks , there are plenty of former models crossing over into the fighting genre .
Marzolla ’s background in both Playboy and pro wrestling make her a natural star for any female MMA promotion .
I look for big things out of Marzolla in 2010 .
On a sidenote , a funny moment in the fight comes in the final round .
Marzolla is getting pounded in the corner when a fan yells out , “ Circle out LaTasha ! ” LaTasha circles out and gets out of trouble immediately .
I just find it funny when MMA fighters are taking coaching advice from the audience and even funnier when it works !

For now , just a few remarks ...
The applet is capable of displaying various 4D polytopes in addition to the hypercube .
All the regular convex 4D polytopes are supported , as well as several compounds .
I 'll probably add some non-convex polytopes when I get around to it .

What you 're seeing :
The edges of the 4D polytope are represented as a sort of wireframe in 4D , only instead of thin wires , I have 4D struts .
The struts are 4D hypercylinders .
When their shadows are cast onto a 3 - space ( from a 4D point light source ) , they appear as 3D cylinders .
Actually , if the 4D point light source is not too distant , the 3D cylinders ' thickness should vary along their length ( they should be truncated cones ) , since the parts of the hypercylinders that are nearer to the 4D point light source should make larger shadows than those that are farther away from it .

Most retail cfos say too much inventory still biggest risk to holiday sales results , while layoffs take a back seat as retailers focus on inventory management for the remainder of 2009
By BDO Seidman LLP ,
According to a recent study by BDO Seidman , LLP , one of the nation ’s leading accounting and consulting organizations , 60 percent of chief financial officers ( CFOs ) at leading U.S. retailers say that too much inventory will pose a greater risk to holiday sales results than insufficient inventory levels .
Still , a large minority ( 40 % ) cite insufficient inventory as the bigger concern , implying that retailers are struggling to find the right product balance for the season .
While inventory levels will likely be low for the remainder of 2009 , retailers are planning to increase their inventory purchases by the second quarter of 2010 or earlier – 62 % percent of the CFOs say they will ramp up buying in the fourth quarter of 2009 through the first half of 2010 .
“ Retailers are still caught between a rock and a hard place , ” said Ted Vaughan , a partner in the Retail and Consumer Products Practice at BDO Seidman LLP .
“ Reducing inventory is necessary , but retailers run the risk of hindering selection , which can lead to disappointed customers and fewer sales .
On the other hand , merchandise overflow can lead to a frenzy of deep discounts , which can cheapen the brand and slash profits .
Ultimately , until consumer spending and confidence picks up , most retailers will continue to cut costs wherever possible , with an eye towards increasing inventory for the Spring and Summer seasons . ”
These findings are from the most recent edition of the BDO Seidman Retail Compass Survey of CFOs which examined the opinions of 100 chief financial officers at leading retailers located throughout the country .
The retailers in the study were among the largest in the country , with revenues ranging from $ 100 million to $ 100 billion , including 10 percent of the top 100 based on annual sales revenue .
The survey was conducted in August and September of 2009 .
Some of the major findings of BDO Seidman Retail Compass Survey of CFOs :
Retailers to Ramp up Inventory Purchases .
Sixty - two percent of the CFOs say they will ramp up buying by the first half of 2010 .
Specifically , 21 percent will increase purchases in the fourth quarter of 2009 , 19 percent will do so in the first quarter of 2010 and 22 percent will wait until the second quarter of 2010 .
Seventeen percent will increase inventory in third quarter of 2010 , seven percent say the fourth quarter and 14 percent will not increase inventory purchases until 2011 or later .
Consumer Confidence Linchpin of Recovery .
More than half ( 51 % ) of CFOs say that a rebound in the economy will depend on an uptick in consumer confidence .
Other responses include lower unemployment levels ( 29 % ) , a rebound in the housing market ( 13 % ) , a rebound in the financial markets ( 6 % ) and lower fuel costs ( 1 % ) .
When asked what will have the greatest impact on consumer confidence for the rest of 2009 , most of the CFOs cite unemployment ( 64 % ) , followed by the weak housing market ( 20 % ) , personal credit availability ( 11 % ) , the 2009 Stimulus Act ( 4 % ) and high fuel costs ( 1 % ) .
Layoffs Most Effective Cost - Cutting Strategy so Far in 2009 .
In addition to inventory management , retailers have implemented several cost - cutting strategies throughout 2009 .
When asked which cost - cutting strategy has been the most effective so far , CFOs cite layoffs the most ( 38 % ) , followed by inventory reduction ( 30 % ) , delayed expansion ( 23 % ) , lease re-negotiation ( 7 % ) and store closings ( 2 % ) .
CFOs to Turn Focus Away from Layoffs .
Fortunately , for the remainder of 2009 , CFOs will focus most heavily on inventory reductions ( 36 % ) and delaying expansion plans ( 30 % ) to cut costs , rather than layoffs ( 19 % ) .
Further , 11 % will focus on lease renegotiations and four percent will close stores .
Turnaround Predictions .
A large majority ( 83 % ) of retail CFOs predict that we will see a meaningful turnaround in the economy in the second quarter of2010 or later .
Forty - one percent expect to see a turnaround in the second quarter of 2010 , while 15 percent cite the third quarter of 2010 , 10 percent cite the fourth quarter of 2010 and 17 percent do n’t expect to see a turnaround until 2011 or later .
Last year , the highest concentration ( 28 % ) of CFOs predicted a meaningful turnaround in the second quarter of 2009 .
The BDO Seidman Retail Compass Survey of CFOs is a national telephone survey conducted by Market Measurement , Inc. , an independent market research consulting firm , whose executive interviewers spoke directly to chief financial officers , using a telephone survey conducted within a scientifically - developed , pure random sample of the nation ’s largest retailers ( with revenues ranging from over $ 100 million to billions of dollars ) .

Microsoft has issued a reminder this week that it will stop providing support for Windows 2000 and Windows XP Service Pack 2 on July 13 , 2010 .
After this date , public support for these products ends and Microsoft will no longer provide any assisted support or security updates .
On the same day , Windows 2000 Server will move out of Extended Support while Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 R2 will move from Mainstream Support to Extended Support , which will end on July 14 , 2015 .
For most of its software , Microsoft provides Mainstream Support , followed by Extended Support , and finishes with just Self - Help Online Support .
For Windows 2000 , this means that Service Pack 4 is the end of the line ( which should not come as a surprise as Microsoft has noted this before ) .
These users are encouraged to move up to Windows XP , Windows Vista , or Windows 7 .
Windows 2000 SP3 support was retired on June 30 , 2005 , SP2 support was retired on May 16 , 2001 , and SP1 support was retired on July 31 , 2000 .
For Windows XP SP2 , users are encouraged to move to Windows 7 , Windows Vista , or simply Windows XP Service Pack 3 , for which support will end two years after the next service pack ( likely not happening ) or at the end of the product 's supported lifecycle , whichever comes first .
Microsoft retired Mainstream Support for Windows XP on April 14 , 2009 , but Extended Support wo n't be retired until April 8 , 2014 .
This date affect all versions of XP ( except for Embedded ) : Home Edition , Media Center Edition 2002 , Media Center Edition 2004 , Media Center Edition 2005 , Professional , Tablet PC Edition , and Tablet PC Edition 2005 .
Support for SP1 was retired on October 10 , 2006 .

TechCrunch was certain that rumors of a pending honest - to - goodness Google Phone were the real deal , and now according to the site , Google employees are already tweeting with the devices in hand .
If you believe what you see on Twitter , Google drones were given the HTC - designed handsets at an all - hands staff event , and the phone is quite a looker .
One tweet reads " ZOMG we had fireworks and we all got the new Google phone .
It 's beautiful . " while another says the phone is " Like an iPhone on beautifying steroids . "
One other , non-Google user on Twitter who 's seen the device says that the device is a bit thinner than the iPhone , has a trackball ( a la Hero ) , and has no physical keyboard ... which sounds like the Bravo / Passion we 've seen a lot of lately ( and we hear is coming to the US soon ) .
Apparently the device is running Android 2.1 , is unlocked and AT&T - ready ( no word on 3G status , but this could line up with our speculation about this being the carrier 's first Android phone ) , and will be due sometime in January .
We 're guessing if that last bit is true , it will coincide with a CES announcement , but anything could happen at this point .
If the device is out in the wild in such a big way , an end of the year press release would n't shock us either ; of course , it 's entirely possible that this is going to end up becoming the Android Dev Phone 1's true successor or an elaborate prank on Google 's part in response to the rumors that have been building steam over the past couple weeks ( they 're crafty and they have a sense of humor -- it could happen ) .
Anyhow , check out one of the tweet - tears after the break , and stay tuned for more info !
Update : Google all but confirms that devices are floating around on campus in a post on its blog :
We recently came up with the concept of a mobile lab , which is a device that combines innovative hardware from a partner with software that runs on Android to experiment with new mobile features and capabilities , and we shared this device with Google employees across the globe .
This means they get to test out a new technology and help improve it .
Not only that , but TechCrunch has more details on the device , claiming it will be a Google controlled , HTC - built model actually dubbed the " Google Phone , " and will feature a " super high resolution OLED display , " a Snapdragon CPU , a mic on the back of the phone that helps to eliminate background noise , is " really , really fast , " and most importantly , will be sold unlocked .
Essentially , TC claims that the phone will function on any GSM network you throw at it -- we assume that means an extremely rare pairing of both T - Mobile and AT&T 3G bands in the radio .
Of course right now this is all speculation and hearsay -- until we get some solid facts ( and maybe a device or two on camera ) , do n't pull out the credit card just yet .
Jon Gruber over at Daring Fireball says that the Google Phone is identifying itself as " Nexus One " ( a Blade Runner reference ) in its user agent string , though apparently Sony is calling its Android UI " Nexus " as well .
Furthermore , a tweet from the man claims that he's heard the phone sports 3G for T - Mobile only , thus seriously dashing hopes that this would play nice all over the US of A. Again , grain of salt everyone .

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has called for profound reform of the economy in his annual state of the nation address .
The Soviet model no longer worked , he said , and Russia 's survival depended on rapid modernisation based on democratic institutions .
An oil and gas - based economy had to be reworked with hi-tech investments .
Inefficient state giants should be overhauled and issues of accountability and transparency addressed , he said .
" Instead of a primitive economy based on raw materials , we shall create a smart economy , producing unique knowledge , new goods and technologies , goods and technologies useful for people , " Mr Medvedev said .
RUSSIA'S 'PRIMITIVE ' ECONOMY GDP went from less than $ 1tn ( £ 600 bn ) in 1998 to $ 2.1tn ( £ 1.26tn ) in 2007 but has since dropped sharply ( IMF ) Exports as a portion of GDP soared from 20 % in 1990 to more than 60 % in 1992 , but had fallen back to 33 % by 2008 ( World Bank ) Mineral products accounted for 70 % of exports in 2008 , machinery - 5 % ( Russian government statistics )
State corporations believed to be under particular scrutiny include VEB bank and Russian Technologies ( Reuters )
Russian readers react to speech " Instead of an archaic society , in which leaders think and decide for everybody , we shall become a society of intelligent , free and responsible people . "
Russia 's industrial and technological base declined rapidly with the collapse of the USSR in 1991 and the relative recovery it has seen this century owes much to its oil and natural gas exports A year ago , in his first such address , Mr Medvedev made a surprise announcement about deploying missiles close to Poland .
This time the focus was on transforming Russia into a more modern and open country , by introducing sweeping reforms .
More than one million Russians were at risk of losing their jobs , he said , and pressing social issues needed to be addressed .
' No future ' " We can't wait any longer , " Mr Medvedev said .
" We need to launch modernisation of the entire industrial base .
Our nation 's survival in the modern world will depend on that . "
ANALYSIS Richard Galpin , BBC News , Moscow
It is highly unusual to hear the Russian president launch such a scathing attack on governments past and present .
It must have made uncomfortable listening for the hundreds of top officials gathered in the Kremlin .
Some sections of Mr Medvedev 's speech seemed particularly critical of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin 's legacy as president between 2000 and 2008 , for example when he encouraged the rapid growth of state corporations .
Mr Medvedev is certainly establishing more of a political identity by focusing on the modernisation theme .
But there is still deep scepticism about his ability to deliver on any of the reforms he has called for because his power base is extremely limited and there will be many vested interests to overcome to bring about real change .
Government had to become more transparent , he said , and corruption should be punished .
The giant state companies created by his predecessor , Vladimir Putin , had " no future " , he said .
" Inefficient enterprises must go through bankruptcy proceedings or leave the market , " he said .
" We wo n't be protecting them forever . "
Mr Medvedev promised to strengthen democratic institutions but warned that any attempts to disrupt national stability with " democratic slogans " would be stopped .
" Freedom means responsibility and I hope everyone understands that , " he said .
And he promised a pragmatic foreign policy that would focus on improving Russians ' living standards .
In other comments , Mr Medvedev • Called for a " joint reliable platform " to strengthen Europe 's security , saying such a body would have prevented the war with Georgia • Described the situation in the North Caucasus as Russia 's most serious internal problem and pledged to fight " terrorist crimes " there • Suggested that the number of time zones in Russia - currently 11 - should be reduced The Russian president gave a bleak assessment of the current situation and there was much in the speech that implied deep criticism of Mr Putin , reports the BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow .
Mr Medvedev is keen to prove he is his own man but the question is whether he can deliver on his pledges and bring about significant reform , our correspondent says .

Joe Cao ( pronounced Gow ) is the name on most people ’s lips Inside the Beltway this morning .
So , how did this freshman Republican escape GOP Whip Eric Cantor ’s hammer to vote with Democrats for health care reform , ruining Cantor ’s goal of unified opposition ?
Cao arrived in Houston at the age of eight with his parents and two siblings as refugees from Vietnam .
Cao ’s father , a lieutenant in the South Vietnamese Army , had spent the better part of the previous seven years in a North Vietnamese “ reeducation camp . ”
Cao originally became a Roman Catholic Priest , serving six years in a Jesuit seminary after getting his bachelors degree in physics at Baylor University in Waco , Texas .
After leaving the priesthood he received a master ’s in philosophy from Fordham University in New York and a law degree from Loyola in New Orleans in 2000 , where he also taught undergraduate philosophy .
He practiced immigration law before getting involved in politics after Hurricane Katrina .
After upsetting nine - term incumbent William Jefferson – who was under indictment at the time for taking bribes — in 2008 , Cao became the first Vietnamese American elected to Congress .
He holds the most Democratic seat – rated D+28 by the Cook Political Report – of any Republican .
He ’s married to Hieu “ Kate ” Hoang , whom he met at Mary Queen of Vietnam Catholic Church in New Orleans East in 1998 .
The couple still attends the church with their two daughters .
So how did Cao end up voting for the bill ?
He was subject to much lobbying from three sides : the White House , embodied by Nancy Ann DeParle , Rahm Emanuel and President Obama ; Eric Cantor , the GOP Whip ; and , harkening back to his early years as a young priest , the Conference of Catholic Bishops .
The Louisiana chapter was the only one to endorse the bill in October , long before the hot button issue of abortion was even raised .
Cao had objected , along with more than 60 pro-life Democrats , to the idea that the legislation might help fund abortions .
After last minute negotiations , Democratic leaders agreed to allow an amendment authored by Bart Stupak , a Michigan Democrat , that would ensure that no money could go to funding abortions .
The amendment passed , gaining the bill the support of the national Conference of Catholic Bishops .
“ Thanks to the Stupak - Pitts Amendment , taxpayer dollars will not go to supporting elective abortions , and for thousands of my constituents , this was a top priority , ” Cao said in a statement .
“ By incorporating this amendment into the health reform bill , my colleagues and I made this bill better , and that is an achievement of which I will always be proud . ”
But by far the most amount of pressure came from Cantor and the White House .
Obama pledged to work with Cao on additional financial aid for his district , especially in disaster loan forgiveness , and on help paying for expanded Medicaid services under the bill in the years to come .
Cantor also lobbied Cao , meeting with him several times Saturday .
Of course , according to Cao , the decision was purely altruistic .
“ I have always said that I would put aside partisan wrangling to do the business of the people .
My vote tonight was based on my priority of doing what is best for my constituents , ” Cao said in his statement .
From "
America ’s Future : California vs. Texas
" in Trends Magazine :
What 's the worst state to do business in ?
According to readers of Chief Executive magazine , it 's California .
In the same poll , Texas won first place as the best state in which to put your headquarters .
As reported in The Economist , the two largest states in the nation have very different philosophies and very different success rates .
What ’s wrong with California , and what ’s right with Texas ?
It really comes down to four fundamental differences in the value systems embodied in these states :
1 . Texans on average believe in laissez - faire markets with an emphasis on individual responsibility .
Since the ' 80s , California ’s policy - makers have favored central planning solutions and a reliance on a government social safety net .
This unrelenting commitment to big government has led to a huge tax burden and triggered a mass exodus of jobs .
The Trends Editors examined the resulting migration in “ Voting with Our Feet , ” in the April 2008 issue of Trends .
2. Californians have largely treated environmentalism as a “ religious sacrament ” rather than as one component among many in maximizing people 's quality of life .
As we explained in “ The Road Ahead for Housing , ” in the June 2009 issue of Trends , environmentally - based land - use restriction centered in California played a huge role in inflating the recent housing bubble .
Similarly , an unwillingness to manage ecology proactively for man ’s benefit has been behind the recent epidemic of wildfires .
3. California has placed “ ethnic diversity ” above “ assimilation , ” while Texas has done the opposite .
“ Identity politics ” has created psychological ghettos that have prevented many of California ’s diverse ethnic groups and subcultures from integrating fully into the mainstream .
Texas , on the other hand , has proactively encouraged all the state ’s residents to join the mainstream .
4. Beyond taxes , diversity , and the environment , Texas has focused on streamlining the regulatory and litigation burden on its residents .
Meanwhile , California ’s government has attempted to use regulation and litigation to transfer wealth from its creators to various special - interest constituencies .
MP : The 4.2 % difference in October jobless rates ( 12.5 % in CA vs. 8.3 % in TX ) tells the story ( see graph above ) .
In fact , California 's unemployment rate has been more than 4 percent above the rate in Texas every month this year except for January , and that is the first time in state jobless rate history back to 1976 that there has ever been a 4 - point difference in the unemployment rates between those two states .

New ‘ Doctor Who ’ Logo – Whatcha
Think ?
The world ’s longest running science fiction series , Doctor Who , is scheduled to continue on after current Doctor David Tennant ends his run .
This means a new doctor and , of course , a new logo .
The new logo with accompany the on -screen debut of Matt Smith as the eleventh Doctor in spring 2010 .
Below is a video teaser of the new logo , which I do n’t really have much of an opinion of yet .
This is more than likely because I ’m still trying to get over Tennant leaving and I ca n’t be concerned with “ new ” anythings until after his final specials air .
The final three episodes featuring Tennant will air later this year , with the existing logo on - screen .

Installing clean , reliable , inflation - proof solar power is easier than ever , thanks to the invention of thin - film photovoltaic ( PV ) laminates that can be bonded directly onto metal roofing panels .
Unlike crystalline PV material , there 's no need for obtrusive racks and heavy , expensive glass .
Instead , unbreakable thin - film PV is produced using amorphous silicon , encapsulated in Teflon and other polymers .
Thanks to pioneering work by Steve Heckeroth , a Mother Earth News contributing editor and the director of building - integrated photovoltaics for Energy Conversion Devices ( ECD )
Ovonics , this thin - film PV is now available in easily shippable , 16 - inch - wide rolls .
It 's a peel - and - stick laminate .
You just unroll the sheet , lay it faceup on a flat metal roofing panel and press it onto the panel while your assistant pulls the protective sheet off the sticky backing .
Invented by ECD Ovonics co-founder Stan Ovshinsky , thin - film laminates offer several advantages over crystalline PV panels .
( See Meet Stan Ovshinsky , the Energy Genius for a profile of Ovshinsky and his remarkable renewable energy inventions . )
Thin - film sheets perform better in high temperatures and in partly shaded conditions , and they require 100 times less silicon , which means thin - film PV is expected to become less expensive than crystalline as production capacity expands over the next few years .
We had a chance to get a firsthand look at this exciting new PV option after Heckeroth offered to install it on the new metal roof I was putting on my small barn last summer .
We invited the public , and Heckeroth led a workshop about solar power .
Nearly 50 folks spent an unusually hot , 100 degree May day watching and helping as Heckeroth showed volunteers how to bond the thin - film PV laminates to the metal roof panels .
Then local architect and builder Kenton Knowles and his Global Homes crew installed the panels on the barn .
As the sequence of photos shows , it 's hard to imagine a simpler way to install grid-tied , solar - electric power on a new or replacement metal roof .
It took only five to 10 minutes to apply each PV sheet to a roof panel .

Our new metal roof was 24 - gauge Galvalume steel from Englert , Inc .
It should last at least 50 years , and the steel can be recycled , making it an excellent sustainable choice for any building .
After the roofing panels were installed , Heckeroth danced briefly along the ridge to snap the connecting wires together , and then our electrician , Robert Gore , wired the direct - current output from the thin - film PV into a Fronius inverter .
The inverter converts the direct - current power generated by the solar panels to standard 110 - volt alternating current .
Then the power flows through the new meters installed by the utility company ( at no charge ! ) and into my home .
The sun was blazing , and the roofers were really sweaty , but as soon as Gore flipped the switch , everyone smiled as the inverter kicked on and the digital readout quickly climbed to " 1,530 watts , " showing exactly how much electricity the new system was delivering to the house .
Anytime the house needs more power than the PV is producing , the system draws from the utility grid .
ORLANDO -- Sammy
Sosa says he is not trying to look like the late Michael Jackson , nor is he suffering from a skin infection .
He also says the change in the color of his skin is not a byproduct of his alleged steroid use .
Speaking publicly for the first time since photos of him from a recent musical award ceremony were published on the Internet , Sosa said that the skin lightening is the result of the use of a facial cosmetic cream .
" It 's a bleaching cream that I apply before going to bed and whitens my skin some , " said the former slugger during the " Primer Impacto " program at the Univision Spanish network .
" It 's a cream that I have , that I use to soften [ my skin ] , but has bleached me some .
I 'm not a racist , I live my life happily , " said a smiling Sosa during the interview .
The photo that has caused such turmoil was taken during the Grammy Latino Awards ceremony held last week at Las Vegas .
It showed an extremely pale , smiling Sosa accompanied by his wife Sonia .
The photo , distributed very quickly throughout Spanish - and English - language Web sites , caused speculation that Sosa was sick and quickly found its way to gossip - related sites .
Sosa , seen here on May 13 , had a different look just six months ago .

Some wondered if Sosa had undergone surgery to whiten and soften his facial expressions , and others thought it was a result of his alleged steroid use .
Rebecca Polihronis , a former Chicago Cubs employee who keeps in touch with Sosa , said in a Chicago Tribune interview that Sosa had undergone a skin rejuvenation treatment , something very common among women .
" What happened was that I had been using the cream for a long time and that , combined with the bright TV lights , made my face look whiter than it really is .
I do n't think I look like Michael Jackson , " Sosa said .
" I 'm going to market it , I 'm a businessman , " Sosa joked about the mysterious cream , about which he revealed only that it was bought in Europe .
Sosa plans to celebrate his 41st birthday with a big party next week in Miami .

It 's tempting to suggest that climate change , and in particular the question of population control , is a feminist issue .
For starters it allows us to put a clear culprit in the dock : find the right stats and hey presto : " Men are all bastards and their irresponsible actions are destroying the planet . "
Mary Fitzgerald recently argued that population control is at heart a feminist issue because , if women across the globe ( and particularly those in " developing " nations ) are given the right to control their bodies via universal birth control , this will halt the potentially disastrous upward curve of the birth rate .
Alex Renton has also urged that " population reduction is best achieved by ensuring women 's equality and improving their education , while providing cheap and effective birth control . "
All this talk of " female education " in the name of feminism pinging round the blogosphere in the run-up to Copenhagen is making me twitchy .
I 've no qualm with the two threads of Renton 's argument when contended independently , but there is an intrinsic risk in compounding them under an " eco-feminist umbrella " .
Why , when it comes to birth control , is the onus still exclusively placed on female education , and not male education ?
One obvious danger lies in making the burden of tackling population control – and by implication climate change – the accepted and sole responsibility of the world 's female population .
Have all these " uneducated " women been single - handedly overpopulating the world via a process of amoeba - like fission of which I am unaware ?
There is a self - defeating logic in simultaneously pointing the finger at men and yet trying to exclude them from further discussion about women 's rights and birth control .
Writing on the Reality Check website , Edwin Okongo rightly criticised the gender bias in aid given to " developing " nations in the name of feminism : " We can spend 10 times the billions of dollars proposed to empower all the women of the world , but those efforts will be in vain if we do n't empower men . "
Okongo 's reasoning highlights why branding climate change an issue of feminism is at best inadequate , and at worst divisive , by pre-emptively splitting men's interests from those of women's .
Furthermore , it provides male " deniers " a cushy little get - out clause to smugly wheel out at parties : " Ain't my problem anyway – it 's down to you gals now . "
Let us not pour more fuel on that crazy fire .
When it comes to climate change , men have equal responsibility – whether they live in sub-Saharan African or SW1 .
Equally , to suggest , as Jess McCabe has , that women are more " likely to bear the brunt of climate change as 70 % of the world 's poor are women " , thereby placing women " on the frontline of climate change , " is slack thinking , and says as much about the skewed state of feminism in western society today as it does about the limited choices of women in non-western ones .
Even if 70 % of the world 's poor are women , this does n't make the threat of climate change a feminist issue - it makes it a humanitarian one .
Interestingly , the Women 's Manifesto on Climate Change , which supplies this stat , justifies its posture by declaring that " women are far more concerned about environmental issues than men . "
Little wonder , if you box it up as a women 's group interest only .
And let us not forget , offering birth control does n't automatically mean that women are treated as equal to men .
The notion of " reproductive justice " is more complex , if not elusive .
Women in western societies are still held primarily responsible for the provision of birth control , but was this really the zenith of feminist ideals ?
It may have allowed women to sleep with who they want , but it hardly encourages , how shall I say , " sustainable activity " on the part of men .
Instead , it arguably perpetuates the still acceptable myth that men can sow their seed where they like and " liberated " women can pick up the pieces .
When it comes to gender equality and climate change , we are all on the " frontline " , regardless of gender or geography .
We do n't need well - wrung stats to accuse one gender over another – hop down to Oxford Street , if you dare , and you 'll encounter just as many women as men buying into mass consumerism , which contributes to environmental destruction .
Eco-feminism tends to divide rather than unite , and risks packaging environmental responsibility as " emasculating " , reinforcing rigid notions of masculinity – a hazard which similarly applies to recycling , taking your own shopping bag , and not eating meat .
We need to stop thinking about the environment as " mother nature " being abused by men , which in turn will be saved by women exclusively .
Seen by millions of people worldwide , the ship design used by The Pirate Bay is one of the most recognizable logos on the Internet today .
But after discovering that the iconic emblem had not been officially registered , a Swedish company has hijacked the trademark as their own , with an eye on commercial exploitation .
The Internet has many great and well - known trademarks .
There can hardly be a web user anywhere in the world who has never seen the red , yellow , blue and green of Google ’s logo , and millions every day skip past the same - colored staggered lettering of auction site , eBay .
Those very same colors are used in the window representation used by Microsoft .
However , despite the shunning of the multi-colored approach of the above , among those millions of Internet users for whom BitTorrent has become a way of life , or those technology reporters who have written so much about the site , the logo employed by The Pirate Bay is also very recognizable indeed .
The ship emblem , with its sails featuring the outline of a cassette tape - and - crossbones , has been reproduced millions of times on countless numbers of websites and products .
The Pirate Bay , in line with their sharing ethos , has always allowed people to use the logo free of charge and even makes the artwork publicly available in usable , scalable formats to ease its reproduction , some of which were used to create fan tattoos .
But that is still not enough for some greedy individuals .
Today news broke that a private Swedish company , noticing that the logo had no commercial protection , took the opportunity to hijack it .
The outfit , Sandryds Handel AB , have officially registered the emblem as their own with the authorities , with the intention of commercially exploiting it .
While admitting they have absolutely nothing to do with The Pirate Bay , in a radio interview Sandryds Handel spokesman Bengt Wessborg defended his company ’s action .
“ The idea is to sell USB drives using this brand , ” he told SR .
“ We saw that it was not already allocated to someone else .
It was not registered , ” he added .
A spokesman for Sweden ’s Patent and Registration Office said that they were unable to find that any rights to the logo were held by The Pirate Bay , therefore they were able to allocate them to Sandryds .
The logo registered by the company is very slightly different in color to that of the original Pirate Bay design , with ‘ The Pirate Bay ’ written as “ The Piratebay ” .
Commenting on the news , ex-Pirate Bay spokesman Peter Sunde told TorrentFreak : “ It will be turned over quite easily , it ’s a preliminary registration that is being ‘ tested ’ , ” adding that while anyone can use the logo for any purpose they like , they may not take any action which limits the way other people can use it .
Peter says he wrote to Sandryds , and they replied telling him “ … that they were amazed themselves and just wanted to try . ”
TorrentFreak asked if The Pirate Bay is going to try and get the logo back , and we were told that they would try to get the decision by the patent office anulled , adding that the registration was n’t legal and is therefore prohibited by law .
“ It ’s a person at the registration office that has made an error – willingly or not , we ’re not sure , ” they added .
“ It would be nice if they liked it , ” said the Sandryds spokesman in a statement .
“ But we may perhaps enter into dialogue with them if needed , ” he added .
Needless to say , certain Pirate Bay supporters will not “ like ” this hijacking at all , and offering discussions over the reappropriation of an emblem they already see as their own will be tantamount to waving a red rag at a bull .
History shows us what happens to outfits who take negative actions against The Pirate Bay , so on past experience , if Sandryds Handel hope to keep doing business on the web in any meaningful way , they may want to quickly reassess their position .

Jones et al 1986 methodical insertion of warming bias
by Warwick Hughes
Jones et al 1986 looked at 86 Australian stations and rejected 46 ( 25 Short term – 21 long term ) .
Of the 40 they used 27 were short term and 13 long term .
Of the long term there were 5 large cities .
The 27 short term stations were mostly only quoted from 1951 onward – regardless of what data was available .
It just so happens that the years just post WWII were not prominently warm in Australia so an “ automatic ” warming trend was reinforced into the CRU Australian component .
Here are 11 examples where Jones et al systematically truncated pre-1951 data or ignored more rural data around many small town Australian stations .
These graphics and text have been extracted from a 1992 vintage Word doc that somehow survived the decades and how many HDD’s .
Port Hedland
The aerodrome records 1951 - 80 shows a clear warming trend .
Marble Bar , 150 kms south east , shows a similar trend over that period but a flat trend over 80 odd years .
Longreach
For the period 1951 - 80 this trend is sharply upward , yet if the Longreach Post Office record is spliced to the aerodrome record ( post 1940s ) the trend becomes markedly flatter .
When Longreach is compared to Isisford , a much smaller rural centre 80 kms south , the trend is closer to neutral over about 70 years .
Mackay
The A.M.O. record 1951 - 80 shows a clearly steeper warming trend for Mackay when compared with St Lawrence and Pine Islet Lighthouse .
Rockhampton
Compared to Bustard Head Lighthouse and St. Lawrence , Rockhampton shows a warming trend of about 0.5 °C over 70 years .
Rockhampton data was used only for the period 1951 - 1970 .
The two nearby more rural sites show a similar temperature pattern but a negligible temperature change over 70 years .
Meekathara
The Aerodrome record 1951 - 80 shows a clear strong warming trend .
The small centre of Cue , 120 kms south west however has a flat trend over 90 years .
Charleville
The trend for this station 1951 - 80 also shows a strong warming trend .
Cunnamulla , a smaller centre approximately 170 kms south , shows a much flatter trend over about 80 years .
Kalgoorlie
The aerodrome record 1941 - 80 shows a well defined warming .
However , when Post Office records are spliced on , the trend is much closer to zero over 90 years .
Looking at Southern Cross , a continuous Post Office record , approximately 200 kms west , the trend is very similar , flat over some 90 years .
www.warwickhughes.com/cru86/tr027/kalgoorlie.gif
Forrest
This station 1951 - 80 , shows a steeper warming trend than the nearby Rawlinna , where records go back to 1926 .
Ceduna
A warming trend is seen over the 1951 - 80 period , yet the longer term and more remote Streaky Bay , where records are available back to 1925 , shows a flatter trend .
Woomera
Once again , this record shows the 1951 - 80 warming .
Broken
Hill , the nearest long term station in a similar climate , shows a cooling trend over a hundred year time span .
Mt. Gambier
From 1951 - 80 this aerodrome station shows a strong warming trend .
When the Post Office records are spliced on the trend 1860s to 1990 , it is close to neutral .
It gets better , in Warwick ’s blog comments , Warwick points this out :
The situation for Jones 1986 Sth Hem compilation – is that Sydney and Melbourne aside , there is not one station , long or short term , between Brisbane and Mt. Gambier .
This area includes all of NSW and Victoria and contains the greatest concentration of long term recording stations in Australia .
Must be one of the great and complete exclusions in the history of science .
He adds in another comment :
I have never been able to discover which stations contribute to their gridded data .
Maybe that will change now .
Some look back at the ' 80s and recall Ronald Reagan , glam metal and The Breakfast Club — a time of weird hair , ridiculous fashions and a thaw in the Cold War .

If This is Recovery , Where Are the Taxes ?
Last Business Standing
Stimulus , What Stimulus ?
The Reality of Unemployment
Let the Good Times Roll
The Quick Double - Dip Scenario
Phoenix , New York , and Thoughts on the Internet
No one goes into Wal - Mart and asks to pay extra sales tax .
Thus sales taxes are reasonable barometers for retail sales .
This week we look at how taxes are doing in a period of economic recovery .
Then we turn our eyes to a very interesting ( and sobering ) analysis of possible future unemployment rates .
This is an anecdote to the happy - face analysis of employment numbers you get from establishment economists .
There will be a lot of charts and tables , so this letter may print a little longer , but I think you will find it very interesting .
If This is Recovery , Where Are the Taxes ?
I keep reading about surveys that show that retail sales are up .
But as noted above , no one pays extra sales taxes , or decides they need to pay more income taxes .
The surest way to measure retail sales is sales taxes .
Want to know how incomes are doing ?
Look at income tax receipts .
Let ’s look at sales taxes first .
First off , I can find no single source of recent sales tax information .
It is all one - off , but it is consistent .
Sales taxes in my home state of Texas are down 12.8 % year - over - year , and we ’re in the fifth straight month of decreases of 11 % or more .
Projections are for sales taxes to continue to decline into 2010 .
There is a very revealing study by the Pew Center on state taxes , called " Beyond California . "
Everyone knows how bad California is .
The Pew Center looks at how the rest of the states are doing , and focuses on 10 states that also have severe problems .
Sales tax receipts are down 14 % in Arizona , and state income taxes are down 32 % .
On average , revenues are down almost 12 % .
Oregon has seen their revenues collapse a stunning 19 % .
New York is down 17 % , with a deficit of 32 % .
Illinois has a projected deficit of 47 % of its budget , second only to California with 49 % .
You can see how your state fares at http://downloads.pewcenteronthestates.org/Beyond_California_Appendix.pdf.
The Liscio Report notes that all states had negative year - over - year sales tax collections in October , and the weighted average decrease was 10.2 % , down from a negative 7.2 % in September . ( www.theliscioreport.com)
Sales at Wal - Mart stores slipped by 0.4 % in the third quarter .
Actual government figures show that retail sales were down 1.5 % in September from the previous month and 5.8 % year - over - year .
So how do we keep seeing headlines about retail sales being up , as unemployment keeps rising ?
Remember that such reports are usually based on surveys , and generally cover mid-sized and up retailers , leaving out smaller businesses .
Further , if you are a retail chain that has closed 10 % of its stores , the remaining stores should in theory benefit from getting your loyal customers into them .
Last Business Standing
Yesterday I was with an associate , and I hesitated in asking them how their business was doing , because I knew things had been tough at the beginning of the year .
But I did ask , and they said sales were up over the last months and business was looking better .
Surprised , I asked them what made the difference .
" Ah , " they said , " less competition .
Our competitors have gone out of business . "
Best Buy and other electronic retailers had to benefit from Circuit City disappearing .
That is Schumpeter ’s creative destruction at work .
Not very good for total employment , but it does help the profitability of the survivors .
So , if things are so bad , how did we have 3.5 % growth in the third quarter ?
First off , things are not as bad as they were in the past year .
We are in fact getting close to an economic bottom , at least for now .
Second , the 3.5 % number is a preliminary estimate .
A study by Goldman Sachs suggests that the number will be revised down by at least 0.5 % and maybe as much as 1 % .
Why ?
The estimate does not really take into account how poorly small businesses are performing .
If you look at small - business indexes and compare them to historical GDP numbers , you get the smaller number mentioned above .
And since at least 2 % of the GDP was from the stimulus package ( Cash for Clunkers , houses , tax cuts ) , the economy on its own was flat .
That begs the question , what happens when the stimulus runs out ?
And the answer is that we wo n’t know for some time , as the stimulus is just getting ramped up .
" According to CBO estimates , only 21 % of [ the stimulus ] spending will occur in 2009 ; another 38 % will come in 2010 , and 22 % in 2011 .
After that , its effect will dissipate quickly . "
( The Liscio Report )
But David Rosenberg notes that what the federal government is giving , the states are taking away .
The Pew Study shows that at least nine other states are in appalling shape , so it is no wonder that David writes :
Stimulus , What Stimulus ?
" Fully nine states are in fiscal distress and only two have balanced budgets .
States like Michigan are planning 20 % budget cuts for the coming year .
Indiana is planning a 10 % spending cut in light of a 7.4 % YoY revenue decline .
How can the economy really be out of recession if government revenues are still deflating ?
" The states are filling around 40 % of their fiscal gaps with the federal stimulus ( so much for spending on " shovel ready " infrastructure projects ) .
Even after the fiscal help from Washington , the state governments will still face a projected deficit of $ 142 billion for 2011 ( versus $ 113 billion in 2010 ) .
All in , the restraint in the state and local government sector is estimated to drain a full percentage point from U.S. GDP growth in 2010 and more than fully offset the stimulative efforts from Washington .
The U.S. economy is more likely to post growth of little more than 2 % next year , rather than the 5 % currently being discounted by the equity market . "
The Reality of Unemployment
All this is , of course , going to put continued pressure on employment .
As I noted last week , the number of unemployed actually soared by 558,000 , to 15.7 million , as measured by the household survey , not the 190,000 you read about in the mainstream media .
Unemployment is sadly continuing to rise by significant amounts .
In August , I did an interview with CNBC from Leen ’s Fishing Lodge in Maine .
The unemployment numbers had just come out .
I did a back - of - the - napkin estimate that we would need about 15 million new jobs over the next five years just to get back to where we were when the recession started .
That works out to a need for about 125,000 new jobs each month to handle new workers coming into the market ( which comes to a total of 7.5 million over five years ) , plus the 8 million and rising jobs we ’ve lost .
That is a daunting number .
It amounts to 250,000 new jobs a month every month for five years .
And we are still losing more than that number a month , let alone adding the needed 250,000 .
Look at the chart below .
It shows the establishment survey employment figures for the last ten years .
Only once , in 1999 , did we actually add over 250,000 jobs a month for a whole year .
And that was during the internet boom .
Sadly , the private sector has shed over 300,000 jobs since 1999 .
Think about that .
We have had a decade where there have been no new jobs added by the private sector .
Real incomes are roughly where they were , and the stock market is down .
Talk about a lost decade .
I love it when someone does the really heavy lifting for me , and my friend Mike Shedlock of Sitka Pacific Capital Management has done a wonderful job of taking that speculation of mine and putting it into a spreadsheet that helps us get a real handle on what unemployment is likely to look like for the next ten years .
I am going to make use of his basic analysis and then modify some of his assumptions in the spreadsheet he provided me , in order to think about different scenarios .
All three scenarios are based on assumptions , so let ’s see what Mish started with .
There is a wealth of data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau .
According to the Census Bureau Population Estimates we are going to add about 2.5 million working - age ( 16 years old and up ) citizens a year , from now until 2020 .
The numbers varies slightly year to year .
Mish used an estimate of the average , summing up the buckets from 16 to 100 + for the years in question and rounding the result .
You can go to the BLS site and look at Table A - 1 , which shows the civilian noninstitutional population ( those over 16 not in prisons ) , the participation rate ( those who are working and / or want to work ) , the unemployment rate , the number employed , those not in the labor force , and those who want a job .
Those are starting numbers for the charts below .
For those interested , you can read Mish ’s very full ( and quite detailed ) analysis at his blog site http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2009/11/mish-unemployment-projections-through.html).
But let ’s look at his assumptions :
Job losses are likely to continue for a minimum of another year .
When job gains start , they will be very slow at first , then pick up .
An extremely generous monthly job gain stat over the course of the year would be 150,000 jobs .
A falling participation rate ( boomers retiring ) will continue to mask reported unemployment .
Starting in 2013 the labor pool will start decreasing because of Boomer demographics .
The noninstitutional population will rise by 2.5 million workers a year .
The spreadsheet below needs a little explanation .
Let ’s start with the assumptions .
Mike starts with current working - age population and adds 2.5 million people a year .
He assumes that Boomers will retire at 65 ( something which all the surveys say is not going to happen ) .
And his last estimate is what the unemployment numbers will be .
Everything else is based on those assumptions , which leads to the first column , or the expected unemployment number .
By the way , we know that everyone will want to make different assumptions .
I am going to create three scenarios , but you can go to Mike ’s blog and at the bottom of the post is a link to the actual spreadsheet .
Have fun .
Let ’s look at scenario 1 .
This assumes there is no double - dip recession , and jobs roughly rise along the same lines as the last recovery .
Actually , Mish is far more optimistic , as in the very first chart you will notice that job losses were negative in the first year after the end of the recession and flat the second year .
Mish has jobs rising by 120,000 next year and 600,000 the second year ( 2011 ) , and then a fairly robust recovery .
Below is the graph of the unemployment numbers under such a scenario .
Notice that unemployment stays at or above 11 % for three years .
Pessimistic ?
Mainstream and usually very optimistic Mark Zandi of www.economy.com predicted this week that unemployment would rise to 11 % by the middle of next year , right in line with this scenario .
Also note that total jobs rise by 14 million over ten years .
Hardly doom and gloom .
Again , Boomers all retire on time and there is no double - dip recession .
Let the Good Times Roll
What would it take to get back to 5 % unemployment ?
I played with the spreadsheet and came up with the following numbers , which get us below 5 % by 2020 .
I assume no recessions for the next ten years , and 2 million new jobs a year after 2011 , which I start off with almost 1.5 million jobs .
Of course , we have never done that , but let ’s be optimistic .
And the graph below shows the unemployment numbers for the Good Times Scenario .
Want to get to 5 % within five years ?
Add 3 million jobs a year starting now .
With no housing recovery , a smaller auto industry , and financial firms getting leaner .
The Quick Double - Dip Scenario
When I called the last two recessions about a year before they happened , it was not all that hard .
We had inverted yield curves , falling leading indicators , and a lot of other data that pretty much pointed to a recession .
Believing that we had a housing bubble and a looming credit crisis also helped my conviction in calling the last recession .
I think we are in for a double - dip recession in 2011 , yet I readily admit there will be little if any statistical evidence in advance this time .
This is more of an instinct call .
I have serious doubts that we can have what amounts to the largest tax increase of all time in what will be a very weak ( albeit growing ) economy , without putting us back into recession .
And Speaker Pelosi thinks it is a smart thing to add another 5.4 % surtax on what will already be a rising capital gains and dividend tax .
Taxing small businesses , and that is what the tax increase amounts to , is a very bad idea in a weak economy .
Small businesses are where the job growth comes from .
Taking money from productive businesses and giving it to government is a fundamentally flawed concept .
Now , if they decide to postpone the tax increase , or phase it in slowly , then maybe we avoid the double dip .
But right now it does n’t look like that will be the case .
So , let ’s quickly see what a double - dip scenario might look like .
Let ’s be optimistic and assume we only lose another 1.2 million jobs in the next recession , since we have already lost so many in this one ( 8 million and counting ) .
And then the economy comes roaring back in 2012 with 1.5 million jobs and continues to grow rather smartly for the rest of the decade .
No further recession .
We absorb the tax increases and move on with our economic lives .
Unemployment under such a scenario would rise to just under 13 % and stay above 10 % for 8 years .
Take a look at the chart and graph .
Think 13 % is too dire ?
This week David Rosenberg said unemployment would rise to between 12 - 13 % .
The former Merrill Lynch economist was one of the few mainstream economists who called the recession and the credit crisis .
The so - called " Blue Chip " economists told us at the beginning of 2008 that unemployment would peak out at 6 % .
While Rosie is not optimistic of late , he has a rather solid record of being right .
We are at 10.2 % unemployment today .
The economy lost jobs for 21 months after the end of the last recession .
That would easily take us into 2011 .
Another million lost jobs will take us well over 11 % and close to 12 % ( remember , you have to add in the increasing population ) , even without my double - dip scenario .
The letter is getting long and it ’s getting late , so let me close with a few thoughts .
First , 12 % unemployment is horrendous by American standards .
But Spain is now at 20 % , and much of Europe has been in the 10 % range for years .
Second , Americans are not used to the concept of 12 % unemployment or 10 % rates for extended periods .
That is going to cause a serious backlash across the political spectrum .
Couple that with the discomfort over $ 1.5 - trillion deficits and there could be some serious political changes in the coming years .
I think the message will be more anti-incumbent than one party or the other .
Third , the only way out of this morass is to create an environment where small business can thrive .
As I ’ve noted for the last several weeks in this letter , government spending does not increase GDP over time .
It is a temporary nonproductive stimulus .
It takes private investment to create jobs and increase productivity .
Over the next few months , I will write more about how to do that .
Phoenix , New York , and Thoughts on the Internet
Next week I take a quick one - day trip to Phoenix , then back to do a satellite - remote speech to a South African hedge fund conference .
I will be in New York the first weekend of December ( the 4th ) for Festivus , a great fundraiser for kids sponsored by Todd Harrison and the team at Minyanville ( http://www.rpfoundation.org).
Interestingly , they hold it every year at a " Texas " barbecue joint .
Look me up if you are there .
The 7 kids , spouses , and grandkids are starting to gather .
We will all have brunch Sunday and then a shower for Tiffani .
She has another 6 weeks before she is due , and she is really uncomfortable .
Walking is literally a pain .
Permit me to reminisce .
A little over 9 years ago I started this letter on the internet with about 2,000 email addresses .
It was a new version of what had been a print letter , as that was the business I knew .
The internet was still a new thing to me , but it seemed like a good idea at the time .
Little did I know .
I am still amazed at the growth and the direction my business and life have taken .
My letters are sent out by various publishers and affiliates to over 1.5 million readers and posted on dozens of web sites , and the numbers have been growing rapidly of late .
I am grateful .
But I wonder what would happen if I started it today .
Ten years ago there was little in the way of free economic letters .
Not a lot of competition .
Today , there is so much free information that it ’s staggering .
There have to be thousands of blogs and hundreds of free letters , some with very large circulations .
It seems a new star is born every few months .
While much of it does not add to the level of conversation , some of it is quite excellent .
I think I am lucky to have started when I did .
And I am grateful for the kind attention you give me .
As I turn 60 , I note that this has been a rather overwhelming last ten years .
A lot of changes for me , and almost all of them very good .
But there are more to come .
The last two flights I was on I was connected to the internet at 35,000 feet .
I sense a lot more changes coming .
I am thinking a lot about how to keep up and not get left behind , how to make sure that you , gentle reader , continue to get my best .
That is what , at the end of the day , drives me .
Have a great week .
I know I shall .
Dad loves it when his kids ( from 15 to 32 ) and spouses and grandkids are all under one roof .

You will probably read this in every story surrounding Brittany Murphy 's passing : 2009 was a year for celebrity deaths , and hers will be yet another to put on the list .
But that does n't make her death any less shocking .
Advertisement
Part of the shock surrounding Murphy 's death is clearly related to her age , though it may also be attributed to the fact that Murphy has been in the public eye for over 15 years , starting out in Hollywood when she was 14 , when she booked guest spots on shows like Murphy Brown and Kids Incorporated before landing more substantial parts on sitcoms like Almost Home :
Advertisement
Murphy 's big break , and perhaps her best known role , however , came in 1995 , when she was cast as Tai , the outcast - turned - makeover - project - turned - popularity - queen in Amy Heckerling 's Clueless .
In watching Clueless , you recognize that there was something very unique about Murphy , most notably her famously scratchy voice , which also landed her a long - running voiceover role as Luann Platter on King Of The Hill , and was still apparently relevant enough for an SNL parody less than a month ago , even though Murphy 's formerly formidable career had stalled as of late .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Though Clueless brought Murphy mainstream and later cult favorite status , her next big role in the 90s did n't come until 1999 , when she cast in Girl , Interrupted as a suicidal incest victim living in a mental hospital alongside the likes of Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie :
But after a decade of playing sidekicks and outcasts , Murphy reinvented herself as a romantic lead , dying her hair blonde and losing a dramatic amount of weight by 2001 :
Advertisement
It was a shocking transformation for those of us who grew up connecting Murphy with her character in Clueless , and speculation over Murphy 's weight haunted her for the remainder of her career .
In 2005 , she spoke out about rumors that her weight loss was connected to drug use or an eating disorder , claims she dismissed as ridiculous , noting , in a now - slightly eerie quote : " I have never tried [ cocaine ] in my entire life .
I 've never even seen it .
... I am also way too high - strung .
I can't even take a Sudafed .
Can you imagine ?
My God .
I think my heart would explode . "

Murphy 's career soared following the dramatic makeover , kicking off with a dark love - interest role in the Eminem film 8 Mile and a romantic comedy she shot with then - fiance Ashton Kutcher , called Just Married .
It was around this time , however , that reports of Murphy 's " diva " behavior started to surface : in a " night out " piece for the New York Times , author Linda Lee noted that there was " no sign of the difficult star who was reported to have been fired by her publicist the week before . "
Advertisement
After Kutcher and Murphy split , the actress continued taking on Meg Ryan - esque roles in films like Little Black Book and Uptown Girls with Dakota Fanning , as well as sexier parts in films like Sin City , and her career trajectory ( or handlers ) seemed to be guiding her toward America 's Sweetheart status , though that never quite materialized .
Following Sin City , Murphy 's career stalled , and she began taking on roles in television movies ( reminiscent of the career path of another early 00s starlet , Lindsay Lohan ) and lesser known films where she was arguably the biggest star in the cast .
The fact that Murphy was dropped by her agent and publicist around the time Sin City was released in 2005 , alongside rumors of her drug use , may account for the dip in her career .
Advertisement
Murphy was engaged twice more before marrying screenwriter Simon Monjack in 2007 , a marriage that sparked some controversy - there was speculation that the two had married in order for Monjack , a Brit , to receive his green card .
It was not the last time that the couple found themselves at the center of tabloid gossip : in 2008 , a source told Page Six that Murphy 's on - set diva - like behavior was causing trouble , as was the ever - looming presence of her husband : " She 's extremely difficult , " said the source , " When she gets to the set , it comes to a grinding halt .
She 's so hot and cold , you never know what 's going to happen that day . "
Advertisement
Just last month , Monjack was rushed to the hospital for an alleged asthma attack , just after Murphy had left a film ( she denied being fired ) due to the old Hollywood standby , " creative differences . "
TMZ is now reporting that Murphy was discovered by her mother , unconscious in the shower , and pronounced dead on arrival at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles .
Radar is reporting that an autopsy may take place as early as Monday , and the LA Times is reporting that the LAPD are launching an investigation to determine exactly what happened to Murphy .
TMZ is also reporting that Murphy 's husband does n't want an autopsy performed on his late wife , though it does not look like his wishes will be honored .
Advertisement
Though details are still sketchy ( we 'll continue to update ) speculation about Murphy 's death and what led to her cardiac arrest will surely overtake the internet , if it has n't already .
Murphy 's rumored drug use and long - discussed weight loss will certainly be thrown into the mix , and though the cause of her death is still unknown it does n't take a genius to recognize that Murphy 's story is as old as Hollywood itself : a starlet who works her way up from bit player to headliner , only to see her career fall apart , and all within a matter of years .
Advertisement
It 's something we 've watched in progress throughout this entire decade : young women who are held up as the next big thing ( Lindsay Lohan , Britney Spears ) and then brushed aside or openly mocked after they no longer fit an expected mold .
It is both a story of self - destruction and mass - destruction , the business of creating and destroying a star ; sometimes it 's caused by internal forces , and sometimes it 's fed by the rest of the world .
We do n't know yet why Brittany Murphy is gone ; for all we know , her death may have nothing to do with any of the Hollywood rumors surrounding the last few years of her life .
All we know is that a woman who gave much of her life and herself to millions of strangers through her performances is dead at the age of 32 , and that is truly a tragedy .
For many , her passing will be just another addition to the " Year Of Celebrity Deaths , " and her story will be added to the annals of untimely celebrity passings , alongside the likes of Heath Ledger and her one - time prom date , Jonathan Brandis .
But to those who knew and loved her , Murphy 's passing is more than just another Hollywood tragedy , more than just another name for the list , and seeing her name alongside the others will provide no consolation .

North America 's electrical grid is one of the greatest technological achievements of the 20th century .
However , at the time of its design , the main goal was to make sure the lights stayed on , with no serious thought to energy efficiency , environmental conservation , alternative energy sources , consumer - tailored choices , or cyber security .
But times have changed , and today the grid offers a virtual window into your home – providing granular levels of information such as when you cook or shower , and for how long .
The information and communications technology revolution has changed our society in profound ways and these new technologies are being used to make the current electrical grid " smarter , " commonly referred to as the " smart grid . "
But this is not the future .
The deployment of smart meters in Ontario homes is already widespread , and the Ontario government has committed to installing this technology in all homes and small businesses by the end of 2010 .
President Barack Obama 's infusion of $ 3.4 billion ( U.S. ) to build the smart grid is greatly accelerating the delivery of the program across the U.S .
Smart meters record and report electricity consumption on an hourly basis – even at the appliance level .
Consumers can access their meter data and make individual choices about their energy use , benefitting by taking advantage of future rates .
While this technology is clearly beneficial in terms of valuable efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and reduce consumers ' energy bills , it will also give rise to a new challenge – privacy protection .
Privacy is the smart grid 's sleeper issue .
Whenever technology is utilized that targets individual consumers , there is invariably a dramatic increase in the amount of personally identifiable information that is collected and stored , leading to very real concerns regarding privacy .
This is why we need to bake privacy into the smart grid at the design stage – known as " privacy by design " – a concept developed to ensure the protection of privacy by making privacy the default in the design of new technologies and business practices .
We must take great care not to sacrifice consumer privacy amid an atmosphere of unbridled enthusiasm for electricity reform .
But we need not forfeit one for the other in a zero - sum manner ; we can adopt a positive - sum approach , where both interests may prevail .
Information proliferation , lax controls and insufficient oversight of this information could lead to unprecedented invasions of consumer privacy .
Intimate details of individual hydro customers ' habits , from when they eat , when they shower , to when they go to bed , plus such security issues as whether they have an alarm system engaged , could all be discerned by the data , automatically fed by appliances and other devices , to the companies providing electric power to our homes .
These concerns , however , are not meant to scare us away from the value of monitoring electrical usage data on the grid – giving consumers more control over their electricity usage and giving electricity providers the ability to manage demand requirements – what we need to embrace is the idea that the dissemination of personal information must be done in a privacy protective and transparent manner .
That is why – along with co-author Christopher Wolf – we are releasing a white paper today , SmartPrivacy for the Smart Grid : Embedding Privacy in the Design of Electricity Conservation , which not only emphasizes the necessity of building privacy into the smart grid , but also provides guidance as to what concrete steps can be taken .
For example , data minimization is key : only the minimal amount of personally identifiable information should be provided , based on the nature of the relevant service , such as the first three digits of a postal code , which may be sufficient for services that allow for comparison of neighbourhood averages and other features such as regional electrical usage .
In addition , when an electrical utility company is sharing data with a third - party service provider , a pseudonym , such as a unique ID number , may be utilized instead of a customer 's name or some other piece of information that can identify the individual .
Further , third - party service providers should enter into contractual agreements not to correlate consumer data with data obtained from other sources , without the consent of the consumer .
These are only a few of the steps that may be taken to ensure privacy protection on the smart grid .
The time for action is now , before the smart grid becomes a fully established part of our infrastructure .
We cannot allow privacy to become the Achilles heel of this new method of energy management .
The information collected on the smart grid will form a large and complex library of personal information , the mishandling of which could be highly invasive of personal privacy .
There will be major concerns if consumer - focused principles of transparency and control are not treated as essential design principles .
Both public and private sector organizations responsible for the processing of customers ' personal information on the smart grid must ensure that privacy is embedded into the design of the smart grid , from start to finish – end - to - end .
If we give consumers assurances that their privacy is protected , we can then ensure consumer confidence and trust , which will allow for the widespread acceptance of the smart grid , in turn contributing to the overall goal of using energy in more efficient and environmentally friendly ways .
We cannot and need not sacrifice privacy for energy efficiency .
We can have both privacy and a fully functioning smart grid .
A positive sum ( win - win ) outcome for all – electrical utility providers , consumers , the environment and privacy – is there for the asking .

See latest as Tropical Storm Ida becomes Hurricane Ida and enters Gulf CLICK HERE
Former Hurricane Ida is moving along as expected so far and for the next day or so , there is a pretty fair consensus on what is going to happen .
After that , well … there are a lot of scenarios .
Reports from Honduras and Nicaragua claim rain totals of up to 20 inches in some locations with some flooding and wind damage from the initial impact when Ida was a minimal hurricane .
It quickly fell back to a tropical depression and , almost exactly as forecast , moved offshore of the northeast coast of Honduras on Friday evening .
Ida emerged with a circulation but with the bulk of the convection on the northern half .
The southern half of the storm was almost void of any convective activity .
However , after just a few hours offshore , substantial convection began exploding in all sectors .
The intensity forecast is difficult to determine but this sudden burst makes me think its going to be interesting .
A couple of models suggest it becoming a hurricane again , but the NHC is dismissing those , citing an idea that wind shear will develop and prevent such an solution .
Over the next couple of days , Ida is expected to get a little better organized as it moves with a general northern component through the Yucatan Channel , though places like Cancuun and Cozumel will be affected .
Unlucky for tourists .
A cold front is still looking to move into the Gulf of Mexico by Tuesday and begin to influence the storm .
The National Hurricane Center has gone with the idea that the southwesterly shear from the trof will transform Ida into an Extra - Tropical Storm .
That means that the physical structure will go from a tropical low , which is a warm core low , to a cold core low .
Pragmatically , that is not so much of a big deal because extra-tropical storms can produce extremely strong winds and bring excessive rains .
I would think that the storm would get swept northeast .
But , there have been several models that want to take the storm back to the southeast once it gets into the Northwest Gulf .
I have to be honest .
This is extremely complex .
There is another area of disturbed weather in the Bay of Campeche and the models are all over the place .
I do n’t think the Southwest Gulf system will do much except draw a lot of moisture into the US Central Gulf Coast but I do think its presence is helping to confuse the models .
The discussion from the NHC ( see below ) is no help and provides no explanation .
My maps do n’t go far enough south to provide an answer as to why the storm would go back southeast instead of getting picked up by the trof and scooted northeast .
I am left to assume that the answer is that Ida gets by passed by the trof crossing the United States and leaves it behind or it gets shoved south by the front .
But , what leaves me a bit befuddled is that , if it is involved with the trof sufficiently to transform it to a extra- tropical storm , I would think that the trof would have enough influence to pick it up .
I ’ve got models running deep lows anywhere from New Orleans to Tallahassee or back to the southeast with a couple taking it northeast .
This points out the difficulty of models to pick up on not fully developed tropical systems .
These models are designed for tropical cyclones and when they turn extra tropical , the models can get confused … and so am I .
Stay tuned .

TROPICAL DEPRESSION IDA DISCUSSION NUMBER 11
NWS TPC / NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL AL112009
1000 PM EST FRI NOV 06 2009
A 2302 UTC SSMIS MICROWAVE PASS INDICATED THAT THE LOW - LEVEL CENTER
OF IDA WAS LOCATED JUST OFF THE NORTHEASTERN COAST OF HONDURAS AND
WAS DISPLACED TO THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST OF THE DEEP CONVECTION .
NEW CONVECTION IS DEVELOPING CLOSE TO THE CENTER …AND DVORAK
ESTIMATES FROM TAFB AND SAB ARE 25 KT AND 30 KT…RESPECTIVELY .
NOAA BUOY 42057… LOCATED ABOUT 150 N MI EAST - NORTHEAST OF THE
CENTER…RECENTLY REPORTED A 1-MINUTE SUSTAINED WIND OF 35 KT…BUT
IT APPEARS THAT THIS OCCURRED WITH THE PASSAGE OF A SQUALL AND MAY
NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OVERALL CIRCULATION .
THEREFORE …IDA
IS KEPT AS A TROPICAL DEPRESSION FOR THIS ADVISORY …BUT IT IS
PROBABLY VERY CLOSE TO REGAINING TROPICAL STORM STATUS .
IDA CONTINUES TO MOVE NORTHWARD AT 360/6 .
A MID - LEVEL ANTICYCLONE
BETWEEN JAMAICA AND HISPANIOLA AND A DEEP -LAYER TROUGH OVER MEXICO
ARE EXPECTED TO STEER IDA NORTH -NORTHWESTWARD
THROUGH THE NEXT 72
HOURS .
THE TRACK GUIDANCE IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT DURING THIS PERIOD
ALTHOUGH THE GFDL AND HWRF MODELS ARE THE EASTERNMOST MODELS AND
HAVE FORCED THE MODEL CONSENSUS A LITTLE MORE TO THE EAST .
THE
FORECAST BEYOND 72 HOURS IS STILL COMPLEX AND IS DEPENDENT ON HOW
IDA INTERACTS WITH THE FRONT AND SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER THE GULF OF
MEXICO .
MOST OF THE GUIDANCE SHOWS IDA BECOMING EXTRATROPICAL BY
96 HOURS ONCE IT MERGES WITH THE FRONT …BUT THE SOLUTIONS VARY ON
WHERE THE LOW GOES NEXT .
ONLY THE 1200 UTC ECMWF AND UKMET SHOW
IDA BECOMING PICKED UP BY A SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND MOVING
NORTHEASTWARD OVER THE NORTHERN GULF .
THE OTHER MODELS INDICATE A
MORE PRONOUNCED SOUTHWARD MOTION AFTER 96 HOURS…AND THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST NOW SHOWS A SLOW SOUTHEASTWARD TURN AT 120 HOURS .
ALTHOUGH WATERS ARE WARM OVER THE NORTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN…VERTICAL
SHEAR IS EXPECTED TO HAMPER MUCH INTENSIFICATION OVER THE NEXT FEW
DAYS .
THE GFDL AND HWRF MAKE IDA A HURRICANE OVER THE CENTRAL GULF
OF MEXICO…A SCENARIO THAT DOES NOT SEEM PLAUSIBLE IN THE FACE OF
WESTERLY SHEAR THAT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO 50 OR 60 KT BY DAY
4. THE OFFICIAL FORECAST INDICATES SOME SLOW STRENGTHENING OVER
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS BUT PEAKS THE INTENSITY AT 45 KT…WHICH IS
JUST BELOW THE INTENSITY CONSENSUS .
IT IS OF NOTE THAT MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS ARE SHOWING A LARGE
PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN A HIGH OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED
STATES AND THE TROPICAL CYCLONE .
THIS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO A LARGE
AREA OF STRONG WINDS OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO NOT DIRECTLY
ATTRIBUTABLE TO IDA .

FORECASTER BERG
BAGHDAD , Iraq —
Iraq literally rolled out the red carpet for foreign oil executives Friday at a bidding round that auctioned off the rights to develop some of the world ’s last known giant reserves of cheap oil .
After the first oil auction in June , when international oil companies were asking up to 10 times more profit what the Iraqi government was offering , Friday ’s winning bids made clear that European and Asian firms at least were willing to settle for a lot less to get in on the market .
American companies were noticeably absent from the aggressive bidding while the French , despite being courted by Iraqi officials who had told them Iraq would favor them in oil deals , lost the biggest prize , the super - giant Majnoon field , to Anglo - Dutch Shell and Malaysia ’s state - owned oil company .
The auction , only the second since the 2003 invasion , was conducted like a high - stakes game show .
To ensure transparency , oil company representatives brought their bids to the stage in sealed envelopes .
The figures were then put up on giant screens with the winner announced to polite applause from the other bidders .
Outside , roads around the ministry were sealed to traffic while rings of soldiers and police surrounded the building .
Inside the newly renovated auditorium , the potential of billions of dollars of profit was won and lost in a single calculation .
The French company Total lost its bid for Majnoon , which it helped develop , when Royal Dutch Shell offered higher increased production at 36 cents less profit per barrel .
“ Surprising figures , ” said one Iraqi oil adviser to a European executive of the morning ’s bidding .
The executive agreed .
“ Due to the lessons learned of the first bid , the second bid was very competitive and they are very , very aggressive with their offers , ” said France ’s new ambassador to Iraq , Boris Boillon .
“ Total made tremendous efforts to present a very aggressive and good offer and they did so but they found in front of a company that did even better so it ’s too bad for them . ”
The oil companies seemed to have made the calculation that the rewards of developing fields in Iraq ’s relatively stable south were worth the risks .
Majnoon , with almost 13 billion barrels of reserves , like the rest of the southern fields has some of the most accessible , lowest - cost oil in the world .
The north though was a different story .
Three oil fields in the north and on the edge of Baghdad ’s Sadr City attracted only one bid — from Angola ’s state oil company .
Sonangol offered to develop the Qaiyarah field in Ninevah province , one of the most turbulent provinces in the country , for $ 12.50 profit per barrel .
Officials conducting the auction asked if they ’d like to revise it to the maximum $ 5 per barrel profit the oil ministry was willing to pay .
“ That ’s not in our plans , ” a bewildered Sonangol representative responded .
The bid was rejected .
The oil companies also seemingly discounted the risk of a less Western - friendly Iraqi government in the future .
Shell ’s Middle East vice president Mounir Bouaziz said he was not concerned that any successive Iraqi leaders could renege on the terms of the contracts .
“ We have faith in the government , ” he said .
With many Iraqis convinced that the war was fought over oil , the contracts are designed to retain Iraqi ownership of the oil and provide foreign firms a fee per barrel for reaching production targets .
How would Justice Scalia have voted on Brown v. Board of Education ?
The NYT's Adam Liptak asks that straightforward question in an intriguing little story out Tuesday .
According to Liptak , Scalia does n't readily enjoy talking about the hypothetical concerning the famed 1954 case that banned segregation in public schools .
The decision is hard to square with Justice Scalia 's commitment to originalism , the theory of constitutional interpretation that says judges must apply the original understanding of the constitutional text .
LIptak writes that the weight of the historical evidence is that the people who drafted the 14th Amendment did not believe themselves to be doing away with segregated schools .
The question came up at the University of Arizona last month in what was billed as a conversation between Justice Scalia and Justice Stephen Breyer .
Breyer asked Scalia about the case , but did n't exactly get a straightforward answer from Scalia .
Writes Liptak on Scalia 's answer :
" As for Brown v. Board of Education , I think I would have " -- and then he changed directions .
He said he would have voted with the dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson , the case Brown overruled .
But Plessy , decided in 1896 , concerned the segregation of passengers on railroads .
That is an easier case for originalists .
For starters , railroads were long considered common carriers required to serve all customers equally .
In a 2005 profile in The New Yorker , Justice Scalia said he would have voted with the majority in Brown .
But he did not explain why .
Liptak writes that Scalia seemed to suggest that Brown reached the right result as a policy matter but that it was not compelled by the Constitution .
Still , in Arizona , Scalia was a fervent defender of the originalist approach .
" Do n't make up your mind on this significant question between originalism and playing it by ear on the basis of whether , now and then , the latter approach might give you a result you like , " Justice Scalia said .
" The test is over the long run does it require the society to adhere to those principles contained in the Constitution or does it lead to a society that is essentially governed by nine justices ' version of what equal protection ought to mean ? "
No one will really understand politics until they understand that politicians are not trying to solve our problems .
They are trying to solve their own problems -- of which getting elected and re-elected are number one and number two .
Whatever is number three is far behind .
Many of the things the government does that may seem stupid are not stupid at all , from the standpoint of the elected officials or bureaucrats who do these things .
The current economic downturn that has cost millions of people their jobs began with successive administrations of both parties pushing banks and other lenders to make mortgage loans to people whose incomes , credit history and inability or unwillingness to make a substantial down payment on a house made them bad risks .
Was that stupid ?
Not at all .
The money that was being put at risk was not the politicians ' money , and in most cases was not even the government 's money .
Moreover , the jobs that are being lost by the millions are not the politicians ' jobs -- and jobs in the government 's bureaucracies are increasing .
No one pushed these reckless mortgage lending policies more than Congressman Barney Frank , who brushed aside warnings about risk , and said in 2003 that he wanted to " roll the dice " even more in the housing markets .
But it would very rash to bet against Congressman Frank 's getting re-elected in 2010 .
After the cascade of economic disasters that began in the housing markets in 2006 and spread into the financial markets in Wall Street and even overseas , people in the private sector pulled back .
Banks stopped making so many risky loans .
Home buyers began buying homes they could afford , instead of going out on a limb with " creative " -- and risky -- financing schemes to buy homes that were beyond their means .
But politicians went directly in the opposite direction .
In the name of " rescuing " the housing market , Congress passed laws enabling the Federal Housing Administration to insure more and bigger risky loans -- loans where there is less than a 4 percent down payment .
A recent news story told of three young men who chipped in a total of $ 33,000 to buy a home in San Francisco that cost nearly a million dollars .
Why would a bank lend that kind of money to them on such a small down payment ?
Because the loan was insured by the Federal Housing Administration .
The bank was n't taking any risk .
If the three guys defaulted , the bank could always collect the money from the Federal Housing Administration .
The only risk was to the taxpayers .
Does the Federal Housing Administration have unlimited money to bail out bad loans ?
Actually there have been so many defaults that the FHA 's own reserves have dropped below where they are supposed to be .
But not to worry .
There will always be taxpayers , not to mention future generations to pay off the national debt .
Very few people are likely to connect the dots back to those members of Congress who voted for bigger mortgage guarantees and bailouts by the FHA .
So the Congressmen 's and the bureaucrats ' jobs are safe , even if millions of other people 's jobs are not .
Congressman Barney Frank is not about to cut back on risky mortgage loan guarantees by the FHA .
He recently announced that he plans to introduce legislation to raise the limit on FHA loan guarantees even more .
Congressman
Frank will make himself popular with people who get those loans and with banks that make these high - risk loans where they can pocket the profits and pass the risk on to the FHA .
So long as the taxpayers do n't understand that all this political generosity and compassion are at their expense , Barney Frank is an odds - on favorite to get re-elected .
The man is not stupid .
What is stupid is believing that politicians are trying to solve our problems , instead of theirs .
As for the FHA running low on money , that is not about to stop the gravy train , certainly not with an election coming up in 2010 .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is also running low on money .
But that is not going to stop them from insuring bank accounts up to a quarter of a million dollars .
It would be stupid for them to stop with an election coming up in 2010 .

The Philosophical Roots of the Marx - Bakunin Conflict
First Published : What 's Next , December 2003 ;
“ Again , I ’m not enough of a Marx scholar to pretend to an authoritative judgement .
My impression , for what it is worth , is that the early Marx was very much a figure of the late Enlightenment , and the later Marx was a highly authoritarian activist , and a critical analyst of capitalism , who had little to say about socialist alternatives .
But those are impressions . ”
Noam Chomsky .
THE TEMPESTUOUS relation between Marx and Bakunin is a well known legacy of the history of western socialism .
As co-members of the International Working Men ’s Association , they seem to have devoted as much energy battling one another as their common enemy , the capitalist system , culminating in Marx ’s successful campaign to expel Bakunin from the organization .
While at times engaging in cordial relations , they nevertheless harbored uncomplimentary mutual assessments .
According to Marx , Bakunin was “ a man devoid of all theoretical knowledge ” and was “ in his element as an intriguer ” , 1 while Bakunin believed that “ ... the instinct of liberty is lacking in him [ Marx ] ; he remains from head to foot , an authoritarian ” .
2
For some , the intensity of the conflict has been puzzling , given that the two authors seem to be struggling for identical goals .
Convinced that capitalism is predicated on the exploitation of workers by capitalists , they were equally dedicated to fighting for a socialist society where economic classes would be abolished and all individuals would have the opportunity to develop all of their creative capacities .
Hence , both envisioned socialism as eliminating the division of labor , especially between mental and manual work , and between men and women .
In other words , the work process was to be transformed so that all workers would take an active role in the organization , design and implementation of it .
Moreover , both argued that the oppressed must liberate themselves – one should not expect any benevolent impulses from members of the ruling , capitalist class ; and to insure success , the revolution must assume an international scope .
Finally , they agreed that the State was an instrument of class oppression , not some neutral organ that equitably represented everyone ’s interests , and in the final analysis must be abolished .
The 1871 Paris Commune offered , in their opinion , a model to be emulated .
However , their most profound point of disagreement centered on their conflicting analyses of the State .
Most importantly , while Marx envisioned a transitional stage between capitalism and a fully mature communist society , which included a state in the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat ( i.e. , a workers ’ state ) , Bakunin adamantly rejected the establishment of any kind of state , including a workers ’ state .
In fact , this rejection is the defining principle of the school of anarchism , a term that literally translates as “ no government ” .
For Bakunin , the only consistent , revolutionary option was to move immediately to a fully mature communist society which , both authors agreed , would be distinguished by the absence of a state .
As a corollary to this disagreement , Marx supported attempts by independently organized workers to pursue their class interests by pressing for reforms within the bourgeois state – for example , for a reduction in the length of the working day – arguing that such victories would promote class consciousness , whereas Bakunin contested this proposal on the grounds that any political engagement whatsoever would constitute a perversion of the revolutionary movement and instead advocated complete abstention from the bourgeois political arena .
The proper form of a revolutionary organization was also a point of dispute .
Bakunin enthusiastically created secret societies as catalysts for a revolutionary upsurge while Marx flatly rejected them .
Finally , the two contested the proper role of the peasants in a revolutionary movement .
Bakunin argued that they might play a leading role while Marx designated the proletariat as the exclusive , leading revolutionary agent .
Because of the preponderance of the points of agreement , some commentators have resorted to personality flaws to account for the interminable disharmony that plagued their relation .
For example , Bakunin has been accused of being both anti-Semitic and anti-Germanic while Marx has been considered to suffer from an incurable strain of rigid authoritarianism .
A more promising line of explanation of their intractable differences , however , lies in an investigation into the profoundly divergent philosophical frameworks that served as the points of departure for their respective political analyses .
As will be shown below , their foundational concepts are so incompatible that even their points of agreement are rendered more illusory than substantive .
Bakunin’s Philosophic Positions
Some of the important philosophical assumptions Bakunin employed in his approach to human reality were borrowed from the European Enlightenment , particularly the empiricist branch of this tradition , so a proper appreciation for his framework requires a brief excursion into its principles .
Having witnessed the phenomenal success of the natural sciences with such practitioners as Galileo and Newton , among others , many Enlightenment philosophers were inspired to transpose both the method and guiding assumptions of the natural sciences onto the domain of human behavior .
These borrowed assumptions included the conviction that different kinds of natural objects contain their unique and defining fixed essence ; objects interact with one another according to immutable mechanical laws of cause and effect ; and after careful observation of individual interactions , the appropriate laws can be conclusively identified and codified .
Consequently , the assumption was commonly adopted by members of the Enlightenment that humans are entirely natural creatures along the lines of other natural species and accordingly embody a unique and permanent essence and exhibit behavior that is entirely determined by natural causes .
This approach was highlighted by the popular recourse to the concept of “ the state of nature ” .
As a state that either literally or figuratively preceded the formation of organized societies , it purported to offer a glimpse into human nature in its purely “ natural ” state , prior to alterations resulting from the impact of society .
Philosophers during this period , which coincided with the rise of capitalism , almost universally described humans as individualistic , autonomous and independent and to one degree or another strongly inclined to pursue their own self interest , in conformity with the prevailing bourgeois norms .
Bakunin deviated somewhat from this philosophic tradition by rejecting the description of humans as essentially individualistic .
For example , he mocked the conception of society as originating by means of isolated , independent individuals contracting with one another , labeling this version a philosophic “ fiction ” , and argued instead that humans were naturally social and always lived in communities .
But he profoundly subscribed to the view that humans should be regarded on the same theoretical plane as other natural objects and that consequently human behavior was governed entirely by mechanical , natural laws .
The following quotations offer a sample of this outlook :
“ There are a good many laws which govern it [ society ] without its being aware of them , but these are natural laws , inherent in the body social ....
[ T ] hey have governed human society ever since its birth ; independent of the thinking and the will of the men composing the society . ”
3
“ [ Natural laws ] ... constitute our being , our whole being , physically , intellectually , and morally : we live , we breathe , we act , we think , we wish only through these laws . ”
4
“ History and statistics prove to us that the social body , like any other natural body , obeys in its evolutions and transformations general laws which appear to be just as necessary as the laws of the physical world . ”
5
“ Man himself is nothing but Nature ....
Nature envelopes , permeates , constitutes his whole existence . ”
6
Bakunin ’s ethics at first glance seem to be a logical corollary to his general naturalistic framework in so far as he identifies what is morally good with what is natural :
“ The moral law ... is indeed an actual law ... because it emanates from the very nature of human society , the root basis of which is to be sought not in God but in animality . ”
7
“ I speak of that justice which is based solely upon human conscience , the justice which you will rediscover deep in the conscience of everyman , even the conscience of the child and which translates itself into simple equality . ”
8
In other words , justice is a natural human sentiment which permanently resides in the human constitution .
Bakunin ’s definition of evil , however , was not altogether consistent .
On the one hand , he seems to have followed the empiricist tradition by identifying it with what is also natural : “ We know very well , in any case , that what we call good and bad are always , one and the other , the natural results of natural causes , and that consequently one is as inevitable as the other . ”9
On the other hand , perhaps because he found it politically advantageous , Bakunin also identified evil , not with a natural impulse or sentiment , but with what is “ unnatural ” , thereby creating a dualistic universe that was not entirely captured by natural laws .
What lay outside these laws was the unnatural , the artificial , a domain which consequently could persevere only by constant recourse to force and coercion :
“ We must distinguish well between natural laws and authoritarian , arbitrary , political , religious , criminal , and civil laws which the privileged classes have established ....
” 10
One final important component of Bakunin ’s philosophic arsenal is his notion of freedom .
We shall see that when Marx and Bakunin mention this term , they have in mind two entirely different concepts .
Bakunin ’s understanding of this term contains several important facets .
For example , for Bakunin , acting freely means , above all , acting “ naturally ” or according to one ’s natural impulses :
“ The liberty of man consists solely in this : that he obeys natural laws because he has himself recognized them as such , and not because they have been externally imposed upon him by any extrinsic will whatever , divine or human , collective or individual .
” 11 In other words , this definition rests on the conception of humans as natural creatures governed by natural laws .
To act naturally is simply to be spontaneous , to be “ oneself ” : “ Once more , Life , not science , creates life ; the spontaneous action of the people themselves alone can create liberty .
” 12
The identification of freedom with spontaneity or impulsive behavior then leads to a second feature of Bakunin ’s definition .
He is embracing a conception of freedom that can be exercised by an single individual , isolated from a human community .
One can act spontaneously entirely alone ; it does not , for example , require a special , acquired mental capacity .
Consequently , for Bakunin , freedom was an attribute of individuals , not of humans constituting a collectivity :
“ Liberty ... consists in my being entitled , as a man , to obey no other man and to act only on my own judgment .
” 13
“ Liberty is the absolute right of all adult men and women to seek no sanction for their actions except their own conscience and their own reason , to determine them only of their own free will , and consequently to be responsible for them to themselves first of all , and then to society of which they are a part , but only in so far as they freely consent to be a part of it .
” 14
However , because he viewed humans as naturally social , at times he tried to take this understanding of freedom and demonstrate that it could operate consistently in a human community :
“ I am a fanatical lover of liberty ....
I do not mean that formal liberty which is dispensed , measured out , and regulated by the State ....
Nor do I mean that individualist , egoist , base , and fraudulent liberty extolled by the school of Jean Jacques Rousseau and every other school of bourgeois liberalism , which considers the rights of all , represented by the State , as a limit for the rights of each ....
No , I mean the only liberty worthy of the name , the liberty which implies the full development of all the material , intellectual , and moral capacities latent in everyone of us ; the liberty which knows no other restrictions but those set by the laws of our own nature .
Consequently there are , properly speaking , no restrictions , since these laws are not imposed upon us by any legislator from outside , alongside , or above ourselves .
These laws are subjective , inherent in ourselves ; they constitute the very basis of our being .... [ T ] hat liberty of each man which does not find another man ’s freedom a boundary but confirmation and vast extension of his own ; liberty through solidarity , in equality .
” 15
Leaving aside the question whether this formulation is consistent with his earlier versions , Bakunin is basically arguing that it is our nature to live together in equality , cooperating with one another , where no one exploits or is exploited .
Hence , if I am acting naturally and consequently freely , then I am not exploiting my neighbor , thereby allowing my neighbor to live naturally and freely .
In this way one individual ’s freedom serves as a confirmation and extension of another .
But still , this conception of freedom is grounded on the individual : “ ... collective liberty and prosperity exist only so far as they represent the sum of individual liberties and prosperities .
” 16
To summarize Bakunin ’s philosophy , he is operating , by and large , within the naturalistic framework established by the empiricist current of the Enlightenment .
Humans are conceived as embodying a permanently fixed nature with behavior basically determined by natural laws .
This state of affairs is then identified with what is good .
However , when coercion enters into the relations among people , we enter the realm of the unnatural .
We are alienated from our natural condition and we lose our freedom .
The Philosophy of Marx
While Bakunin ’s major theoretical assumptions were firmly rooted in materialist Enlightenment philosophy , Marx was impacted by this tradition for the most part only after it underwent a significant transformation in the hands of Hegel .
Most importantly , Hegel rejected the Enlightenment conviction that humans are a natural species , conforming to the same kind of permanently fixed laws as the rest of the natural world .
Instead , he postulated a vision of humanity engaged in a developmental process , constantly transforming and recreating itself in its struggle to become increasingly rational .
Moreover , this undertaking was conceived as a collective endeavor since rationality , in the final analysis , is an attribute that requires , both for its original emergence and its continual exercise , the contribution of the entire species .
For example , each new generation builds on the rational accomplishments of its predecessors , and in this way humans gradually succeed in creating a scientific grasp of reality .
Finally , in Hegel ’s opinion , this historical process culminates in a state of consummate rationality when humanity acquires self - knowledge .
Here humans achieve the capacity to regulate their interactions according to conscious , rational canons and have come to understand themselves as a rational species in a collective sense .
Marx adopted Hegel ’s vision of humans engaged in a collective undertaking but argued in favor of a different logic governing the process .
For Hegel , the logic of history reflected the logic of human consciousness while Marx anchored the logic to a materialist substructure .
In particular , for Marx , the manner in which humans go about satisfying their basic needs stamps a certain structure on the kind of society they create , the relations people have with one another , and the ideas they formulate about themselves and the surrounding world :
“ In the social production of their existence , men inevitably enter into definite relations , which are independent of their will , namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production .
The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society , the real foundation , on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness .
The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social , political and intellectual life .
It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence , but their social existence that determines their consciousness .
” 17
Moreover , this economic foundation contains a certain logic that unleashes a historical movement :
“ ... [ W ]e must begin by stating the first premise of all human existence and , therefore , of all history , the premise , namely that man must be in a position to live in order to be able to ‘ make history . ’
But life involves before everything else eating and drinking , a habitation , clothing and many other things .
The first historical act is thus the production of the means to satisfy these needs , the production of material life itself .
The second point is that the satisfaction of the first need ... leads to new needs ; and this production of new needs is the first historical act .
” 18
Like Hegel , Marx viewed this historical process as a collective endeavor since humans depend on one another both for the satisfaction of their basic physical needs and for the acquisition of higher needs :
“ The object before us , to begin with , material production .
Individuals producing in society – hence socially determined individual production , is , of course , the point of departure .
The individual and isolated hunter and fisherman , with whom Smith and Ricardo begin , belongs among the unimaginative conceits of the eighteenth - century Robinsonades , which in no way express merely a reaction against over - sophistication and a return to a misunderstood natural life , as cultural historians imagine .
As little as Rousseau ’s contrat social , which brings naturally independent , autonomous subjects into relation and connection by contract , rests on such naturalism .
”
19
While Bakunin posited a fixed , natural human essence , Marx , again following Hegel ’s lead , believed that human nature itself unfolded in a developmental process whereby the specific nature of one historical epoch was shed and a new nature was donned in a perpetual process of re-creation .
As humans invent ever more sophisticated instruments to employ in the production process , they simultaneously transform themselves into more rational , universal individuals .
At the beginning of history , the human species was hardly distinguishable from the rest of the animal kingdom ; people were impulsive and lacked a conscious understanding of themselves and their environment .
In other words , Bakunin ’s picture of humanity as a fixed , natural species only enjoys a fleeting validity at the earliest stage of history in Marx ’s perspective :
“ This beginning is as animal as social life itself at this stage .
It is mere herd - consciousness , and at this point man is only distinguished from the sheep by the fact that with him consciousness takes the place of instinct or that his instinct is a conscious one .
This sheep - like or tribal consciousness receives its further development and extension through increased productivity , the increase of needs , and , what is fundamental to both of these , the increase of population . ”
20
But in the course of a communist revolution , a remarkable transformation takes place : the working class seizes control of the instruments of production and , for the first time , begins to direct them according to a conscious , rational plan :
“ All - round dependence , this natural form of the world - historical co-operation of individuals , will be transformed by this communist revolution into the control and conscious mastery of these powers , which born of the action of men on one another , have till now overawed and governed men as powers completely alien to them . ”
21
Here humans have abandoned their animal - like , impulsive existence in favor of a deliberate , rational regulation of their affairs .
But conscious mastery of the productive forces can only be achieved when humans work in cooperation and harmony with one another , for as long as economic classes exist with their accompanying exploitation , relations of domination will substitute for rational discussion , thereby precluding the possibility of consciously controlling the productive forces :
“ First , the productive forces appear as a world for themselves , quite independent of and divorced from the individuals , alongside the individuals : the reason for this that the individuals , whose forces they are , exist split up and in opposition to one another , whilst , on the other hand , these forces are only real forces in the intercourse and association of these individuals .
” 22
For this reason , the involvement of all individuals in the conscious control of the economy is an absolute prerequisite :
“ In all appropriations up to now , a mass of individuals remained subservient to a single instrument of production ; in the appropriation by the proletarians , a mass of instruments of production must be made subject to each individual , and property to all .
Modern universal intercourse can be controlled by individuals , therefore , only when controlled by all . ” 23
In stark contradiction to Bakunin , Marx believed that a successful revolution does not signal the recapturing of an original , natural essence that was stifled by the advent of the State and the creation of classes , but rather the creation of a new human being :
“ Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist consciousness , and for the success of the cause itself , the alteration of men on a mass scale is necessary , an alteration which can only take place in a practical movement , a revolution ; this revolution is necessary , therefore not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in any other way , but also because the class overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew .
” 24
Thus , in the revolutionary process , the proletariat transforms itself from a passive class , following the dictates of the bourgeoisie , into a self - determining agent capable of taking the reins of history into its own hands and directing events according to a conscious plan .
This represents the dawn of a new age in which individuals act collectively and consciously in determining social policy : “ Only at this stage does self - activity coincide with material life , which corresponds to the development of individuals into complete individuals and the casting off of all natural limitations .
” 25
We see , therefore , that Marx and Bakunin have developed two dramatically divergent visions of humanity .
Bakunin adopted a static version of human nature , identifying it with what is physically natural while Marx posited a humanity that was undergoing maturation , leaving behind a more animal - like existence as it achieved ever higher levels of rationality and self - consciousness .
Their ethical doctrines correspondingly reflected these different conceptual frameworks .
While Bakunin defined the good in terms of what is “ natural , ” Marx relativized ethical terms historically so that each new mode of production was seen to spawn new ethical assumptions :
“ The production of ideas , of conceptions , of consciousness , is at first directly interwoven with the material activity and the material intercourse of men , the language of real life .
Conceiving , thinking , the mental intercourse of men , appear at this stage as the direct efflux of their material behavior .
The same applies to mental productions as expressed in the language of politics , laws , morality , religion , metaphysics , etc. , of a people .
Men are the producers of their conceptions , ideas , etc. – real , active men , as they are conditioned by a definite development of their productive forces and of the intercourse corresponding to these , up to its furthest forms . ” 26
In the context of criticizing Gilbart , a 19th century British historian of economics who claimed that deriving profit from money through interest was “ naturally ” just , Marx argued that there is no natural justice , i.e. , no justice that is permanently valid :
“ To speak here of natural justice , as Gilbart does ... is nonsense .
The justice of the transactions between agents of production rests on the fact that these arise as natural consequences out of the production relationships .
The juristic forms in which these economic transactions appear as willful acts of the parties concerned , as expressions of their common will and as contracts that may be enforced by law against some individual party , cannot , being mere forms , determine this content .
They merely express it .
This content is just whenever it corresponds , is appropriate , to the mode of production .
It is unjust whenever it contradicts that mode . ” 27
Marx ’s notion of freedom also involves a paradigm shift in relation to Bakunin and the empiricist school of the Enlightenment .
There are two pivotal turns that Marx executed in departing from this tradition and in both cases he was following Hegel ’s analysis .
First , for Marx , freedom does not amount to following one ’s impulses or engaging in spontaneity .
Impulses are a part of one ’s natural constitution – they are not the product of choice .
When we act impulsively , we act “ naturally ” and without conscious reflection .
However , when we rationally and consciously direct our behavior , we ourselves , through thoughtful deliberation , determine our course of action .
Marx accordingly allied himself with that sector of the Enlightenment that was represented , for example , by Kant and Rousseau , where both endorsed the autonomy of the subject :
“ Really free working , e.g. composing , is at the same time precisely the most damned seriousness , the most intense exertion .
The work of material production can achieve this character only ( 1 ) when its social character is posited , ( 2 ) when it is of a scientific and at the same time general character , not merely human exertion as a specifically harnessed natural force , but exertion as subject , which appears in the production process not in a merely natural , spontaneous form , but as an activity regulating all the forces of nature .
” 28
Second , and connected with the first point , freedom is not a capacity that is exercised fundamentally by an individual ; rather it is for Marx undertaken primarily by a community of people and in this respect his analysis deviates from Kant and Rousseau .
Science , for example , is not a discipline that can be created or employed by an isolated individual .
Humans existed for thousands of years before they were in a position to begin to engage in scientific thought , and many more thousands of years passed before they were able to create formal , scientific theories .
And no progress could be made at all in this direction until humans developed the ability to build on the contributions of previous generations .
Moreover , because humans are dependent upon one another for the satisfaction of their needs , both physical and psychological , they are compelled to work with one another .
Within capitalist society , rather than working with one another directly , cooperation is enforced indirectly by people competing against one another , each consulting only his or her private interest in determining which option to pursue .
But such behavior entails that the structure people operate within does not become an object of critical reflection precisely because , from the vantage point of an isolated individual , it is impossible to alter .
Hence , from this perspective society appears to be as inflexible as the law of gravity .
But the goal of a socialist society is to invert this relation .
Instead of individuals feeling powerless in the face of their own social institutions , by directly coming together through organized discourse , they place themselves in a position to alter these institutions according to their own needs and values .
But this can only be accomplished when individuals are operating as a coordinated force , where they are discussing , debating and voting on which options to pursue , and where everyone has the opportunity to participate .
Consequently a socialist society brings into play a new definition of freedom , and , in Marx ’s opinion , a superior conception : the collective , rational determination of social policy .
“ Freedom in this field can only consist in socialized man , the associated producers , rationally regulating their interchange with Nature , bringing it under their common control , instead of being ruled by it as by blind forces of Nature . ”
29
Consequently , Bakunin ’s individualistic definition of freedom , in Marx ’s opinion , remains mired in the conceptual framework of bourgeois philosophy and simply sows confusion when transplanted onto a socialist foundation :
“ Liberty [ i.e. the bourgeois conception ] , therefore is the right to do everything that harms no one else .
The limits within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law , just as the boundary between two fields is determined by a boundary post .
It is a question of the liberty of man as an isolated monad , withdrawn into himself ....
But the [ bourgeois ] right of man to liberty is based not on the association of man with man , but on the separation of man from man .
It is the right of this separation , the right of the restricted individual , withdrawn into himself .
”
30
In fact , this bourgeois conception of freedom , when compared to a more advanced socialist conception , is simply another form of slavery :
“ Precisely the slavery of civil society is in appearance the greatest freedom because it is in appearance the fully developed independence of the individual , who considers as his own freedom the uncurbed movement , no longer bound by a common bond or by man , of the estranged elements of his life , such as property , industry , religion , etc. , whereas actually this is his fully developed slavery and inhumanity . ”
31
The differences between Marx ’s and Bakunin ’s definitions of freedom , in the final analysis , stem directly from their opposed philosophical presuppositions .
For Bakunin , since humans are a natural species , it only makes sense to define freedom as acting naturally .
But for Marx , since he regards humanity as in the process of lifting itself above nature , freedom is identified with collective , rational action .
One final cornerstone of Marx ’s philosophic foundation concerns his analysis of the laws of history .
As we have seen , his historical , materialist approach committed him to emphasizing the role of economic conditions in determining the course of history .
But while Bakunin argued that historical laws could be reduced to natural laws , thereby implying that humans have no more control over their destiny than natural objects , Marx postulated a dynamic relation between human intentions and the surrounding economic environment :
“ Men make their own history , but they do not make it just as they please ; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves , but under circumstances directly encountered , given and transmitted from the past . ”
32
“ It shows that circumstances make men just as much as men make circumstances . ”
33
Here , the material environment and human intentions conjoin to nudge , or hurl , as the case may be , history in a particular direction .
This dynamic relationship for Marx is rooted in the basic production process through which humans relate both to one another and to nature :
“ Labour is , in the first place , a process in which both men and Nature participate , and in which man of his own accord starts , regulates , and controls the material re-actions between himself and Nature .
He opposes himself to Nature as one of her own forces , setting in motion arms and legs , head and hands , the natural forces of his body , in order to appropriate Nature ’s productions in a form adapted to his own wants .
By thus acting on the external world and changing it , he at the same time changes his own nature .
He develops his slumbering powers and compels them to act in obedience to his sway .
We are not now dealing with those primitive instinctive forms of labour that remind us of the mere animal ....
We pre-suppose labour in a form that stamps it as exclusively human .
A spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver , and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells .
But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this , that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality . ”
34
In other words , the economic foundation itself upon which history rests in Marx ’s system , includes the role of human consciousness as an irreducible moment .
Consequently , Marx ’s materialism does not commit him to a mechanical explanation where each historical event is conclusively determined by a preceding set of conditions , as in the natural sciences .
Rather , the surrounding economic conditions establish certain parameters within which human intentions operate , thereby stamping a general logic on these intentions without entirely determining them .
It is impossible , for example , to create a computer when one has only stone implements at one ’s disposal , but one is not compelled to create a computer even if all the necessary technology is available .
For this reason Marx insisted upon drawing a sharp boundary between nature , on the one hand , and history on the other :
“ Nature does not produce on the one side owners of money or commodities , and on the other men possessing nothing but their own labour - power .
This relation has no natural basis , neither is its social basis one that is common to all historical periods .
It is clearly the result of a past historical development , the product of many economic revolutions , of the extinction of a whole series of older forms of social production .
” 35
And for this reason he was also critical of attempts to depict history as one more branch of the natural sciences :
“ Does not the history of the productive organs of man [ i.e. technology ] , of organs that are the material basis of all social organization , deserve equal attention [ as the history of the organs of plants and animals ] ?
And would not such a history be easier to compile , since , as Vico says , human history differs from natural history in this , that we have made the former , but not the latter ?
...
The weak points in the abstract materialism of natural science , a materialism that excludes history and its process , are at once evident from the abstract and ideological conceptions of its spokesmen , whenever they venture beyond the bounds of their own speciality . ”
36
The Dispute Over the Dictatorship of the Proletariat
With their divergent philosophical frameworks at least partially clarified , it becomes clearer why their political differences could not be resolved .
Their respective political programs were tied to conflicting philosophical principles so that they were at times being pulled in diametrically opposed directions .
From Bakunin ’s perspective , the most important revolutionary act aimed at the destruction of the institution of the State : “ We think that the necessarily revolutionary policy of the proletariat must have for its immediate and only object the destruction of States .
” 37 The State , by establishing the right of inheritance , creates economic classes and thereby introduces an “ unnatural ” dimension in human relations , a perversity , as it were , that can only be maintained through force which , by means of the military and the police , the State monopolizes .
When the State is abolished and coercion is removed , people can immediately revert back to their “ natural ” condition and recapture their “ natural ” freedom .
No transitional period is required .
The dictatorship of the proletariat , as another State , would only serve to repeat the mistakes of the past .
Operating within his historical , materialist framework and placing economics first , Marx countered this analysis by arguing that the State , far from creating economic classes , was itself created by them , by the clash of opposing class interests .
The ruling class , in order to consolidate its economic privileges , uses the State to create laws which enshrine its monopoly on wealth in a cloak of legal legitimacy , and it establishes a military apparatus that is prepared to implement these laws by brute force .
Consequently , from Marx ’s perspective , classes could persist beyond the destruction of the bourgeois state , although with some difficulty , and the bourgeoisie could survive even after its property has been expropriated .
People who have enjoyed privileges are molded by them , they tend to view their elevated position as “ natural , ” and accordingly seldom relinquish their assets voluntarily .
As history as proven , they will often fight tenaciously to reinstate them .
Hence , according to Marx , if the proletariat is truly determined to succeed , it must be prepared to use decisive force , if the situation demands .
Therefore the working class must establish its own coercive apparatus , i.e. state , so that it can defend its interests and enforce a genuine form of majority rule .
Otherwise it will find itself at the mercy of a counterrevolution .
In criticizing Marx ’s program of the dictatorship of the proletariat , Bakunin raises this challenge : “ If the proletariat is to be the ruling class , one may ask whom will it govern ?
There must be yet another proletariat that will be subjected to this new domination , this new state .
” 38 Here Bakunin ’s reaction stems from his belief that the State itself is the creator of classes so that whoever controls the state is identified with the ruling , capitalist class while those being victimized by it are the equivalent of the proletariat .
But for Marx , as we just saw , the proletarian dictatorship is not aimed at any section of the working class but at the former bourgeoisie , which simply does not disappear overnight .
Bakunin , however , proceeds : “ There are about forty million Germans .
Are all forty million going to be members of the government ?
” 39 And Marx responds : “ Certainly , because the thing starts with the self - government of the commune . ”
40
This last criticism of Bakunin is connected with a fundamental misunderstanding of Marx ’s program .
Operating within an a-historical framework , Bakunin was quick to assume all states are basically the same .
Hence , he concluded that Marx ’s dictatorship of the proletariat was not essentially different from the bourgeois state : “ ... according to Mr. Marx ’s theory the people not only must not destroy it [ the State ] but on the contrary must reinforce it and make it stronger .... ” 41
But this was not Marx ’s intention .
In 1852 , for example , in the Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte , Marx argued :
“ This executive power with its enormous bureaucratic and military organization , with its ingenious state machinery , embracing wide strata , with a host of officials numbering half a million , this appalling parasitic body , which enmeshes the body of French society like a net and chokes all its pores , sprang up in the days of the absolute monarchy , with the decay of the feudal system , which it helped to hasten ....
Finally , in its struggle against the revolution , the parliamentary republic found itself compelled to strengthen , along with the repressive measures , the resources and centralization of governmental power .
All revolutions perfected this machine instead of smashing it . ” 42
Almost twenty years later he reiterated this position : “ ...
If you look at the last chapter of my Eighteenth Brumaire , you will find that I declare : the next French Revolution will no longer attempt to transfer the bureaucratic - military apparatus from one hand to another , but to smash it , and this is the precondition for every real people ’s revolution on the Continent . ”
43
The determination to smash the bourgeois state was a cornerstone of Marx ’s political program .
Its destruction opens the door to the political participation of the entire working class where everyone can have a voice in shaping public policy .
If the bourgeois state were to survive , the proletariat would remain hopelessly paralyzed in a bureaucratic quagmire .
Aside from the need of the dictatorship of the proletariat to guard against the bourgeoisie , Marx envisioned the establishment of a socialist society as an arduous task , requiring a transitional period in which the groundwork could be laid for a radically new society .
Not subscribing to any concept of a natural , pristine condition that could serve as a point of return , Marx conceived of the revolutionary process as one that actually involved the creation of a new human being , one that was capable of acting both socially and rationally .
But such an achievement could not be secured instantaneously ; considerable time and effort was required for it to mature .
“ What we have to deal with here is a communist society , not as it has developed on its own foundations , but , on the contrary , just as it emerges from capitalist society ; which is thus in every respect , economically , morally and intellectually , still stamped with the birth marks of the old society from whose womb it emerges . ”
44
But in order for a moral and intellectual transformation in humans to take place , or , as mentioned above , “ an alteration of man on a mass scale , ” the proper economic conditions must exist because , as Marx persistently argued , humans are molded by their economic environment :
“ He [ Bakunin ] understands nothing whatever about social revolution ; all he knows about it is political phrases ; its economic prerequisites do not exist for him .
Since all the economic forms , developed or undeveloped , that have existed till now included the enslavement of the worker ( whether in the shape of the wage - worker or the peasant , etc. ) he presumes that a radical revolution is equally possible in all of them . ”
45
These economic improvements would include the abolition of the division of labor , especially between mental and manual labor , and the development of the productive forces :
“ And ... this development of productive forces ... is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general , and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced ; and furthermore , because only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established , which ... finally has put world - historical , empirically universal individuals in place of local ones . ” 46
Therefore , the dictatorship of the proletariat was also required since it could not be assumed that relations among people will immediately proceed smoothly .
Time would be needed for humanity to recreate itself along more humanitarian principles .
Then :
“ ... after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labour , and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labour , has vanished ; after labour has become not only a means of life , but life ’s prime want , after the productive forces have also increased with the all - around development of the individual , and all the springs of cooperative wealth flow more abundantly – only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banner : ‘ From each according to his ability , to each according to his needs ! ’” 47
Organisational Differences
Another major point of dispute centers on the form of organization needed to wage a revolution .
Although Bakunin was a member of the International Working Men ’s Association , most of his organizing efforts were concentrated on the creation of secret societies which were governed by a top - down structure .
The following quote gives a sense of the role Bakunin assigned to them and why they appeared to be a sensible alternative for him :
“ This organization rules out any idea of dictatorship and custodial control .
But for the very establishment of the revolutionary alliance and the triumph of revolution over reaction , the unity of revolutionary thought and action must find an agent in the thick of the popular anarchy which will constitute the very life and all the energy of the revolution .
That agent must be the secret universal association of international brothers .
“ This association stems from the conviction that revolutions are never made by individuals or even by secret societies .
They come about of themselves , produced by the force of things , the tide of events and facts ....
All that a well - organized secret society can do is first to assist the birth of the revolution by sowing ideas corresponding to the instincts of the masses , then to organize , not the army of the revolution – the army must always be the people – but a kind of revolutionary general staff made up of devoted , hardworking and intelligent men , and above all of sincere friends of the people , without ambition or vanity , and capable of acting as intermediaries between the revolutionary idea and the popular instinct .
“ Therefore there should be no vast number of these individuals ....
Two or three hundred revolutionaries are enough for the largest country ’s organization . ”
48
There are several important points contained in the above passage .
First , the emphasis is placed on the instincts of the masses for the fuel that will erupt in a revolutionary upheaval .
Second , there is no emphasis on organizing the masses themselves .
Third , the secret societies act somewhat as midwives , assisting in the birth of the revolution but are certainly not considered the main engine of it .
They engage in translating the instincts of the masses into revolutionary concepts .
Fourth , precisely because these societies are in fact secret , they are not elected by the masses , but are self - appointed representatives of the masses .
They themselves determine whether they are genuinely hardworking and intelligent .
Using these principles as his point of departure , Bakunin then criticized Marx for failing to appreciate the crucial role of instinct or temperament :
“ Likewise , Marx completely ignores a most important element in the historic development of humanity , that is , the temperament and particular character of each race and each people , a temperament and a character which are themselves the natural product of a multitude of ethnological , climatological , economic and historic causes ....
Among these elements ... there is one whose action is completely decisive in the particular history of each people ; it is the intensity of the spirit of revolt ....
This instinct is a fact which is completely primordial and animalistic ....
[ I ]t is a matter of temperament rather than intellectual and moral character .... ” 49
And for this reason there is no need to educate the masses .
In order to mount a revolution , Bakunin ’s self - appointed leaders must simply mix with the oppressed so that this instinct to revolt might be ignited .
Then , because instincts are true and just , one can depend on them entirely to push the revolution to a successful conclusion .
Consequently , Bakunin complained that Marx was actually contaminating this natural flow of events in that Marx was “ ruining the workers by making theorists out of them ” .
50
For Marx , the revolutionary process was far more complicated , requiring ongoing education of the proletariat .
For example , it was crucial for him that the proletariat acquire class consciousness because , without this consciousness , it would not come to the realization that the entire capitalist system must be abolished and replaced by a system that operates in the interests of working people , as opposed to a small , extremely wealthy minority .
In other words , without class consciousness , members of the proletariat assume that their miserable condition is a function of their own individual initiative , or lack thereof , or simply bad luck , as opposed to resulting from naked class exploitation .
But class consciousness is not simply gained instinctively since the bourgeoisie , for example , is relentlessly on a campaign to assert ideological hegemony by arguing that capitalism represents the highest achievement in individual freedom , fairness in the distribution of wealth , etc .
For these reasons , Marx was always insistent on the importance of propaganda or education :
“ To assure the success of the revolution one must have ‘ unity of thought and action ’ .
[ Marx is quoting Bakunin . ]
The members of the International are trying to create this unity by propaganda , by discussion and the public organization of the proletariat .
But all Bakunin needs is a secret organization of one hundred people , the privileged representatives of the revolutionary idea , the general staff in the background , self - appointed and commanded by the permanent ‘ Citizen B ’ [ i.e. , Bakunin ] . ”
51
But in order for education to take place , the working class must be organized , and one such venue is the trade union movement :
“ It is in trade unions that workers educate themselves and become socialists , because under their very eyes and every day the struggle with capital is taking place .
”
52
Moreover , for Marx , beyond their trade union experience , workers must be organized on a political level so that they can challenge the bourgeoisie for state power .
A political party is the organ through which the working class develops and expresses its class consciousness .
It is the instrument with which it articulates and promotes its own class interests in opposition to the bourgeoisie :
“ Here , in order to be able to offer energetic opposition to the democratic petty bourgeois , it is above all necessary for the workers to be independently organised and centralised in clubs ...
The speedy organisation of at least a provincial association of the workers ’ clubs is one of the most important points for the strengthening and developing of the workers ’ party ; the immediate consequence of the overthrow of the existing governments will be the election of a national representative assembly .
Here the proletariat must see to it :
“ I. that no groups of workers are barred on any pretext or by any kind of trickery on the part of local authorities or government commissioners .
“ II . that everywhere workers ’ candidates are put up alongside the bourgeois - democratic candidates , that they are as far as possible members of the League , and that their election is promoted by all possible means .
Even where there is no prospect whatever of their being elected , the workers must put up their own candidates in order to preserve their independence , to count their forces and to lay before the public their revolutionary attitude and party standpoint .
In this connection they must not allow themselves to be bribed by such arguments of the democrats as , for example , that by so doing they are splitting the democratic party and giving the reactionaries the possibility of victory . ” 52a
Furthermore , from Marx ’s perspective , these working class organizations must encompass the entire proletariat .
The working class as a whole must become actively engaged so that the discussions and debates truly amount to “ universal intercourse ” .
If only some are engaged in the decision - making process , then the decisions will reflect only these special interests so that the decisions will not be universally valid .
“ Thus things have now come to such a pass , that the individuals must appropriate the existing totality of productive forces , not only to achieve self - activity , but , also , merely to safeguard their very existence ...
In all appropriations up to now , a mass of individuals remained subservient to a single instrument of production ; in the appropriation by the proletarians , a mass of instruments of production must be made subject to each individual , and property to all .
Modern universal intercourse can be controlled by individuals , only when controlled by all .
”
53
Therefore , while Bakunin was intent on organizing secret societies and relying on the instincts of the masses to push the revolution to a successful conclusion , Marx was urging that the workers themselves become organized .
These working class organizations not only serve as vehicles for education , but they have the potential to become powerful weapons aimed at challenging the bourgeoisie for state power .
In the process of this struggle , workers not only deepen their self - consciousness as an oppressed class , but gradually acquire the realization that they are capable of seizing control of society and running it in their own interests .
Political Reforms
Bakunin consistently condemned all efforts on the part of the proletariat to improve its lot by pressing for specific legislation that seemed in its interest .
The State , after all , was an unnatural excrescence , implying that any participation in it would only contaminate the revolutionary movement .
Marx , on the other hand , not only regarded this political engagement as permissible but even , at times , as indispensable , provided that the conquest of state power was not on the immediate agenda , either because the objective conditions were lacking or because the proletariat had not already achieved the appropriate level of class consciousness and organization .
Struggling for reforms involves a certain level of organized , self - determination and hence contributes to the transformation of the working class into active agents .
Also , when these campaigns are successful , they can endow the working class with a sense of its own power , enhance its self - confidence , and consequently lead to even bolder initiatives in a revolutionary direction .
Moreover , the legislation can in turn open up greater opportunities for working class self - activity , for example , by shortening the working day .
Finally , as mentioned earlier , this kind of political engagement is an expression of , and contributes to , the development of class consciousness :
“ On the other hand , however , every movement in which the working class as a class confronts the ruling classes and tries to constrain them by pressure from without is a political movement .
For instance , the attempt by strikes , etc. , in a particular factory or even in a particular trade to compel individual capitalists to reduce the working day , is a purely economic movement .
On the other hand the movement to force through an eight - hour , etc. law is a political movement .
And in this way , out of the separate economic movements of the workers there grows up everywhere a political movement , that is to say , a class movement , with the object of enforcing its interests in a general form , in a form possessing general , socially coercive force . ”
54
For Marx , the development of class consciousness is a slow process that traverses a number of stages .
On the lowest level , a worker who is suffering from the relations of exploitation approaches the employer as an individual , pleading for ameliorated working conditions .
After meeting with failure , workers eventually come to recognize that a more promising avenue lies in collective action , for example , in organizing a union and launching a strike .
Here the individual ’s consciousness rises one level as he or she realizes that co-workers are also suffering and collective action can be far more effective than the pleas of an isolated individual .
But these struggles can in turn lead to action on a more universal plane where one realizes that one ’s plight is not simply the function of a particular workplace but emanates from the capitalist system itself .
Here , individuals recognize that all workers are suffering and that by organizing the entire working class , a powerful agent is created that has the capacity to change such laws as the length of the working day ; and so on .
The political arena offers an important opportunity for the proletariat to embark on this path of growth .
The Revolutionary Agent
Another strategical disagreement dividing Marx and Bakunin centered around the question of who would lead the revolution .
Both agreed that the proletariat would play a key role , but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive , leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the peasants and even the lumpenproletariat ( the unemployed , common criminals , etc. ) could rise to the occasion .
Bakunin argued , for example , that the peasants were a revolutionary class for three reasons : ( 1 ) They have retained “ the simple , robust temperament and the energy germane to the folk nature . ”
( 2 ) They work with their hands and despise privilege .
And ( 3 ) as toilers they have common interests with workers .
55
In other words , being close to nature , the peasants are less alienated from their true , natural essence since they have suffered less corruption by the evils of society .
Bakunin adopted a similar argument in relation to the lumpenproletariat :
“ By flower of the proletariat , I mean precisely that eternal ‘ meat ’ , ... that great rabble of the people ( underdogs , ‘ dregs of society ’ ) ordinarily designated by Marx and Engels in the picturesque and contemptuous phrase lumpenproletariat .
I have in mind the ‘ riffraff ’ , that ‘ rabble ’ almost unpolluted by bourgeois civilization , which carries in its inner being and in its aspirations ... all the seeds of the socialism of the future .... ” 56
In both cases , Bakunin ’s conclusions flow directly from his conviction that inherent in humanity is a natural essence which can be suppressed but never entirely extinguished .
Those in society who are more distant from the State apparatus ( the peasants are scattered throughout the countryside , the lumpenproletariat simply refuses to obey the laws ) are accordingly natural leaders .
In contrast , Marx consistently argued that the proletariat alone was the revolutionary agent : “ Of all classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today , the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class .
The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry ; the proletariat is its special and essential product .
” 57 Here again their different philosophical frameworks led these revolutionaries in opposed directions .
Because Marx believed human nature was shaped by the economy , he analyzed the possible revolutionary agents by analyzing how the economy would influence their development .
And economic considerations led him to conclude that the peasants could not play a leading revolutionary role .
For example , they do not constitute a cohesive class .
Some are large landowners and hire other peasants to work for them while the latter are often landless and destitute .
Moreover , the desire for land by a majority of the peasants could serve as an anchor , holding them back from a truly revolutionary perspective .
Rather than rallying for a thoroughgoing , socialist revolution where private ownership of land is abolished , they often veer in the direction of seeking to augment their own modest , private property land holdings at the expense of the large landowners .
But aside from these economic considerations , Marx also believed that the situation of the peasants , not only prohibited them from attaining class consciousness , but from becoming a truly revolutionary class :
“ The small holding peasants form a vast mass , the members of which live in similar conditions but without entering into manifold relations with one another .
Their mode of production isolates them from one another instead of bringing them into mutual intercourse ....
Their field of production , the small holding , admits of no division of labor in its cultivation , no application of science and , therefore , no diversity of development , no variety of talent , no wealth of social relationships .
Each individual peasant family is almost self - sufficient ; it itself directly produces the major part of its consumption and thus acquires its means of life more through exchange with nature than in intercourse with society .
A small holding , a peasant and his family ; alongside them another small holding , another peasant and another family ....
In so far as millions of families live under economic conditions of existence that separate their mode of life , their interests and their culture from those of other classes , and put them in hostile opposition to the latter , they form a class .
In so far as there is a merely local interconnection among these small - holding peasants , and the identity of their interests begets no community , no national bond and no political organization among them , they do not form a class .
”
58
Marx was even less enthusiastic about the lumpenproletariat because it was not directly related to the production process at all , being comprised of the permanently unemployed , criminals , etc .
Conclusion
We can now see that when Marxists and anarchists refer to such concepts as “ human nature ” and “ freedom ” , they have diametrically opposed definitions in mind and therefore are frequently talking at cross-purposes .
Bakunin ’s notion of spontaneity stands starkly opposed to Marx ’s notion of collective , rational action .
Each author , armed with his own definition , could then logically categorize the other as a tyrant .
One can understand , therefore , why Bakunin labeled Marx an “ authoritarian ” when Marx would not concede to Bakunin ’s impulsive politics .
Marx , on the other hand , viewed Bakunin ’s conceptual framework as mired in an antiquated 18th century Enlightenment philosophy , lacking any historical dimension , theoretically inconsistent , and parading metaphysics as if it were materialism .
As far as Marx was concerned , Hegel could easily have been speaking of Bakunin when he declared :
“ Since the man of common sense makes his appeal to feeling , to an oracle within his breast , he is finished and done with anyone who does not agree ; he only has to explain that he has nothing more to say to anyone who does not find and feel the same in himself .
In other words , he tramples underfoot the roots of humanity .
For it is in the nature of humanity to press onward to agreement with others ; human nature only really exists in an achieved community of minds .
”
59
Neither the early nor the later Marx was a figure of the late Enlightenment , a philosophic school which trumpeted the autonomy of the isolated individual , divorced from a human community .
And Marx had little to say about socialist alternatives , except by suggesting broad parameters , since socialism , in the final analysis , is to be defined and created by the participants themselves , i.e. by “ freely associated men ” engaged in “ universal intercourse ” who in this way achieve “ control and conscious mastery ” of their lives .
I would like to thank Bill Leumer , Paul Colvin and Fred Newhouser for their valuable suggestions in connection with this article .

Microsoft has pulled the plug on its Windows 7 sponsorship of Seth MacFarlane 's forthcoming " Family Guy " special after deciding the edgy comedy did n't " fit with the Windows brand . "
A report by Variety said Microsoft originally hoped to sponsor the " Family Guy Presents : Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show " on Fox to help launch Windows 7 .
Rather than using commercial breaks between the show 's segments of animated and live - action comedy routines , the company planned to work with MacFarlane and comedienne Alex Borstein to inject messages about Windows 7 directly into the program .
Once Microsoft saw the material being developed , it dropped sponsorship of the show .
" Family Guy " has been a bawdy mix of parody and intentionally poor taste for most of the decade .
It was canceled after its third season , only to be resurrected by Fox after DVD sales and reruns found a wide audience .
It has since spawned two other spinoffs on Fox .
How Microsoft could have been surprised by the character of MacFarlane 's style of comedy is difficult to imagine .
Just days before backing out of the special , Microsoft marketing executive Gayle Troberman told Ad Age " You 'll see us deeply integrated into the content .
You 'll hear how Windows 7 can help you simplify your PC : it 's simple , fast and easy to use . "
A promotional spot that did air seemed to indicate that the special would be a mix of the show 's old gags with irrelevant mentions of Windows 7 .
Below , Stewie installs Microsoft 's new new operating system in order to useâ ¦
Twitter .
During production , Variety reported that Microsoft " sent MacFarlane and Fox several notes expressing their concern over the show 's content but ultimately decided just to drop out . "
Fox plans to line up another sponsor for the show and air it as planned .
Outside of the rejected MacFarlane special , Variety reported that Microsoft is still going forward with the rest of its multimillion - dollar deal with Fox One , which " encompasses a wide range of News Corp. properties , including Fox Sports , FX , Hulu , FoxSports.com on MSN , Fox Licensing and Merchandising and 20th Century Fox TV .
Partnership includes a 12 - week college tour sponsored by Fox Licensing and Merchandising — featuring events such as ' Family Guy ' - themed movie nights . "
Past efforts at co-opting cool
Microsoft has struggled in the past with attempts to attach its corporate image to popular culture in order to sell its PC operating system software to users .
In 1986 , a younger Steve Ballmer tried to tie " Miami Vice " into Windows by pasting an image of a Ferarri into Windows Write .
The ad was an internal spoof , but characterized the type of humor the company hoped to use in marketing its products .
A late 80s promotional spot for Windows / 386 that Microsoft actually delivered to retailers featured a white woman dressed like a clownish hooker and rapping away concerns about using Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 files within Windows as a sampled dog barks to the beat .
Windows / 386 was a version of Windows 2.0 targeted at the 386 processor .
At the launch of Windows 95 , the company recruited Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston of what was then the new hit show " Friends " to demonstrate its new operating system .
The company called the resulting advertisement " the first ever cyber sitcom " offering " more than a few laughs " in " an adventure in computing that takes place in the office of Microsoft chairman Bill Gates . "
Along the way " they meet a wacky bunch of propeller heads " while learning about Windows 95 features , and the pace was purported to be " fast and funny . "
Another spot employed a non -stop string of stereotypes , puns , and cliches to explain why users should drop DOS and their old keyboard for Windows 95 and Microsoft 's new ergonomic keyboard .
Just after Microsoft launched Windows XP , Bill Gates appeared in character on the comedy " Frasier , " where he took over Frasier Crane 's radio show to answer users ' questions pertaining to the newly available software the company was selling .
Gates explained to users in 2001 that they " do n't need to make a boot disk " using DOS and a floppy , but could now upgrade Windows by just inserting their CD and running the installer .
" It 's a feature of XP , very quick , very smooth , " Gates announced .
Another caller says , " Wow , Bill Gates this is so cool ! " and then asks , " I have a question about multilingual user interface ads ons .
What are those ? "
In an attempt to turn around the Vista launch , Bill Gates pitted himself opposite comedian Jerry Seinfeld in a series of ads that attempted to associate Gates and Microsoft with the quirky oddball humor of Seinfeld 's long running show , which by that point had been off the air for a decade .
While the first couple ads aired , the series was pulled before the spots ever developed upon their theme and the last episode to be filmed was n't even broadcast .
East Belfast solicitor Philip Krown , formerly known as William Philip Crossey , outside Laganside Courts after being given a suspended jail sentence
A crooked solicitor who stole almost £ 500,000 in mortgage fraud and used the money to go on a “ hedonistic adventure ” has walked free from court after he was given a suspended four - year jail term .
Belfast Crown Court heard that over a two - year period 53 - year - old Philip Krown , also known as William Philip Crossey , opened a Swiss bank account and then used the money to rent a swish apartment in fashionable Rutland Gate in London , travelled extensively to his wife 's home country of Colombia and to Europe , had an expense account at the Ritz Hotel and splashed out on expensive jewellery .
All the money , the court heard , had come from Krown remortgaging his Groomsport Home for £ 445,000 and simply taking the cash , rather than using it to pay off the existing loan .
Arrested at Gatwick Airport in March last year as he and his wife were about to board a flight to Barcelona , Krown later pleaded guilty to one count of theft in that he stole credit in the Philip Crossey Solicitors Client 's account in the sum of £ 445,520 , and also to removing £ 390,498.52 of criminal property from Northern Ireland .
Before he changed his name to Krown , he had been known as Crossey and throughout the 1980s and 1990s , had built up a successful firm on the Cregagh Road in east Belfast , and had served on the Council of the Law Society of Northern Ireland .
Outlining how he was diagnosed with diabetes and was forced to have his left leg amputated because of it , Judge Geoffrey Miller QC revealed that his right leg is also in danger and that his life expectancy could well be reduced .
He said Krown's “ descent into the mire of his present circumstances has something of the Greek Tragedy about it ” .
The judge added , however , that he “ cannot lose sight ” of the fact that he had committed a deliberate fraud knowing full well that he could not repay the money , had planned a “ sophisticated scheme ” to get the money out of the country “ by subterfuge ... and thirdly that you then engaged on what may be regarded as a hedonistic adventure of high living for nearly two years ” before he was eventually arrested .
Yesterday Judge Miller said Krown and his Colombian wife , Dr Claudia Ortiz , were stopped last year by police at Gatwick as they were planning to board a flight to Barcelona .
He said that during the investigations it emerged that Krown and his wife had been living in Rutland Gate since October 2006 and had travelled extensively together .
He said that during 18 interviews with the PSNI Krown “ was unable to give a clear account of how precisely the monies were used , but it is quite apparent that he and his second wife lived ‘ well ' in a fashionable part of London and accounts for stays at the Ritz Hotel , together with regular travel to Europe and South America and purchase of expensive jewellery , all point to the dissipation of the monies ” .
Since the revelation of the fraud , said the judge , the authorities have only been able to recover $ 50,000 , which was left in the Swiss bank account .
In mitigation Judge Miller said the offences were set against a backdrop of Krown 's mental and physical deterioration since he was diagnosed with diabetes in 1999 , culminating in the amputation of his left leg in June 2005 , leading to depression , paranoia and a personality change .
He added that throughout defence submissions “ no clear picture emerged ” as to what purpose Krown had for the money “ other than to use it for his own benefit without any intention to either redeem the original HSBC mortgage or to repay the loan to Future Mortgages ” .
Judge Miller told Krown he believed the background to the case amounted to “ special mitigating circumstances ” and therefore “ persuade me ” to suspend the jail term for three years .
Outrage at ‘ incredible ’ court ruling
The failure to jail prominent solicitor Philip Krown for his elaborate swindle sends out the wrong message over white collar crime , local representatives have claimed .
DUP MLA Jimmy Spratt , whose East Belfast constituency includes the Cregagh Road where Krown was based , expressed outrage at the sentence imposed by the courts .
The former Police Federation chairman said judges were sending out the wrong messages and were doing little to deter criminals .
“ It is appalling that somebody like that walks away from court .
Given the enormity of the figure of money stolen , it is absolutely incredible that such a person is effectively allowed to get away with it .
“ Jail is the right place for someone like that .
I believe this case is one that the Attorney General needs to look at .
“ If it had been anyone else they could have almost banked on not being treated in such a lenient manner .
Jail is the right place for someone like that .
“ It does n’t bode well for people to have confidence in the legal system .
Everybody should be dealt with the same .
Severe sentences are what we need in cases like this , ” he said .
Meanwhile , North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds , a qualified barrister , added : “ There are a lot of people out there who will feel that , given the level of theft and stolen money involved , that he has got away very lightly .
They will compare the sentence passed on him as a solicitor to sentences passed on others who have served custodial sentences for lesser sums .
There was deliberate planning and full knowledge .
He knew precisely what he was doing . ”
SDLP MLA and Belfast city councillor Alban Maginness , who is also a qualified barrister , said he believed the court had taken the case seriously .
“ The imposition of any prison sentence , whether it is suspended or not , is the hallmark of the seriousness that the court takes of the case .
“ The fact that it was suspended simply reflects the mitigating circumstances such as family circumstances , plea and whether there was any compensation .
“ Just because the sentence was suspended does n’t mean that the court did n’t take it seriously .
“ Of course , if there is any re-offending , that jail sentence would be put into effect . ”
The PSNI has declined to comment on the judgment passed by the court .
Philip Krown , also known as William Philip Crossey , has not practised law since 2006 and his crime could mean the end of his career .
A spokesman for the Law Society said : “ The Law Society has referred William Philip Crossey to the Independent Disciplinary Tribunal which is empowered under statute to take disciplinary action , including striking off the roll of solicitors if necessary . ”
How crooked lawyer got his hands on the money
An earlier court hearing was told that in July 2005 Krown successfully applied to Future Mortgages for a £ 445,000 mortgage on his home on Coastguard Lane , Orlock , Groomsport , the property still being subject to a £ 395,000 mortgage from HSBC Bank Plc .
The mortgage fund was drawn into the client account of Philip Crossey Solicitor with the usual undertakings that it would be used to pay off the existing debt .
Prosecuting lawyer David McAughey told the court that on January 11 , 2006 Krown took a cheque for £ 390,000 , purportedly to pay the loan off , but that cheque has never been presented .
However , on the same day a draft for £ 375,000 was paid out of the client account to a Scottish solicitor and estate agent firm A S Ireland , who were acting for Krown in the purchase of a portfolio of properties .
The sale of his firm of solicitors took place two days later with the company now being known as Keown Crossey Solicitors , but the old client account remained active to deal with cases still ongoing .
Mr McAughey said in February 2006 Krown wrote to A S Ireland telling them he no longer wished to continue with the purchase and asked that the money be returned by means of a cheque to Kraner Developments .
The firm , said the lawyer , agreed to send the money back but only to its original source , the Philip Crossey Client account .
During the course of February Krown himself lodged £ 125,000 into the client account but asked the book - keeper of Keown Crossey to write out two cheques payable to Kraner Developments amounting to a total of £ 500,000 .
Mr McAughey said when these two cheques were returned cashed , it transpired that Krown had written on the back of each that they were to be paid to a David Vogt , a lawyer in Liechtenstein .
The fraud was not discovered until March 2006 by which time Krown and his wife had disappeared , not to be seen again for two years .

Always the political instrument of moneyed elites , and a retrograde societal force , the GOP today is more negatively impactful than ever .
Its agenda , if fully implemented , would prove catastrophic .
Here 's what an unfettered Republican Party would do " for " America :
1 ) Greatly reduce or entirely eliminate taxes on the rich , thereby forcing hard - pressed working families to painfully make up resulting revenue shortfalls .
2 ) Bust labor unions , cruelly preventing the collective bargaining that 's the key reason why US workers ever won decent wages and benefits .
3 ) Stubbornly deny the existence of ominous climate change while blithely pumping more pollutants into the environment from lucrative , dirty industries and practices .
Although reputable scientists say 350 carbon parts per atmospheric million is the safe limit for sustained life on Earth , Republicans dismiss the frightening fact that we 're already at a carbon level of roughly 390 ppm .
4) Remove " restrictive " regulations on everything from investment banks and credit card companies to a broad array of " profit - eroding " consumer protections , leaving the American masses exposed to a host of resulting abuses and dangers .
5 ) Continue to criticize and insufficiently fund public education , advocating private schooling instead , thus entirely ignoring that progressive public systems are used in every country that has education outcomes superior to our own .
6 ) Outlaw abortion , under a fraudulently moral guise , compelling the US to bloodily join those benighted , backward nations where thousands of already - born , living , breathing , socially functioning females perish because of sexist denials of their basic reproductive rights .
7 ) Continue to recite a Pledge of Allegiance whose last six words are " with liberty and justice for all , " while remaining numbly oblivious to the harsh hypocrisy of preventing our homosexual citizens from marrying .
8 ) Speak often and loftily of freedom , but engage in secret wiretapping , repression of domestic dissent , neo -McCarthyite witch hunts , Red-baiting name calling , and a panoply of Patriot Act transgressions against the Constitution of the United States ... all under the misused rubric of " national security . "
9 ) Show the rest of humankind nothing but bullying world - cop arrogance through endless US interventions and aggressions on foreign soil , resulting not just in countless lives extinguished in indefensible wars , and billions of badly - needed dollars flushed down the drain , but constant al Qaeda recruitment against hated Yankee interlopers .
10 ) Generally drive down the income levels of America 's working - class majority , as a purported cost - saving corporate measure , without appreciating that a populace that 's too poor to buy back what society produces is doomed to economic ruin .
A living wage is the ultimate " stimulus , " but try to find even one Republican who favors it !
11 ) Continue to lie about the alternative , affordable health care for all that some fifty world nations ' people overwhelmingly support , thereby propagandistically leading Americans to think that having private insurance whose premiums are rising at rates three times higher than our pay -- and which routinely denies coverage when it 's required most -- is somehow preferable
12 ) Unleash de facto ethnic cleansing against 12 million immigrant men , women , and children , making them contemporary equivalents of the Jewish scapegoats that Hitler blamed for hardships Germans experienced during a prior period of capitalist economic distress .
13 ) Shamefully try to lend credence to their avarice and social irresponsibility by revising the Bible to obscure passages that place human need before abject greed , attempting to turn it into a facilitating guide for modern peers of the temple moneychangers whose tables Jesus angrily knocked to the floor ( and who undoubtedly would n't be mentioned in the amended version that one conservative group is actually , amazingly trying to put into circulation ) .
14 ) Give full vent to the intensely bigoted hatred that has crazed extremists dreaming of literally tearing Barack Obama to pieces and gassing all liberals ... if only they could .
15 ) Place the livelihoods and lives of over 300 million Americans in the hands of incompetent ideological " purists " such as Sarah Palin .
While there are certainly Democrats who 've yet to show spine in furtherance of vital change , let 's be absolutely clear about the unmitigated disaster that would follow if Republicans , in their present ultra- rightist incarnation , ruled our country exactly as they wickedly wished .

About author Dennis Rahkonen , from Superior , Wisconsin , has been writing progressive commentary with a Heartland perspective for various outlets since the Sixties .
“ These numbers are a wake - up call for the country , ” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack .
One figure that drew officials ’ attention was the number of households , 506,000 , in which children faced “ very low food security ” : up from 323,000 the previous year .
President Obama , who has pledged to end childhood hunger by 2015 , released a statement while traveling in Asia that called the finding “ particularly troubling . ”
The ungainly phrase “ food insecurity ” stems from years of political and academic wrangling over how to measure adequate access to food .
In the 1980s , when officials of the Reagan administration denied there was hunger in the United States , the Food Research and Action Center , a Washington advocacy group , began a survey that concluded otherwise .
Over time , Congress had the Agriculture Department oversee a similar survey , which the Census Bureau administers .
Though researchers at the Agriculture Department do not use the word “ hunger , ” Mr. Obama did .
“ Hunger rose significantly last year , ” he said .
Analysts said the main reason for the growth was the rise in the unemployment rate , to 7.2 percent at the end of 2008 from 4.9 percent a year earlier .
And since it now stands at 10.2 percent , the survey might in fact understate the number of Americans struggling to get adequate food .
Rising food prices , too , might have played a role .
The food stamp rolls have expanded to record levels , with 36 million Americans now collecting aid , an increase of nearly 40 percent from two years ago .
And the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , passed last winter , raised the average monthly food stamp benefit per person by about 17 percent , to $ 133 .
Many states have made it easier for those eligible to apply , but rising applications and staffing cuts have also brought long delays .
Tyra Banks is strutting away from her daytime talk show .
The supermodel - turned - TV - tycoon will end her talk show after this season .
“ The Tyra Banks Show , ” which has won two Daytime Emmys and is currently in its fifth season , will wrap in the spring .
Banks will shift her concentration to Bankable Studios , a New York - based film production company .
“ As many of you know , several years ago I made the decision to leave modeling -- at the height of my modeling career -- and although it was the most terrifying move , it was the BEST decision and led to me fulfilling some big lifelong dreams , ” Banks said in a statement to fans on her website .
“ Now , I 'm a bit nervous and excited for my next HUGE steps which will allow me to reach MORE women and young girls to help us all feel as fierce as we truly are !
The announcement of her exit from daytime TV , first reported on People.com , comes on the heels -- no pun intended -- of the announcement by her longtime mentor , Oprah Winfrey , that she ’ll leave her daytime post in 2011 to focus on OWN , the Oprah Winfrey Network .
[ Updated at 1:51 p.m. : Most devastated by the announcement are probably the folks over at " The Soup . "
Clips from " The Tyra Banks Show " are a prominent feature on the weekly E! series , which pokes fun at the goings - on in pop culture .
“ We ’ll find a way to fill the hole , " said K.P. Anderson , executive producer and head writer for " The Soup . "
" We lost [ Tony ] Danza and we moved on .
Maybe she felt all the people watching daytime TV were as fierce as they could be and it was time to move on .
We ’ll miss the times when she really , really , really , firmly believed she had something to relate to the rest of the world .
That show is a great clip source … and it absolutely helped contribute to our success . “
He added that “ some form of tribute ” on “ The Soup ” would only make sense when the show wraps production .
But the pop culture recap source wo n't be totally Tyra - free .
There 's still that " other " Tyra show .
]
Banks will continue her venture in reality TV as “ America ’s Next Top Model ” enters its 14th season .

“ I must admit , it was n’t on my radar , ” said Darryl Moore , a city councilman in Berkeley , where a ban passed unanimously on Tuesday .
“ But , besides being disgusted by the procedure , which is cruel , there is the fact that , given all the problems in California and the state taking money and property taxes from us , it seemed obscene and ridiculous to me that they would tell us how to regulate this . ”

Culver City , Burbank and other cities are working on similar ordinances .
Several counties , including Humboldt , Marin and Sonoma , have also expressed interest in banning the practice , said Dr. Jennifer Conrad , a veterinarian and director of The Paw Project , an organization that opposes the declawing of cats big and small .
Until Oct. 27 , West Hollywood was the only city in the country with such a ban , Dr. Conrad said .
The California Veterinary Medical Association pushed to prevent local regulation of declawing after taking West Hollywood to court to reverse its ban and losing .
In letters to the San Francisco and Santa Monica City Councils , the group ’s president , Mark Nunez , said , “ The decision to declaw a cat should remain between the owner in consultation with his , or her , veterinarian on a case - by - case basis . ”
John Duran , a West Hollywood city councilman , drafted that city ’s ban in 2003 .
Mr. Duran said his remorse over having had his own cat declawed inspired him .
Years ago , in an effort to save his couch from an exuberant shredding by his Persian , Alexis Carrington , named after a character on the television show “ Dynasty , ” Mr. Duran asked his veterinarian to remove her claws .
“ But I did n’t realize what I ’d done until I saw the pain Alexis went through , ” he said .
“ I thought that declawing was glorified nail clipping , ” when in fact , “ part or all of a cat ’s first paw joints ” are severed to prevent regrowth .

For 30 years , the Republican Party dominated American political life , winning five of the seven presidential elections before 2008 .
But the GOP has taken its lumps of late , culminating in its loss of Congress in 2006 and the White House last November .
As the party suffers not just from a leadership vacuum but from considerable internal division , its future direction is unclear .
This much , however , is certain : as America struggles to emerge from a financial crisis , any renewal of the Right will require the Republicans to rethink their approach to the economy .
An agenda focused chiefly on tax cuts , as the Republicans ’ has been since Ronald Reagan ’s presidency , is no longer enough .
In 1980 , Reagan won the election by attracting a substantial portion of Democrats with three simple ideas .
First was the fight against the Soviet Union .
Second , the battle against the excesses of the state : “ Government is the problem , not the solution , ” Reagan famously said .
Third , and most relevant to this discussion , was an overarching faith in economic growth .
Growth improves everyone ’s well - being , lifting the underprivileged from poverty and eliminating the need for costly fiscal redistribution .
With growth as the objective , a deep cut in tax rates for higher - income people was not only justifiable but necessary , because it would increase the incentive to work and thus foster productive activity .
Lower taxes became a winning political weapon for the Republican Party — all the more so , perhaps , because the cuts were n’t accompanied by painful reductions in public spending .
Fiscal deficits , traditionally unacceptable to conservatives , had even become welcome to the Right , which regarded them as a way to “ starve the beast . ”
By burdening the state with debts , the thinking went , we could reduce its ability to expand and thus the danger that it could suffocate the economy .
In 1980 , when the highest marginal income - tax rate stood at 70 percent , this economic platform was extremely attractive , as were Reagan ’s other key ideas .
The country had just seen a decade of low growth and high inflation , defeat in Vietnam , the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , and the humiliation of the American hostages in Tehran .
It was ready for change .
An entire generation adhered to the Republican Party , forming a majority so solid that it permitted George W. Bush to be elected president 20 years later .
The success of the Republican platform went well beyond the voting booth , of course .
The war against the evil empire brought the collapse of Communism and the democratization of the Soviet Bloc countries .
During the Reagan years , the battle against the state led to a negative real growth rate in nondefense public spending .
Deregulation freed the economy from excessive constraints and , together with tax cuts , sparked enormous entrepreneurial and creative forces .
A golden era of economic growth began in the early eighties and continued , aside from a few minor recessionary interludes , until 2007 — a quarter - century of unparalleled prosperity .
After the Reagan economic reforms kicked in , the United States grew by an average of 3 percent each year , against Germany ’s 1.9 percent , France ’s 2.1 , and Italy ’s 1.8 .
Not only did this revolution allow the U.S. to outpace Europe in income and productivity ; it also transformed the country from a manufacturing economy into an innovative , high - powered service economy .
Today , America does not produce iPhones , but it generates the technology and the design that permit a piece of plastic to sell for $ 300 .
It does not manufacture microchips , but it creates the technology that lets some wafers of silicon sell for thousands of dollars apiece .
It does not build computers , but it develops the operating systems that run them .
This transformation has enabled the United States to face the competition of emerging countries from a position of strength .
Yet today the Republican brand , so successful for over two decades , has lost some of its luster .
In part , it ’s simply the curse of success .
The war against the evil empire has been won .
Taxes were substantially reduced .
The battle for deregulation has achieved many of its main objectives .
Deregulation was a cry of freedom that most Americans supported back when Chicago banks could n’t open branches in southern Illinois — let alone in other states ; when a truck had to obtain a permit to transport merchandise across state borders ; and when a government agency decided the prices of commercial flights .
But now that these restrictions are only a distant memory , the public may see further deregulation as unnecessary , or even as a cover for the financial lobby , rather than as a symbol of freedom .
In part , too , Reagan ’s platform lost its appeal because the Republican Party frequently betrayed it .
How can Republicans effectively campaign against big government when the size of government increased by 33 percent during President George W. Bush ’s first term , the largest increase in federal spending since Lyndon B. Johnson ?
How can Republicans portray themselves as free - market paladins when Bush ’s last secretary of the Treasury , Henry Paulson , orchestrated the most massive state intervention in a Western economy since François Mitterrand ’s nationalization of the French banking system ?
The party has much to do before it regains credibility on this score .
The Republican approach has also lost traction because the situation of Americans changed .
By juxtaposing his faith in the American dream to Jimmy Carter ’s portrayal of American malaise , Reagan captured the hearts of traditionally Democratic blue - collar workers who believed that with hard work , every generation would enjoy greater prosperity than the previous one .
But this dream has materialized only in part .
Though American GDP has doubled in real terms over the last 25 years , median real income has grown by only 17 percent .
While the richest 1 percent of the population has almost tripled its real income and the richest 0.01 percent has more than quintupled it , the bottom 10 percent has increased its income by only 12 percent .
While in 1980 , an average high school graduate earned 26 percent less than a college graduate , in 2005 this gap had grown to 38 percent .
The blue - collar “ Reagan Democrats ” are among those struggling the most .
America ’s transition to a service - based economy is one reason for its growing income inequality .
A country specializing in manufacturing needs many high - quality ( and well - paid ) workers .
By contrast , a service economy can succeed with a relatively small number of geniuses who design devices like the iPhone and earn millions , while less educated workers have fewer opportunities to make a good living .
Ironically , the relatively slow increase in American workers ’ wages also results , in part , from the success of the American economic model throughout the world .
In the first three quarters of the twentieth century , companies operating in the United States enjoyed unique advantages : a well - educated workforce that shared pro-market values and a government sensitive to the will of the people .
Much of the rest of the world was run by dictators , torn by ideological conflicts , and populated by illiterate or semiliterate people .
American companies dominated easily , and American workers shared in the prosperity that came from their privileged position .
Over the last 30 years , however , these values have spread around the world .
Communist countries and autocracies have become democracies .
Generalized education has become the rule .
And much of the world has embraced basic market principles .
America has succeeded in nation - building after all — not by force , but through example .
The only unfortunate consequence of this otherwise happy story , which has brought greater prosperity across the globe , is that the comparative advantage of U.S. - based production has declined , and this has put downward pressure on American workers ’ wage growth .
Many Americans could not help but feel disgruntled at such developments .
Until recently , though , they could console themselves with the robust capital gains on their home - equity and retirement accounts .
Unfortunately , the financial crisis has destroyed this comfort , too , creating significant discontent .
In a survey taken in December 2008 , 60 percent of Americans declared themselves “ angry ” or “ very angry ” about the economic situation .
This anger is affecting political decision making .
In September 2008 , when Congress voted against the first version of the Paulson plan , it did so in response to the anger pervading the country .
This past March , the House of Representatives approved a 90 percent tax on AIG bonuses for the same reason .
And when President Obama contradicted his advisors and condemned the bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch executives , he , too , was responding to widespread anger .
The question is not whether this populist pressure will have a strong influence on policy decisions , but how :
Will it work to destroy , or to improve , the market system that has brought so much well - being ?
If Republicans ignore popular anger , as the party establishment did last autumn , they leave a powerful and potentially disruptive force in the hands of Democrats .
The majority of the Democratic establishment does not believe in the American dream , in the importance of providing incentives for economic growth , or in the market as the best mechanism to allocate available resources .
The Democrats could channel popular anger into protectionism , 90 percent tax rates , and onerous new market constraints .
In Republican hands , though , populism could become a strong force for positive change .
At the beginning of the twentieth century , facing similar conditions of rising income inequality and popular anger , President Theodore Roosevelt , a Republican , approved a series of fundamental reforms that turned the United States into a modern country .
From creating the Food and Drug Administration to trust - busting , Roosevelt used public anger to counterbalance the power of large companies ( and monopolies ) and create a more efficient and popular form of market capitalism .
The Republican Party today must follow a similar strategy , updated for present circumstances .
It has to move from a pro-business strategy that defends the interests of existing companies to a pro-market strategy that fosters open competition and freedom of entry .
While the two agendas sometimes coincide — as in the case of protecting property rights — they are often at odds .
Established firms are threatened by competition and frequently use their political muscle to restrict new entries into their industry , strengthening their positions but putting their customers at a disadvantage .
A pro-market strategy aims to encourage the best conditions for doing business , for everyone .
Large banks , for instance , benefit from trading derivatives ( such as credit default swaps ) over the counter , rather than in an organized exchange : they can charge wider spreads that way , and they can afford to post less collateral by using their credit ratings .
For this reason , they oppose moving such trades to organized exchanges , where transactions would be conducted with greater transparency , liquidity , and collateralization — and so with greater financial stability .
This is where a pro-market party needs the courage to take on the financial industry on behalf of everyone else .
A pro-market strategy rejects subsidies not only because they ’re a waste of taxpayers ’ money but also because they prop up inefficient firms , delaying the entry of new and more efficient competitors .
For every “ zombie ” firm that survives because of government assistance , several innovative start - ups do n’t get the chance to be born .
Subsidies , then , hurt taxpayers twice .
A genuinely pro-market party would have resisted more vigorously the Wall Street bailouts , in line with popular sentiment .
And a pro-market approach holds companies financially accountable for their mistakes — an essential policy if free markets are to produce sound decisions .
A pro-market party will fight tirelessly against letting firms become so big that they cannot be allowed to fail , since such firms may take risks that ordinary companies would never dream of ( see “ ‘ Too Big to Fail ’ Must Die , ” Summer 2009 ) .
Being pro-market does not mean being heartless .
For markets to work properly , inefficient firms must be allowed to fail , but their workers do n’t have to suffer unduly .
In fact , it ’s a market imperative that they do n’t : the harsher their pain , the more politically feasible it becomes to subvert the market system to alleviate that pain .
In Italy , for example , where unemployment insurance does not exist , governments frequently bail out large firms , fearing televised images of massive protests and the political cost of thousands of families without financial support .
( The mechanism is so automatic , in fact , that some firms hire more people once they get into trouble . )
Thus a wise pro-market party understands that any strategy is only as good as it is politically sustainable .
Markets enjoy political support primarily because of the well - founded belief that they do a better job of providing goods and services than any other arrangement .
This conviction often weakens during major crises like the current one .
So a pro-market party should favor a robust safety net — for people , that is , not companies .
Of course , this safety net should be run on market principles as much as possible .
For example , unemployment insurance should retain incentives to look for work , and the health - insurance industry should be opened up to competition .
But defenders of markets cannot ignore the importance of providing such security for citizens .
They also cannot ignore the nation ’s growing income inequality , and the loss of confidence , among a substantial part of the population , that the future will be better than the past .
Revolting against the devastating effects of technological change , early - nineteenth - century British workers destroyed mechanized looms .
Modern Luddites do n’t need to resort to violence : they can resist progress by supporting protectionism and regulation .
And they will do so , unless they ’re given a stake in the brighter future of technological progress — retraining for new jobs , sending their children to better schools , and so on .
The knee - jerk Democratic reaction is to give these poorer citizens entitlements disguised as rights : the right to a job , the right to health care , the right to appropriate a fraction of someone else ’s income .
The Republican response should focus on providing opportunities .
Parents should have access to good schools for their kids , regardless of their financial means or where they live .
The best way to deliver on that promise is through a voucher system .
Students should have better access to loans to finance their education because everyone gains from a better - educated workforce .
The unemployed should have access to retraining , which can also be designed through a voucher system .
Health care should be available in the marketplace ; the current system , in which only employers get a tax deduction for health insurance , reduces labor mobility and increases the cost of becoming unemployed .
In the end , it ’s not only the Republican Party that would benefit from these policies : it ’s America and the world .
The United States has been the inspiration for all who believe in freedom , both political and economic .
Its identity , however , is predicated upon maintaining a political consensus that supports market values .
Growing income inequality , the financial crisis , and the perceived unfairness of the market system are undermining this consensus .
Today , the Republican Party is the best candidate to carry the pro-market flag .
Being in the opposition , it is less subject to the lobbying efforts of big business , which always sides with whoever is in power .
The party ’s current leadership vacuum and intellectual disorientation create the perfect conditions for renewal and the emergence of a new agenda .
And the nation ’s social tension creates a sense of urgency .
Above all , the Republican Party has a moral obligation to support markets .
The United States and the world are threatened by protectionism , state intervention , and dirigisme .
If Republicans do n’t stand up for markets , who will ?

I have no doubt that our propensity toward religion is part of our evolutionary makeup .
On the other hand , so are our taste for sugar and fat , our warmaking inclination and our ability to question received knowledge , just to mention a few .
We are made up of conflicting and contradictory parts that constantly fight one another and do n’t always fit the circumstances of our current environment .
None of them constitute some kind of final pronouncement on the nature of man ( or the divine ) , and are no cause for worry to either believers or atheists .
Rather , we should welcome as much knowledge about our makeup as we can get in order to be better informed about how to face our own impulses and those of others .

“ The Evolution of the God Gene ” points to archeological findings suggesting that religions are a useful product of genetic evolution , having conferred hereditary advantage to societies that possessed them .
Atheists , the article suggests , may not find this welcome news .
As an atheist , I would first say that the premise that religions evolved ( like everything else ) is not news at all , and atheists will heartily agree .
The bad news here is for the believers , who , to my mind , must conclude that gods are , at best , useful fictions , and do n’t exist in reality .

The US Senate has narrowly voted to hold a full debate on a landmark bill designed to overhaul the country 's healthcare .
All 58 Democrats , plus two independent senators , approved it .
All but one of 40 Republican senators voted against .
Two Democratic senators whose support had been in doubt earlier said they would back the package , a key election pledge of President Barack Obama .
The White House said Mr Obama was " gratified " by the result .
A full Senate debate on healthcare reform will now begin on 30 November .
We 're going to do anything and everything we can to prevent this measure from becoming law
Mitch McConnell
Republican Senate leader
Q&A : US healthcare reform US healthcare : Who wants what ?
The House of Representatives narrowly passed its own version of the reforms earlier this month .
The legislation - designed to secure coverage for millions of uninsured Americans - could lead to the biggest changes in US healthcare in decades , if approved .
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says his $ 849bn ( £ 508 bn ) bill would extend coverage to another 31 million people , or 94 % of eligible citizens .
The legislation , which was outlined in a 2,074 - page document , is said by Democratic aides to reduce deficits by $ 127bn ( £ 76 bn ) over a decade and by as much as $ 650 bn ( £ 389 bn ) in the 10 years after that .
' Historic ' But Republicans say it will be too expensive , and have vowed to block it .
Fewer than 60 votes for the initial measure would have left the bill vulnerable to Republican delaying tactics .
NEXT STEPS 30 Nov - Senators return from Thanksgiving recess to debate and propose amendments to the bill
At least three weeks later - Senators vote on final bill
If passed , conference committee set up to reconcile Senate and House bills Both chambers vote on final version
If passed , President Obama signs bill into law
Q&A : US healthcare reform
The US health system ' headache ' US healthcare :
Who wants what ?
A White House spokesman said President Obama was " gratified that the Senate has acted to begin consideration of health insurance reform legislation " .
" Tonight 's historic vote brings us one step closer to ending insurance company abuses , reining in spiralling health care costs , providing stability and security to those with health insurance , and extending quality health coverage to those who lack it , " said Robert Gibbs .
Speaking after the vote , Mr Reid said he was looking forward to the coming debate and to " finally bringing quality health care to the American people " .
But Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said he would continue to oppose the motion .
" The American people are asking us to stop this bill and we 're going to do anything and everything we can to prevent this measure from becoming law , " he said .
Efforts to get the vote passed had focused on three centrist Democrats - Ben Nelson of Nebraska , Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana - who expressed doubts about the bill .
Sen Nelson said on Friday he would back the procedural vote , but Senators Lincoln and Landrieu declared themselves available only hours before it was due to take place .
' Deep reservations '
After confirming her support , Sen Lincoln said that it was important to start debating the issue and that Saturday 's vote would " mark the beginning of consideration of this bill by the US Senate , not the end " .
Senator Landrieu said there were " enough significant reforms and safeguards in this bill to move forward , but much more work needs to be done " .
All three Democrats continue to have deep reservations about the bill .
The bill will face stiff opposition inside and outside Congress Under the Senate bill , most Americans would have to have health insurance , while private insurers would be banned from refusing to provide insurance because applicants had pre-existing medical conditions .
Insurance would be made more affordable with subsidies available to help those in lower income bands , the Democrats say .
People would also be able to take part in new insurance market places and be able to choose to buy government - sold insurance from 2014 , a provision intended to help regulate the prices charged by private companies .
Large companies would be required by law to provide coverage to staff .
The costs would be covered by government cuts on future Medicare spending .
If the Senate eventually passes its bill , it must then be reconciled with the House of Representatives bill and voted on again before the programme can become law .
Mr Reid 's bill differs to the House bill in that he calls for an increase of a half percentage point in Medicare payroll tax for people with an income of over $ 200,000 ( £ 119,779 ) per annum - rising to $ 250,000 ( £ 149,724 ) for couples .
There is also a tax on high - value insurance policies that is not contained in the House version of the bill .

Every Day , In Every Way , I Am Getting Better And Better : The Classic Affirmation by Émile Coué
37 SHARES Share Tweet
If you ’ve ever read any books on self improvement , you ’ve probably heard of the concept of “ affirmations . ”
Affirmations are positive thoughts that individuals repeat to themselves to help plant that thought inside their minds .
Émile Coué , a French psychologist and pharmacist in the late 19th century , was one of the first individuals to make use of affirmations as a popular form of psychotherapy and self - improvement .
He called it “ optimistic autosuggestion . ”
His most famous method – the Coué Method – involved saying the positive affirmation , “ Every day , in every way , I am getting better and better ” at the beginning and end of each day .
It was meant to be repeated in a clear and focused state of mind .
Coué believed that through the use of affirmations and imagination an individual could motivate their self to better living habits and health .
Émile Coué first noticed that he could improve the effectiveness of a drug by praising its effectiveness to his patients before prescribing it to them .
This discovery eventually became known as the placebo effect .
These kinds of findings turned Coué ’s interests towards hypnosis and digging deeper into the nature of suggestion .
Coué observed that the main obstacle to hypnosis and autosuggestion was willpower ; in order for the suggestions to be most effective , the individual had to reserve judgment and accept the suggestion based on an element of faith .
If you practice this stuff being ultra-skeptical , then you ’ll block your mind from taking in the suggestion and it wo n’t work .
This could explain why hypnosis can be so hard to study reliably using the scientific method .
Because each individual has their own degrees of suggestibility , and trust and open - mindedness is so crucial to the effectiveness of the treatment .
This makes it difficult to establish a good “ control group ” – because different people are often suggestible to different types of suggestions .
The power of suggestion has proven to play a huge yet perplexing and largely unexplained role in human psychology .
According to a recent study reported by Wired Magazine , placebo drugs have actually been getting more effective over time .
Perhaps this is due to society ’s growing acceptance of pills as a convenient “ cure - all ” for all of our problems ?
Either way , the power of suggestion proves to have a real effect on the human mind .
It seems only natural that with all of this evidence on the power of suggestion that scientists should begin to seek what factors play a role in making a particular suggestion powerful .
Hypnosis should not just be seen as a tool that only works on “ highly suggestible ” persons , but also a tool that can be learned and applied by everyone .
Émile Coué himself claimed that he was not a healer , but one who taught others how to heal themselves .
In this sense , many hypnotists often say that “ The only form of hypnosis is self - hypnosis . ”
This is an old book cover of Émile Coué ’s classic 1920 ’s book Self - Mastery Through Conscious Autosuggestion , one of the first books about the power of affirmations and the placebo effect .
Personally , the affirmation “ Every day , in every way , I ’m getting better and better ” is one of my favorite positive thoughts .
Not only does it roll off the tongue nicely , it also presents a fundamental truth about being a human being : we are always growing , evolving , and learning new things each and every day .
It ’s not just a positive thought , it ’s an inspiring truth .
Try It Out For Yourself :
Take a moment , close your eyes , and take a deep breath .
Then say to yourself 3 times in a calm and relaxed tone : “ Every day , in every way , I ’m getting better and better . ”
If you ’ve never tried affirmations before , this is a nice simple exercise to get you more familiar with it .
When you begin to take this stuff seriously and develop a consistent practice , it can have a very dramatic effect on your life .
I do a small affirmations exercise like this at least a few times every week – I hope it works for you as much as it works for me !

After decades of shares product development , Mazda and Ford Motor Co. look poised to go separate ways .
According to comments made by Mark Fields , Ford 's president of the Americas , last week to Bloomberg , Ford is planning to go it alone with future vehicles .
It 's not altogether surprising .
In late 2008 , Ford sold its share in Mazda from 33.4 percent to just 13.4 percent , although it remains Mazda 's single largest shareholder .
Ford has bet heavily on its new EcoBoost family of direct - injection , turbocharged engines , Mazda is developing its own families of next - generation direct - injection gasoline engines and diesel engines , plus an all - new family of automatic transmissions independent of Ford .
There are no plans to share the technology with Ford , either .
This news comes just after the official North American introduction of the 2011 Ford Fiesta , a vehicle that was developed primarily by Mazda ( the Japanese automaker sells its own Mazda2 , which also made its debut at the show and will be sold here as a 2011 model ) .
Other current Ford vehicles built on Mazda underpinnings include the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan , along with the Lincoln MKZ ( all based on the Mazda6 ) ; Ford and Mazda also share components between the Mazda CX - 9 and Ford Edge ( and to some degree with the CX - 7 ) , while the Volvo C30 , Mazda3 , and European Ford Focus are closely related .
And the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner can still trace their original design back to the former Mazda 626 sedan .
Engines are also shared ; although Mazda and Ford use separate engine production facilities , the ubiquitous 2.5 - liter four - cylinder units that are common in both automakers '
U.S. lineups are nearly identical in design .
Both automakers have a long history of sharing products and platforms in the U.S. and elsewhere .
For instance , up until the 2009 model year Mazda sold a rebadged Ford Ranger pickup as the B - Series in the U.S. , while Ford sold a rebadged version of Mazda 's pickup as the Ranger in other markets .
At one time even Ford 's best - selling Escort was built for the U.S. on a Mazda platform .
We 'll likely see some level of technology and powertrain technology exchange for many years .
U.S. Mazda spokesman Jeremy Barnes told TheCarConnection.com that the automaker has no intention of ruling out the sharing of components or technology in the future , and that some possibilities would still be in the best interest of both companies given their financial ties .

World and Regional Maps Collection , 16th to 19th Centuries
In an essay on the history of cartography , scholar J. B. Harley writes ,
For many centuries maps have been employed as literary metaphors and as tools in analogical thinking .
There is thus also a wider history of how concepts and facts about space have been communicated , and the history of the map itself — the physical artifact — is but one small part of this general history of communication about space .*
Whether or not one is a devoted scholar of cartography , one can always marvel at the beauty , scale and just plain oddities of rare maps and their relationship to the spaces they illustrate and information they convey .
From mythical sea beasts and unexplored areas to the carving up of the “ New World ” by colonial powers , rare maps demonstrate not only changes in geographical knowledge but change occurring in Western civilization ’s conception of itself .
Combining large - scale scanning techniques , ContentDM JPEG 2000 software , and scholarly research on each map ’s creation and context , this database allows researchers to access over 170 color digital images of examples from the University of Washington Libraries Special Collections Division ’s Rare Map Collection .
Maps included date from the sixteenth to early twentieth centuries with coverage spanning : the world , Western and Eastern Hemispheres , continents , countries and cities .
Of note this collection emphasizes North America , the Pacific Northwest , and exploration in this region from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries .
A number of these maps depict the fabled Northwest Passage between Asia and North America with interesting variations on Alaska ’s coastline as well as apocryphal accounts of the Sea of the West and the Northwest coast .
Also important are approximately 35 maps showcasing the work of eighteenth - century French cartographer , Guillaume de L'Isle .
Another significant collection of maps are taken from the atlas , “ Atlantis Geographicus Maior ” by Matthaeus Seutter .
Additionally , a small number of bird ’s - eye maps depicting cities in the Pacific Northwest ( i.e. Seattle , Victoria and Tacoma ) are represented .
About the Database
This digital collection was created with the CONTENTdm software ’s innovative new program , JPEG 2000 which enables larger materials to be displayed in a higher quality , more usable online format .
It allows viewers to see image details that would be difficult or impossible to see at the lower resolutions used in the normal software .
This new software includes pan and zoom capabilities which allow one to move in and out of the image and moving across the image to display the details .
JPEG 2000 software is particularly valuable for providing access to maps and drawings since large documents are made of fine details which researchers need to be able to see clearly .
The maps presented in this digital collection were scanned from original maps as TIFF files , manipulated in Adobe PhotoShop to achieve the best and clearest possible digital image and loaded into the Contentdm JPEG2000 software and linked with descriptive metadata .
Selection and supervision for the Rare Map Digital Collection was done by Kristin Kinsey and the research and descriptive metadata was prepared by Sarmila C. Franklin in 2008 - 9 .
The materials in this database are selections from the Rare Map Collection held by the UW Libraries Special Collections Division .

LOS ANGELES – A group working to produce an open and transparent voting system to replace current proprietary systems has published its first batches of code for public review .
The Open Source Digital Voting Foundation ( OSDV ) announced the availability of source code for its prototype election system Wednesday night at a panel discussion that included Mitch Kapor , creator of Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 and co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation ; California Secretary of State Debra Bowen ; Los Angeles County Registrar - Recorder Dean Logan ; and Heather Smith , director of Rock the Vote .
The OSDV , co-founded by Gregory Miller and John Sebes , launched its Trust the Vote Project in 2006 and has an eight - year roadmap to produce a comprehensive , publicly owned , open source electronic election system .
The system would be available for licensing to manufacturers or election districts , and would include a voter registration component ; firmware for casting ballots on voting devices ( either touch - screen systems with a paper trail , optical - scan machines or ballot - marking devices ) ; and an election management system for creating ballots , administering elections and counting votes .
" How we vote has become just as important as who we vote for , " Miller told the audience of filmmakers and technologists who gathered at the Bel - Air home of film producer Lawrence Bender to hear about the project .
" We think it is imperative that the infrastructure on which we cast and count our ballots is an infrastructure that is publicly owned . "
Miller said the foundation was n't looking to put voting system companies out of business but to assume the heavy burden and costs of research and development to create a trustworthy system that will meet the needs of election officials for reliability and the needs of the voting public for accessibility , transparency , security and integrity .
" We believe we 're catalyzing a re-birth of the industry ... by making the blueprint available to anyone who wants to use it , " Miller said .
The foundation has elicited help from academics and election officials from eight states as well as voter advocacy groups , such as Rock the Vote and the League of Women Voters , to guide developers in building the system .
Technology bigwigs such as Oracle , Sun and IBM have also approached the group to help with the project .
" That was unexpected , " Miller said .
The code currently available for download and review represents only a small part of the total code and includes parts of an online voter registration portal and tracking system , election management software and a vote tabulator .
Prototype code for producing ballots has been completed and will be posted soon .
Code for auditing is still being designed .
The voting firmware and tabulator program are built on a minimized Linux platform ( a stripped down version of Sharp ) and the election management components are built with Ruby on Rails .
The foundation already has California , New Hampshire , North Dakota , Ohio , Oregon , Vermont and Washington interested in adopting the system and is in talks with 11 other states .
Florida , which has been racked by voting machine problems since the 2000 presidential debacle , has also expressed interest , as has Georgia , which uses machines made by Premier Election Solutions ( formerly Diebold Election Systems ) statewide .
" Currently two vendors impact 80 percent of the vote " nationwide , Miller said , referring to Premier / Diebold and Election Systems & Software , which recently merged in a sale .
But if all the states that have expressed interest in adopting the open source system follow through with implementing it , about 62 percent of the nation 's electorate would be voting on transparent , fully auditable machines he said .
The foundation is especially interested in getting a system that would be workable in Los Angeles County , the nation 's largest and most complex election district with 4.3 million voters casting ballots in seven languages .
" If Los Angeles County figures this out , we will have solved the problems for the rest of the country , " Miller said .
Kapor called the project " a breath of fresh air " and said it symbolized the kind of " disruptive innovation " that has characterized all of the best technological developments over the last thirty years .

What seemed great on paper — a World War II game like nothing else , with sophisticated artistry to boot — had to be turned into a video game .
But then some things , not necessarily too many things , went wrong .

The Saboteur is the final game developed by Pandemic Studios out of the EA - owned label 's former offices , the last hurrah of the studio that brought gamers new takes on combat through Full Spectrum Warrior , Star Wars Battlefront , and Mercenaries .
And their last standalone effort may have been their boldest , a World War II open - world game set in and around Paris , starring an Irish race car driver on a vendetta against the Nazi occupiers of France 's beautiful city .
The game has received headlines for its inclusion of optional nudity and near - nudity , and it 's likely turned the head of anyone who has seen screenshots or video featuring its terrific mixture of black - and - white graphics and color .
But what makes it worth playing is its attempt to offer a mix of Grand Theft Auto , Assassin 's Creed and thankfully some of its own style , situated in a time and place of history no other major game has explored , letting its players be the hero in a battle they can't truly win , sneakily killing Nazis and brashly blowing up zeppelins along the way .

Theme : Setting a game amid the resistance movement against Nazi- occupied France is fresh and original .
This is n't a game of storming beaches but hiding in brothels , not ( often ) of driving a tank but of slipping into an enemy uniform and poisoning the rival army from within .
You do n't play many games in which you can walk around without the Nazis shooting at you until you raid their bases .
Better , though , is sneaking behind them to blow up their parked cars , sucker - punching them while they 're harassing people on the street , or walking calmly away after you 've set a ticking stack of dynamite at the foot of their sniper tower .
Basically , this is the ultimate game of griefing Nazis , which is a lot of fun and feels morally sound .
That this is all draped in one of the most unusual color schemes in gaming history is a bonus .
Nazi - dominated areas of Paris and the surrounding towns and countryside are rendered in black - and - white , save for the colors of flames and red Nazi arm bands and banners .
The game colorizes sections after the completion of certain missions , generating a sense that some vitality has been returned to the locale thanks to your actions .

It has you fighting them because your character , Irish race car driver Sean Devlin lost a race against crooked Nazis , tried to prank them and wound up stumbling across a scheme that got someone close to him killed .
He 's in it for revenge in the middle of a war , the French resistance a convenient cause to assist rather than one he was dedicated to serve .
It 's a nice touch that you play in the pair of races that are both key to the story , adding the historical nuance of the Nazis ' attempt to demonstrate Aryan superiority in sporting events .
Beyond Paris :
The game hits its stride best , for better or worse , outside Paris , where the player is most empowered to feel like a saboteur .
Climbing rooftops and battling some control and design issues in the big city can hurt the fun , but on the vast outskirts , a player can speed down dirt roads , quick - stop next to a Nazi gas station , plant a bomb and peel out .
The biggest delight comes from the explosions you hear and do n't see , the sounds of the chain of blasts you managed to trigger from beneath those Nazi noses .
All your sneaking and planning is rewarded as they scramble or die while you drive off to your next place to cause more mayhem .

A Man Of Many Talents :
An open - world game is often improved by an wide array of character abilities .
Our hero , Sean Devlin , can do the stealthy chaos - causing things described above , or he can toss grenades and fire machine guns into a nest of Germans , turning the tactical subtlety that feels most distinct to Saboteur into moments of gun-facing , man vs. army action .
In other words , it begins to feel like Mercenaries , a playground , as they said in the commercials , of destruction .
Other options , some not commonly seen elsewhere , include arming a bomb in a car you 've stolen and then bailing from the vehicle just before it speeds into a Nazi base .
Or you can call in resistance fighters to help you out , sometimes with drawbacks ( see below ) .
Dynamic Intent : Almost a " Hated " instead of a " Loved , " but something I ultimately cannot knock Pandemic for is its pockmarking of its map with several hundred " freeplay targets . "
These dots represent Nazi guard towers , trucks , supply drops and other things worth detonating .
The winning concept behind them is to empower the gamer of this open - world game to gradually influence the dynamics of his terrain .
Destroying a sniper tower while wandering through Paris removes that tower from the map , making a story - advancing mission the player might take right near the sniper tower easier .
The game falters in inundating the player with so many freeplay target options while making it very unclear what the incentive is for taking out most of them .
Sure , knocking over a guard tower makes a mission easier and earns Devlin some cash for buying better weapons .
But does the elimination of propaganda speakers make the pedestrians more willing to resist ?
It 'd be nice if the game made that more clear .

For The People :
The most original missions in The Saboteur branch from the game 's main story .
A lady asks Devlin to stop a Nazi book - burning .
A priest requests the murder of the Nazi half of a wedding party .
Most of the game 's main missions feel like they could have been generated for other action games , but those that engage with the manifold struggles of one society to survive the pervasive menace of another are the most refreshing .
They show the scope of The Saboteur 's potential .

Very Bad Timing : In Paris , Sean Devlin needs to climb , But he is no Altair or Ezio , and this game suffers in its proximity to the release of Assasin 's Creed II .
Sean 's climbing is slow and stymied in odd ways by seemingly surmountable out - croppings .
Worse , he has a hard time lowering himself down a roof in controlled ways .
That the designers named Devlin 's race car the Altair or that they included summit points that spin the camera around when he reaches them does the game no favors in avoiding the comparisons .
These are Assassin's Creed 1 mechanics in a world that is enjoying Assassin 's Creed II .
And that makes much of the emergent action in Paris — the escaping from Nazi patrols by taking to the rooftops — or climbing walls to reach ziplines to reach bomb - able targets , less fun that it would have been a year ago .

Very Bad Timing Part 2 : Sean Devlin is less the Irish rogue and more the jerk .
He 's gruff to the point of unpleasantness , the lead in a cast of characters who seem to hate each other except when they are sleeping with each other .
Uncharted 2 just showed us how very likable an overmatched , cocky hero can be and how a game with romantically - linked leads can be sexy without being sophomoric .
In this game , a stressed Devlin is asked how he feels after a rough battle .
He says : " I could eat a nun 's arse through a convent gate . "
Glitches :
The game is glitchy in an absurdly amusing way at least once per hour you 're playing it .
I approached a Nazi to snap his neck .
He animated properly , dropping to his death .
But so did the Nazi standing next to him , in synchronicity .
I went into a base camp to talk to a resistance leader and wondered why he had a mannequin on his office .
That was no mannequin .
That was another character , accidentally spawned atop his phonograph .
I called in a car - load of resistance fighters while I was taking fire in an intersection .
They drove over , some got out of their car , and then their driver ran over one of them .
I had to escape a mission on the back of a truck and kept failing because a character not involved in my mission — but who happened to be standing on the road we passed — kept dying , for reasons I can't explain .
I 'd just get a notification that he was dead .
Etc. Once an hour with things like these .
Not gamebreakers , but certainly mood - killers .

Truncated : Why Devlin brushes off an aerial crash he survives — right after the scene that was about him not having a parachute — I can't explain .
Nor can I explain why the game 's main adventure ends before we 've again fought the Nazi henchwoman who is set up in earlier missions or why it ends with an enchanting but incredibly easy last mission .
This game 's story feels like it was cut off , though The Saboteur does offer enough terrain and optional missions to keep players busy past that early end .
The Saboteur has enough originality and enough of a capacity for the player to have fun at almost all times that it 's a hard game not to recommend .
It 's a game for the curious , for gamers seeking something different .
But as with so many original games , it is a game that has rough edges .

This may be the most un - polished major - label game I 've reviewed this year , which is too bad .
Because when The Saboteur is being The Saboteur and not being Assassin 's Creed or choking on a bug , it 's got the spirit and spark of a game that should be played .
That is , if you ever wanted to blow up a Zeppelin with a rocket launcher , kiss someone to hide from the people chasing you or knock over a Nazi gas station without them ever knowing you were there .
The Saboteur was developed by Pandemic Studios and published by EA for the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 and PC on December 8 .
Retails for $ 59.99 USD .
A copy of the game was given to us by the publisher for reviewing purposes .
Played the campaign to its narrative conclusion , which was , for me , 88 % mission progress in about 19 and a half hours .
Liberated five chocolate bars and nine cans of caviar .

Dyson Air Multiplier Fan Blows Air , Will Blow Your Mind
To put it bluntly , the Dyson Air Multiplier Fan should not work .
It ’s a ring around a gaping hole .
Yet , every publication that reviewed it says it performs as advertised and they have no idea how it does either .
What the heck is the Dyson Fan ?
It ’s James Dyson ’s ( yes , the guy who updated the vacuum cleaner and the hand dryer in the same awesome manner ) take on the electric fan , removing the blade and leaving nothing but a ring and a base .
Looking more like a giant Fruit Loop than a home appliance , the clever fan manages its wind - blowing ability using some clever engineering tricks .
According to the press release , the fan draws air from the base of the machine , forces it up into the loop amplifier and accelerates it through an annular aperture , creating a jet of air in the large loop - the loop .
Then , this jet of air pulls more air from behind the fan into the airflow , along with the surrounding air around the device , eventually amplifying the resulting stream as much as 15 times .
Did you get that ?
I honestly did n’t .
But it sounds clever , right ?
Simply put , they successfully created a bladeless fan that actually blows air , spewing 118 gallons of it every minute .
Since , there are no blades , there ’s no chance of anyone hurting their fingers there , too .
Even better , it looks spanking hot and operates quietly .
How can you resist ?
Well , I ’ll tell you how .
The Dyson Air Multiplier Fan is scheduled for release this fall at an innovation - worthy price of between $ 300 to $ 330 .
Yep , that ’s how you can resist .

The political class has been entranced for a year now by the camp charm of Peter Mandelson : the Comeback .
The de facto Deputy PM glides from yacht to Downing Street , receiving awed applause for the cut of both his suits and his jib .
It feels almost vulgar , then , to mention his policies .
Yet Mandelson is enthusiastically pushing Britain further down a path that is damaging one of the great tools for human progress – scientific research – and slowly corrupting the medicine you take and the air you breathe .
At Mandelson 's instigation , universities have been taken out of the Department for Education and moved into his Department for Business .
He explains why : " I want the universities to focus more on commercialising the fruits of their endeavour ... business has to be central . "
He wants individual corporations to be more closely involved in steering research in university science departments and profiting from the results .
He says it is just common sense : we are all part of UK plc , and the ivory towers should be tilted towards serving British business .
A new report by Scientists for Global Responsibility ( SGR ) lays out the consequences of this process .
They start with a story most of us know .
The tobacco companies knew from the early 1950s that smoking caused lung cancer but they denied it relentlessly and paid university scientists to give the impression there was an ongoing " debate " .
A similar process is speeding across Britain 's science departments .
From drug trials to the energy sector , companies are ensuring that publicly funded research serves their profit - margins rather than the public interest .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
For example , oil companies are one of the biggest providers of private funds to our universities .
As Mandelson says , this funding " is n't something for nothing " .
They get to direct the scientists we employ and the labs we provide towards their purposes – which are to find ever more elaborate ways to drill the last dregs of oil and gas from the earth .
That 's why in our universities five times more is spent on research into fossil fuels than into renewable energy sources – even though fossil fuels are destroying our ecosystem , and renewables can save it .
At the heart of science is the idea that a good scientist should follow the evidence wherever it leads .
It 's this blue skies thinking that produces the greatest breakthroughs .
But corporate funding prevents this from happening : if research veers from the immediate interests of the corporation , it is shut down .
Edinburgh University used to have a Centre for Human Ecology that looked into corporate damage to the environment , until the director of an affected company wrote furiously to the head of the university : " You really will have to gag [ them , because they ] will alienate most , if not all , wealth creators . "
The Centre was shut down .
It only reopened years later , at the Open University .
Drug companies today are the largest funders of university research , and they too expect a return .
A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at 370 randomised drug trials , an essential phase in finding out if medicines work .
It discovered that if a study is sponsored by a drug company , it tells you the drug is safe to use 51 per cent of the time .
But if the scientists are publicly funded , they say the drug is safe only 16 per cent of the time .
The consequences of this process can – according to the SGR report – be startling .
In 1996 , Dr Nancy Olivieri was commissioned at her university to study a drug developed by Apotex Inc that treats a rare blood disorder .
She discovered a serious side - effect .
When she tried to inform her patients , the company brought the study to a sudden halt , and told Dr Olivieri that she could be sued .
She then discovered another more dangerous risk – and they threatened more lawsuits .
At this point many scientists would have shut up .
In 2002 , a series of independent reviews completely vindicated her .
How many cases like this happen in the shadows ?
It 's hard to tell , but the more universities are dependent on corporations , the more it will occur .
In 2002 , Proctor and Gamble paid for scientists at the University of Sheffield to evaluate the effectiveness of their new osteoporosis drug Actonel .
One of the lead scientists on the study , Dr Aubrey Blumsohn , noticed that when the research was published under his name , some 40 per cent of the data had simply been left out .
P&G refused to tell him why , saying it would breach commercial confidentiality .
He complained that the company was manipulating medical data – and according to the SGR report Blumsohn says he was offered $ 300,000 by the University of Sheffield to stop embarrassing their corporate sponsor .
When he spoke out to the media , he was suspended from his job .
When I put these allegations to Sheffield University , their spokesman said : " This is a confidential internal matter and I would n't want to go into any details . "
P&G say they adhere to " the highest standards of research integrity " .
The corporate capture of medical research now runs remarkably deep .
A recent study by Professor PC Gotzsche found that 70 per cent of published articles in the biosciences had been ghost - written in part by corporate PRs .
The risks are plain , but Mandelson wants to take us deeper .
Only research that can make a short - term buck for a big company will occur .
Malaria research out ; treatments for " shyness " or " sexual dysfunction " in .
Tidal power out ; leeching petrol from tar sands in .
Mandelson claims there is no other way to pay for research in a recession .
It 's not true .
The wealthy OECD nations currently spent £ 48bn on military research and development a year , and only £ 33bn on health and environmental R&D combined .
Transfer just half of the cash we currently spend on weapons to human needs and we do n't need any of this corporate contamination .
British science gave the world Isaac Newton , Charles Darwin and Stephen Hawking .
They figured out how we became human and the shape of the universe .
Now Peter Mandelson wants to bend that great tradition to serve the yacht - owning overclass he adores .
If he succeeds , we may never know the magnitude of our loss .
We wo n't see the health risks that go unreported , the cures to diseases that pass unfound , or the green technologies never invented .
They will all pass silently into the corporate - sponsored night .

There is an interesting controversy in Brooklyn after the city yielded to the Hasidic community in sandblasting off bike lanes on roads .
Hasidic leaders complained that they are having trouble obeying their religious law forbidding them from staring at members of the opposite sex with women biking around in shorts .
Bicycle advocates have been trying to repaint the lanes .
The Hasidic community has long viewed this enclave as their special area , even though other families and artists have moved in recently .
That has caused trouble with the Shomrim Patrol , a Hasidic neighborhood watch group .
The Shomrim recently apprehended two cycling advocates who were repainting the lane and called the police .
No charges were filed but the bikers were prevented from repainting the lane .
I find it incredible that the city would yield to such demands by a religious group to erase bike lanes .
A Department of Transportation spokesman said : “ We will continue to work with any community on ways we can make changes to our streets without compromising safety . ”
However , this is a religious - based objection to women who are not covered .
Yet , reports indicate that Mayor Bloomberg wanted to appease the Hasidic community before his recently close election .
Hasidic leaders say that the cyclists endanger families and children .
However , this is not the view of the city in creating these lanes and they are found in every major city .
The real objection appears to be their lifestyle and the rigid religious beliefs of this sect .
It is a clearly improper decision that uses city resources to enforce values of a single religious group .

The database has helped solve 32,200 crimes - 0.7 % of all crime
The DNA of innocent people arrested in England and Wales should be held for no longer than six years , ministers are expected to say .
Last year the European Court of Human Rights ruled it was unlawful to keep indefinitely the profiles of innocent people .
The United Kingdom has the world 's biggest DNA database .
Police say retaining samples has helped solve crimes .
Human rights groups say the proposed change is not enough .
There are no reliable figures on how many crimes have been solved because someone cleared of one offence has been later linked to another solely through the unique genetic fingerprint obtained from their DNA .
One recent government figure suggests that less than 1 % of all recorded crime is solved with the database 's help - although most police investigations do not involve DNA at all .
' Unfinished research '
The European Court ruling last year said the system in England and Wales breached basic rights because it allowed police to retain indefinitely the DNA samples of anyone arrested in an investigation , even if they were later neither charged nor convicted .
Northern Ireland 's DNA database is administered separately but follows the same model and is therefore , in practice , also in breach of the European Court 's judgment .
Scotland 's part of the database was given the all clear because police delete DNA profiles of most people who are not convicted .
In all four parts of the UK , police take DNA swabs from suspects shortly after their arrest .
Please turn on JavaScript .

The Home Office has already deleted the profiles of children under 10 years old to comply with the European Court 's ruling , but has been considering how to deal with the rest of the estimated one million samples from people who have not been convicted .
Earlier this year it proposed time limits of six or 12 years depending on the nature of the crime for which a suspect had been arrested .
These figures were drawn from research by the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science .
Its director subsequently accused the Home Office of basing the proposals on unfinished research which did not prove the case for any particular time limit .
Fundamental principles
The proposals being outlined later on Wednesday are expected to discount the 12 year figure and propose different rules for the under - 18s .
But the Equality and Human Rights Commission said such a proposal would not meet requirements set by the court ruling that data should be held only when there were " clear , justifiable reasons " for doing so .
NATIONAL DNA DATABASE Profiles : 5.9 m Individuals : 5.1 m Estimated proportion of replicate profiles : 14 % Estimate for people neither charged nor convicted : 20 % Crimes solved with database 's help : 32,200 ( 0.68 % of all crime ) Profiles removed March - Oct 2009 : 255 Source : Home Office / Parliamentary questions
Q&A : The national DNA database Send us your comments
The shadow home secretary , Chris Grayling , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a future Conservative government would adopt the system in place in Scotland , where DNA samples are kept for no longer than five years and in relatively minor cases destroyed at the end of the inquiry .
He added : " What I do n't think we should be doing is saying to absolutely everybody who is pulled into a police station for any reason , ' Your DNA will be taken and it will be stored indefinitely , ' as is the case at the moment , or indeed will be stored for up to six years as the government appear to be proposing ' .
" One of the fundamental principles of our criminal justice system is that you 're innocent until proven guilty and I think this actually rather undermines that principle . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Julie Bindel , from the campaign group Justice for Women , told Today she understood the fears of discrimination against those whose DNA profiles are kept - but the needs of victims also had to be considered .
" It may be that we need to think about a national database , " she said .
" It 's something that we feel uncomfortable with , but so many crimes have been solved by DNA and so many crimes have also been solved by acquitting those who have been falsely accused - some of the worst miscarriages of justice .
" And I think for women particularly who 've been raped and who do n't get justice we have to balance their rights against the rights of those who do n't like the idea of having their DNA on record . "
Shami Chakrabarti , director of the campaign group Liberty , told BBC News : " The government has been stockpiling the DNA of completely innocent people including children and the more innocent DNA you keep the greater the risk of accident , error and abuse . "

The Perfect Traveler
The Perfect Traveler
Travel Books :
He was cool , steady and prone to breaking rules .
Pico Iyer celebrates the life and work of Somerset Maugham .
Somerset Maugham ( Somerset Maugham ( Wikimedia Commons
The perfect traveler must be a perfect contradiction .
She should be open to almost everything that comes her way , but not too ready to be taken in .
He should be worldly , shrewd , his feet firmly on the ground ; but he must also have the capacity to give himself over to moments of real wonder .
He or she must be curious , observant , spirited and kind — ready to spin a spell - binding tale of adventure and irony at the Explorers ’ Club , and then throw it all over for a crazy romance in the South Seas .
Really , I suppose , the ideal traveler , or travel companion , offers a happy blend of steadiness and surprise .
I make up such lists of characteristics often , in my head , and scroll quickly through some of the obvious suspects ( Graham Greene , D.H. Lawrence , Herman Melville , Annie Dillard ) .
And then , somehow , I alight , over and over , on a man who seems to be wearing a silk dressing gown and is best known for his novels ( though in his lifetime he was celebrated as a dramatist ) .
We read “ Of Human Bondage , ” “ The Razor ’s Edge ” or “ The Moon and Sixpence ” for their familiar characters , their unembarrassed intensity and , perhaps , behind all that , their exotic scenes ; but the reason Somerset Maugham is still commanding readers almost 50 years after his death , and the reason Hollywood keeps turning to him for new movies ( “ Up at the Villa , ” “ Being Julia , ” “ The Painted Veil ” ) is that he was a classic traveler , disguising his hunger for romance , and even for transcendence , behind the cool demeanor of an unillusioned , above - it - all , often feline Englishman .
In reality , however , Maugham was born in Paris and all his early letters were written in perfect French .
As a teenager he studied in Heidelberg and then , having already mastered Greek , Latin , French , German , Italian and Russian , he went to Seville for 16 months in his early 20s and learned Spanish .
He served in World War I as a volunteer ambulance driver and nurse — though he had four plays on at the time in London ’s West End — and he became the West ’s main source of intelligence in Russia during the weeks leading up to the Bolshevik Revolution .
And all of that was before he undertook the long , almost never - ending series of journeys , to Borneo and China and the Pacific and Japan , that made him perhaps the defining teller of far - flung tales .
Look at him enjoying himself with Noel Coward and Winston Churchill , and it ’s easy to forget that he spent the last 39 years of his life in France , where he had a secret symbol to repel the evil eye painted on his outside wall ( and had that same symbol slipped into the cover of his books ) .
Only four of the 78 books Maugham turned out are officially placed on the travel shelves : his classic account of a journey from Rangoon to Haiphong , “ The Gentleman in the Parlor ” ( still the best book on Southeast Asia I know ) , brought out in 1929 ; a series of far - sighted , ironic sketches and snapshots called “ On a Chinese Screen , ” from 1920 ; a very early , boyish series of wanderings around southern Spain , “ In the Land of the Blessed Virgin , ” from 1905 , that he delighted in repudiating in later years for its flowery romanticism ; and a meditation on some figures in Spanish history — not , he said , “ a book of travel , ” though it is generally characterized as such — called “ Don Fernando , ” from 1935 .
Yet travel lay behind nearly all his work , and the traveling impulse — the wish to steal into the untried alleyway , to slip into a foreign heart , the wish to be away from the stuffy drawing - rooms he knew too well , and out among dramas and mysteries that would challenge and expand his mind — was really the engine that drove all his writing .
His early book on Spain is full of the excitement and rebellion of a boy eager to be away from England ’s enclosedness , at loose in a world of sunshine and passion , a “ romancer by profession , ” as he calls himself .
In his youthful novel , “ The Merry - Go - Round , ” published when he was 30 , a burning young medical student , Frank Hurrell ( much like Maugham himself — even the name sounds like Larry Darrell , the questing hero of “ The Razor ’s Edge ” almost 40 years later ) , cries , famously , “ My whole soul aches for the East , for Egypt and India and Japan .
I want to know the corrupt , eager life of the Malays and the violent adventures of the South Sea Islands ...
I want to see life and death , and the passions , the virtues and vices , of men face to face , uncovered . ”
The phrasing may be purple , jejune , but the sentences are as alive as anything in “ Siddhartha ” or “ On the Road . ”
When Maugham , at the end of his life , looked back on his experience , in “ The Summing Up ” and “ The Writer ’s Notebook , ” he began returning again and again to formative experiences “ on the wing . ”
Much of the particular beauty of Somerset Maugham as travel model , for me at least , is that he breaks every rule you might find in Travel Writing 101 .
He generalizes wildly .
He claims not to be interested in the places he ’s visiting .
He admits that he ’s only hunting for material and , very typically , in the middle of Southeast Asia , goes off on such a long digression about a novelist in London that we lose all sense of where we are .
Trees in a Thai village he likens , unusually , to “ the sentences of Sir Thomas Browne , ” Asian clothes he calls much less interesting and various than what you ’d see in Piccadilly and , in the middle of wildly colorful and unvisited landscapes , he confesses that his great delight comes from reading F.H. Bradley ’s “ Appearance and Reality . ”
Yet the net effect of all these transgressions is to suggest he ’s having fun .
He seldom loses his temper on his travels , and he never seems bored .
He always , in fact , seems to be just where he most wants to be .
He wins our trust by telling us frankly that he ’s lazy , unfair and uninterested , and his sense of ease and general perambulating is so intense , you can easily overlook that he ’s sleeping for days in an open rowboat , has a temperature of 105 ( just before offering one of the most brilliant synopses of Buddhism I ’ve read ) and went on a 60 - day march when he was close to 50 .
More deeply , Maugham ’s background — growing up in a foreign country , training as a medical student ( which is to say , a keen observer of both the body and the mind ) , and suffering from a lifelong stammer — all schooled him in listening , in hearing others ’ symptoms more than just listing his own , in seeing how much he could get by being not a somebody at home but a no one abroad .
He ’d grown up hearing his father bring back stories from Greece , Turkey and Morocco , and his mother , whose own father had served in India , “ could prattle Hindustani much better than English . ”
And over and over he saw that he could most powerfully engage with life undistractedly in some place not his own .
As he put it in his autobiography , “ I never felt entirely myself till I had put at least the Channel between my native country and me . ”
Part of what made Maugham such an engaged traveler was that he had already had his fill of so - called success and high society , and quickly saw that “ I would much sooner spend a month on a desert island with a veterinary surgeon than with a prime minister . ”
He was eager to try everything — to smoke opium , to visit prisons as much as churches , to do the very things that another part of himself would denigrate as reckless or susceptible .
“ A novelist must preserve a child - like belief in the importance of things which common sense considers of no great consequence , ” he wrote late in life .
“ He must never entirely grow up . ”
What this meant in practice was that , like all the great travelers , he brought a freshness as well as a knowingness to everything he saw , and did not just try to excavate the past , but , more , to outline the future .
Go to Chiang Mai tomorrow , and you will almost certainly meet a man who threw over his comfortable life in London for the less visible benefits of a cozy room in the wilderness , a local girl with whom he shares few words and , nearby , a missionary raging against all such men , and such girls : a classic Maugham triangle .
Visit the China being “ definitively ” covered by tomorrow ’s foreign correspondents and you ’re unlikely to find anyone who catches the country ’s character and mysteries so well as Maugham did 90 years ago .
It ’s hard not to go to an expat dinner party in Hong Kong , Paris , Buenos Aires , and not realize that you ’re in a collection of half - exotic types that you ’ve met before in a Maugham short story .
Maugham was able to write about the British in China , say , because he could find an Englishman in himself , but he could also sympathize with — and longed to explore — everything that was the opposite of that .
He could give us unusually sensitive accounts of Confucianism , of Buddhism , of mysticism and hedonism because he could locate elements of all of them in his own make - up .
He was at once the archetypal denizen of the Belgravia lounge and , by virtue of that fact , a lifelong rebel who always longed to be as far from such civilities and boredoms as he could .
This made for a blend of anti-moralism and philosophical enquiry much rarer than it might seem .
D.H. Lawrence , for example , traveled everywhere at the same time as Maugham , and caught Ceylon , Australia , New Mexico with a vividness and fury that few travelers have matched in the 80 years since .
Almost preternaturally attentive and alive , he could pick up the smells , shapes , instincts of a place , grow bewitched by them and then grow violently disenchanted — all inside a week .
Every place became a reflection of his mood .
Aldous Huxley , meanwhile , who later became one of the most open - minded explorers of different traditions , bumped across Asia in “ Jesting Pilate ” like many a modern travel writer , looking only for an excuse to show off his superior wit .
Evelyn
Waugh is great fun to read , but you never come away from him feeling that you ’ve really seen or visited Ethiopia or South America .
Perhaps that is why Maugham is so alive even now , stealing into many of the travel writers we most enjoy .
It ’s hard to savor Graham Greene , for example , without seeing Maugham ’s ghost in the mix of worldliness and romanticism , the persistent investigations into faith , the condition of the lonely man in a scruffy room abroad ( the two of them even both wrote works called “ The Tenth Man ” and both ended up living on the French Riviera ) .
Pick up Paul Bowles ’ harrowing stories of travelers consumed by the places they visit and you realize that Maugham is one of the few writers who has claimed those depths before him .
Jan Morris ’ blend of tolerance and acuity — her very British longing for a counter - Britain everywhere — powerfully evokes her great predecessor , and when I read “ Hotel Honolulu ” by Paul Theroux , I feel as if I ’m paging through a Maugham anthology of the South Seas , though updated to the modern moment , and with sexual explicitness and rage added .
V.S. Naipaul began his escape from his native Trinidad by writing a schoolboy essay on Maugham — it won a competition — and , more than 50 years later , was endowing the protagonist of two late novels with the curious name , “ W. Somerset Chandran . ”
As a young man , Maugham was taught , he says , by an anatomy teacher that “ the normal is the rarest thing in the world , ” and when he was traveling he spent little time looking at the sights , but went off instead “ on the search for emotion , ” as he put it in his early book on Spain , collecting “ characters , ” picking up stories at the bar , using the Alhambra or the temples of Thailand as a launching pad for inquiries into beauty and impermanence and illusion .
And what gives his work its particular power is that , you can tell , he remained all his life a stowaway at heart , whose spirit lay with the wastrel and the seeker .
You see that most obviously in “ The Moon and Sixpence , ” about a man ( based on Gauguin ) who throws over his successful job in Paris to go to live in Tahiti , or in “ The Razor ’s Edge , ” about a quintessential young American who leaves behind the comfortable circles of Chicago to look for wisdom in the Himalayas .
But even the lesser stories and travel books are likewise full of runaways , men of the cloth , drifters committed for life to a place they know will never be home ( or pining for an England they know they ’ll never see again ) .
We ’re not used to thinking of Maugham as a hippie , but it ’s worth recalling that he was roughing it around India for three months when he was 63 , seeking out swamis and yogis ; he told his friend Christopher Isherwood , a few years later , that his great wish , when he turned 70 , was to return to the subcontinent and study Shankara .
He had no time for the likes of Henry James , with his country - house themes , and from early on was sounding much more like a vagabond Thoreau ( “ What is the use of hurrying to pile up money when one can live on so little ? ” ) .
Read his great apologia , “ The Summing Up , ” and you find him as metaphysically alive and excited as that German who just spun out his creed to you over dinner in a candlelit restaurant in Ladakh last night .
Indeed , Maugham read philosophy every morning when he woke up , the way others might do yoga .
At the beginning of his short story , “ Honolulu , ” Maugham writes , in tones we instantly recognize as his own , “ The wise man travels only in imagination . ”
In his early book on Spain , he concluded , “ It is much better to read books of travel than to travel oneself ; he really enjoys foreign lands who never goes abroad . ”
Yet the strength of Maugham is that he would not listen even to his own advice , and was permanently breaking the rules he ’d so clearly and logically laid down .
He does , after all , go to Honolulu , and there meets a Western traveler whose story , perhaps , he would never have listened to , or heard , if he ’d met the man in London or New York .
On his 90th birthday — he ’d enjoyed Japan and Italy in his 80s — he confessed that perhaps his greatest wish now was to go back to Angkor Wat .
“ I have one desire left , ” he wrote , his powers failing , “ which is to return to that lost village in the jungle in the Far East . ”
In truth , though , as every reader of the man knows , he ’d never really left the place at all .

I 'm still trying to get my head around why the Oilers celebrated their " 30th anniversary season " in 2008 - 09 , which was the franchise 's 36th season , including its 29th in the NHL .
( The lockout season does NOT count in my books -- fridiculous ! )
From an NHL perspective a whole bunch of 30th anniversaries will take place in 2009 - 10 .
This week marks three decades since that first NHL training camp .
What an exciting time it was to be a hockey fan !
The past twelve months had already seen :
the acquisition and long - term signing of Wayne Gretzky ;
first place , the franchise 's first - ever playoff series victory ( a Game 7 home win over Gordie Howe 's New England WHAlers ) , and a trip to the Avco Cup finals ;
the drama of the merger in which acceptance was finally forced by Canadian hockey fans who , it turned out , also drink beer ( who knew ? ) .
What they did n't drink was Molson 's beer , at least not across the prairies and in francophone Quebec , until " Molson 's Canadiens " reluctantly changed their swing vote to " yea " ;
player movement galore , and
the best Entry Draft in history .
The Oilers were not a typical expansion team in any respect , with an existing team , arena and fan base , and established ownership , management , coaching and scouting .
Most importantly of all , the Oilers had Gretzky , the guy Peter Pocklington had craftily signed to a " personal services contract " earlier in 1979 in yet another example of outside - the - box thinking that had helped the WHA surivive through those seven chaotic , fascinating years .
Pocklington consistently referred to Gretzky as a " deal - buster " during merger negotiations and had managed to hold firm .
That was one of the few concessions the incoming teams won .
It was n't so much expansion or merger as it was a hostile takeover .
The newcomers got shafted in many different positions , including three different drafts :
a " Reclamation " Draft in which WHA teams were allowed to protect a paltry 2 skaters ( and bizarrely , 2 goalies ) , exposing the rest to being reclaimed by those teams that held their NHL rights ; an Expansion Draft in which NHL teams could protect virtually everybody that mattered , while exposing a sorry collection of has - beens , never - weres , fat contracts and problem children for the WHA teams to restock their pillaged rosters ; the Entry Draft where the WHA got end - of - round slots ; the Oilers got the last pick in each round .
No Gilbert Perreaults here .
W.r.t. # 1 , sometimes those " NHL rights " were tenuous to put it mildly .
Paul Shmyr was a great example of the screw - job the NHL put to the new clubs ; he had bolted the hapless California Golden Seals in 1972 , and played all 7 years in the Rebel League including the last two as Edmonton 's " Kaptain " .
Meanwhile his NHL rights went from California to Cleveland and ultimately to Minnesota in the Barons dispersal draft .
Even though he had zero history in Minny , the No - Stars grabbed him as a free player , an experienced defender who had led the first - place Oilers with +37 .
Other Oilers lost in this process included defencemen Dave Langevin , John Hughes and Risto Siltanen , and forwards Stan Weir , Dave Hunter , Dave Semenko , Dennis Sobchuk , Steve Carlson , and ( controversially ) Bengt Gustafsson .
Oilers ' management was already wheeling and dealing , giving up other assets and considerations to claw back four guys who had been claimed by their " NHL teams " : Weir , Semenko , Siltanen , Hunter .
The latter was part of some fancy dealing with Montreal , which involved among other things future considerations , namely a " hands off " agreement for certain Habs in the expansion draft .
The Habs were so deep -- many thought their Voyageurs farm team could comfortably make the NHL playoffs -- they had to take extraordinary measures to protect a couple of extra guys .
Sather emerged with several " B " prospects from the Habs , including Hunter , Cam Connor and Dave Lumley .
By training camp Oilers had 13 returnees : goalies Dave Dryden and Ed Mio , just 2 defencemen in Siltanen and Al Hamilton ; and forwards Gretzky , B.J.MacDonald , Brett Callighen , Peter Driscoll , Bill " Cowboy " Flett , Weir , Hunter , Semenko , and captain Ron Chipperfield .
The blueline severely weakened , Sather & Co. plucked a few somewhat - familiar blueliners from around the league in that expansion draft -- Lee Fogolin , Colin Campbell , Doug Hicks , Pat Price .
They did considerably less well in choosing forwards .
Oilers then hit gold in the Entry Draft , drafting defenceman Kevin Lowe in the first round , then picking Hall - of - Famers Mark Messier and Glenn Anderson with picks they had ironically traded down to acquire ( in recovering Dave Semenko , Oilers traded # 42 and # 63 to Minnesota for # 48 and # 69 .
I guess that deal worked out OK . )
The new - look squad took the ice of Varsity Arena ( now Clare Drake ) in late September , 1979 .
It so happened I had had knee surgery earlier that month , and had a couple weeks off work to recover ( knee surgery involved scalpels , stitches , and crutches way back then ) .
With nothing better to do , I made my way down to Varsity to watch the workouts and scrimmages each day .
I had never seen a live NHL game in my life , but I had season tickets dating back to the last two WHA seasons , an unshakeable belief that Gretzky was for real , and a very high level of excitement and optimism about the prospects of NHL hockey in Edmonton .
Some of the newcomers did n't show much .
Training camp was training camp for seasoned pros , and " gamers " like Lee Fogolin and Colin Campbell needed real games to show their true colours .
Others stood out right away .
It was clear from the first practice that Dave Lumley was a player who likely would have a couple NHL seasons under his belt already if not for the log jam in Montreal ; he was a good postional player with a little offensive imagination and solid puck skills ( he was absolutely great at getting the puck over his own blueline ) , and an effective agitator besides .
Doug Hicks was a mobile puck - moving blueliner who looked poised and confident from the get - go .
Then there was the rookie Lowe , whose every move screamed Quality .
A little green around the edges to be sure , but there was no way he was n't going to make the team right out of camp .
His professional career would ultimately consist of 1468 games in the NHL and 0 in the minors .
The surprise was Messier , an 18 - year - old colt who had scored all of one goal in the WHA the previous season .
He hardly appeared cowed by that experience .
The brash local kid was undisciplined and prone to dumb mistakes even in training camp , but he was n't afraid to try stuff .
Moreover , there was no denying the size , speed , and soft hands which were evident in ( almost ) every line rush .
And of course there was Gretzky , whose unique game I was still learning .
It was fascinating to watch some of the stuff he did in practice , always pushing himself , winning all the races in the stop - and - starts , using the down times for self - driven drills of puck control including a few tricks nobody had ever seen before , staying out late to practice deflections .
Of course it was during scrimmages where he truly excelled , constantly springing surprised linemates through even - more - surprised defenders with his subtle but devastating puck distribution skills .
I remember one play in particular where he executed his patented buttonhook - in - a - phone - booth , then used the space created to take a couple of steps and wire a perfect slapshot through traffic into the top corner .
It was both unexpected and understated -- no red light , no celebration -- so it took a second for the semi - full house to take it in , then we erupted in applause .
It did n't matter that the play had taken place against scrubs and rubbydubs ; it was apparent that such magic would work against anybody .
There was simply no way to defend Wayne Gretzky .
There was also no way to deter optimism in Edmonton .
Like Gretzky , like Messier , like Lowe , we could n't wait to unleash our enthusiasm and our unseasoned squad against Big Brother .
They would n't know what hit them .
Right ?
Right !
It actually did work out that way , and in short order too .
There would be bumps along the road of course , but that team never failed to thrill with a team game that was simultaneously creative and porous .
Fortunately , they had a smart GM / coach with the patience to allow them to be both .
To review just the 1979 - 80 season that followed that glorious training camp :
On the individual level , mid-career guys like MacDonald , Callighen and Weir at least matched their WHA productivity rates that 1979 - 80 season .
Lumley posted outstanding numbers as a 25 - year - old rookie : 20 - 38 - 58 , +15 , as he joined Weir and Hunter on a productive , tough - minutes line dubbed the Gang Green ( at least on nights the whole team was n't being called The Gang That Could n't Shoot Straight , as they were often that first autumn ) .
Hicks would lead the defence in scoring and the entire team in plus / minus ( +18 ) , while Fogolin showed his quality the moment a puck was dropped in anger .
Others like Chipperfield and Driscoll found their games did not translate well to the NHL , while former NHLers Hamilton , Flett and Dryden all were exposed for their eroding skills .
Connor , who used to kill the Oilers when he was a Houston Aero , proved to be a bust and was one of many guys shipped out of town ( for Don Murdoch , but that 's another story entirely ! ) .
As for Gretzky , all he did was have the greatest rookie inaugural season in the history of the NHL , winning the Hart and Byng Trophies while getting hosed out of the Ross and Calder .
Sather and titular GM Larry Gordon were constantly tinkering and experimenting , as 40 different players including 6 goalies wore Oiler silks that season .
Only a dozen or so of them were " real NHLers " , so the ' 79 - 80 Oilers had neither the depth nor the goaltending to contend .
A deadline deal of Chipperfield for Ron Low brought an instant infusion of the latter , a 59 - minute brawl in Pittsburgh after Kim Clackson highsticked Gretzky with Semenko in the immediate vicinity galvanized the group , and the Oil went on a closing 8 - 2 - 1 run to scrape into the last playoff spot .
That earned them the privilege of playing the NHL's first overall team , Pat Quinn 's Philadelphia Flyers .
The Flyers ended the dream in the minimum three games , but not before two of them were extended into overtime .
The Oilers would be carried off on their shields only after Ken " The Rat " Linseman beat Low 23:56 into overtime in the first - ever Stanley Cup playoff game in Northlands Colsieum .
Despite the loss , the crowd roared as their temporarily - vanquished heroes shook hands with the Flyers .
Historical footnote : Even in defeat there was foreshadowing .
Four years later , the Oil would break those Flyers ' record for fastest Stanley Cup by an " expansion team " .
Ken Linseman of all people would score the Cup - winning goal , and Glen Sather 's choice of skaters at the game 's denouement -- Fogolin , Lowe , Messier , Gretzky , Lumley -- were all participants of that first NHL training camp back at Varsity Arena .
What a thrill it was to have been in the seats for both !

Fox p2 firing on all cylinders ( Image : Oliver Culman / Tendance Floue )
It is often thought of as one of the things that make humans unique .
Now , researchers are uncovering the suite of genes that gave us our gift of the gab .
All of them appear to be controlled by a master - switch gene called Foxp2 .
When inactive , this gene causes severe speech and language problems in humans .
Although other animals have versions of Foxp2 , in 2002 a German team identified two small alterations in the protein the human Foxp2 produces that are not carried by our closest living relative , the chimpanzee .
This suggested that the human version of Fox p2 may function differently , and be a key element in our unique linguistic abilities .
Earlier this year , Wolfgang Enard ’s team at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , spliced this human version of Fox p2 into mice .
The mice did n’t start speaking , but their sub- sonic vocaliszations changed , as did the shape and activity of neurons in a brain area that goes awry in people with Foxp2 - related language disorders .

To discover what Foxp2 does differently in humans , neuroscientists Genevieve Konopka and Daniel Geschwind at the University of California , Los Angeles , grew human brain cells lacking Foxp2 in Petri dishes .
To some they added human Foxp2 and to others the chimp version .
They then recorded all the genes that were affected .
Out of the hundreds of genes controlled by Foxp2 , they identified 116 that responded differently to the human version of Foxp2 .
This set of genes fits well with Foxp2 ‘s suggested role in the evolution of language and speech , says Konopka .
Many control brain development or have been linked to cognition .
Others are involved in controlling body movement and guiding the development of facial and laryngeal tissues that are essential for articulation .
Evolutionary studies of Foxp2 suggest it acquired its human - specific changes in the last half million years of human evolution – roughly when language is thought to have emerged .
Geschwind has done preliminary studies of the evolution of the 116 genes that Foxp2 affects , which suggest they may have a similar history .
“ It brings up the possibility , which is not at all remote , that these genes may have evolved in concert , ” he says , adding that this may even be true for other genes involved in language .
While the results hint at a central role for Foxp2 in the evolution of language , Geschwind cautions against calling it “ the language gene ” as some have in the past .
“ Either Fox p2 itself is pretty damn important , ” he says , “ or it ’s part of a regulatory circuit – something else is regulating Fox p2 that no one else has found yet . ”
Geschwind ’s team carried out a second experiment , comparing patterns of gene activation in adult human and chimpanzee brain tissue .
They found a striking overlap between the genes whose activity was different in the human brain tissue and the set of genes that are controlled differently by human Foxp2 .
The finding is preliminary , but if confirmed , it might mean a significant part of the difference between human and chimpanzee brains could be explained by two small changes in one gene , says Wolfgang Enard .
“ That would be really amazing . ”
With 116 genes to follow up on , Geschwind and Konopka have their work cut out for them , says Pasko Rakic , a neuroscientist at Yale University .
“ This paper provides a starting point for future molecular studies on the basis of the evolution of language . ”
Faraneh Vargha - Khadem , a neuroscientist at University College London , who studies patients with Foxp2 - linked language disorders , says Geschwind ’s list makes sense .
In addition to their speech problems , her patients ’ lower faces are partly misshaped as well .
However , Vargha - Khadem cautions against distilling the evolution and development of language down to a single gene and its multitude of effects .
Fox p2 may have helped endow humans with the machinery to produce speech , but this does not explain how abstract ideas get translated into utterances , she says .
“ Almost by magic these muscles move to produce the sound sequence that makes sense to the listener , ” Vargha - Khadem says , adding that science has a long journey ahead to understand how the machinery works , let alone how it expresses our thoughts .

It is no secret to readers that I think we can best balance energy supply and demand using pure economic transactions .
Whatever you feel about flash trading , those markets with millions of 14 millisecond transactions prove that we know how to run markets fast enough to manage even the most demanding decision making on smart grids .
Free energy , that is energy markets unencumbered price and reliability arbitrage , is certainly the fastest path to the technologies we need to balance supply with the increasingly volatile supple we foresee .
But today ’s utilities serve a social justice purpose that I have been unable to reconcile in my mind with free energy until now .
We need free energy because we need to unbundle two of the most significant services provided alongside today ’s energy delivery ; availability risk arbitrage and price risk arbitrage .
These services create a moral hazard we can no longer afford .
Availability risk arbitrage removes performance incentives for end nodes to install systems for energy storage and generation .
Price risk arbitrage reserves all economic incentives for energy storage and generation to the grid , where it is too expensive and innovation adoption is , of necessity , to slow to support the type of venture creation we have seen in high tech .
The basic problem is that our electric grid operates with lower margins for error than it ever has before , and current policy is to reduce them further .
No community is clamoring for more power lines in its back yard even as our houses are filled with ever more energy consuming equipment for computing , telecommunications , and entertainment .
It is becoming too expensive , in generation costs , infrastructure capacity , and social will to maintain constant oversupply of traditional energy .
We wish to use new energy sources that are unpredictable and episodic .
Attempts to smooth out supply volatility at the grid re too expensive or too few .
( Ask me some time why natural gas sales went up when gas generation was replaced by wind in Colorado . )
The ability of the grid to supply availability arbitrage is failing .
With fixed prices , the economic incentives for end nodes to participate in energy generation and storage are non-existent .
The most basic market rule is buy low and sell high .
Without dynamic pricing , the rule for homes and commercial buildings is sell low ( wholesale ) and buy high ( retail ) .
Efforts by local regulators to repeal that rule are as artificial as efforts to repeal gravity .
Dynamic pricing changes all that .
With the volatility of energy supply fully exposed , end nodes will buy technologies to manage their risk .
With the volatility of energy prices fully exposed , end nodes will find the business case to manage their power purchases .
Bottlenecks in the power grid will result in local congestion pricing , letting the true costs neighborhood infrastructure decisions to be seen by the public .
Utilities today must play not to lose rather than to win .
They cannot adapt new technologies quickly because they must always be reliable .
Market actors that cannot accept risk , cannot afford to innovate .
End nodes can voluntarily accept risk , and so can afford to adopt new technology .
If Denver , where we met this month to form the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel ( SGIP ) , is plunged into darkness for a week , it is a dire outcome ; if my home fails for a week , is provides entertainment to my neighbors .
The difference between grid - level innovation and end - node innovation is the difference between tragedy and comedy .
Smart grids will transfer risk to their end nodes .
Economic agents which assume risk will expect to be paid for it .
These payments will be the fertilizer for an untold number of new technologies .
The best way to transfer risk and payments together is self - balancing , self organizing free markets in energy .
Systems that can participate in these markets for us as well as systems that can store or generate energy on - site , will be the reward .
Researchers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham ( UAB ) have discovered that restricting consumption of glucose , the most common dietary sugar , can extend the life of healthy human - lung cells and speed the death of precancerous human - lung cells , reducing cancer 's spread and growth rate .
The research has wide - ranging potential in age - related science , including ways in which calorie - intake restriction can benefit longevity and help prevent diseases like cancer that have been linked to aging , said principal investigator Trygve Tollefsbol , Ph.D. , D.O. , a professor in the Department of Biology .
" These results further verify the potential health benefits of controlling calorie intake . "
Tollefsbol said .
" Our research indicates that calorie reduction extends the lifespan of healthy human cells and aids the body 's natural ability to kill off cancer - forming cells . "
The UAB team conducted its tests by growing both healthy human - lung cells and precancerous human - lung cells in laboratory flasks .
The flasks were provided either normal levels of glucose or significantly reduced amounts of the sugar compound , and the cells then were allowed to grow for a period of weeks .
" In that time , we were able to track the cells ' ability to divide while also monitoring the number of surviving cells .
The pattern that was revealed to us showed that restricted glucose levels led the healthy cells to grow longer than is typical and caused the precancerous cells to die off in large numbers , " Tollefsbol said .
In particular , the researchers found that two key genes were affected in the cellular response to decreased glucose consumption .
The first gene , telomerase , encodes an important enzyme that allows cells to divide indefinitely .
The second gene , p16 , encodes a well known anti-cancer protein .

" Opposite effects were found for these genes in healthy cells versus precancerous cells .
The healthy cells saw their telomerase rise and p16 decrease , which would explain the boost in healthy cell growth , " Tollefsbol said .
" The gene reactions flipped in the precancerous cells with telomerase decreasing and the anti-cancer protein p16 increasing , which would explain why these cancer - forming cells died off in large numbers . "
The UAB research into the links between calorie intake , aging and the onset of diseases related to aging is thought to be a first of its kind given that it used the unique approach of testing human cells versus laboratory animals .
" Our results not only support previous findings from the feeding of animals but also reveal that human longevity can be achieved at the cellular level through caloric restriction , " Tollefsbol said .
" The hope is that this UAB breakthrough will lead to further discoveries in different cell types and facilitate the development of novel approaches to extend the lifespan of humans , " he added .
Tollefsbol 's research team included Yuanyuan Li , Ph.D. , M.D. , a UAB biology research associate , and Liang Liu , Ph.D. , a UAB assistant professor of medicine .
The group 's study has been published in the online edition of The Journal of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology ( FASEB Journal ) .
The research was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Glenn Foundation for Medical Research .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - AT&T Inc is suing Verizon Wireless in an effort to stop its bigger mobile rival from using “ misleading ” coverage maps in advertisements that AT&T says are causing it to lose “ incalculable market share . ”
According to the lawsuit which AT&T filed in Atlanta federal court , a recently launched ad campaign shows maps with white spaces that mislead consumers into thinking AT&T has no network coverage outside of areas where it offers high - speed mobile services , known as third - generation or 3G .
But AT&T argued that its customers can “ fully use their wireless devices outside of a ‘ 3 G ’ coverage area and undisputedly have coverage in areas depicted by white or blank spaces on the maps used in Verizon ’s advertisements . ”
It asked the court for a temporary restraining order against Verizon Wireless so its rival cannot benefit from the ads while the court sets a date for a preliminary and permanent injunction hearing .
Verizon Wireless , a venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc , said the AT&T suit was without merit .
Verizon Wireless spokeswoman Nancy Stark said the ads in question “ clearly state ” that voice and data services are available outside 3G areas .
She said the ads were intended to tell consumers about coverage for smartphones , which are used for data services .
Since most of the U.S. population already use cellphones for phone calls , operators are depending on high - speed data service offerings to attract new customers or convince existing customers to spend more money on cell services .
AT&T ’s exclusive U.S. right to sell Apple Inc ’s iPhone helped the No. 2 U.S. operator to gain market share from Verizon Wireless during the quarter ended in September .
But since then , AT&T said the ads launched by Verizon in October have caused it to lose market share .
AT&T described how the Verizon ads use maps comparing 3G coverage in the Verizon Wireless and AT&T network , using color to depict areas where each carrier has 3G and blank spaces to in areas where 3G is not available .
Because Verizon uses white spaces in its own maps for areas where it has no coverage , consumers are incorrectly interpreting the blank spaces on the AT&T maps to mean it has no wireless coverage in those areas , AT&T said .
“ Verizon has stepped over the line of legitimate comparative advertising , ” AT&T said in the lawsuit .
The case is AT&T Mobility LLC v. Cellco Partnership , U.S. District Court , Northern District of Georgia , No. 09-3057 .
An introduction and review of best practices for dealing with binary data in Ruby .
This will include examples with binary memcached , Open Sound Control , AMQP , and others .
Presentation by Brian Mitchell at RubyConf 2009 .
A 22 - year veteran kindergarten teacher in the Texas Bible Belt could lose her job for refusing , on religious grounds , to give fingerprints under a state law requiring them .
The evangelical Christian , Pam McLaurin , is fighting a looming suspension , claiming that fingerprinting amounts to the " Mark of the Beast , " and hence is a violation of her First Amendment right to practice her religion .
Her case is similar to a lawsuit by a group of Michigan farmers , some of them Amish , challenging rules requiring the tagging of livestock with RFID chips , saying the devices are also the devil 's mark .
The latest case is the first in which a teacher is refusing fingerprinting on religious grounds , the woman 's lawyer said .
The U.S. Supreme Court has yet to decide whether the First Amendment is implicated in fingerprinting , especially at a time when states , local governments and civic organizations are increasingly making them mandatory for anyone wanting to drive a car or coach a youth basketball team .
McLaurin's lawsuit against the Texas Education Agency cites various passages of Revelation , the final book of The Bible :
He causes all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on their right hand and on their foreheads , and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast , or the number of his name . …
Then a third angel followed them saying with a loud voice – if anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God . …
He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb .
Her attorney , Scott Skelton , said his client believes that the computerized fingerprinting , in which her fingerprints will be stored in a database , is the mark addressed in Revelation .
The teacher does not believe that it is merely coincidence that Revelation says only those with the ' mark on his forehead or on his hand ' will be able to buy or sell , since only those teachers who comply with fingerprinting requirements will keep their jobs , he said .
" This law prohibits the free exercise of her religion , " Skelton said in a telephone interview .
The Big Sandy Independent School District , where the woman teaches , is located about 100 miles northeast of Houston .
Wayne Haglund , the school district 's lawyer , described McLaurin is a " valued member of the faculty and one of the best teachers we have . "
" The school district 's position is fully supportive of Mrs. McLaurin , " Haglund continued in a telephone interview .
" We 're caught in the crossfire .
We believe her religious beliefs are sincerely held . "
Haglund said the Texas Education Agency informed him it would deactivate her teacher certification if she does not comply .
She has until Nov. 7 , Skelton said .
Texas lawmakers approved the fingerprinting measure in 2007 in a bid , Skelton said , " to catch somebody with a criminal background or a history of preying on children . "
" She 's willing to undergo a background check , " Skelton said , " just not fingerprinting . "

With the news that GDP grew at 3.5 % in the third quarter , it seems apparent that economic recovery is underway .
How much of this was a result of government programs ?
To evaluate this , it is important to understand what constitutes a recovery .
There are three developments needed to restore the economy to its prior vibrancy .
The first development , bank stabilization , began in late autumn of last year .
The source of the recession was financial - sector turmoil that commenced in August 2007 and peaked in ...
( CNN ) --
The suspected link between Chinese drywall and toxic effects reported by thousands of U.S. homeowners was strengthened Monday by three preliminary reports issued by the federal government .
The strongest link came from an analysis of air sampled inside dozens of homes containing drywall made in China .
" While the study of 51 homes detected hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde ... at concentrations below irritant levels , it is possible that the additive or synergistic effects of these and other compounds in the subject homes could cause irritant effects , " the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in its executive summary of the study .
Two other preliminary studies found copper sulfide corrosion in metal components taken from homes containing the Chinese drywall .
The drywall in question was imported from 2005 through 2007 , when a housing boom and two active hurricane seasons created a shortage of building materials in the southern United States .
Since then , the product safety agency has received nearly 2,100 reports from 32 states -- but mostly from Florida , Louisiana and Virginia -- of homeowners complaining of a rotten - egg smell , sickness , failed appliances , and corroded wires and pipes .
Many have moved out of their homes .
In some cases , insurers have refused to reimburse them .
The air study tested 41 houses containing Chinese drywall and compared those findings with air from inside 10 homes in the same geographical areas whose homeowners had not complained , said Jack McCarthy , president of Environmental Health & Engineering Inc. , which carried out the work .
The investigators also examined materials such as copper pipes and wiring for corrosion , and looked at indoor air humidity , temperature and air exchange , he said .
Copper and silver strips were left in the homes for two weeks and then examined for corrosion , he said .
The result : in the 41 homes containing the problem drywall , there was a " strong association " between the high levels of hydrogen sulfide and the corrosion of the metals , he said .
" Temperature , humidity and air - exchange rates also appear to be contributing factors , " McCarthy told reporters on a conference call , noting that higher moisture and temperature levels and lower air - exchange rates were connected with more corrosion .
Formaldehyde , also a potential source of irritation , was found in both complaint and noncomplaint homes , he said .
Though McCarthy cautioned that the study was not intended to examine health effects , " we can say that the levels of the pollutants we found , particularly the hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde , could possibly contribute to some of the health problems that have been reported to the CPSC . "
McCarthy also said that not all Chinese drywall may be alike .
Its risk " depends on what it is made of , not necessarily what country it 's from , " he said .
The next step is to determine how to identify homes with the corrosive materials and how to fix them , said Scott Wolfson , the product safety agency 's director of information and public affairs , who noted that the investigation is the largest in the agency 's history .
He said none of the tainted drywall entered the United States this year .
Hundreds of thousands of suspect boards have been stockpiled in warehouses ; their owners have been told it will not be sold , he added .
Several weeks ago , agency representatives traveled to China , where they visited mines , factories and government officials to determine the scope of the problem , which is still not clear , Wolfson said .
" The CPSC is working hard to determine how many homes in how many states are affected , " he said , adding that the data do not support the widely reported figure of 100,000 homes .
Wolfson said the Chinese helped investigate .
" They 're committed to helping us with the technical side of this investigation , " he said .
Though the study raises suspicions that the drywall is responsible for the health effects reported by some families , Wolfson said a causal association has not been proved .
" The work continues , " he said .
" The work toward an exact nexus between drywall and effects is still ongoing . "
Wolfson called on the news media to help alert homeowners in affected houses to report the problem .
Some may be hesitant to report because they are afraid their insurers will drop their coverage , he said , but he pointed out that the reports can be made confidentially .
" We will make sure that you are not harmed in any way by reporting to the government , " he said .
Monday 's report did not surprise Sen. Bill Nelson , D - Florida , who said the product safety commission 's chairwoman , Inez Tenenbaum , told him Monday she did not know when further testing would be completed .
" I am very disappointed with the whole process , and especially that the CDC [ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ] and EPA [ Environmental Protection Agency ] can't say whether drywall is harmful to people 's health , " he told CNN .
" Common sense says otherwise , but we still lack definitive answers . "
Joan Glickman , who moved out of her townhouse in Pompano Beach , Florida , after her wiring and air conditioning failed , said Monday 's report told her nothing new .
" It was a huge letdown because it still did n't tell me how to fix it , who 's going to fix it , how do we go about fixing it , where the money comes from , " said Glickman , who moved in with her mother .
" This has left us in such a mess . "

Willard Scott as Ronald McDonald
We now have the first three Ronald McDonald commercials in video format !
In the early 1960s , in addition to his radio work , Willard Scott played Bozo the Clown on a local children 's TV show .
Children love clowns and hamburgers , so it was only natural for Bozo the Clown to make an appearance when the first McDonald 's hamburger stand opened in Alexandria , Virginia .
Willard tells the story in his book , The Joy Of Living :
At the time , Bozo was the hottest children 's show on the air .
You could probably have sent Pluto the Dog or Dumbo the Elephant over and it would have been equally as successful .
But I was there , and I was Bozo ...
There was something about the combination of hamburgers and Bozo that was irresistable to kids ...
That 's why when Bozo went off the air a few years later , the local McDonald 's people asked me to come up with a new character to take Bozo 's place .
So , I sat down and created Ronald McDonald .
So Ronald McDonald was born , wearing a paper cup on his nose and a cardboard carry - out tray on his head .
( Notice the milk shake , hamburger , and fries on top of the tray . )
McDonald 's corporate web site credited Willard as being the first Ronald McDonald .
Unfortunately , McDonald 's chose another actor when they took the character into a nationwide ad campaign .
Willard started playing Ronald in 1963 , while the Joy Boys were going strong on WRC .
The first Ronald McDonald commercials were filmed that year , with Willard on camera , and Joy Boys partner Ed Walker doing the voice - over announcements .
We have three of those commercials here , in audio clips with still frame images .
Or , click here for video clips instead !
McDonald 's spot # 1 - meet the kids
McDonald 's spot # 2 - never talk to strangers
McDonald 's spot # 3 - to the moon , Ronald !
If 1963 does n't take you back far enough , you can listen to this clip from the Joy Boys 1961 New Year 's show ( MP3 , 275K ) in which they read a live spot for McDonald 's ... now with eight restaurants in the Washington DC area !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - More than one - fourth of U.S. households do not use traditional banking services , according to a study released by federal bank regulators on Wednesday .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp , the agency charged with protecting U.S. bank deposits , said 25.6 percent of households are “ unbanked ” or “ underbanked . ”
It said those households are largely either low - income or minority , or both .
FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said insured bank accounts provide financial security and access to credit on affordable terms .
“ By better understanding the households that make up this group -- who they are and their reasons for being unbanked or underbanked -- we will be better positioned to help them take that first step , ” she said in a statement .
Bair has championed financial literacy and education , even writing two children ’s books on the subject : “ Rock , Brock and the Savings Shock ” in 2006 and “ Isabel ’s Car Wash ” in 2008 .
The study was conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and found that about 21.7 percent of black households and 19.3 percent of Hispanic households are unbanked , while only 3.3 percent of white households and 3.5 percent of Asian households are unbanked .
Households were characterized as unbanked if no one in the household had a checking or savings account .
They were characterized as underbanked if they had a checking or savings account but relied on alternative financial services , such as non -bank money orders , non -bank check - cashing services , payday loans , or pawn shops .
Households with income under $ 30,000 account for at least 71 percent of unbanked households , the study found .
Results of the study broken down regionally can be viewed at www.economicinclusion.gov.

Seminoles helped by ' LD ' diagnoses
TALLAHASSEE , Fla . --
As the learning specialist working with the most academically challenged athletes at Florida State , Brenda Monk was confronted each year with recruits who would seem to have little chance of surviving on a college campus .
Their deficiencies were laid out in transcripts and psycho-educational reports submitted during the admissions process .
Sometimes , the athletes knew exactly what they were up against .
She recalls a conversation with one such player in her office at Doak Campbell Stadium .
" You might as well know right off the bat , I can't read , " he told her .
" Then how are we going to get through these college classes ? " she asked .
A 2001 photo of former FSU learning specialist Brenda Monk , right , with Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden and Monk 's daughter , Allison .
" It 's easy , " he responded .
" You get to read to me . "
And so she did , Monk says , spending about 20 hours a week by his side , turning classroom texts into passages to be absorbed orally , and making flash cards to improve his memory .
He qualified for the help , she says , because he was learning disabled , or LD .
To some , such arrangements are a recipe for abuse -- just the latest angle athletic departments use to get , and keep , marginal students eligible for competition .
Indeed , Monk , who was forced to resign from FSU in 2007 after six years , is accused by the NCAA of academic fraud and unethical conduct -- accusations she has asked the NCAA Division I Infractions Appeals Committee to overturn -- for allegedly doing too much work for athletes .
But as a former special education teacher and administrator who worked with the educationally disadvantaged in the Mississippi school system , the above case highlights the benefits of recognizing learning disabilities in academically at - risk athletes .
She says a diagnosis of dyslexia or some other learning disability can be the key to leveling the playing field with students who arrive on campus with superior educational backgrounds and no neurological deficits .
" It 's very difficult to overcome a reading disability , " says Monk , who was a principal , counselor and special education teacher in the Mississippi school system before joining FSU .
" It 's not something that you can just overcome .
It 's like blindness .
You can't just go in and give someone new eyes .
You can't just go in and give someone neurons that are going to connect in their brain and get rid of their learning disability . "
Certainly , the NCAA and colleges like Florida State offer an array of special services and waivers to help athletes with documented learning disabilities .
The accommodations start in high school .
With a documented learning disabled diagnosis , athletes can get relief from the NCAA in meeting its minimum academic requirements for initial eligibility .
They can apply for approval to submit SAT or ACT scores that were acquired through " non-standard " tests in which special accommodations were provided , and use high school courses for LD students to satisfy the NCAA 's core - course requirements .
Bowden has distanced himself from the violations , telling reporters , " Our university found this problem .
It 's not like I had anything to do with this . "
The NCAA granted 527 of these waivers to incoming athletes in the 2008 - 09 school year , up from 310 the year before , according to NCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn .
( There were 302 in 2006 - 07 , 335 in 2005 - 06 and 338 in 2004 - 05 . )
She said more athletes are taking advantage of those waivers because in the past two years the NCAA has raised the core - course requirements ( from 14 to 16 classes ) , and mandated that core courses be earned in the first eight semesters of high school .
If the prospective athlete still can't qualify with those adjustments in standards , the college they have signed with can apply with the NCAA for a waiver to grant eligibility anyway .
Some of these waivers provide only partial relief , meaning that an athlete might receive an athletic scholarship and can participate in practice , but may not compete in games until meeting the NCAA 's progress - toward - degree requirements at the end of his / her freshman year .
Once on campus , a learning disabled athlete can ask for an NCAA waiver that allows him or her to take less than a full course load ( 12 hours ) in a given semester .
And at Florida State , the athlete can be exempted from passing the state - mandated basic competency tests in math and English that all at - risk college students must take before their junior year .
" A good number of athletes come through the waiver system , " says Jennifer Buchanan , chair of the CLAST ( College Level Academic Skills Test ) Waiver Committee at FSU .
Beyond that , some learning disabled athletes drink from a fire hose of course assistance .
At Florida State , classroom accommodations , such as note - takers and untimed tests , are dispensed by the campus disability center that is available to all students .
But athletes also have the resources of a $ 1.5 million - a- year athletic academic support unit with 32 computers , private tutoring rooms and a five - station " Learning Center " for athletes with learning disabilities or deficiencies .
That 's where Monk set up camp , working on papers and other assignments with what she estimates were about 65 learning disabled athletes .
She tells " Outside the Lines " that more than a third of the football team , and three - quarters of the basketball team , had learning disabilities .
FSU spokesman Rob Wilson did not respond to requests by " Outside the Lines " for information on the number of learning disabled athletes who were in the program when Monk left .
By comparison , experts estimate that 5 to 10 percent of the general adult population has a learning disability .
Fred Rouse , a former Seminoles receiver , attributes the prevalence of learning disabled athletes to an awareness of the resources available to those with such a diagnosis .
He says some players are just lazy and looking for someone else to do their academic work .
Former FSU receiver Fred Rouse says some athletes are just looking for someone else to do their academic work .
" I think it 's bull ---- , " says Rouse , who started as a freshman in 2006 .
" You [ as a high school athlete ] have all of this time to prepare [ academically ] before you get to this level , and then when you get here , you play this punk role as , you know , ' I have a learning disability , ' when that 's not the case . "
Some athletes arrived in Tallahassee with such a diagnosis , from psycho-educational evaluations conducted when they were in high school or earlier .
Others , as many as 20 per year who were identified as academically at - risk , were referred by Monk after they arrived on campus to Casey Schmidt , a licensed psychologist based in Tallahassee .
Schmidt evaluates these athletes for learning disabilities and is paid $ 800 by the athletic department for each test .
About 80 percent of the FSU athletes sent to him receive a learning disabled diagnosis , says Schmidt , who was hired after Monk arrived on campus .
Schmidt said " people are n't sophisticated enough " to tank his tests , which are cross- referenced and take the better part of a day to complete .
But he concedes that he is surprised at the high rate of learning disabilities in the FSU athlete population he has evaluated .
" That 's a question mark I do n't know how to rectify , " he said .
One possible explanation is the assessment tool he uses .
It 's known as the " simple discrepancy " model , which looks for an imbalance between a person 's IQ and educational achievement level .
The FSU athletes he 's evaluated , he said , often have normal or advanced IQs , but poor academic skills .
In his estimation , any college student with less than a ninth - grade reading or math level is a strong candidate to meet the criteria for a learning disabled diagnosis .
NCAA : Mixed Messages " Outside the Lines " and ESPN.com present a monthlong series starting this weekend that examines several hot - button issues facing the NCAA .
This Sunday , Dec. 13 , the series looks at Florida State University , where 61 athletes allegedly were involved in an academic - fraud scandal that included , in some cases , access to test answers and tutors who edited and typed papers .
The NCAA ruled Florida State guilty of major violations , announcing it would reduce scholarships in football and other sports , and force Bobby Bowden 's team to vacate as many as 14 victories from 2006 and 2007 .
Watch Tom Farrey 's report on " Outside the Lines " at 9 a.m. ET Sunday on ESPN .
ESPN.com 's companion series begins with an examination by investigative reporter Mike Fish of the worth to a university of top college football players such as Tim Tebow , Colt McCoy and Sam Bradford , and a database showing how much money flows into each of the 120 Football Bowl Subdivision college athletic departments and how it is spent .
• OTL : Making Paper : More Than Just a Scholarship
• OTL : Financial Impacts of Tebow , McCoy and Bradford
• OTL : The Money that Moves College Sports
Schmidt gives them an additional , cognitive test to minimize the rate of false positives , he said .
Still , the simple discrepancy method has been criticized by some experts as unreliable .
A 2003 study by Florida State researchers Briley Proctor and Frances Prevatt found that that model " diagnosed significantly more students with LD than the other three [ established ] models . "
In fact , in testing of the same set of students , the simple discrepancy model produced a learning disabled diagnosis 46.5 percent of the time , nearly twice the rate of the most conservative model .
Based on their research , Proctor and Prevatt adopted a new model in 2006 for the LD assessments done at the FSU campus facility they run , the Adult Learning Evaluation Center , which is available to all students .
The athletic department continues to refer athletes off campus to Schmidt , and his diagnoses are accepted by various campus groups that process waivers and provide LD services .
They are required to , by laws prohibiting discrimination against the disabled .
" There 's no universally agreed upon way to do these tests , " Schmidt said .
That 's especially true at the college level , experts say .
Most of the regulation in the area of learning disabilities occurs at the K - 12 level , because that 's when students typically get evaluated for learning disabilities .
( Beginning in July 2010 , for instance , the state of Florida will move to a new model , forcing schools to attempt to re-mediate a student 's difficulties with regular services before labeling them as learning disabled . )
At universities across the country , set standards for evaluations are rare -- and the NCAA provides no oversight .
Recognizing an opportunity , the Seminoles hired Monk in 2001 to work with these athletes .
" Florida State could n't be left behind , " she said .
" I think they recognized the fact that there were a lot of very talented student - athletes who were maybe reluctant learners or who struggled in the classroom who were not maybe academically as prepared to come to college as they should be .
And so they were looking at that population -- how do we let this talent go by ?
Is there some way that we can have both ?
Can we have the talent and can we also provide them with some kind of help so that they can remain academically eligible while they are in school ? "
Monk received a glowing review in her first year on the job .
As she experienced more and more success keeping at - risk athletes eligible , she says she became a tool of recruiting , with coaches and parents asking her to work with athletes with increasingly severe learning disabilities .
That 's when she made what she calls an error in judgment , asking one basketball player in 2007 to input the answers to an online sports psychology test for a teammate who left a hard copy of the test on her desk .
" I was exhausted , totally exhausted , " she said .
" I was n't thinking clearly and made an error . "
That led to a Florida State and NCAA investigation that found improprieties in the athletic academic support program .
An academic adviser was implicated for telling a tutor to provide answers to exam questions in an online music course .
The tutor helped 55 athletes receive fraudulent academic credit by supplying answers to that test .
Monk was accused by the NCAA of creating the study guide for that test , and for providing improper typing assistance on her computer for at least three athletes .
She denies that she typed papers , characterizing her role as editing their work , which she says was appropriate given the needs of some academically deficient athletes .
" There was an atmosphere in athletics , particularly academic support , that was unacceptable , " FSU president T.K. Wetherell said in an NCAA hearing in 2008 .
Wetherell had played college football under Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden , and was an athletics academic adviser early in his career .
Both he and Bowden declined to speak to " Outside the Lines . "
Until her departure in 2007 , Monk worked with Florida State 's most academically challenged student - athletes .
No NCAA - wide survey has been conducted on the prevalence of athletes with learning disabilities , said Corrine Corte , chair of the learning committee of the National Association of Athletic Academic Advisors .
At Arizona State , where she is a learning specialist , she said less than 10 percent of football and basketball players are learning disabled .
So , being proactive about athletes ' learning difficulties does not have to be a recipe for abuse , Corte said .
At the same time , she said she is talking with the NCAA about drawing up rules for what constitutes acceptable support when working with these athletes .
FSU officials told the NCAA that Monk was not permitted to provide some of the accommodations she was supplying , a charge Monk denies .
She said that offering such support was part of her job description , and her manager , as well as officials at the campus disability office , knew how she was working with them .
" She 's a wonderful person , " said Rouse , who did n't have a learning disability but worked with Monk in study halls .
" Very , very nice lady .
I think it came to a point where it was almost forced on her also to make sure these guys were passing .
And in the end , she ended up getting fired . "
But not before Monk felt like she made a difference in some players ' lives .
She looks back to the player who announced at their introduction that he could n't read , and so she would need to read to him .
She says she arranged for him to work with the most helpful tutors , and drilled with him constantly on memorization and other basic academic skills .
A lot of times , she says , he would be " lying on the floor , " spent from all that brainwork .
Eventually , he received a degree in sports administration from Florida State .
" And it was not something anyone did for him , " says Monk , now a principal at a prison school in Lake City , Fla .
" He did it for himself , taking advantage of all of situations .
If you would have looked at his paperwork before you ever met him , you would have said , there 's no way "
No way , that is , that someone with a grade - school reading level could graduate from a college where the average entering freshman was an honors student in high school .
" I said there was no way , " Monk said .
" He proved me wrong . "

UK trade deficit widens as imports climb
Britain 's goods trade deficit with the rest of the world widened unexpectedly in October to its biggest since January as imports rose more than exports despite the weakness of the pound , official data showed on Wednesday .
My son
Joe shocked us all at breakfast the other morning by asking us what kilts , bagpipes , porridge , whisky , tartan and haggis have in common , and then announcing that none of them originated in Scotland .
Apparently , kilts came from Ireland , bagpipes from central Asia , porridge from Scandinavia , whisky from China , tartan from England and haggis from ancient Greece – indeed Aristophanes wrote about an exploding haggis in The Clouds , 420 years BC .
At least Joe did n't totally wreck our illusions by adding Irn Bru and Kirsty Wark to the list .
That would have been too much to take .
As it was , it took me a while to come to terms with the news about haggis .
I 'm a big fan of haggis , even in the form in which it was dished up when I lived in a student hall of residence in Scotland ; dumped unceremoniously onto the plate from an ice - cream scoop by a bad - tempered cook with a ginger beard and a scarred nose , the legacy , we were told , of a bottle fight in a pub .
Morag , she was called .
Anyway , whether haggis originated in Scotland or not , I was delighted to find it being reinvented in the kitchens of a Herefordshire pub last week .
One of the starters at The Butchers Arms in Woolhope was haggis fritters with beetroot relish , which might not sound like something likely to seduce your taste buds , yet sent mine into raptures .
Morag and Aristophanes , not a pair I ever expected to unite in the same sentence , would have been astonished .

We went to The Butchers Arms because it is run by Stephen Bull , who is not as famous as Gordon and Marco and Heston , but in his less limelight - hogging way has been just as influential on modern British cooking .
He ran another Herefordshire pub called the Lough Pool Inn for some years , and we kept meaning to go but never did .
The Butchers Arms is a new venture , and one that deserves the attention of every national newspaper restaurant critic , if they can just force their way west of Sloane Square .
For the record , Jane 's starter was oxtail terrine with pear chutney , which she followed with roast breast of Chepstow duck with elderberry jelly and vinegar lentils .
My main course was eight - hour slow - roast lamb shoulder with chickpea puree .
Never have two more satisfied diners farted their way home .
And let me mention the puddings : geranium panna cotta for Jane , and quince tarte tatin with vanilla ice - cream for me .
Even by the ever - rising standards of pub food in rural Herefordshire , it was sublime .
Moreover , the starters are all £ 5.50 , the puds £ 5.25 , and the mains around £ 12.50 .
Bull did not get where he is today by attaching unreasonable prices to his marvellous cooking .
But how did he get to where he is today ?
Afterwards , we managed to grab a cosy fireside chat with him , and he told us his inspiring tale , that he worked in the advertising business , with Peter Mayle , until the fateful day in 1973 that , on a visit to northern Italy , he tasted risotto Milanese with white truffle grated over it .
That was his Damascene moment .
He came back to Britain and taught himself to cook by reading Julia Child 's seminal book Mastering The Art of French Cooking , in vogue again thanks to the film Julie & Julia , starring Meryl Streep .
Meanwhile he got a job as a waiter , working for mad Peter Langan .
Eventually , he set up his own restaurant in London , called simply Stephen Bull .
Jane and I went there once before we were married , and while I could n't in all honesty recall to him what we ate , at least we 've been together ever since .
He left London for Herefordshire nine years ago and plainly loves it out here , as we all do , although he has a splendid fund of nightmare - customer stories .
Once , at the Lough Pool Inn , a diner in a party of 10 found a tiny lettuce - coloured caterpillar , about the size of a little fingernail , on her salad .
They all promptly got up and left – without paying .
" And the thing is that I 'm scrupulous about washing my salad leaves , " he said , still indignant after all these years .
" At least it had n't been sitting in a chlorine bath to kill everything , which is what some places do .
The caterpillar just got through the net . "
Which reminds me of the time a fellow student found a severed mouse 's head in Morag 's treacle pudding and custard , but that 's another story .
In an international first , scientists from the Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information ( IQOQI ) produced a Bose - Einstein condensate of the alkaline - earth element strontium , thus narrowly winning an international competition between many first - rate scientific groups .
Choosing the isotope 84Sr , which has received little attention so far , proved to be the right choice for the breakthrough .
It can now be regarded as an ideal candidate for future experiments with atomic two - electron systems .
This is not the first time that Prof.
Rudolf Grimm and his scientific team have won a tightly contested race between scientists : in 2002 , they were the first to produce a Bose - Einstein condensate of cesium atoms .
Now junior scientist Dr. Florian Schreck and his team obtained the first Bose - Einstein condensate of strontium atoms , thus winning a tight international race despite having started their experiment much later than their competitors in the U.S.A .
" We backed the right horse and , towards the end , worked day and night to realize this Bose - Einstein condensate , " says Dr. Schreck .
For years physicists from all over the world have tried to condense atomic strontium , focusing mainly on the two strontium isotopes that are relatively abundant in nature ( 86Sr , 88 Sr ) .
But the breakthrough came when Dr. Schrecks ' team decided to try a new , almost counterintuitive approach .
" A year ago I had the idea to try it with the isotope 84 Sr which has a low natural abundance , " recounts Dr. Schreck concerning the moment of breakthrough .
Never considered before because of its ' low natural abundance , new theoretical calculations soon showed that this neglected isotope had an ideal scattering length for producing a Bose - Einstein Condensate as compared to the other , more abundant , isotopes .
Condensation of Strontium
As an initial step , strontium atoms were collected in a magnetic trap and cooled using laser cooling and trapping techniques that were refined in IQOQI .
In order to isolate these atoms from undesired interactions with the environment , the experiment was performed in an ultra - high vacuum chamber .
After loading the atoms into an optical trap , they were cooled to near absolute zero ( - 273.15 ºC ) by evaporative cooling techniques made possible due to the excellent scattering properties of this particular isotope - the atoms collide and thermalize without being lost due to molecule formation .
This was the crucial step that was not possible with the other strontium isotopes .
In this manner , a Bose - Einstein Condensate of 150,000 atoms was produced .
This new form of matter is a purely quantum phenomena where the atoms lose their individual identities and coalesce into a single , collective state .
The scientists of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information ( IQOQI ) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences ( ÖAW ) have now succeeded in doing with strontium what other scientists have done with other chemical elements .
Only two weeks after the success of the Innsbruck team , a research group from the U.S. also achieved Bose - Einstein condensation of strontium atoms .
Both research results are now published in the same issue of the journal Physical Review Letters .
Hot Scientific Topic
Strontium belongs to the atomic two - electron systems ; these are elements whose atoms have two valence electrons .
Most of the atoms with one valence electron have already been successfully condensed ( the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for this achievement in 2001 ) , making Bose - Einstein condensation of two - electron systems a new hot topic in the field of physics .
Although ytterbium ( 2003 ) and calcium ( June 2009 ) were the first two - electron systems to be condensed , it is with strontium that significantly large Bose - Einstein Condensates have been produced .
With Bose - Einstein condensates research in fundamental quantum mechanics can be carried out ; these include developing new schemes for quantum computation , modeling condensed matter systems , and performing precision measurements of forces on the micrometer scale , which still pose many challenges to physicists today .
" The opportunities we have at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information ( IQOQI ) are a crucial factor in our success , " underlines Rudolf Grimm .
" We had a free hand in trying something totally new and , thus , were able to enter this international race . "
But Dr. Schreck and his team are not stopping there .
They have already started working on a new exciting direction ; besides the three bosonic isotopes of strontium mentioned above , there is a fermionic isotope , 87Sr , which Dr. Schreck intends to use to produce the first ultracold Fermi gas of strontium atoms .

How does it feel to have health insurance contributions deducted from your paycheck , then find out you did n't actually have insurance , and now are expected to pay thousands in medical bills ?
Ask employees of Turbine Airfoil Designs Inc. in Harrisburg , Dauphin County .
TAD stopped paying toward its Capital BlueCross group plan in October .
TAD employees said they did n't know that .
For five months , their believed coverage remained in effect .
Or so it seemed , since their insurance cards remained valid .
In March , Capital sent TAD employees letters saying their coverage had been canceled retroactively to Oct.
9 . Now some TAD employees face five months ' worth of medical bills .
Some have bills totaling $ 10,000 or more .
State agencies are investigating .
" I have collectors calling here pretty much on a daily basis , " said Jason Beachler , 39 , of McAlisterville .
He said he has $ 3,000 in bills from incidents including an emergency room visit after his wife got glass in her eye .
Gary Murdock of Monroe Township has $ 12,000 in bills stemming from medical care for this two children .
" I was paying for family coverage ... $ 200 plus per month .
Where is the money at ? , " said Murdock , 33 .
TAD , on North Cameron Street in Harrisburg , makes parts used in airplane engines .
John Walton , the Dallas - based CEO of TAD , acknowledged the lapsed coverage .
He also said TAD managers never expected health benefits to end , and he maintains Capital should not have terminated coverage .
He said TAD missed the payments because of the recession , and because it has been in desperate financial straits since late last year .
When asked who is responsible for the medical bills , Walton said TAD is responsible .
Meanwhile , TAD has laid off workers and is struggling to stay alive .
Capital BlueCross spokesman Joe Butera said Capital followed the rules in notifying TAD employees of the termination .
He said Capital spent several months trying to work with TAD to bring payments up to date and preserve coverage .
It reached the point where continuing to carry TAD would have been unfair to paying customers , he said .
Butera further said it was TAD 's responsibility to inform workers of the payment situation and possible loss of coverage .
The state Attorney General 's health care section is focusing on " the retroactive nature " of the coverage cancellation , said Nils Frederiksen , a spokesman .
On Thursday , he said it was too early to say if any laws may have been broken , and who is legally responsible for the bills .
But he said TAD employees should n't get stuck with them .
The state Insurance Department also is investigating .
The Attorney General 's health care section says affected TAD employees may call 717-705-6938 or 877-888-4877 during normal business hours .

Urban legends are often told as true accounts that happened to a ‘ friend of a friend , ’ and serve as mere cautionary tales told around a camp fire , or on a stormy night .
However , some urban legends prey on our deepest fears , and are quickly spread by word of mouth and other media , propagating a sense of anxiety and insecurity , intended to incite reactions .
The following urban legends transcended schoolyards and message boards , and found their way into talk shows and news outlets , causing a variety of emotions , while portraying a depraved and decadent society that is further being threaten and that must be protected .
10 Rainbow Parties
A rainbow party is a type of sexual party , said to be popular among adolescents , in which girls wearing different shades of lipstick take turns performing oral sex on the males attending the party , leaving an array of colors on their penises which vaguely resembles a rainbow .
This urban legend was publicized on several talk shows and publications , leading parents to believe that rainbow parties were not only factual , but also rampant among teenagers .
However , apart from questionable testimonials , little evidence exists that rainbow parties are real , and sex researchers , as well adolescent health care professionals , believe the practice to be inexistent and nothing more than the cause of a moral panic .

9 Vodka -Soaked Tampons
The rumor that both women , and men , are inserting vodka - soaked tampons into their vagina and anus respectively , as a new way to get drunk , quickly reached the status of an urban legend through the media coverage that it received , alarming parents about the dangerous practice prevalent among teens .
Getting drunk via a vodka - soaked tampon purports several benefits , such as helping fool breathalyzer tests by eliminating alcohol breath , providing a quicker way to get drunk by speeding alcohol into the bloodstream , and preventing vomiting caused by intoxication ; all of which seem credible .
However , all these claims , except for getting people drunk faster by only a matter of minutes , have been proven to be false , leading to the question of why would anyone want to ingest alcohol in such a manner , and dismissing the story as a false urban legend .
8 Snuff Films
Said to portray the actual death or murder of those being filmed , snuff films continue to cause a tremendous stir by playing to people ’s emotions , and by relying on their plausibility .
While some people sustain that various snuff films have been distributed commercially , police investigations by various law enforcement agencies , including the FBI , have revealed that no snuff films have been produced , and that no market exists for such type of films , undermining the claims that snuff films are made for financial gain .
While some deaths and murders have been caught on camera , such as suicides , and executions of death row inmates , none of them have been explicitly recorded for the purpose of entertainment or profit .
7 The Kidney Heist
The story goes that a well organized , well funded , crime ring , with very skilled personnel is drugging travelers and surgically removing one of their kidneys , leaving the victims to wake up submerged to their neck in a bathtub full of ice .
This urban legend has been associated with numerous major U.S. cities , from Las Vegas to Houston , from Houston to the City of New Orleans , in which caused quite a commotion on the days prior to Mardi Gras , prompting the New Orleans Police Department to issue an official statement declaring the allegations of kidney theft as “ completely without merit and without foundation . ”
The National Kidney Foundation also took part in the fight to dispel the credibility of the legend , by asking individuals who claim to have been victims of kidney theft to contact them , so far no one has .
6 Jenkem
A drug made by fermenting raw sewage that causes a euphoric high followed by strong hallucinations , when its gases are inhaled .
Jenkem took the world by storm , fooling several news outlets , including the Washington Post , that reported the drug as a new popular form to get high among American teenagers , and appealed to it gross factor by calling it “ the human waste drug ” and “ butthash . ”
The media frenzy was sparked by an intelligence bulletin published by the Collier County Sheriff ’s Office , which cited Jenkem as “ a popular drug in American schools . ”
However , the information contained in the bulletin came from a source that later dismissed it as a hoax , and the belief that Jenkem was a new popular drug was based on nothing but gossip .
5 Wal - Mart Gang Initiations
By addressing the issue of gangs , rumors that gang initiates were required to kill children or women at a Wal - Mart , as part of the initiation process , caused widespread panic and flooded police phone lines .
The rumors portrayed those most vulnerable , children and women , as being at risk , and spread quickly through text messages and media coverage .
Many people avoided shopping at Wal - Mart on the days following the surge of the rumor , failing to notice that it bore some similarities to another false urban legend in which gang initiates would kill unsuspecting drivers that flashed their headlights at them .
The Wal - Mart gang initiations were said to take place in stores across the U.S. and even in the province of Alberta , Canada .
Police departments in several states were quickly to reassure concerned callers , and issued statements declaring the rumors as “ not credible , ” “ hoaxes , ” and as “ urban legends . ”
4 Pin Prick Attacks
The hypothetical attacks involved injecting blood tainted with AIDS into unsuspecting targets , at movie theaters , raves , and night clubs .
The unwary victim would feel a slight prick on their arm , and later discover a note attached to their clothes carrying the message ‘ Welcome to the world of AIDS . ’
Variations of the urban legend quickly spread through email , and some claimed to be a warning being circulated by the Dallas Police Department , which later declared the attacks as false , and not happening .
Although attacks have been carried out by using syringes as weapons , in none of the attacks were the syringes contaminated with HIV or AIDS ; except for one isolated event in Australia , in which an inmate at Sydney ’s Long Bay Jail managed to jab a guard with a syringe filled with HIV - positive blood and a case in New Zealand in which a man intentionally infected his wife with a syringe of his blood .
Prison guard , Gary Pearce , contracted the disease and died , despite the 1 in 200 chance of infection .
The motive behind this urban legend was to frighten people and to keep them from visiting leisure establishments , by playing on the public fear of AIDS .
3 Sex Bracelets
According to the legend , gel bracelets , also known as jelly bracelets , or ‘ awareness bracelets , ’ are being used by teenagers as a sexual code to indicate their willingness to participate in different acts , which range from hugging and kissing , to oral sex and intercourse .
The acts are determined by the bracelet ’s color , and if a boy snaps a girl ’s bracelet off her wrist , he is awarded a ‘ sexual coupon , ’ which can be exchanged for the act that corresponds to the color of the bracelet .
Several schools banned the bracelets as a response to the rumors of the bracelets ’ hidden meaning , which in turn lead news outlets to believe that the rumors were in fact true , citing the banning of the bracelets as proof positive .
Alarmed parents expressed shock and disbelief , ignoring the fact that gel bracelets served only as a fashion accessory , and that the urban legend of the bracelets being used as ‘ sexual coupons ’ was nothing more than wishful thinking on part of the adolescents .
2 Blue Star Tattoos
Playing on parents ’ fears , and on society ’s instinct to protect those who are most vulnerable , the blue star tattoos legend takes the form of a warning declaring that LSD laced rub - on tattoos are being distributed to children to get them addicted at an early age .
The ‘ warning ’ has been attributed to several health institutions and police departments .
Despite the fact that the information contained in the warning regarding the effects of LSD is inaccurate , and that LSD is not an addictive drug , the blue star tattoo legend continues to fool and alarm , parents , journalists , and school administrators .
The legend resurfaces from time to time , bringing with it a familiar wave of panic and concern , regardless of the fact that no documented cases of actual LSD distribution to children exist .
1 Poisoned Candy
By far the most popular urban legend on this list , and the most widely believed to be true .
Retold each year on the days previous to Halloween , it manages to instill unease , by casting doubt on the integrity of others .
Rumors that unscrupulous people are handing out poisoned candy to unsuspicious children on Halloween , have become a staple of urban legend lore , due in part to the horrifying nature of the act , and to the mass media coverage that false claims of poisoned Halloween treats received .
No evidence and no documented cases exist , that tampered candy is being randomly and knowingly distributed to children while trick - or - treating with the intent to harm or possibly kill .
In one case of premeditated murder , however , a cyanide - laced Pixie Stix was given to a child by his father with the intention of killing him , and collecting the insurance money .
Attempts at debunking this urban legend have n’t been able to put it to a rest , and as with all other urban legends on this list , it continues to be passed off as true , causing a moral panic despite its obvious falsity and blatant sensationalism .
Here 's my theory .
God has narcissistic personality disorder .
Stay with me as I indulge in two of my favourite pastimes : illuminating monotheistic religion 's exploitation of the human desire to feel safe , loved and special ; and my constant need to question and expose maladaptive behaviour .
Let 's pathologise !
Here 's the deal : tick five in the diagnostic criteria and we have an NPD winner !
?
Feelings of grandiosity and self - importance ( I am God ) ; exaggerating accomplishments ( I made you and the world ) to the point of lying ( I exist and there is a heaven ) ; demands to be recognised as superior without commensurate achievements ( Worship me and only me because I am great and almighty and I know everything ) .
?
Obsession with fantasies of success , power , brilliance , beauty or perfect love ( I will love you , you will love me and we will live happily in eternity ) .
?
Conviction you are unique and special ( I am almighty .
I am the one and only God ) .
The Royal Mail looks after post code data files
The government is planning to give anyone free access to postcode data .
The move will be made as part of its commitment to make more use of technology and the web to transform official services .
Currently organisations that want access to datasets that tie postcodes to physical locations cannot do so without incurring a charge .
Following a brief consultation , the postcode information is set to be freed in April 2010 .
The announcement about releasing postcode data came as part of a much wider plan to use technology as part of the Smarter Government strategy .
As part of this push , the government said it would start " consulting on making Ordnance Survey mapping and postcode datasets available for free reuse from April 2010 . "
A spokesman for the Ordnance Survey said the consultation would begin before Christmas 2009 .
" It 's a chance for anyone who has views on what can be given away to make those views known , " he said .
" It 's more a question of how not if , " he said .
" It 's something that 's going to be happening . "
The dataset that is likely to be freed is that which ties postcodes to geographic locations .
Many more commercial organisations use the Postcode Address File ( PAF ) that ties post codes to addresses .
Currently access to either data set incurs a charge .
In October 2009 the Royal Mail took legal action that cut off the access many websites had to such data .
Sites that used the postcode feed included Job Centre Pro Plus , HealthWare ( locates nearby pharmacies and hospitals ) , Planning alerts.com ( monitors planning applications ) , Straight Choice ( finds out who sent political leaflets ) .
Services online Harry Metcalfe , who helped sites get at postcode data , said he was " cautiously optimistic " about the decision to open up the OS data sets .
" If the right data is released in the right way , this will be a positive development , " he said .
Also included in the Smarter Government announced by Gordon Brown was the intention to get the " majority " of government services online in the next five years .
It also pledged a further £ 30 m cash injection for UK Online Centres to help another million Britons get to grips with the web for the first time .

The big story on this slow news day is the NYT ’s 3000 - word story on Goldman and synthetic CDOs , which now has a formal response from Goldman itself .
Here ’s what I think is the most interesting new information in the story :
Beginning in 2004 , with housing prices soaring and the mortgage mania in full swing , Mr. Egol began creating the deals known as Abacus .
From 2004 to 2008 , Goldman issued 25 Abacus deals , according to Bloomberg , with a total value of $ 10.9 billion …
Rather than persuading his customers to make negative bets on Abacus , Mr. Egol kept most of these wagers for his firm , said five former Goldman employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
On occasion , he allowed some hedge funds to take some of the short trades …
Goldman ’s bets against the performances of the Abacus C.D.O. ’s were not worth much in 2005 and 2006 , but they soared in value in 2007 and 2008 when the mortgage market collapsed .
The trades gave Mr. Egol a higher profile at the bank , and he was among a group promoted to managing director on Oct. 24 , 2007 .
There are a couple of things which jump out , here : firstly that Goldman was structuring synthetic mortgage - backed CDOs as early as 2004 , and secondly that it held on to the short side of those deals for years .
Remember that by their nature , synthetic CDOs have equal - and - opposite long sides and short sides .
Anybody buying these things from Goldman knew that someone else was betting the opposite way .
And they knew that someone was Goldman , at least in the first instance .
Over 2004 , 2005 , and 2006 , and even into the first half of 2007 , demand for mortgage - backed credit assets was insatiable .
That ’s why so many originators started churning out low - quality paper , and that ’s why Goldman got into the origination business too , both on the real - money side ( although it was never a huge player there ) and on the synthetic side .
Goldman ’s synthetic CDOs involved it paying millions of dollars in insurance premiums every year to the investors who bought them .
Because of the balance of power between buyers and sellers of credit during the boom , the people buying bonds had very little bargaining power , and the people issuing debt had a lot .
As a result , private - equity shops were able to issue billions of dollars in cov-lite loans , and the likes of Goldman Sachs were able to put all manner of triggers into their CDOs — things like ratings downgrades — which would stop the money flowing from Goldman to the buyers , and start sending money flowing back in the opposite direction .
Goldman was certainly in a good position here .
It had a substantial portfolio of mortgage - backed securities — so substantial , in fact , that it wrote down $ 1.7 billion on its residential - mortgage exposure in 2008 .
As a result , it had a lot of appetite for hedges against those securities , and happily held on to those hedges in 2004 - 7 when they were losing , rather than making , money .
It liked holding the position because it had structured the hedges itself , and knew exactly how profitable they might be if and when the housing market turned .
But does that mean , as the NYT article says , that Goldman ’s decision to take the short side of the CDOs “ put the firms at odds with their own clients ’ interests ” ?
No , it does n’t .
In fact , I ’m a bit depressed that we ’re still having this argument , a full two years after everybody derided Ben Stein for saying the same thing .
I may as well simply disinter what I wrote back then :
If I sell you something – whether it ’s a car or a house or a stock or a ham sandwich – I have no fiduciary responsibility to you .
Caveat emptor , and all that .
If I am investing your money on your behalf , then I have a fiduciary duty .
But if you ’re looking for fiduciaries , you ’re not going to find them on the sell side , only on the buy side .
When Stein accuses Wall Street banks of “ betraying their clients ’ trust , ” he ’s simply confused about who the clients are , in these transactions .
If I ’m an investor and I buy a stock from a broker , then I ’m buying it because I think the total amount of money I ’m paying is a fair amount for that security .
I ’m completely agnostic about whom , exactly , I ’m buying the stock from : if a different broker has the same security for a lower price , I ’ll go there instead .
And I ’m certainly not trusting the broker to assure me that my security will go up rather than down in value .
In fact , at the margin I actually like it if my broker is shorting that stock and thinks it will go down in value – because that just means that I get to buy it at a slightly cheaper level .
It ’s just ridiculous to think that “ basic fairness ” means that Goldman should be exposed to exactly the same risks as anybody who it sells securities to .
Goldman Sachs is n’t Berkshire Hathaway , investing money on behalf of shareholders .
It ’s an investment bank : an intermediary between issuers and investors .
If an investor buys any kind of financial security , he ’s deliberately buying a risk product .
He gets all the upside if that security rises in value .
But he also gets all the downside if that security falls in value .
It ’s not the job of any securities firm to bail him out .
The 30,000 - foot view of what happened here is that there was an enormous amount of mortgage paper flooding the market over the course of the 2000s .
Goldman Sachs , as a sell - side institution which manages its risk book on a daily basis and does n’t want to take long - term directional bets , hedged its mortgage exposure with short positions it created by structuring synthetic CDOs .
The buy - side , by contrast , had an enormous amount of appetite for long positions in mortgages , and it was the job of banks like Goldman to feed that appetite : again by structuring synthetic CDOs .
Goldman was killing two birds with one stone : no wonder Jonathan Egol , who was in charge of these deals , did so well there .
When the mortgage market started to turn , Goldman was smart and nimble enough to realize that it could make money on the way down as well as on the way up .
That ’s what traders do , and Goldman is the world ’s largest and most successful trading shop .
Henry Blodget adds another important point :
Do n’t forget that everything is obvious in hindsight .
Goldman could have been wrong about the housing market , and its clients could have been right .
In that case , we would n’t be talking about a scandal .
We would be talking about how Goldman got greedy and made dumb bets .
The real lesson here is n’t that Goldman did anything scandalous .
It ’s just that if you ’re making a bet and Goldman is your bookmaker , do n’t be surprised if you end up losing .
Last summer Aftonbladet , a Swedish newspaper , printed allegations that Israeli soldiers had taken organs from Palestinian youths they had killed , putting the tissue on the transplant market .
An Israeli official called the story anti-Semitic " hate porn , " and Haaretz denounced it .
Today the AP reports that an Israeli official has admitted that state forensic pathologists harvested organs .
The news caused Bruce Wolman to send an email [ 1 ] to Haaretz reporter Barak Ravid and Haaretz columnist Tom Segev , and to dig out an email [ 2 ] he sent the men last summer .
1. Barak and Tom ,
Neither one of you would give any credence to these accusations of organ - harvesting by Israel during the Aftonbladet incident back in August .
I suggested to both of you in an email that this was an issue Ha’aretz should investigate , not deny as ridiculous or insane .
My email received no response .
It seems Ha’aretz ’s journalism on this story reached the same levels as Aftonbladet ’s : Insufficient actual investigating and reporting .
When is the Israeli Foreign Minister going to apologize to the Swedish government ?
Sincerely ,
Bruce Wolman

To : [ Barak Ravid and Tom Segev ]
Barak Ravid and / or Tom Segev ,
I ’ve noticed that the Aftonbladet story is off the front pages in both Sweden and Israel today .
It seems PM Netanyahu is busy for the moment setting the Brits and Americans straight on settlements and Jerusalem .
After surveying last week ’s diplomatic fireworks , it was my conclusion that the Israeli press should investigate and disprove the charges in the Boström article , much as the Norwegian press acted earlier this year when the Jerusalem Post wrote a series of false articles claiming anti-Semitism in Norway .
However , I see that Ha’aretz in an editorial has already concluded that the Swedish article is an outrageous slander not worthy of investigation .
Donald Bostrom , a veteran Swedish journalist , wrote a despicable , utterly baseless article for the tabloid newspaper Aftonbladet last week , claiming that Israel harvests the organs of Palestinians it has kidnapped or killed .
The country ’s excoriation was a testament to poor and unprofessional journalism , and to the low point Israel ’s standing has reached in Europe .
The demands of both the correspondent and his newspaper that Israel investigate the charges are also baseless – not every bit of outrageous slander is worthy of investigation .
My question to Ha’aretz :
Is this conclusion based on your own investigations and knowledge , or is it based on your belief that no element of the IDF is or was capable of engaging in such activities ?
To whom at Ha’aretz might I address this question ?
I can understand that a claim such as Jews need the blood of Jewish children to make matzohs is such an outrageous slander that to investigate such a charge would be ridiculous , as nobody has ever seen a Jew making matzoh out of blood .
But there is plenty of evidence that a number of Israelis have been involved in organ trafficking scandals through the years , and that the Israeli medical system itself has supported the purchase of organs .
Is it really impossible to believe that certain elements of the IDF might have trafficked in organs at some point ?
The circumstances surrounding the killings Boström mentioned should have been investigated even without the charge of organ snatching .
Regards ,
Bruce Wolman

Objective observers mostly agree that it does n’t make sense for banks to be in the securities business , not if they ’re explicitly insured by the government .
Wall Streeters invent rationalizations to support the current structure because a large chunk of their profits come from trading .
It ’s very refreshing that John Reed , an architect of Citigroup — the biggest , most disastrous financial supermarket of them all — now says the merger was a mistake and banks should be broken up .
From Bob Ivry , Bloomberg :
Congress ’ overhaul of U.S. financial regulations should include ordering banks to hold more capital , ensuring executives ’ compensation is aligned with long - term profitability and banning firms that take deposits from also engaging in equities and fixed - income trading , Reed said .
“ I would compartmentalize the industry for the same reason you compartmentalize ships , ” Reed said in the interview in his office on Park Avenue in New York .
“ If you have a leak , the leak does n’t spread and sink the whole vessel .
So generally speaking you ’d have consumer banking separate from trading bonds and equity . ”
Lawmakers were wrong to repeal the Depression - era Glass - Steagall Act in 1999 , Reed said .
At the time , he supported overturn of the law , which required the separation of institutions that engaged in traditional customer banking services from those involved in capital markets .
“ We learn from our mistakes , ” said Reed , who wrote an Oct. 21 letter to the editor of the New York Times endorsing a division of banking activities .
“ When you ’re running a company , you do what you think is right for the stockholders .
Right now I ’m looking at this as a citizen . ”
Again , this is just half the battle .
Getting dangerous activities outside of insured banks does n’t mean the activities themselves , which in many cases still pose systemic risks , wo n’t continue to benefit from an implicit government guarantee .
As long as investment banks remain highly complex , systemically dangerous institutions , they ’ll always have a government lifeline .

Population control called key to deal By Li Xing ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-12-10 07:37
COPENHAGEN : Population and climate change are intertwined but the population issue has remained a blind spot when countries discuss ways to mitigate climate change and slow down global warming , according to Zhao Baige , vice - minister of National Population and Family Planning Commission of China ( NPFPC ) .
" Dealing with climate change is not simply an issue of CO2 emission reduction but a comprehensive challenge involving political , economic , social , cultural and ecological issues , and the population concern fits right into the picture , " said Zhao , who is a member of the Chinese government delegation .
Many studies link population growth with emissions and the effect of climate change .
" Calculations of the contribution of population growth to emissions growth globally produce a consistent finding that most of past population growth has been responsible for between 40 per cent and 60 percent of emissions growth , " so stated by the 2009 State of World Population , released earlier by the UN Population Fund .
Although China 's family planning policy has received criticism over the past three decades , Zhao said that China 's population program has made a great historic contribution to the well - being of society .
As a result of the family planning policy , China has seen 400 million fewer births , which has resulted in 18 million fewer tons of CO2 emissions a year , Zhao said .
The UN report projected that if the global population would remain 8 billion by the year 2050 instead of a little more than 9 billion according to medium - growth scenario , " it might result in 1 billion to 2 billion fewer tons of carbon emissions " .
Meanwhile , she said studies have also shown that family planning programs are more efficient in helping cut emissions , citing research by Thomas Wire of London School of Economics that states : " Each $ 7 spent on basic family planning would reduce CO2 emissions by more than one ton " whereas it would cost $ 13 for reduced deforestation , $ 24 to use wind technology , $ 51 for solar power , $ 93 for introducing hybrid cars and $ 131 electric vehicles .
She admitted that China 's population program is not without consequences , as the country is entering the aging society fast and facing the problem of gender imbalance .
" I 'm not saying that what we have done is 100 percent right , but I 'm sure we are going in the right direction and now 1.3 billion people have benefited , " she said .
She said some 85 percent of the Chinese women in reproductive age use contraceptives , the highest rate in the world .
This has been achieved largely through education and improvement of people 's lives , she said .
This holistic approach that integrates policy on population and development , a strategy promoting sustainable development of population , resources and environment should serve as a model for integrating population programs into the framework of climate change adaptation , she said .

Federal officials rescued 52 children and arrested nearly 700 people over the last three days in a nationwide crackdown on child prostitution .
Almost 1,600 agents and officers took part in the raids , which followed investigations in 36 cities , according to the FBI , local law enforcement agencies and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .
Included in the arrests were 60 suspected pimps , according to the FBI and local police officials .
Authorities say the youngest victim was 10 .
In Southern California , two children were rescued in Riverside , and four adults were arrested , said Laura Eimiller , an FBI spokeswoman .
Four suspected customers of child prostitutes were arrested in Orange County .

“ It is repugnant that children in these times could be subjected to the great pain , suffering and indignity of being forced into sexual slavery for someone else ’s profit , ” Assistant Atty .
Gen. Lanny A. Breuer said in a statement .
He added that the latest raids show that “ the scourge of child prostitution still exists on the streets of our cities . ”
The sweep , dubbed Operation Cross Country , is part of the Innocence Lost National Initiative , started in 2003 to address child sex trafficking in the U.S .
The initiative has rescued nearly 900 children ; led to the conviction of 510 pimps , madams and their associates ; and seized $ 3.1 million in assets , according to the FBI .
“ We ’re having an enormous impact on this business , ” said Ernie Allen , president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .

Most of the recovered children have been girls , who usually become victims of traffickers around age 12 , Allen said .
He estimated that 100,000 children are still involved in sex trafficking in the U.S. , adding that the problem is growing partly because of the recession .

October 1 , 2009 – Allen Moll
Allen Moll is an avid NBA and College Basketball fan who watches and studies games religiously and coaches youth basketball in his native Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania .
Allen is a regular columnist for the Hoopdoctors , Bleacherreport.com , UpperDeckblog.com , and his own blog , Hoops Haven .
The Celtics are so confident about the ’09 - ’10 season that when you look up into the rafters , you will see 17 banners representing the team ’s 17 NBA titles .
But during Boston ’s media day recently , everyone in attendance noticed a blank 18th banner hanging next to their ’08 Championship banner .
Apparently this Celtic ’s squad is a very confident bunch that hope to be adding some letters and numbers to that banner reading “ 2010 NBA Champions . ”
When head coach Doc Rivers was asked about the blank banner , he replied , ” It was Red Auerbach ’s idea “ , referring to the now deceased Boston coaching legend .
Everything appears good in Boston as the team opens training camp .
The team received great news that the “ Big Ticket , ” Kevin Garnett has been cleared to practice without any restrictions .
A healthy Garnett , I feel is the key to a successful season for the green and white .
Even if he does n’t put up MVP caliber numbers anymore , his leadership and defensive presence is his best asset while on the floor .
If Garnett was healthy enough to play in last season ’s playoff series against the Magic , they surely would have had a better opportunity to advance and make it an interesting Finals series against their dreaded rival , the Lakers .
The addition of Rasheed Wallace is arguably the biggest offseason move of any , this Summer .
Although the Celtics already had possibly the most potent lineup in the league , adding Wallace ’s versatility on offense and smothering post presence on defense fits perfectly in with the passionate play of Garnett , Pierce , and Ray Allen .
Many people felt that the 35 year old ’s ( Wallace ) skills have taken a step back in recent seasons in Detroit .
He finished right at his annual Detroit averages of 12 ppg and 7.4 rebounds in the regular season but his playoff numbers dipped to 6.5 ppg and 6.3 rebounds in a 4 game first round loss .
I speculate that the his lower playoff number were related to his unhappiness with the Detroit roster and management decisions rather than a sudden loss of ability .
Coach Rivers biggest concern will be keeping Wallace and Garnett ’s emotional outbursts in check since both are annually among the league leaders in technical fouls .
I read an amazing stat - line that Wallace has more than 296 tech ’s and 24 ejections in his career , tops among active players .
Point guard Rajon Rondo has been stellar and often overlooked among all the other star players in Beantown .
The 3 year pro has steadily increased his production in each of his three seasons averaging career highs in virtually every category last season with 11.9 ppg , 8.2 assists , 5.2 rebs , and 1.9 steals .
With Boston ’s added firepower , he is poised to be the next great point guard in the East , average over 10 assists per game , and a mainstay on the Eastern All Star squad for the next 10 years .
It seems hard to imagine , but the sky is the limit since Rondo is still only 23 years old .
Hopefully his contract issues wo n’t have a negative impact on his play since he is due for a long term deal , which GM Danny Ainge has yet to offer him .
The two have clashed at times , with Ainge claiming that Rondo has sometimes been late or skips practices .
Some good advice for Rondo is to just play his game and the money will come .
Boston learned from last season and resigned Glen “ Big Baby ” Davis to back - up Garnett if he has another unforseen injury .
The Celtics were smart to bring back the 23 year old power forward since he proved invaluable in Garnett ’s absence , especially in the ’09 postseason , where he averaged 15.8 ppg and almost 6 rebounds .
Additionally , the move really looks good now with forward Leon Powe ’s defection to Cleveland .
Although it is tough for Davis to find minutes with Garnett and Wallace playing most of the minutes in the frontcourt but with a little more seasoning , Davis could be a very serviceable big man , either for Boston or another team , in 2 years when his current deal is up and Wallace and Garnett will be 37 and 35 years of age .
Do n’t forget , Davis was a beast at LSU in college .
The addition of Marquis Daniels , a 6 ’ 6 swingman entering his 7th season from Auburn , could prove to be a valuable commodity considering the ages of Allen and Pierce .
Daniels averaged 13.6 ppg and 4.6 rebounds in place of the injured Mike Dunleavy last season for the Pacers .
Daniels was once a key piece to the Dallas Mavericks up - tempo attack from ’ 03 - ’06 , before they changed their style of play .
Also , do n’t sleep on Boston ’s second round pick ( # 58 overall ) , Lester Hudson who finished 2nd in the nation last season behind only Steph Curry , by averaging 27.5 ppg at Tennessee - Martin .
The 6 ’ 3 guard definitely knows how to score since he was the Ohio Valley Conference Player of the Year in both his junior and senior seasons .
Although he is a point guard , he plays like a Eddie House clone but with a little better handle .
It appears everything is great in Boston and everyone is ready to play .
It ’s amazing how all of the seemingly big egos somehow can coexist on this roster .
Rasheed Wallace , who already owns an championship ring from the ’04 Pistons , explains the team ’s cohesion when he was asked about changing the former Big 3 ( Garnett , Pierce , and Allen ) to the Big 4 ( with Wallace ) , he responded , ” Absolutely not .
I feel like the fourth on the Big 12 or 13 , All of our guys want to win ! ”
Here is some footage from Wendy Nix at ESPN reporting on Garnett ’s rehabbed knee :

OK , so Wipeout !
Is one of those shows that you ’ll just hate yourself for watching .
I hate to admit to watching it myself ( my interest being entirely professional , of course ) .
It ’s a bit like admitting you watch Australia ’s Funniest Home Videos or The Farmer Wants a Wife .
It ’s cringe - worthy , embarrassing and somehow , completely addictive .
At its most basic , Wipeout !
is a kind of athletic game show in which contestants race against the clock around an obstacle course with the winner taking home a wad of cash .
Sounds pretty boring , right – the Amazing Race without the scenery .
But two things conspire to make this a rather addictive concoction .
The first is the fact that the people doing this are Americans – not regular Americans mind you , but the kind of Americans whose ultimate desire in life is to get their mug on television , no matter how dire the show .
They ’re an eclectic mix of type - A jocks , people well past their prime who think they can still cut it in sports and the plain deluded .
Oh , and they usually include someone whose job description contains the words “ exotic ” and “ dancer ” .
When Andy Cookston and his wife opened Denver ’s first medical - marijuana dispensary three years ago , they hung no sign outside their door .
They did no advertising ; patients were drawn exclusively by word of mouth .
They were unsure whether the state would even allow them to include their dispensary ’s full name — Cannabis Medical Technology — on their business license because of its pot -tinged terminology .
Such modesty is no longer a concern .
“ Now that the door ’s been cracked open , ” said Cookston , who also owns a graphics company , “ people are rushing it . ”
Colorado ’s medical - marijuana industry — just in its infancy — is already in the throes of a dramatic change .
As tens of thousands of patients applied for medical - marijuana cards in the past six months , dozens of new dispensaries opened .
The number of dispensaries — in essence , shops where approved patients legally buy marijuana — is likely more than 200 in Colorado , though no official tally exists .
And , even as new mom-and - pop dispensaries continue to open weekly , the money flooding into the industry has also attracted the interest of big players with big checkbooks .
A 5,000 - square - foot dispensary — billed as the largest in Denver — recently opened just north of Invesco Field .
Two powerhouse dispensaries from California are opening outposts in LoDo .
Offshoot businesses abound
Meanwhile , small - time dispensary owners have resorted to ever more adventurous business models to create a niche in a suddenly crowded marketplace .
There are delivery - only dispensaries and dispensaries with hair stylists on site and one dispensary that claims to be the country ’s only medical - marijuana restaurant .
And this does n’t include the offshoot businesses that dispensary owners say have arisen around the cannabis industry — including not just the paraphernalia and growing supply shops but also insurers , electricians , security firms , ventilation contractors , real estate agents and lawyers .
One local bail bonds company took out an ad in the alternative magazine Westword ’s 64 - page special medical - marijuana insert , offering a discount to people charged with marijuana - related crimes .
Commercial real estate for dispensaries now leases at a premium , several dispensary owners said .
Warehouse space for marijuana - growing operations is even tighter .
“ The average guy starting a storefront now , you definitely better have some legitimate business skills compared to what it used to be , ” Cookston said .
“ It ’s definitely getting harder . ”
Despite the harsher competition , dispensary owners remain a diverse set .
Many , like Cookston , are patients themselves and longtime advocates of using marijuana for medical purposes .
Because dispensary owners remain largely cut off from traditional financing like bank loans , they must scrounge together all the money necessary to open their shops — in most cases anywhere from $ 20,000 to $ 50,000 — on their own .
For Steve Horowitz , who used to sell promotional magnets to Realtors until the housing bust , that meant skipping the mortgage payment on his space for three months in order to come up with the cash to start a dispensary .
Horo witz ’s creation — the Ganja Gourmet , which serves marijuana - infused pizza , lasagna , hummus and desserts — opened last week on South Broadway in Denver .
“ I ’m lucky I did n’t run out of money before I opened this , ” he said .
Posting ads for investors
Pierre Werner — a Nevada transplant who moved to Boulder earlier this year in search of a friendlier climate for medical - marijuana distribution after receiving three felony convictions on marijuana - related charges in his home state — opened his Dr. Reefer dispensary on University Hill after posting ads to Craigslist seeking investors .
“ I think everybody is throwing every last dollar and maxing out their credit cards and getting every kind of loan they can , ” Werner said of new dispensary owners .
Well , perhaps not everybody .
In LoDo , at least two new dispensaries have the backing of major players from California ’s booming medical - marijuana industry .
The Farmacy , at 14th and Market streets , is a branch of a dispensary chain with three shops in the Los Angeles area .
Local Product , at 15th and Larimer streets , has the backing of Harborside Management Associates , a for - profit offshoot of the Harborside Health Center in Oakland , one of California ’s largest dispensaries with about $ 20 million in annual sales .
“ It ’s David versus Goliath ”
Representatives from the two dispensaries did not respond to inquiries , but the Californians ’ entrance into Colorado has a number of local dispensary owners concerned .
“ It ’s David versus Goliath , ” said Jason Irwin , the 27 - year - old owner of Highland Health dispensary in Denver .
“ They did n’t strong - arm their way in , but they have a blank checkbook . ”
In response , Irwin said , he plans to expand his business .
The dispensary just completed the first harvest at its own growing operation in southern Colorado .
Irwin said he hopes to build an even bigger growing operation soon , all to be overseen by his mother .
“ When I was in high school , she used to flush my weed down the toilet , ” he said , marveling at her shift in attitude .
“ She was not cool with it . ”
Cannabis Medical ’s Cookston said the current growth will only help boost dispensaries ’ legitimacy , making them all the more entrenched in the community .
“ It ’s all coming , ” he said .
“ It ’s like the sunrise .
It ’s getting brighter and brighter . ”

Retiring to Boca Raton might might appeal to some aging Baby Boomers , but what about those planning to retire early – due to sound investments , for instance – or , those who are looking for a little post - career adventure ?
Whatever your age , retirement should be an opportunity to do all the things that you always wanted to do , but were too busy to try .
Perhaps you ’ll pursue a neglected hobby or even launch another business but this time from a more exotic locale .
From changes in scenery to endless recreation , business tax breaks to huge exchange rate benefits , a number of international locations are well - worth consideration as retirement destinations .
For those not yet looking to retire , they make good vacation getaways as well :
Cuenca , Ecuador
Named the best place in the world to retire by International Living , Cuenca , Ecuador has it all for the modern retiree .
For starters , the cost of living is quite low .
MSN
Money offers a useful chart that sketches out an average monthly living expense of $ 1,415.00 .
This figure includes rent on a luxury , two - bedroom apartment , maid service , food , auto maintenance and fuel , clothing , entertainment and health care for two .
The aesthetics of Cuenca include Renaissance style architecture , terracotta roof tiles , and cathedral - like archways everywhere you look .
With its high elevation , ( about 8,000 feet )
Cuenca retirees rave about its near perfect 60 degree year round temperature , according to EcuadorExplorer.com .
The scenery consists of lush greens , luminous flowers and babbling rivers .
Cuenca embodies countryside living at its best .
Residents even even enjoy half - priced airfare .
Coronado , Panama
Panama offers a quaint retirement haven for your golden years .
Most Panama retirees choose the town of Coronado for its gorgeous climate , peaceful neighborhoods and elder - friendly culture .
What Coronado lacks in urbanization it makes up for in small - town clubs and organizations such as mahjong clubs , karaoke bars , art classes , yoga classes , golf tournaments and country clubs , miles of pristine beach , and more .
The cost of living is very low according to MSN Money , which describes Panama as a paradise for retirees due to affordable real estate .
For example , the average cost of a house in a quiet neighborhood is around $ 185,000 , while consultation with English - speaking doctors is priced at around $ 35.00 .
MSN also notes that “ … residents pay no taxes on foreign - earned income . ”
With the retiree population on the rise , demand for entertainment , services and restaurants here is at an all - time high .
This means anyone with dreams of opening their own business will find opportunity in Panama .
San José , Costa Rica
RetireInCostaRica.net ranks Costa Rica as one of the top five emerging real estate markets in the world , meaning that housing can be had at a big discount , and the government offers substantial tax breaks to all new home owners .
And the place to be , is San José .
Costa Rica utilizes a rare type of retirement structure that does not tax retirement income .
As mentioned earlier , many retirees choose to go into business for themselves ; if this sounds like you , Costa Rica makes an ideal spot to set up shop due to its famous “ Free Zones . ”
Free Zone is quite literally a zoned area in Costa Rica that allows certain kinds of businesses ( especially import / export focused companies ) to operate with 100 % tax exemption , according to WestNet .
Aside from the financial benefits , Costa Rica offers a sunny , tropical climate with gorgeous scenery .
In addition , quality of life is superb , and many people can afford to live on $ 1,500 a month ( excluding rent payments ) .
Koh Samui , Thailand
Looking to retire like a king and live lavishly on your average means ?
Look no further than Koh Samui , a wonderful island in Southwest Thailand .
Here , the exchange rate allows anyone with a decent retirement fund to enjoy high - class luxuries .
One Thai Baht is equal to roughly three cents USD , according to BKKPages .
Rental properties in Thailand can readily be found for between 3,000 to 10,000 Baht per month , which equals about $ 90.00 to $ 300.00 USD .
Temperatures generally range from around 80 - 90 degrees in the winter and from 90 - 100 during the summer months .
Thailand is home to beaches with crystal water , which in Koh Samui , would likely be within walking distance of your property .
Golf is also big in Thailand , and numerous rolling courses complete with palm tree decor can be found in the countryside .
Vienna , Austria
Vienna , Austria , home to 1.7 million , is ideal for those who enjoy the changing of the seasons and looks forward to snow - covered winter months .
Known ’round the world for its winter charm , Austria is a popular place to retire , attracting those who wish to get out of the urbanized west and live amongst pristine wilderness .
Residents enjoy walking the endless trails of Alps , fishing the countless lakes and river , and skiing the various mountainsides .
Most retirees fall in love with the slower and more traditional Austrian culture .
Hardly anyone is in much of a hurry to get rich or climb any corporate ladders .
Instead , they spend their enjoying the pleasures of nature , raising animals and relaxing with friends among the scenery .
Austria remains the cheapest European country to live in according to Best Places to Retire , making it an obvious choice for many retirees looking to get the most bang for their buck .
The country also remains a tax haven , as the Austria Times noted in March of 2009 that the EU ’s demands to stop offering secret accounts to foreigners fell flat on the nation ’s finance ministry .
Capetown , South Africa
Over the past decade , South Africa has grown in popularity as an exotic place to retire .
Specifically , the historic city of Cape Town has received a five star rating on eOpinions.com .
More than most countries in the area , the climate in South Africa is varied .
In the summer months , temperatures can reach 90 to 100 degrees during the day , and can fall close to freezing by night .
South Africa is another place where the exchange rate allows those with average savings to live large .
One South African Rand ( ZAD ) is worth about $ 0.13 USD according to Exchange - Rates.org .
Real estate is entirely open to foreign buyers , and the market is currently expanding at blistering rates , opening up opportunities and discounts for most buyers .
Generally speaking , rent in South Africa should ran between $ 300 – $ 700 USD , allowing for a very low cost of living .
If you have more than a few thousand a month to spare , this country is a viable option .
Merida , Mexico
Merida , Mexico offers some of the best of what International Living calls , the 4 C’s : comfort , convenience , cost and culture .
Though the summers may get hot , almost all residential areas are within walking or very brief driving distance of sun soaked beaches .
During the rest of the year , the climate is said to be “ paradise . ”
Concerning convenience , Merida is almost entirely flat .
This lay of the land makes long walks or bike rides very enjoyable , allowing you to stay in - shape all throughout retirement .
In addition , flying to and from Merida to the US is quite reasonable , and a number of direct flights are available via major cities .
Nicely accommodated apartments can be had for around $ 500.00 USD per month .
Health care is also very inexpensive thanks to generous government subsidies .
As far as culture goes , Merida is a hot bed of activity , and much of it is free of cost .
Free dances , free concerts , free plays and stage shows , for example .
And , for the explorer , some breath - taking Mayan ruins lie only 90 minutes outside of the city .
Montevideo , Uruguay
Billed by EscapeArtist as having , “ … one of the lowest costs of living in the world ” , Uruguay has something to accommodate any retiree .
Many are taken by the friendly locals and the seductive scenery .
Uruguay is one of the few countries where you can have your quiet retirement retreat without giving up the conveniences of the modern world .
Look no further than Montevideo , said to be an , “ … old - world European style city with fine restaurants , colorful markets , sycamore - lined streets and a cultural scene second to none . ”
Communication services are excellent and shopping centers are plentiful .
In addition , the highways are fresh and safe , so if you must travel far you can do so with ease .
Uruguay is less urbanized than much of the western world and features some of the best natural beauty your eyes can take in .
Prospective entrepreneurs will be pleased to know that Uruguay offers some of the , “ … highest rental returns in Latin America . ”
Calitri , Italy
For many , Calitri is the place to retire .
Calitri is unspoiled Italy at its finest – overflowing with classic building designs , fine wines and delicious food .
The cost of living in Calitri is amazingly affordable .
For only $ 15,000 USD , you can purchase a small , unrestored apartment complete with kitchen and bathroom accommodations according to International Living .
Unrestored , classic homes in Calitri can be purchased for as little as $ 42,000 USD .
Those looking to live modern in classic Italy can opt for the restored “ luxury ” models for around $ 64,000 .
The town of Calitri is surrounded by lush green fields and forests along rolling hillsides , offering great opportunities to wander off and take in the untouched scenery .
What ’s more , you can also receive free health care if you become a European citizen as part of your move to Calitri – although this may take some strategic marrying .

On Tuesday , the Supreme Court of British Columbia barred Rogers from making claims that it has Canada ’s “ most reliable network ” for mobile phones .
This comes from a compaint lodged by Telus Corp. that Rogers no longer could claim it had the ‘ most reliable ’ or ‘ fastest ’ network in Canada since both Bell Canada and themselves had launched their HSPA netwrok , which of course uses the same technology as Roger ’s HSPA network .
Bell Canada had recently been running ads touting its network as the ‘ best ’ in Canada , which Telus obviously has n’t complained about since it runs on the exact same network .
Ironically though , Bell actually uses the phrase “ Fastest , largest and most reliable ” in describing its netwrok on its website .
Telus ’s website claims it 3G + coverage is four times greater than that of Rogers ’ , which makes me wonder why they have n’t instituted some coverage map vs. coverage map ads like Verizon has in the U.S.
It may be possible that they know Canadian courts can be more stringent that U.S. ones when ads hurt other companies feelings .
Probably because Canadian companies always play second fiddle to American one ’s anyways , and there ’s no need for infighting .

This is a direct reply to a blog post by VM Brasseur , telling about the difficulties to get started in the Perl 6 community .
I started it as a comment on that blog , but it got too long pretty quickly .
The problem is known : far too many Perl 6 sites , far too many of which are out of date .
I hoped to kill fire with fire by starting one more ( which is perl6.org ) , and trying to make it easy and attractive to keep it up to date - by making it central , easy to contribute to , and by making it light on content and rich on links .
However being a " seasoned warrior " in the community , it is sometimes hard for me to assess what we have to present to the newcomer , and in what way .
I also like to keep in mind that Perl 6 has multiple implementations , and even a newcomer should have the choice .
Being involved with some of the implementations I also feel it 's unfair against the others to just point to one of them .
So , what would a newbie need ?
I 'm guessing here , please do tell if you have different opinions .
Introductory documents / tutorials
A way to run a Perl 6 compiler to try it out
Ways to contact the community
A list of what needs to be done
Further reading
The first one is maybe the toughest : frankly speaking , we do n't have any .
We have my 5 - to - 6 blog which I put up here in chronological form , but which assumes Perl 5 knowledge , and which talks about many features that Rakudo does not implement yet , and which mostly is n't practical .
We have examples , but the rest is unorganized , out of date , or woefully incomplete .
D'oh .
On the second point we 're doing fairly well with a big download button - at least I hope we do .
We also advertise our IRC channel ( which I consider the heart beat of Perl 6 development ) and mailing lists , another score here .
The fourth point is a tough one again .
Being a completely volunteer driven project , we are not used to handing out tasks .
There is a huge variety of tasks that all have vastly different requirements in terms of interests , skills , time and commitment .
The larger such a list becomes , the harder it becomes to maintain .
And TODO lists are one of those things that go out of date rather quickly .
Which is why I 'd encourage newcomers to contact the community , tell about their interest and skills so that we can search for suitable tasks together .
However that 's quite a hurdle for some people .
I usually suggest to write tests and applications , which sometimes finds resonance .
But any ideas how to perform better is greatly appreciated .
The last point , further reading , is mostly covered by the Synopsis / specification .
But all in all I think we need a better presentation , though I do n't yet know how .
Ideas ?
Also somebody mentioned that our IRC channel is friendly , but still not very accessible to the newcomer , because we use lots of technical terms when talking among ourselves .
That 's something we can't really avoid , but it does scare off some people .
So far we have tried to avoid splitting into many subchannels ( with the possible exception of per- project dedicated channels ) , but maybe the time has come to fork off a newbie or users channel ?
Anything else we can do right now to improve newcomer experience ?
And yes , we 're working on improving introductory material .
More on that next Friday .
It is often easy to ignore the effects of climate change when those effects do n’t have a direct impact on your immediate surroundings .
However , if you take a closer look at the more northern habitats , you will see how climate change is affecting both the local tundra ecosystems and the animals who call that area home .
One such animal is the collared pika – a mammal that resembles a small bunny and is part of the same order as rabbits ( Lagomorpha ) .
The effect that climate change is having on this mammal is currently being studied by University of Alberta researchers David Hik and Scott Williamson .
David
Hik ’s research emphasizes plant - herbivore - climate interactions in northern alpine and tundra ecosystems , while Scott Williamson is involved in research on elevation dependent warming ( 4 ) .
Scott Williamson ’s research contributions on elevation - dependent warming were published in the journal Nature Climate Change in April , 2015
http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v5/n5/full/nclimate2563.html
The collared pika is a species of pika that lives in the more extreme northern climates .
They have adapted to this colder climate through a combination of different behavoiurs .
They burrow under thick snow packs in the winter , which allows them to survive these colder months since they do n’t hibernate ( 2 ) .
Collared pikas also gather food in the summer months and store it in a separate pantry or “ cache ” over the winter ( 2 ) .
In the summer , they hide from predators and shield themselves from the heat in rock “ talus ” sites at the base of landslides ( 3 ) .
The food that they gather and store , mostly consists of green grasses and the leaves of alpine meadow plants ( 2 ) .
However , a combination of lower temperatures and other global warming trends is negatively affecting their food supply and ability to shelter themselves from the cold in snow packs .
This is a concern considering that their populations are already dropping by 90 % over the winter months , as observed by David Hik ( 2 ) .
Northern habitats are currently being affected by the global warming trend of “ shrubification , ” which is having an impact on the survival of collared pikas .
Shrubification is the colloquial term that describes the process of shrub expansion into more northern areas and at higher altitudes .
These shrubs are able to expand farther north due to factors such as lower temperatures , soil disturbances and herbivory ( 1 ) .
For example , reduced temperatures allow for enhanced soil nutrient uptake .
Landscape and soil disturbances also contribute to increased shrub abundance and distribution .
Grazing herbivores have an impact on shrub distribution by altering seed production and seedbed size , transport of seeds and soil fertilization ( 1 ) .
This process of shrubification is causing the already endangered collared pika populations to dwindle further due to decreasing their food sources and reducing the snow pack cover .
The advancement and canopy thickening of shrubs is causing a reduction in albedo ( or , sun reflectance off snow ) , which contributes to warmer temperatures .
It also takes longer for the snow to melt under shrubs , which then covers the meadow plant seedlings for a longer time and delays the growing season ( 2 ) .
In combination with this , the lower temperatures are also causing more rain and ice and less snow .
This then leads to reduced snow pack thickness , and when the rain freezes , it covers any winter vegetation with an impenetrable shell of ice ( 2 ) .
Therefore , the collared pikas face many challenges in their alpine habitats .
To help these creatures , make sure that you are doing all that you can , such as driving less , recycling , drinking water from reusable bottles and reducing your overall energy consumption .
These fluffly little bunny - like creatures will surely thank you !

My mother , Rose Meraglio Rose ( Rosie ) , shaped her adult identity as a waitress in coffee shops and family restaurants .
When I was growing up in Los Angeles during the 1950s , my father and I would occasionally hang out at the restaurant until her shift ended , and then we ’d ride the bus home with her .
Sometimes she worked the register and the counter , and we sat there ; when she waited booths and tables , we found a booth in the back where the waitresses took their breaks .
There was n’t much for a child to do at the restaurants , and so as the hours stretched out , I watched the cooks and waitresses and listened to what they said .
At mealtimes , the pace of the kitchen staff and the din from customers picked up .
Weaving in and out around the room , waitresses warned behind you in impassive but urgent voices .
Standing at the service window facing the kitchen , they called out abbreviated orders .
Fry four on two , my mother would say as she clipped a check onto the metal wheel .
Her tables were deuces , four - tops , or six - tops according to their size ; seating areas also were nicknamed .
The racetrack , for instance , was the fast - turnover front section .
Lingo conferred authority and signaled know - how .
Rosie took customers ’ orders , pencil poised over pad , while fielding questions about the food .
She walked full tilt through the room with plates stretching up her left arm and two cups of coffee somehow cradled in her right hand .
She stood at a table or booth and removed a plate for this person , another for that person , then another , remembering who had the hamburger , who had the fried shrimp , almost always getting it right .
She would haggle with the cook about a returned order and rush by us , saying , He gave me lip , but I got him .
She ’d take a minute to flop down in the booth next to my father .
I ’m all in , she ’d say , and whisper something about a customer .
Gripping the outer edge of the table with one hand , she ’d watch the room and note , in the flow of our conversation , who needed a refill , whose order was taking longer to prepare than it should , who was finishing up .
I could n’t have put it in words when I was growing up , but what I observed in my mother ’s restaurant defined the world of adults , a place where competence was synonymous with physical work .
I ’ve since studied the working habits of blue - collar workers and have come to understand how much my mother ’s kind of work demands of both body and brain .
A waitress acquires knowledge and intuition about the ways and the rhythms of the restaurant business .
Waiting on seven to nine tables , each with two to six customers , Rosie devised memory strategies so that she could remember who ordered what .
And because she knew the average time it took to prepare different dishes , she could monitor an order that was taking too long at the service station .
Like anyone who is effective at physical work , my mother learned to work smart , as she put it , to make every move count .
She ’d sequence and group tasks :
What could she do first , then second , then third as she circled through her station ?
What tasks could be clustered ?
She did everything on the fly , and when problems arose — technical or human — she solved them within the flow of work , while taking into account the emotional state of her co-workers .
Was the manager in a good mood ?
Did the cook wake up on the wrong side of the bed ?
If so , how could she make an extra request or effectively return an order ?
And then , of course , there were the customers who entered the restaurant with all sorts of needs , from physiological ones , including the emotions that accompany hunger , to a sometimes complicated desire for human contact .
Her tip depended on how well she responded to these needs , and so she became adept at reading social cues and managing feelings , both the customers ’ and her own .
No wonder , then , that Rosie was intrigued by psychology .
The restaurant became the place where she studied human behavior , puzzling over the problems of her regular customers and refining her ability to deal with people in a difficult world .
She took pride in being among the public , she ’d say .
There is n’t a day that goes by in the restaurant that you do n’t learn something .
My mother quit school in the seventh grade to help raise her brothers and sisters .
Some of those siblings made it through high school , and some dropped out to find work in railroad yards , factories , or restaurants .
My father finished a grade or two in primary school in Italy and never darkened the schoolhouse door again .
I did n’t do well in school either .
By high school I had accumulated a spotty academic record and many hours of hazy disaffection .
I spent a few years on the vocational track , but in my senior year I was inspired by my English teacher and managed to squeak into a small college on probation .
My freshman year was academically bumpy , but gradually I began to see formal education as a means of fulfillment and as a road toward making a living .
I studied the humanities and later the social and psychological sciences and taught for 10 years in a range of situations — elementary school , adult education courses , tutoring centers , a program for Vietnam veterans who wanted to go to college .
Those students had socioeconomic and educational backgrounds similar to mine .
Then I went back to graduate school to study education and cognitive psychology and eventually became a faculty member in a school of education .
Intelligence is closely associated with formal education — the type of schooling a person has , how much and how long — and most people seem to move comfortably from that notion to a belief that work requiring less schooling requires less intelligence .
These assumptions run through our cultural history , from the post–Revolutionary War period , when mechanics were characterized by political rivals as illiterate and therefore incapable of participating in government , until today .
More than once I ’ve heard a manager label his workers as “ a bunch of dummies . ”
Generalizations about intelligence , work , and social class deeply affect our assumptions about ourselves and each other , guiding the ways we use our minds to learn , build knowledge , solve problems , and make our way through the world .
Although writers and scholars have often looked at the working class , they have generally focused on the values such workers exhibit rather than on the thought their work requires — a subtle but pervasive omission .
Our cultural iconography promotes the muscled arm , sleeve rolled tight against biceps , but no brightness behind the eye , no image that links hand and brain .
One of my mother ’s brothers , Joe Meraglio , left school in the ninth grade to work for the Pennsylvania Railroad .
From there he joined the Navy , returned to the railroad , which was already in decline , and eventually joined his older brother at General Motors where , over a 33 - year career , he moved from working on the assembly line to supervising the paint - and - body department .
When I was a young man , Joe took me on a tour of the factory .
The floor was loud — in some places deafening — and when I turned a corner or opened a door , the smell of chemicals knocked my head back .
The work was repetitive and taxing , and the pace was inhumane .
Still , for Joe the shop floor provided what school did not ; it was like schooling , he said , a place where you ’re constantly learning .
Joe learned the most efficient way to use his body by acquiring a set of routines that were quick and preserved energy .
Otherwise he would never have survived on the line .
As a foreman , Joe constantly faced new problems and became a consummate multi-tasker , evaluating a flurry of demands quickly , parceling out physical and mental resources , keeping a number of ongoing events in his mind , returning to whatever task had been interrupted , and maintaining a cool head under the pressure of grueling production schedules .
In the midst of all this , Joe learned more and more about the auto industry , the technological and social dynamics of the shop floor , the machinery and production processes , and the basics of paint chemistry and of plating and baking .
With further promotions , he not only solved problems but also began to find problems to solve :
Joe initiated the redesign of the nozzle on a paint sprayer , thereby eliminating costly and unhealthy overspray .
And he found a way to reduce energy costs on the baking ovens without affecting the quality of the paint .
He lacked formal knowledge of how the machines under his supervision worked , but he had direct experience with them , hands - on knowledge , and was savvy about their quirks and operational capabilities .
He could experiment with them .
In addition , Joe learned about budgets and management .
Coming off the line as he did , he had a perspective of workers ’ needs and management ’s demands , and this led him to think of ways to improve efficiency on the line while relieving some of the stress on the assemblers .
He had each worker in a unit learn his or her co-workers ’ jobs so they could rotate across stations to relieve some of the monotony .
He believed that rotation would allow assemblers to get longer and more frequent breaks .
It was an easy sell to the people on the line .
The union , however , had to approve any modification in job duties , and the managers were wary of the change .
Joe had to argue his case on a number of fronts , providing him a kind of rhetorical education .
Eight years ago I began a study of the thought processes involved in work like that of my mother and uncle .
I catalogued the cognitive demands of a range of blue - collar and service jobs , from waitressing and hair styling to plumbing and welding .
To gain a sense of how knowledge and skill develop , I observed experts as well as novices .
From the details of this close examination , I tried to fashion what I called “ cognitive biographies ” of blue - collar workers .
Biographical accounts of the lives of scientists , lawyers , entrepreneurs , and other professionals are rich with detail about the intellectual dimension of their work .
But the life stories of working - class people are few and are typically accounts of hardship and courage or the achievements wrought by hard work .
Our culture — in Cartesian fashion — separates the body from the mind , so that , for example , we assume that the use of a tool does not involve abstraction .
We reinforce this notion by defining intelligence solely on grades in school and numbers on IQ tests .
And we employ social biases pertaining to a person ’s place on the occupational ladder .
The distinctions among blue , pink , and white collars carry with them attributions of character , motivation , and intelligence .
Although we rightly acknowledge and amply compensate the play of mind in white - collar and professional work , we diminish or erase it in considerations about other endeavors — physical and service work particularly .
We also often ignore the experience of everyday work in administrative deliberations and policymaking .
But here ’s what we find when we get in close .
The plumber seeking leverage in order to work in tight quarters and the hair stylist adroitly handling scissors and comb manage their bodies strategically .
Though work - related actions be­come routine with experience , they were learned at some point through observation , trial and error , and , often , physical or verbal assistance from a co-worker or trainer .
I ’ve frequently observed novices talking to themselves as they take on a task , or shaking their head or hand as if to erase an attempt before trying again .
In fact , our traditional notions of routine performance could keep us from appreciating the many instances within routine where quick decisions and adjustments are made .
I ’m struck by the thinking - in - motion that some work requires , by all the mental activity that can be involved in simply getting from one place to another : the waitress rushing back through her station to the kitchen or the foreman walking the line .
The use of tools requires the studied refinement of stance , grip , balance , and fine - motor skills .
But manipulating tools is intimately tied to knowledge of what a particular instrument can do in a particular situation and do better than other similar tools .
A worker must also know the characteristics of the material one is engaging — how it reacts to various cutting or compressing devices , to degrees of heat , or to lines of force .
Some of these things demand judgment , the weighing of options , the consideration of multiple variables , and , occasionally , the creative use of a tool in an unexpected way .
In manipulating material , the worker becomes attuned to aspects of the environment , a training or disciplining of perception that both enhances knowledge and informs perception .
Carpenters have an eye for length , line , and angle ; mechanics troubleshoot by listening ; hair stylists are attuned to shape , texture , and motion .
Sensory data merge with concept , as when an auto mechanic relies on sound , vibration , and even smell to understand what can not be observed .
Planning and problem solving have been studied since the earliest days of modern cognitive psychology and are considered core elements in Western definitions of intelligence .
To work is to solve problems .
The big difference between the psychologist ’s laboratory and the workplace is that in the former the problems are isolated and in the latter they are embedded in the real - time flow of work with all its messiness and social complexity .
Much of physical work is social and interactive .
Movers determining how to get an electric range down a flight of stairs require coordination , negotiation , planning , and the establishing of incremental goals .
Words , gestures , and sometimes a quick pencil sketch are involved , if only to get the rhythm right .
How important it is , then , to consider the social and communicative dimension of physical work , for it provides the medium for so much of work ’s intelligence .
Given the ridicule heaped on blue - collar speech , it might seem odd to value its cognitive content .
Yet , the flow of talk at work provides the channel for organizing and distributing tasks , for troubleshooting and problem solving , for learning new information and revising old .
A significant amount of teaching , often informal and indirect , takes place at work .
Joe Meraglio saw that much of his job as a supervisor involved instruction .
In some service occupations , language and communication are central : observing and interpreting behavior and expression , inferring mood and motive , taking on the perspective of others , responding appropriately to social cues , and knowing when you ’re understood .
A good hair stylist , for instance , has the ability to convert vague requests ( I want something light and summery ) into an appropriate cut through questions , pictures , and hand gestures .
Verbal and mathematical skills drive measures of intelligence in the Western Hemisphere , and many of the kinds of work I studied are thought to require relatively little proficiency in either .
Compared to certain kinds of white - collar occupations , that ’s true .
But written symbols flow through physical work .
Numbers are rife in most workplaces : on tools and gauges , as measurements , as indicators of pressure or concentration or temperature , as guides to sequence , on ingredient labels , on lists and spreadsheets , as markers of quantity and price .
Certain jobs require workers to make , check , and verify calculations , and to collect and interpret data .
Basic math can be involved , and some workers develop a good sense of numbers and patterns .
Consider , as well , what might be called material mathematics : mathematical functions embodied in materials and actions , as when a carpenter builds a cabinet or a flight of stairs .
A simple mathematical act can extend quickly beyond itself .
Measuring , for example , can involve more than recording the dimensions of an object .
As I watched a cabinetmaker measure a long strip of wood , he read a number off the tape out loud , looked back over his shoulder to the kitchen wall , turned back to his task , took another measurement , and paused for a moment in thought .
He was solving a problem involving the molding , and the measurement was important to his deliberation about structure and appearance .
In the blue - collar workplace , directions , plans , and reference books rely on illustrations , some representational and others , like blueprints , that require training to interpret .
Esoteric symbols — visual jargon — depict switches and receptacles , pipe fittings , or types of welds .
Workers themselves often make sketches on the job .
I frequently observed them grab a pencil to sketch something on a scrap of paper or on a piece of the material they were installing .
Though many kinds of physical work do n’t require a high literacy level , more reading occurs in the blue - collar workplace than is generally thought , from manuals and catalogues to work orders and invoices , to lists , labels , and forms .
With routine tasks , for example , reading is integral to understanding production quotas , learning how to use an instrument , or applying a product .
Written notes can initiate action , as in restaurant orders or reports of machine malfunction , or they can serve as memory aids .
True , many uses of writing are abbreviated , routine , and repetitive , and they infrequently require interpretation or analysis .
But analytic moments can be part of routine activities , and seemingly basic reading and writing can be cognitively rich .
Because workplace language is used in the flow of other activities , we can overlook the remarkable coordination of words , numbers , and drawings required to initiate and direct action .
If we believe everyday work to be mindless , then that will affect the work we create in the future .
When we devalue the full range of everyday cognition , we offer limited educational opportunities and fail to make fresh and meaningful instructional connections among disparate kinds of skill and knowledge .
If we think that whole categories of people — identified by class or occupation — are not that bright , then we reinforce social separations and cripple our ability to talk across cultural divides .
Affirmation of diverse intelligence is not a retreat to a softhearted definition of the mind .
To acknowledge a broader range of intellectual capacity is to take seriously the concept of cognitive variability , to appreciate in all the Rosies and Joes the thought that drives their accomplishments and defines who they are .
This is a model of the mind that is worthy of a democratic society .
Jonathan Weisman reports on politics .
After pumping more than $ 1 million into an upstate New York House race to elect the Conservative Party ’s Doug Hoffman , the Club for Growth is on the hunt again .
Chris Chocola , president of the conservative political action committee , made it clear the PAC is looking for more GOP targets who do n’t embrace the Club ’s limited - government approach .
Priority No. 1 is likely to be the Senate contest in Florida , where Republican Gov. Charlie Crist , who embraced President Barack Obama ’s stimulus package , is being challenged by former State House Speaker Marco Rubio .
Chocola said the Club will jump in “ where there is a viable candidate and a stark contrast . ”
“ It ’s no secret we like Rubio a lot and we have great concerns about Crist , ” he said , adding that a decision will come in “ no more than weeks . ”
Beyond Florida , other establishment Republicans may be looking over their shoulders .
Chocola , a former House Republican from Indiana , noted that he served with Rep. Mark Kirk ( R. , Ill . ) and former Rep. Rob Simmons ( R. , Conn. ) , both running for the Senate …

Having a national agency will not change the relationship with Esa Britain is to set up a dedicated agency to direct its space policy .
The new organisation is expected to have a budget and will represent the UK in all its dealings with international partners .
The announcement , made by the Science Minister Lord Drayson , follows a 12 - week consultation held with academia , industry and government departments .
Britain spends about £ 270 m a year on space , most of it via its membership of the European Space Agency ( Esa ) .
But it also has a highly successful industry which currently contributes some £ 6.5 bn a year to the UK economy .
" We have a real success story in our space research and space industry , and we need to make sure we make the most of it , " Lord Drayson told BBC News .
Just calling it an agency is not enough ; it has to be empowered at the right level
Richard Peckham , UK Space
Spaceman Blog : UK space agency Consultation UK space agency " Having a central agency allows us to much more effectively develop the policy that will build on this fantastic asset .
" People will notice a much higher profile for space .
It follows things that have happened this year , such as the appointment of the first British astronaut , the launches we have seen [ of the Herschel and Planck telescopes ] ; and it will enable us to speed up great ideas like for example Virgin Galactic looking to put a launch site here in Britain . "
A competition will be held to come up with a name and a logo for the new agency .
Whereas Germany , France and Italy have national space agencies that speak with single voices backed up by single budgets , the UK 's approach has been to devolve space policy decisions to a club of " users " facilitated by a civil service unit called the British National Space Centre ( BNSC ) .
These users are the government departments and research councils that have interests in space science or space - borne services .
Funding questions
The arrangement was supposed to ensure that limited space funding chased " need " and " value " .
But critics complained the approach only promoted self - interest and made it hard for the UK to adopt coherent positions on big international programmes - where much space activity is now directed .
The hope is that a more top - down structure can overcome some of the perceived weaknesses of the past , and drive more and better co-operation among the different space - user groups .
The UK acquired its first Esa astronaut - Tim Peake - this year However , it is not completely clear yet how the agency will be funded .
The BBC understands there are at least two models on the table .
One would see the public monies currently allocated to users being issued to the agency instead .
Another would see the monies remain with the users who would then " subscribe " to programmes directed by the agency .
The latter model is how the European Space Agency works , although it also has a core budget of its own .
If the agency does take control of most of the civil space budget , it could lead to tensions if some users feel their priorities are being ignored by the new executive decision - making process .
But Professor Keith Mason , who heads the Science and Technology Facilities Council which is one of the key BNSC partners today , said this was not an inevitable outcome of the reorganisation .
" I think it 's important when designing how this agency will work that we take the strengths from the current system and build on them , " he said .
" The space science programme I 'm responsible for has been hugely successful , and we need to make sure it stays that way .
But we can do that ; it is something we can design into this agency from the outset . "
The space sector is a major employer and revenue earner Richard Peckham , the chairman of UK Space , an umbrella group representing the British industrial space sector , commented : " In principle , having an agency is excellent news .
Whether it is a success or not will depend on the implementation .
" Just calling it an agency is not enough ; it has to be empowered at the right level .
It also needs a policy - a clear vision of what it is that needs to be delivered ; and we have n't had that to date , " he told BBC News .
The announcement of an agency is just the latest in a series of initiatives affecting British space interests .
In July , Esa finally opened a technical centre in Britain - the only one of its major members not to have such a showcase facility .
It also appointed a British national , Major Tim Peake , to its astronaut corps in May .
The government has initiated a review of UK space activity to try to identify the key trends that businesses can exploit in the coming years .
This is due to report in the coming weeks .
Another space study was published on Thursday .
The Space Exploration Review examines the options for future UK participation in the global effort to push humans out across the Solar System , especially at locations such as the Moon and Mars .
It identifies the technological and economic opportunities that the UK could exploit and that fit with its particular areas of expertise , for example in robotics .

In 2006 , Ron Suskind published “ The One Percent Doctrine , ” a book about the U.S. war on terrorists after 9/11 .
The title was drawn from an assessment by then - Vice President Dick Cheney , who , in the face of concerns that a Pakistani scientist was offering nuclear - weapons expertise to Al Qaeda , reportedly declared : “ If there ’s a 1 % chance that Pakistani scientists are helping Al Qaeda build or develop a nuclear weapon , we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response . ”
Cheney contended that the U.S. had to confront a very new type of threat : a “ low - probability , high - impact event . ”
Soon after Suskind ’s book came out , the legal scholar Cass Sunstein , who then was at the University of Chicago , pointed out that Mr. Cheney seemed to be endorsing the same “ precautionary principle ” that also animated environmentalists .
Sunstein wrote in his blog : “ According to the Precautionary Principle , it is appropriate to respond aggressively to low - probability , high - impact events  such as climate change .
Indeed , another vice president 
Al Gore  can be understood to be arguing for a precautionary principle for climate change ( though he believes that the chance of disaster is well over 1 percent ) . ”
Of course , Mr. Cheney would never accept that analogy .
Indeed , many of the same people who defend Mr. Cheney ’s One Percent Doctrine on nukes tell us not to worry at all about catastrophic global warming , where the odds are , in fact , a lot higher than 1 percent , if we stick to business as usual .
That is unfortunate , because Cheney ’s instinct is precisely the right framework with which to think about the climate issue  and this whole “ climategate ” controversy as well .
“ Climategate ” was triggered on Nov. 17 when an unidentified person hacked into the e-mails and data files of the University of East Anglia ’s Climatic Research Unit , one of the leading climate science centers in the world  and then posted them on the Internet .
In a few instances , they revealed some leading climatologists seemingly massaging data to show more global warming and excluding contradictory research .
I finally got around to finishing Shorty , my url - shortener for my vanity short - domain , ❺➠.ws .
I did the whole thing in Scala as a way to create a fully - functining application that I would use and that I could finish in my non -work time .
Scala unequivocally made this task enjoyable and quick .
J2EE , on the other hand , did not help one bit .
The Good
Scala
My Scala code is so much shorter and easier to follow than the Java equivalent .
Consider this code that , given the request path , finds a controller to handle it , and then calls the appropriate method based upon the HTTP method : route ( path ) match { case Some( controller ) => { val result = determineMethod ( request ) match { case GET => controller.get ( params ( request ) ) case PUT => controller.put( params ( request ) ) case POST => controller.post ( params ( request ) ) case DELETE => controller.delete( params ( request ) ) }
It 's highly readable , and very concise ; the Java version would 've required a lot more variables , some noisier control structures , and a lot more braces and parens .
ScalaTest
ScalaTest resulted in a lot more readable code than JUnit or TestNG would 've .
Because of Scala 's syntax , the tests are also free of weird dots and " literate " syntax that is n't quite that literate .
it ( " should respond to get for a URL that is known " ) { val controller = new OneUrlController ( hasher , " 738ddf " ) val result = controller.get ( Map ( ) ) result.getClass should equal ( classOf [ URL ] ) result.asInstanceOf [ URL ].url should equal ( " http://www.google.com " ) }
The delineation between " expected " and " received " could not be more clear .
assertEquals just is n't the same .
The latest version of ScalaTest has some BDD options that look really great .
The Bad
SBT
I really wanted to like SBT , and , while it 's a billion times better than maven , it 's still not as easy to use as I 'd like it to be .
I like :
Building code and downloading dependencies are separate
The save / run - tests loop is very handy
JavaRebel + re-deploying the webapp on file save is very handy
The test output is horrid ; big huge stack traces
Constant OutOfMemory errors that it traps and then does n't exit .
I had to kill -9 SBT a lot
errors that and then .
I had to SBT Still more complicated than shell scripts
However : I believe that a build tool should be a DSL for automating software development tasks , which means it should be more concise and easier to use than UNIX shell scripts .
Ant , Maven , and SBT fail miserably at this .
While SBT is light - years ahead by using an actual programming language , I found it very difficult to customize .
Part of this is that the scaladoc tool gives developers no help in documenting their API , but , when it comes down to it , Scala and Java are not system automation languages .
scaladoc
Scaladoc is nowhere near as powerful as Javadoc .
It makes it very hard to document how to use your code .
Scala should have a more advanced documentation system than Java , but it actually has a much more primitive one ; even RDoc is better .
Hopefully , as Scala 's popularity increases , the tools surrounding it will improve .
The Ugly
J2EE Deployment
Deployment is an underappreciated aspect of why Rails is so easy to use ; copy / push your code to the production server , tell it you are running in production , and go .
With J2EE , you get NONE of this .
If you want to alter configuration based upon environment , you are entirely on your own .
J2EE , Ant , Maven , and SBT give you no real help or support ; you have to roll it yourself .
I 'm just shocked at this omission ; J2EE is ten years old and still has not provided a solution for something that every project needs .
Amazing .
Servlet Spec
Java 5 is at end of life .
The latest released Servlet Spec still does n't support generics and is still completely schizophrenic about it 's API ( some methods use Enumeration , some use arrays , some use Iterable .
Ugh ) .
The Israeli Prime Minister has begun talks with the US Middle East Envoy
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has praised a UN proposal to regulate Iran 's uranium enrichment programme .
Speaking before talks with US Middle East envoy George Mitchell , he called it a " positive first step " in stopping Tehran developing a nuclear weapon .
Under the plan , low - enriched fuel would be further processed outside Iran .
On Thursday , the UN 's nuclear watchdog confirmed it had received Iran 's response to the directive , but its contents have not been released .
Mr Netanyahu said : " I think that the proposal to have Iran withdraw its enriched uranium , or a good portion of it , outside Iran is a positive first step . "
He also praised US President Barack Obama 's efforts in drawing global attention to the issue of Iran 's nuclear programme .
' Old tricks '
But striking a different note in Brussels , European leaders are reported to be preparing a critical draft communique expressing " grave concern " over Iranian nuclear enrichment and its " persistent failure to meet its international obligations " .
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the European Union , told the AP that Iran 's approach of " back - and - forth talks " were reminiscent of its " same old tricks . "
Tehran insists it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes , fuel and medical research , but the US and its allies have accused it of seeking nuclear weapons .
The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohamed ElBaradei said he was hopeful of reaching an agreement with Tehran when he received Iran 's response to the UN draft on Thursday .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had described the IAEA proposal as a move from " confrontation to co-operation " by Western powers , but that Iran would " not retreat even an iota " over its right to develop a civilian nuclear programme .
The plan proposes exporting most of Iran 's enriched uranium to Russia and France for conversion into fuel rods before being returned .
All signs point to a New Year 's fare hike for TTC riders , now that the Toronto Transit Commission has moved up its monthly November meeting to talk about operating costs .
Originally scheduled for the end of the month , it will take place Nov. 17 , with the TTC 's 2010 operating budget expected to be the key agenda item .
That gives the nine city councillors on the commission just a little over the six weeks the TTC requires to prepare for a fare increase .
It 's not clear how big a fare hike is being contemplated , but an increase of about 25 cents per ride raises about $ 45 million in revenue for the transit system .
For the past decade the TTC has raised fares about 10 cents per ride annually , which brings in about $ 20 million in operating revenue .
But this year Mayor David Miller pledged a price freeze to help recession - weary riders .
Chair Adam Giambrone has already rejected the idea of service cuts , and both the city and province are predicting dire financial straits for the foreseeable future , making subsidy increases look unlikely .
The TTC is nevertheless expected to ask for an increase of about $ 80 million in operating subsidies for 2010 .
There is going to be about a $ 100 million shortfall on next year 's operating budget , Giambrone said Tuesday .
That reflects higher costs across the board , 2 to 3 per cent inflation , diesel prices and rising accident claims .
There are three ways for the TTC to raise operating revenue :
Cut service , increased subsidies from government and fare hikes .
" All three options will be before the commission for consideration , " said Giambrone .
" I am not prepared to cut service . "
TTC vice - chair Joe Mihevc said , " The bottom line is the deficit for the TTC is huge , " referring to the shortfall in operating revenue generated at the fare box , where the transit system recovers only about 71 per cent of its costs .
" You can not talk about the deficit without talking about fares , " he conceded .
A 10 - cent increase usually means a loss of about 2 million rides a year .
The TTC is only just recovering from the loss of ridership in the 1990s , when it cut service and increased fares .
" It has taken us a generation to get that ridership back , " said Mihevc .
TTC surveys consistently show that service cuts are the last thing riders want .
The transit system received about $ 394 million in city subsidies on its $ 1.3 billion operating budget this year .
That was up from $ 317 million in 2008 – making another increase look unlikely for 2010 , said city budget committee chair Shelley Carroll , who pointed out that if the TTC wants to raise fares in January it is in the awkward position of having to do so before the budget committee does its review .
" We 're going to wait to see their submission , " she said .
But with new Transit City streetcar lines rolling out in a couple of years , operating costs for the TTC will continue to be a problem .
Asked if it would get more money next year , she said , " Without any hesitation , with what I know of the early operating outlook , the answer is no . "

The TTC last week announced it had reduced its 10 - year capital plan , which includes new vehicles and facilities , by $ 538 million .
That 's $ 300 million less than the $ 838 million the city asked it to cut .
The TTC is already projecting a $ 22 million shortfall on its 2009 operating budget , in part because the transferable monthly Metropass has been appealing to riders .
Instead of collecting $ 1.80 per ride , the TTC has been averaging only about $ 1.78 – an amount that adds up when multiplied by about 1.5 million rides a day , according to transit officials .
Who 's in Charge at the Transportation Security Administration ?
Nobody Critics blame mistakes like release of screening manual on TSA leadership vacuum
 --
In a massive security breach , the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) inadvertently posted online its airport screening procedures manual , including closely guarded secrets regarding special rules for diplomats and CIA and law enforcement officers .
Such glitches are made more likely , say critics , because there is no one at the helm of the TSA .
" One of the problems I see is we do n't have anybody in charge , " said Rep. Bennie Thompson ( D - Miss. ) , Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee .
" We 've been without a TSA administrator a good part of this year . "
The most sensitive parts of the Standard Operating Procedures manual were apparently redacted in a way that computer - savvy individuals easily overcame .
The 93 - page document shows sample CIA , Congressional and law enforcement credentials , which experts say would make it easy for terrorists to duplicate them .
The improperly redacted areas indicate that only 20 percent of checked bags are to be hand searched for explosives and reveal in detail the limitations of x-ray screening machines .
" When you do n't have someone at the top , you have many of these issues that we 're dealing with now , " said Thompson .
DeMint Blocks Nominee
The previous TSA dministrator , Kip Hawley , stepped down on January 20 , 2009 .
The acting administrator is Gale Rossides .
President Obama tapped Erroll Southers , currently assistant chief for homeland security at Los Angeles airport , to become the TSA 's permanent director back in September .
But Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) placed a hold on the Southers nomination earlier this month .
In October , Sen. DeMint had sent a letter to Southers asking him for " a clear answer " on whether he would permit unionization of screeners at the nation 's airports , which DeMint opposes .
In the wake of the screening manual snafu , Sen. Joe Lieberman ( ID - Conn . ) , chair of the Senate 's Homeland Security Committee , called forthe confirmation of Southers .
" The release of a Standard Operating Procedures manual for TSA officers is an embarrassing mistake that calls into question the judgment of agency managers , " said Lieberman .
" I would also add that the swift confirmation of Erroll Southers as TSA administrator will go a long way toward providing TSA the leadership it needs to put this issue behind it , and move forward . "
Thompson said the decision by " a certain senator " to block Southers was " causing significant leadership issues at the agency . "
A spokesman for Senator DeMint defended the hold on Southers .
" The last thing we need to bring to TSA is the DMV 's human resources model , " he said .
" This is pure politics by Rep. Thompson .
President Obama and liberals in Congress are trying to pay back unions for their political support in the last elections , despite the fact that unionizing TSA screeners will hurt security efforts to protect Americans . "
" If unions take over TSA and end the performance - based criteria for advancement and promote based on your seniority as a union member , " said the spokesman , " you 'll see even more errors like the one you saw yesterday . "
Damaging Information in Screening Manual
Officials say the most damaging information in the unredacted manual is what size electrical wire can go undetected by airport screening machines -- valuable information for a bomb maker .
The document also includes a list of VIPs and federal officials who can get specialized or no screening , as well as items that screeners can opt not to check , including wheelchairs , footwear of the disabled , prosthetic devices and casts and orthopedic shoes .
Said former TSA inspector general Clark Kent Ervin , " It obviously gives a road map to terrorists as to exactly how to exploit the weaknesses in our aviation security system .
And it 's particularly galling because we 've spent the bulk of our money and attention since 9/11 on the aviation sector . "
The TSA was created after the 9/11 attacks as a response to the ease with which hijackers were able to get through airport security .
But it has been a troubled agency from the beginning .
" I 'm afraid to say that there has been a pattern of incompetence and ineptitude on the part of the TSA over the years , " said Ervin .
" There have been improvements in TSA , but it appears as though these kinds of things happen again and again . "
In a written statement the TSA said the inadvertently released screening manual is an outdated version of procedures from last year that has since been updated six times .
Even so , the TSA has launched a full investigation .
One thing officials have already learned is that if they had blacked out the sensitive parts with a magic marker , instead of a fancy computer program , there would have been no way for this breach to happen .

So as everyone is focused on the benign picture of initial claims in the last week which was " only " 474,000 , the number of people rolling off continuing benefits has exploded and is now a stunning 592,579 only in the last two week .
Look for this number to keep going into the stratosphere as the 6 month continuing claims cliff keeps getting hit by more and more people who are unemployed and keep looking not only for believable change , but actual jobs to go with it .
And here is the chart that the administration would love to keep under lock and seal : the cumulative number of people on Emergency Insurance .
At this rate those collecting EUC will surpass those on continuing claims ( 5.5 million ) within a month .
Four intrepid adventurers who set sail across the Irish Sea in a modified Renault Laguna car arrived safely in Scotland last night .
Crowds cheered the men as they pulled into Portpatrick harbour almost seven hours after having set off from Donaghadee in Northern Ireland .
Inspired by BBC ’s Top Gearprogramme , Peter Martin ( 38 ) , from Bangor , Co Down , adapted the car - which he bought for £ 100 and named the Sir Tristram , after a naval landing ship - with foam , an outboard motor and a bilge - pump .
With friends Carl McConkey , Rick Miles and Mark Farrell , he took it on trial trips around the Copeland Islands , off Co Down , before the audacious 40 kilometre amphibious crossing .
Mr Martin , a lecturer in leadership and management at Belfast Metropolitan College , said they could not quite believe their feat when they landed ashore .
“ One of the lads kept saying everybody here has Scottish accents - we ’ve actually sailed to Scotland in a Renault Laguna , ” he said .
The efforts of the team , who would not describe themselves as experienced sailors , were slightly hampered by serious bouts of sea-sickness .
But despite persistent vomiting , waves up to four metres and having to constantly bail out water leaking through the accelerator and clutch , the men refused to abandon their craft .
“ We ’re all really tired , but obviously we ’re elated too , ” said Mr Martin , who is getting married in three months .
“ This just proves what you can do when you put your mind to it . ”
The crew are now back safely in Northern Ireland .
The car was brought back on a Stena Line ferry .
Mr Martin intends to auction the Sir Tristramon eBay to raise money for the Help For Heroes charity , which raises money for wounded men and women from Britain 's armed forces .
While it is believed to be the first crossing between Ireland and Scotland in a home - adapted car , two men already lay claim to being the first to make an amphibious journey across the North Channel .
Ivan Tinman , former chief of Belfast ’s Downtown Radio , said he and friend Sam Allen sailed from Mull of Kintyre to Ballycastle , Co Antrim on August 3rd , 1968 .
That journey was in a German - manufactured Amphicar , which was specially designed for use on land and water .

Let me open this post about judicial pay with a personal anecdote , if you 'll indulge me , LBers :
Back during my second and third years of law school , I landed several interviews for federal clerkships .
One required me to buy a plane ticket , at my own expense , and fly a good distance to a mid-sized city and spring for a night in a hotel .

A new gîte in Nantes offers guests the chance to live as a rodent for the night - complete with fur costumes and a romantic hamster wheel for two
Were Franz Kafka alive today - and were he to have developed an uncharacteristic interest in European city breaks - it would be interesting to know what he made of the latest addition to France 's panoply of weekend getaway options .
For while there are no gigantic insects lurking in the corners of Nantes ' newest urban bolthole - and , one would hope , no more than the standard quotient of existential angst - the writer might have appreciated the gite 's raison d'être : metamorphosis , of a sort .
Tucked away down an unremarkable side - street near the centre of the western French city , the Villa Hamster offers guests the " unique " opportunity to leave their species at the door and live the life of a rodent .
Urging those curious to enter into its " poetic " world of woodchippings and fur costumes , its website asks : " Is it possible to put myself in the place of my hamster ? "
Lost in translation ?
... Villa Hamster 's human wheel .
Photograph : Cedric Chasse
A compact space of 18m2 in a building dating back to the 1700s , the unusual rental home has been deliberately designed to evoke a hamster 's cage .
It boasts such authentic facilities as containers of organic grain , a water tube which guests can sip , and a double bed accessible only by a step ladder and a quick scramble on all fours .
The pièce de résistance is a 2 m - wide metal wheel in which both residents , if they wish , can take a turn side - by - side .
So where did the idea come from ?
Yann Falquerho , the 42 - year - old scenographer who lets the property through his quirky urban gîte company , Un Coin Chez Soi , told me that he and Frédéric Tabary , the interior designer with whom he works , had wanted to find something that was simply " very funny " .
" We wanted to create a place that was a real gîte - a place where you could sleep and be comfortable - but also where you could have a real experience , " he explained .
" We wanted it to be eccentric and we decided that the funniest experience would be to become an animal . "
Tabary , 41 , was marginally more reflective .
In comments to the French media , he said he " wanted people to chill out and smile in a society which is nowadays completely paralysed and formatted " .
Whatever their intentions , they seem to be doing something right .
Since opening a fortnight ago , the Villa has been submerged with requests for visits from both inquisitive media and paying guests .
But at the moment most people are choosing to keep their hamster transformation to a Saturday night - only experience , often as a present to a friend or partner .
Falquerho , who is raising the rate from € 99 ( £ 88 ) for bookings made this year to € 150 euros in 2010 , insists his creation is suitable for longer stays .
" It 's not just a toy .
It 's a place you can really be comfortable in , " he said , adding that the shower , kitchen area and soon - to - arrive WiFi were all standard gîte facilities .
Though their homeland of western France has brought them success , the Nantais duo now has its eyes on projects further afield .
They are scouting for properties in Paris and in London , hopeful that their quirky spirit will appeal across the Channel .
A UK version of the hamster experience could be in the pipeline , said Falquerho , or even the company 's boldest creation to date : an apartment which aims to take occupants " back to their origins " .
" By that we mean their mother 's womb , " he explained .
" There will be lots of light and sound to make you feel as though you are in a uterus . "
Suddenly the Villa Hamster seems perfectly orthodox .

On Tuesday , Senate Democrats beat back Jeff Sessions ’ filibuster of Obama ’s first judicial nominee – Judge David Hamilton – by a reassuring margin of 70 - 29 .
Sessions lost ten of his fellow Republicans , including conservatives like Hatch , Cornyn , and Thune , and Hamilton will be confirmed Thursday afternoon to the Seventh Circuit .
That ’s the good news .
The bad news is that the GOP is winning the battle for the federal courts .
Just a few short years ago , right - wing Senators denounced filibusters of President Bush ’s nominees in the strongest possible language and threatened to employ the “ nuclear option . ”
Sessions went even further – he claimed Democrats were violating the Constitution by blocking any Bush nominee ( no matter how extreme ) .
But some time after November 4 , 2008 , his interpretation of the Constitution must have changed dramatically .
Now a Democrat is in the White House , and – hypocrisy be damned !
– Sessions is vehemently pro-filibuster and pro-obstruction .
And the worst part is that he ’s been successful .
Judge Hamilton was nominated in March to general acclaim .
He received the highest possible rating from the ABA , both his home - state Senators strongly endorsed him ( including senior Senate Republican Dick Lugar ) , and even the head of the Indianapolis Federalist Society backed him .
It does n’t get much better than that .
But the nomination was dragged out for months by the GOP .
As a result , Hamilton will become just the seventh Obama nominee to be confirmed to the federal bench .
By contrast , nearly 30 such Bush nominees had been confirmed at the same point .
We ’re talking lifetime appointments to the highest courts in our land .
President Obama obviously has his hands full , but he ca n’t afford to neglect this crucial aspect of his legacy .
But so far , Obama has been playing into the hands of the GOP obstructionists .
He ’s nominated fewer than half as many people as Bush had at this point .
That has got to change , and quickly .
The Obama administration has a window of just 4 - 5 months to return some semblance of balance to the federal bench before the mid-term elections .
The choice is simple : act now to fill the judicial pipeline with highly qualified progressive nominees , or let Sessions and Bush win .
After losing his belt to Rashad Evans , and then suffering a humbling knockout defeat to Anderson Silva , former light heavyweight champion Forrest Griffin got his career back on track at UFC 106 with a split decision victory over Tito Ortiz .
Immediately after the event there was a strong push , from Ortiz in particular , for a rematch , with both Griffin and UFC boss Dana White appearing willing to entertain the idea .
There was also speculation that the two could coach the 11th season of The Ultimate Fighter ahead of the rubber match .
That idea now appears to have been put on hold however after the weekend announcement that Ortiz will now coach opposite Chuck Liddell on the upcoming season of the show .
Another likely match - up appeared to be Antonio Rogerio Nogueira , who got off to an impressive start in the division by convincingly defeating up and coming prospect Luiz Cane .
In a recent poll on this site asking who Nogueira should fight next , the most popular match - up by far with 44 % of the vote was Forrest Griffin .
Despite the interest in that fight , it has just been announced that Nogueira will now face Brandon Vera at UFC 109 instead .
So where does that leave Forrest Griffin ?
Firstly he needs time to heal from a foot injury which is likely to keep him from competing in the early stages of 2010 .
After that Griffin himself has stated that he wants to continue to challenge himself against the top fighters in the division .
The problem is that along with the fighters mentioned earlier , many of the divisions top stars are already tied up with other fights .
It seems unlikely that he will be next in line for a title shot , and to be fair it ’s not something that he himself has called for .
Even if there were plans to line him up against the loser of the Lyoto Machida – Shogun Rua rematch , that fight is n’t scheduled until May 1st next year , and the UFC wo n’t want Griffin on the shelf for that long .
A rematch with Rashad Evans is currently out of the picture since Evans is set to fight Thiago Silva at UFC 108 in January , and then will have his hands full with a much anticipated rematch with fellow TUF 10 coach Quinton Rampage Jackson .
Thiago Silva could remain a possibility , particularly if he were to emerge victorious against Evans .
If he lost however , this may be a fight that is unlikely to capture the fans imagination .
One option that stands out is Rich Franklin who is expected to make the move to 205 lbs after spending his last two fights at a catchweight of 195 lbs .
He is currently taking an extended break from the octagon after his knockout loss to Vitor Belfort , but is expected back in the spring / early summer .
That would appear to fit in with
While he has lost some of his main event credibility in recent times , Franklin is still a well respected fighter , and a fight between two of the organizations most likable stars would be a marketable fight .
A potential stumbling block is that , after coming off a loss , the promotion may be looking to give Franklin a more gentle introduction to the division .
Beyond that another choice could be the fast rising Jon Jones .
Though he lost to Matt Hamill at the weekend due to a disqualification , his dominating performance impressed all who witnessed it , and suggests he is ready to take a step up in competition .
It has to be remembered however that Jones is still only 22 , and has been fighting professionally for less than 2 years .
Will the UFC be willing to risk his continued development and growing reputation by throwing him in against a former champion so soon ?
Personally I think the Rich Franklin fight makes the most sense from the available options , but as always it will be interesting to see the UFC ’s take on it in the new year .

You ca n’t make this stuff up .
A deer , a resident of Rock Creek Park , made a very unwise decision on Sunday .
This poor deer decided to take one small step for deer … and one giant leap for deerkind – right into the lion exhibit at the National Zoo.
Merry Christmas to the two female lions that quickly became interested in their new dinner menu .
But WAIT – not so fast .
This little deer is a survivor .
NBC 4 has the full story here .
According to the article , the whole ordeal took about 45 minutes and ended up with the staff at the Zoo rescuing the deer after its valiant fight to get away .
Pics or it did n’t happen , right ?
How about video .
Even better .
You must watch this video of the deer escaping the female lions as a large crowd cheers on Bambi !
This is seriously like watching the Discovery Channel ’s footage of a lion attack in Africa .
Must watch .
( Watch the video after the jump )
Dear Mr. Deer ,
You may not be smart … but you sure are brave .
UPDATE : Unfortunately , it looks like the deer had to be put down due to its injuries , according to WaPo .

Seedy Mario Bros : 10 Dark Depictions of Mario and Luigi
Mario and Luigi have been around for a very long time , and they ’ve become ingrained into modern society in a way .
They ’re very recognizable , they ’ve appeared in tons of games , and they have n’t changed too much in over two decades .
For most of us , Mario and Luigi represent a very pleasant part of childhood , and most Mario fan art reflects that .
But then there are some artists who decide to go an entirely different direction with their homages to the arcade machine heroes .
Instead of the bright , rounded , only vaguely violent world of the Super Mario Brothers games , some artists re-imagine the game world as a more realistic place , where enemies actually bleed when you stomp on their heads .
This painting from Handre de Jager is admittedly sort of disturbing , but hilarious at the same time .
Winona Nelson ‘s vision is equal parts odd and awesome .
It ’s strange to see familiar baddies cast in a slightly more realistic light , but the entire painting is gorgeous .
The realistic Mario and Luigi look ready to fight as they cross over the Shy Guy - infested log bridge that ’s well - known to any lover of Super Mario Brothers 2 .
Alexei Balashov explores what the famous brothers might look like if they were actual plumbers with a mean streak a mile wide .
The crying goomba does n’t do much to win sympathy for the gruff - looking Mario and Luigi .
Artist Ryan Wood re-imagines Mario as an overweight , grouchy , and somewhat world - weary plumber .
We have to imagine that chasing bad guys and hitting boxes with your head all day would make you a little irritable , but we pity the poor Princess when this sour dude wheezes his way up the castle stairs to rescue her .
DeviantArt member Robot Pencil sees Mario and Luigi in a more serious , realistic , and somewhat tragic way .
In his vision , Luigi is an addict strung out on star power .
There ’s no backstory for Mario , but we like to think he ’ll come to Luigi ’s rescue in the end .
This awesome piece from Rob Sheridan places a narrow window on the in - game world so that the edges are pixelated 8 - bit innocence , but the middle is a treacherous real - life danger zone .
The goomba ’s claws and fangs are the perfect touches to make this sweet little mushroom into a vicious killing machine .
Bob Dob ( also the creator of the Mario and Luigi mug shots at the top ) pictures Donkey Kong and Mario settling their differences and sitting down on some scaffolding for a drink and a smoke .
Gary Storkamp takes a different angle when depicting the relationship between DK and Mario .
Here , they ’re still fighting while Pauline watches their fight helplessly .
While slightly more cartoony than some of the others , this piece from DeviantArt member Hugh puts huge personality into the brothers .
Clearly they ’re not pleased about something .
Could it be that Princess has gone and gotten herself into trouble yet again ?
In another sign of how deep the global recession has become , the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach on Friday reported their worst combined import statistics for September in nine years .
September is often the busiest month at the nation ’s biggest port complex , making it one of the best barometers of the health of the economy and international trade .
The port of Los Angeles received 309,078 containers packed with imported goods in September , representing a decline of 16 % from the same month last year and 27 % from September 2006 , L.A. 's best month ever for imports .
Long Beach received 224,924 import containers in September , a drop of 19 % from a year earlier and 32 % from September 2007 , the port ’s best September ever .
For the first nine months of the year , imports , exports and empty containers through the port of Los Angeles were down 16 % at just under 5 million containers while the Long Beach port saw a decline of nearly 25 % at just under 3.7 million containers , compared with the same period last year .

As dismal as those figures are for the two ports , which rank first and second in the U.S. in container volume and together rank fifth in the world , a greater worry goes beyond the immediate and substantial loss of local trade - related jobs :
Some of the ports ’ most important tenants were so poorly positioned for the downturn that they might sink completely in a sea of billions of dollars of red ink , experts say .
“ Without a doubt , the Southern California ports should be worried , ” said Neil Dekker , an analyst at Drewry Shipping Consultants in London who produces container industry forecasts .
“ Companies will go bust ; freight rates may take years to recover . ”
The outlook could hardly be more ominous , said John Husing , an independent analyst with Economics and Politics Inc. in Redlands who follows the effects of global trade on the Inland Empire .
Seeing nothing but smooth sailing ahead for the globalization that has reshaped international trade , the world ’s shipping lines committed themselves years into the future to orders for new container ships that have as much as 69 % more cargo carrying capacity than the vessels that were the world ’s largest in 2004 , Husing said .

He described it as “ the worst recession in modern times hitting an industry that was geared for the opposite of what they are facing . ”
Through the first half of 2009 , each of the world ’s 17 biggest shipping lines were in the red , according to Paris - based AXS - Alphaliner , which maintains online databases for shipping industry professionals
Denmark - based APM - Maersk had losses of $ 540 million .
Cosco Container Lines of China lost $ 671 million .
Hapag - Lloyd , Germany ’s biggest container line , lost $ 680 million .
NYK of Japan posted net losses of $ 694 million , AXS - Alphaliner research shows .
Jan Tiedemann , a shipping analyst with AXS - Alphaliner , said the companies were dealing with less cargo , lower freight rates for the cargo that remains , contractual obligations for new ships they do n’t need and the inability to rid themselves of older vessels quickly enough by scrapping them to reduce overcapacity .
Advertisement
“ No one in the industry is making money , ” Tiedemann said .
Dekker of Drewry Shipping Consultants said shipping lines had been able to increase their freight rates for handling a 40 - foot container from less than $ 900 during the summer to $ 1,450 in September , but he added that “ last September , they would have been able to charge $ 2,000 for the same container , so they are not even back to breaking even yet . ”
As landlords , seaports have been responding to their tenants in ways that would make a financially struggling apartment dweller green with envy .
Kathryn McDermott , deputy executive director of business development for the Port of Los Angeles , said there was a 10 % discount on the rate that customers normally had to pay to move containers through the port .
She added that the port ’s Infrastructure Cargo Fee had been postponed indefinitely “ until we are sure that we need it . ”
Advertisement
“ We have had customers ask us for help and we have looked very carefully at what we can do , ” said McDermott , who said the reductions amounted to about $ 20 million in relief .
“ The majority of them said that we really needed to look at our discretionary cargo , business that could go through other ports .
These changes are aimed at trying to protect that cargo . ”
The Port of Long Beach has taken similar steps , spokesman Art Wong said .
Tenants have not asked for full - scale renegotiation of leases , he said , in part because of new requirements they might face , such as environmental restrictions .
“ The thing about a long - term lease is that you are protected from new requirements .
Reopening them is a big roll of the dice , ” Wong said .
If there is a silver lining for Southern California , it ’s that the trade from Asia to the West Coast is expected to recover faster than other trade routes , according to IHS Global Insight , a business research firm in Lexington , Mass .
Advertisement
IHS Global Insight also said retailers that had been looking to diversify their warehouse and distribution networks to rely less on Southern California had delayed those plans because of the recession and stayed put .
Paul Bingham , managing director of global commerce and trade for IHS Global Insight , said his firm predicted a 10.1 % growth rate next year over 2009 levels in international trade , but he added that the figure masked a great deal of weakness .
Part of what will make 2010 ’s international trade figures a double - digit improvement over 2009 will be rebuilding inventories for warehouses , not direct sales .
“ It will sound like a booming market in 2010 , but it will come after a year in which trade fell by 20 % , ” Bingham said .
“ There will be a recovery , but not at the trade rates we were accustomed to in 2006 and 2007 . ”

news Nowhere to Hide from Google Street View
Yesterday ’s launch of Google Street View created a new wave of digital tourism , with most of us starting with our home address and then scouring the mostly anonymous bodies nearby for flickers of recognition .
As is par for the course with the service , the camera sometimes captures some unusual , quirky , and mysterious events .
Here are some of our local favourites ( so far ) .
On January 26 , 1950 , when General Curtis E. LeMay , commander of the U.S. Air Force Strategic Air Command , attended yet another conference to discuss the next U.S. long - range heavy bomber , his mind was likely already made up .
The Convair B - 36 was soon to be obsolete , and a variety of successors had been proposed .
But Boeing bombers had served the U.S. military well during World War II , and if LeMay got his way — and he usually did — the next big bomber would be another Boeing product : the B - 52 Stratofortress .
The potential contract was huge , and U.S. aircraft manufacturers brought ambitious proposals to the table .
One of the designs — the Model 1211 - J— came from the Douglas Aircraft Company in Santa Monica , California .
Never had a bomber looked so capable — on paper .
Powered by four turboprop engines , the Model 1211 - J was a colossus — 160 feet long with a wingspan of 227 feet , about the size of the Convair behemoth it was to replace .
It was designed around a new 43,000 - pound conventional bomb but could carry nuclear weapons as well .
It could also carry its own fighter escorts , as parasites under its immense wings .
A variety of fighter types were suggested , including Douglas ' new ogival - wing jet , the F4D Skyray .
The fighters ' jet engines were to be powered up to assist the carrier bomber during takeoff ; refueling of the fighters was to take place while they were stowed on the mothership 's underwing pylons .
Though the concept of parasite aircraft had an appealing ingenuity , flying them was fraught with difficulty .
Flight testing had revealed that turbulent airflow would form under the carrier aircraft , causing severe problems as the fighter attempted to reattach itself to the host aircraft .
Would the Model 1211 - J have succeeded as a parasite platform ?
" The combination of the totally new bomber and the totally new fighter , attaching itself in the direct path of the turboprop propeller wash , is frightening to contemplate , " says Walt Boyne , a retired B - 52 pilot and former director of the National Air and Space Museum .
" The inclusion almost smacks of either desperation or a sense of humor on the designers ' part . "
( A few years later , the parasite concept was rendered obsolete by the use of inflight refueling . )
In place of the parasite fighters , large underwing drop tanks and special - purpose pods could be substituted to provide , according to the Douglas proposal , " extreme versatility in operations . "
Douglas engineers imagined pods — " droppable or not as desired , " the proposal states — that could carry reconnaissance or radar equipment , countermeasures , even personnel to supplement the bomber 's nine - man crew .
One drawing shows the pods in a photo - reconnaissance configuration , complete with cameras and even a small film - processing lab .
Without the parasites , the Douglas bomber could defend itself with a choice of radar - controlled 20 - mm cannon or Hughes MX - 904 self - guided missiles , stored in an internal rotary launcher like an oversized Colt six - shooter .
The Douglas team had also proposed droppable takeoff gear positioned under the outer section of the 1211 - J's enormous wings .
" Using droppable gear is always a last resort , " says Boyne .
" The B - 52 had retractable tip gear , which was a heavier but more sensible solution . "
By including so many options , the Model 1211 - J's designers tried to make the bomber a paragon of multi-tasking self - sufficiency .
They had hoped to sell the Air Force not just a single bomber but a family of aircraft , with a variety of airframes to choose from , including custom options and mission - specific add - ons .
But would asking so much of the 1211 - J compromise its ability to do its main job : put bombs on target ?
" I 've always been a minimalist in aircraft design , " says aerospace historian and author Dick Hallion .
" When you take a look at this Douglas design , there 's a lot of frou - frou .
There are a lot of things here that would n't work out well operationally .
There are a lot of issues that make turboprops unreliable : gearbox issues , shafting issues , the propellers themselves .
These are all complex problems that need to be worked out . "
And even if Douglas engineers could have solved the 1211 - J's problems , the bomber 's fussy design would have made it a maintenance nightmare .
The Douglas designers of course hoped to dazzle the Air Force with possibility , but no matter how much versatility they put into the 1211 - J , it was n't enough to interest LeMay , who kept pushing for the more practical , turbojet - powered B - 52 .
In the spring of 1951 , Air Force chief of staff General Hoyt Vandenberg approved the Boeing proposal .
Given the stupendous — and ongoing — career of the B - 52 , this was certainly a wise decision .
The history of the dollar is one marked by a dominance unrivaled in history .
Following the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 , which established the dollar as the global reserve currency , Americans have enjoyed an era of unprecedented wealth and prominence .
The impressive growth in America could not have occurred without a stable dollar .
Stable currencies are the unheralded but undeniable foundation of any vibrant economy .
Stable currencies allow for longer term transactions and help instill confidence in the public , which is critical , since the value of any fiat currency is ultimately a function of public confidence .
That being said , there are several factors that lead me to believe the dollar is headed for a precipitous decline , and that this decline will exacerbate what I perceive currently as a Depression in our country .
The value of a currency is determined by a number of variables .
In this article , I will focus on the dynamics of demand , supply , current account deficits , and aggregate government debt .
Demand for Dollars
The dollar has enjoyed a boost in demand and an exchange rate premium due to its privileged role as the world 's reserve currency .
As a function of this status , world trade is , for the most part , transacted in dollars .
However , recent developments on the periphery have slowly undermined the dollar 's dominant position in global trade .
World trade in dollars has been declining since the start of the decade .
Recent currency swap agreements between countries , mostly involving China , have been used to bypass the dollar in global trade .
Arrangements such as these threaten the dollar 's role as global reserve currency , removing any support to the dollar 's value such an arrangement provided .
This decreased demand is clearly reflected by a falling percentage of foreign reserves held in dollars .
Further , in a low interest rate environment , the dollar has become the carry trade currency of choice .
Investors have long been waiting for a powerful countertrend rally in the dollar , but as the example in the yen shows , prolonged weakness in carry trade currencies can and do occur .
Also keep in mind that alternative assets , such as gold , become much more attractive in an environment where yields are essentially 0 % .
Massive Supply
It 's been well - documented that the Fed has embarked on a campaign of massive monetary stimulus .
Unfortunately , it 's hard to quantify the extent of money supply growth , since the government has stopped reporting M3 money supply figures .
The real problem brewing under the surface are accumulating bank reserves , which can be thought of as a proxy for risk aversion .
Once these reserves are deployed , expect inflation to increase significantly .
Sooner or later , banks will have to focus on their core business , which is lending to consumers .
Here is a chart of the quickly accumulating bank reserves .
Is there any question there will eventually be a flood of dollars hitting the system ?
Current Account Deficits
Current account deficits are the quantifiable measure of a country 's profligacy and overconsumption .
Current account deficits are historically a short - term solution to a nation 's underproductivity , which must eventually be settled through the balancing of capital and current accounts .
As a nation continually funds consumption via debt , its currency naturally becomes less and less valuable as a medium of exchange .
Current account deficits as a percent of GDP in the U.S. have exploded to troubling levels , especially since President Nixon removed the last vestiges of our link to gold in 1971 .
Over the long run , the value of a currency is inversely correlated to the level of current account deficits .
Persistent imbalances in current account deficits will weaken a currency without exception .
The downward trend over the last decade in the dollar evidences the detrimental effect of long - term current account deficits .
Notice how gold , as an alternative to the dollar , has risen in response to rising current account deficits .
U.S. Government Debt and the Treasury Market
Moving forward , the Treasury market will inordinately dictate major moves in the dollar .
But before I explain why , I want to briefly overview the relationship between treasury debt , inflation , and the value of the dollar under the Maestro , Alan Greenspan .
The " great moderation " in the Greenspan years was facilitated by the recycling of dollars into our capital accounts - such as stocks , treasury debt , and agency debt .
This meant that inflation was temporarily stifled as dollars were sterilized in debt instruments , while asset prices received a jolt from the attendant low interest rates .
Furthermore , the tremendous demand for U.S. capital products proved to be supportive of the dollar .
If there ever were a period of getting " something for nothing " in America , it was during this era of massively inflated asset prices , and moderate consumer price inflation .
Now what happens when our debt grows to a level that forces the government to become a major player in the bond market ?
Foreign actors will start unloading their treasury debt , especially on the long end of the yield curve , to an increasingly overburdened government .
As demand for Treasuries falls , yields will rise , which makes the burdens of servicing debt greater .
Due to collapsing tax receipts and excessive stimulus measures to stave off the effects of this crisis , our budget deficit has exploded in 2009 .
This phenomenon is what forces our government to " monetize " debt .
The monumental and ever - increasing level of debt the government has directly taken on through its program of quantitative easing is troubling .
The reason is simple : in an inflationary environment , the Fed will be inhibited from containing inflation by selling bonds in the open market , and thereby , soaking liquidity from the system .
Due to the sheer size of our program of monetization , any move to sell treasury instruments will likely be met with panic from foreign investors .
This is something to keep in mind moving forward .
Total Debt Including Unfunded Liabilities
And now we come to the elephant in the room : aggregate government debt , including unfunded liabilities .
Decades of kicking the debt can down the road in Ponzi scheme entitlement programs , like Social Security , has created a behemoth of debt that is quite literally unpayable .
Absent a growth miracle , and a bigger miracle of fiscal austerity by our government , there is no way we can fund these accruing liabilities through our dwindling tax base .
According to the Dallas Fed , current unfunded liabilities are about $ 100 trillion dollars .
While a restructuring of entitlement programs is absolutely necessary , it is not politically viable .
If recent government actions are any indication , our government will attempt to mask insolvency through the printing press .
Conclusion : Implications of a Weaker Dollar
A weaker dollar poses tremendous complications for Americans .
For one , it makes imports more expensive , which is effectively inflation .
Ultimately , this means a standard of living lower than what we have come to expect .
If confidence in the dollar totally erodes , then things will really get ugly .
While we could possibly stave off an inflationary spiral if we enacted the correct policy right now , the reappointment of " Helicopter " Ben Bernanke all but destroyed any hopes of a stable currency .
The inflationary spiral of the late 70's and early 80's was brought to a halt through the politically unpopular actions of Paul Volcker .
It 's counterintuitive , but central bankers that are denigrated politically are doing their job correctly .
Celebrated central bankers like Ben Bernanke are succumbing to political pressure , making decisions based on expedience rather than prudence .
The inherent deficiencies in our system virtually guarantee that long - term implications of massive debt will be ignored .
Unfortunately , the " long - term " may finally be upon us , and a dollar collapse of shocking proportions is increasingly likely .
This Depression is just getting started .

The ...
Sun Meng has been given the cold shoulder by his community after the extraordinary picture of him cowering naked outside the flat were posted on the internet .
Peyton Manning , Super Bowl winning quarterback and three time NFL MVP , revealed when he was the Indianapolis Colts quarterback what makes him one of the greatest gunslingers to ever grace gridiron : the use of Gaelic !
Manning mesmerizes his opponents by calling plays in Irish at the line of scrimmage that only he and his offense can understand .
Well , sort of .
Now , while he may not have been 100 percent serious in this video ( see link above ) , Manning can be heard rattling off what appears to be his version of one , two , three ( a haon , a do , a tri ) in Gaelic .
Even center Jeff Saturday was a bit perplexed by Peyton ’s grasp of Gaelic .
“ I mean we all speak regular Gaelic , but Peyton is into his own thing , you know , it takes me forever to translate it . ”
When asked how he picked up the little used language - shame on all of us who do not use it - he gave props to his brother .
“ My brother Cooper is the one who taught me Gaelic , he 's really into it , he has got personalized license plates , ” says Manning .
When asked if his brother had plates that said “ Mr. Gaelic , ” Manning asked the interviewer to stop making fun of his brother !
The Colts crack a few more jokes in the piece , which is linked above , and show that a happy team off the field is a winning one on it .
The Colts took care of the New York Jets in the AFC Championship game Sunday , during which Manning methodically let his team through an early storm to a 30 - 17 victory .
The omens are good for Manning , who incidentally got married on St. Patrick 's Day , as this year 's Super Bowl is being in the same stadium where he won his only championship ring in 2006 when his team beat the Chicago Bears 29 - 17 in Super Bowl XLI .

Here 's the kind of freedom and liberation you get in exchange for a million dead bodies : Iraqi court rules Guardian defamed Nouri al - Maliki .
What exactly did the Guardian do to merit this judgment -- which , perhaps not incidentally , directs them to put more than $ 100,000 in Nouri al - Maliki 's pocket ?
Something which , admittedly , is quite shocking in our day : reporting .
The Guardian 's Ghaith Abdul - Ahad , who has contributed a remarkable series of stories from the frontlines and backrooms of the Iraqi cauldron , interviewed three members of the Iraqi national intelligence service " who claimed that the prime minister was beginning to run Iraqi affairs with an authoritarian hand . "
And for this " revelation " -- which is akin to claiming that the sun rises in the east , or that the Pope served with the Nazis -- the Guardian was hauled into an Iraqi court for defamation .
After a number of expert witnesses demolished the case on legal grounds , a new five - member panel of government toadies weighed in to argue that " Iraqi publishing law did not allow foreigners to publish articles critical of the prime minister or president , or to interfere in Iraqi internal affairs . "
To which the Guardian laconically appended this little fact : " The advice appeared to overlook the fact that Abdul - Ahad is an Iraqi citizen . "
It surely comes as no surprise that the court rejected the expert testimony in favor of the toadies ' playful sporting with the truth .
But this is to be expected given the , well , authoritarian hand that the local satrap has been given by the occupying power .
As the Guardian notes :
Journalists covering routine violence in Iraq have reported being assaulted by security officials in recent weeks , in the wake of two huge bombings since early August that destroyed three government ministries and the Baghdad governorate , calling the effectiveness of government security forces into question .
And as we noted here just a few weeks ago , it is not only the Guardian who is nailing the truth about the grubby , kleptocratic police state that America is building in the conquered land ; even the Economist --
the veritable Bible of the Anglo - American Establishment -- paints a grim portrait of the Iraqi regime installed at the point of American guns : a sinkhole of torture , execution , increasing repression and brazen power - grabs :
The Shia -led government has overseen a ballooning of the country ’s security apparatus .
Human - rights violations are becoming more common .
In private many Iraqis , especially educated ones , are asking if their country may go back to being a police state .
Old habits from Saddam Hussein ’s era are becoming familiar again .
Torture is routine in government detention centres .
“ Things are bad and getting worse , even by regional standards , ” says Samer Muscati , who works for Human Rights Watch , a New York - based lobby .
His outfit reports that , with American oversight gone ( albeit that the Americans committed their own shameful abuses in such places as Abu Ghraib prison ) , Iraqi police and security people are again pulling out fingernails and beating detainees , even those who have already made confessions .
A limping former prison inmate tells how he realised , after a bout of torture in a government ministry that lasted for five days , that he had been relatively lucky .
When he was reunited with fellow prisoners , he said he saw that many had lost limbs and organs .
The domestic - security apparatus is at its busiest since Saddam was overthrown six years ago , especially in the capital .
In July the Baghdad police reimposed a nightly curfew , making it easier for the police , taking orders from politicians , to arrest people disliked by the Shia - led government .
In particular , they have been targeting leaders of the Awakening Councils , groups of Sunnis , many of them former insurgents and sympathisers , who have helped the government to drive out or capture Sunni rebels who refused to come onside .
Instead of being drawn into the new power set - up , many of them in the past few months have been hauled off to prison .
In the most delicate cases , the arrests are being made by an elite unit called the Baghdad Brigade , also known as “ the dirty squad ” , which is said to report to the office of the prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki .
CARACAS , Venezuela —
It has taken Venezuela by storm , but it seems that Facebook and other social networking sites also come with their perils .
Police here revealed that a pair of students at a private university in Caracas had been robbing their virtual friends ’ homes using information they had compiled using Facebook .
Police raided the apartment of one of two students who , working in tandem with another couple , had been using Facebook to befriend classmates .
They then used the information their new “ friends ” posted on their profiles to find out where they lived , what they owned and when they were not at home .
" They observe the families ’ movements , they study the residencies — the comings and goings , the security measures , " said Wilmer Flores Trosel , director of the CICPC , Venezuela ’s eqivalent of the FBI .
Security analysts in Venezuela say it is becoming increasingly frequent for criminals to use social networking sites such as Facebook , Twitter , Sonico and Hi5 as a source of information for house robberies , fraud and kidnappings .
And it 's not just the criminals capitalizing on this online data source , the police too are using it , to go after both hard - core criminals and political protesters .
In a country with little tolerance for dissent , many fear the government has designs on controlling these sites .
And the crimes aided by Facebook , might give them cause to do just that .
“ There 's a certain amount of intelligence work involved in kidnapping that Facebook makes easier , ” said Roberto Briceno Leon , director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence .
“ Before , what did kidnappers do ?
They could spend months checking accounts , studying a person 's daily movements in order to be able to plan the kidnapping .
That implies an investment .
Now , Facebook makes that easier . ”
Briceno Leon said that even an innocent photograph of a user ’s home could reveal valuable information about security systems that could be used to plan robberies or kidnappings .
Leon 's Venezuelan Observatory of Violence did a survey and they estimate that there were between 8,000 and 9,000 kidnappings in Venezuela in 2008 .
The official figure for last year was 554 but most kidnappings go unreported because victims ' families prefer not to involve the police as they are often involved in the kidnappings .
Venezuelans are no strangers to crime .
Murder rates have reached record highs in recent years and they have been a part of daily life since the late 1980s .
Banks take elaborate precautions to avoid fraud .
Making a simple withdrawal can involve heavy scrutiny and a customer often has to be photographed and fingerprinted before the money is released .
But Venezuelans are not similarly cautious when it comes to the personal details they publicize on social networks .
There are 435,992 users signed up to three " Venezuela " pages on Facebook , and Facebook is used widely in the country for party invitations and political protests .
Briceno Leon said that social networking sites offer the illusion of safety but what may seem like an innocent confession often opens up a window into the private life of an individual .
“ People feel intimate and safe , they do n't feel like they are on the street , ” he said .
“ That 's why people cease to take precautions . ”
Facebook is also a tool used by Venezuelan police — though not always effectively .
Carlos Graffe , a student from Valencia , a city 75 miles west of Caracas , said the prosecutor ’s office put out a warrant for his arrest after he was identified through a photo on Facebook as one of several protesters who are accused of inciting violence during a protest march in Caracas in August .
Graffe and his lawyer claim it ’s a case of mistaken identity :
The television footage that shows protesters dismantling police barriers during the march shows a different person than the one identified in the Facebook photograph .
What ’s more , the person in the Facebook photograph is in fact his cousin , also called Carlos Graffe .
Opposition figures claim the Venezuelan government ultimately wants to control social networking sites , which have become an important tool for organizing protests and marches .
Thousands of Venezuelans protested the closing down of local radio station CNB by posting messages on the Twitter account # freemediave .
An editorial piece in the state - run Bolivarian News Agency then accused Twitter of becoming a “ new channel for creating terror ” by spreading disinformation in a campaign orchestrated by the Venezuelan ultra-right .
Government critics claim the government is pushing its own forms of disinformation .
In July , Diosdado Cabello , the minister for public works , aired the idea of passing all of Venezuela ’s internet traffic through the servers of Cantv , the state - run telecommunications company .
Critics say the move would allow the government to control communication on social networking sites during protests .
Social networking sites are a threat to the government that fears that it cannot control the partisanship of sites such as Facebook , said Carlos Delgado , a media analyst at the Andres Bello Catholic University in Caracas .
He said the government ’s move to control Venezuela ’s servers is an attempt to “ consolidate its communicational hegemony . ”

Avatar type Movie genre Animated
I saw Avatar on Saturday .
My opinion of the film is n’t all that important or interesting — but I basically agree with EW ’s estimable Owen Gleiberman , although I must admit I continue to think about it more than the usual “ B ” grade movie .
More interesting and perhaps more noteworthy was the reaction of my 8 - year - old son Ben .
He ’s a big Star Wars fan ( so you know that I ’m raising him well ) and interested in sci - fi stuff ( especially sci - fi stuff that involves spaceships and loud battles ) , and so he ’s been obsessed with Avatar for weeks .
Until now ,
Ben ’s only cinematic experiences have been 3 - D animated movies like Wall - E , Up and Madagascar .
I tried to take him to Speed Racer last year , but he asked to leave one hour into it , saying , “ Daddy , I think I ’m too young for this movie . ”
( I was pretty impressed that he could think that way for himself . )
With this as context , Ben walked out of our 3 - D Imax screening of Avatar totally blown away .
And then he said the words that left me floored : “ That was even better than Star Wars ! ”
Not sure I heard him correctly , I asked him , pointedly : “ What ’s your favorite movie : Star Wars or Avatar ? ”
He said , without hesitation , “ Avatar . ”
Three days later , he ’s still talking and buzzing about it , and more , he ’s suddenly hungry for more cinematic experience — very similar to my reaction to A New Hope when I first saw at as a 7 - year - old in ’ 77 .
With Avatar , the medium of movies ( or what it is movies have become ) has captured my son ’s imagination .
My questions :
Have I gone horribly awry in my parenting ?
Is my son just peculiar — or is Avatar this generation ’s Star Wars ?
And if you ca n’t relate to the question because you do n’t have kids , let ’s make it relevant to all .
Star Wars or Avatar :
Which one is better — and which one do you like better ?
It is ironic that this will , after my death , probably be the one thing that anyone remembers from my writing .
I was just a punk when Common Lisp was standardized by a bunch of guys who'd been writing Lisp code for 10 years or more .
Although I contributed a few fixes and minor improvements to the Lisp Machine operating system , I was always more interested in application programs and put 99 percent of my effort into building some big computer - aided engineering systems .
So I definitely do n't belong in the pantheon of Lisp Gods .
I 'm an impatient pragmatist and hate to spend time working on tools .
When I start a project , I survey my friends who are experts to find out what the best tools are , and then run with it .
So when I was a nerdlet at MIT it was the MIT Lisp Machine .
When I was building my first large - scale multi-user Internet applications , it was Oracle .
