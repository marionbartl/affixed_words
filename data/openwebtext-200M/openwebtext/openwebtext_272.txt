Like most teenage girls , Cheryl Tunney is a fan of boy bands , likes chatting to friends on the internet and going out .
However , the unemployed 18 - year - old admits to another , horrifying , " hobby " .
Since losing her virginity at 16 , this young girl claims to have had sex with at least 50 men she picked up on the internet .
Scroll down for more ...
She confesses to not using condoms or other contraceptives during many of her sexual encounters with strangers and claims most were " over in a minute " .
Miss Tunney , from Dagenham , Essex , can give the first names of 36 of her partners but the rest have been forgotten - or never known .
She explains with a shrug : " When you sleep with so many , you kind of lose count . "
The appalling picture of soulless - and reckless - promiscuity among Britain 's youth was revealed in a BBC3 documentary series last night .
In Sex ..... With Mum and Dad , Miss Tunney confesses her sexual tally to her shocked mother , Debbie , but insisted that many girls of her age " slept around " , adding : " Girls around here do it all the time . "
The youngster told her 45 - year - old mother , who is separated from Cheryl 's father , how she picked up men , including a drug dealer , by trawling online dating and networking sites in internet cafes .
Miss Tunney 's own listing on Britain 's most popular social network website , Bebo , which has 11 million users , most of them teenagers , shows her posing suggestively in a bikini .
Her description of herself tells its own story : " hiya every !
my names cheryl im 17 frm essex .
im a big mcfly fan as u guessed bt i also like rnb and hip hop .
i easy going so if ya wana chat message me and i will reply .
luv ya all x x x "
She has 249 " friends " listed - most of them men - including " Jordan " who messaged her to say " yer bbz [ babes ] your bangin , idd shag ya
add me if ya intrested " and Squeak who tells her " hey your hot " .
In the documentary , which brings children and parents together for a frank discussion about sex in a bid to mend relationships between the generations , the teenager admitted that some internet contacts asked her to have sex without preamble .
One simply asked : " Do you want to meet for a sh*g ? " but she claimed she often made dates and then stood the men up .
Miss Tunney said : " I stated using dating sites with my friends at about the age of 14 .
We would bunk off school and go to the internet cafe and just flirt with boys online .
" The first time I went to meet one of them we were both 14 , but my mum went along with me .
I did n't lose my virginity until I was 16 but I have now had about 50 partners . "
Miss Tunney added : " That does seem quite a lot in two years . "
In a televised confrontation with her mother , the teenager drew a series of stick men to represent her dozens of partners and appeared shocked when Debbie Tunney revealed she had only had three sexual partners in her life .
The 18 - year - old said : " We had to write our numbers on a board for the show and the initial for each partner 's name .
I could n't believe my mum had only had sex with three men .
" It made my number seem really high and it was worse because I could only remember about 40 of their names .
I have decided not to sleep around any more . "
Astonishingly , given her admission that she did not always use condoms , the young woman tested negative for sexually transmitted diseases .
She said : " That is so weird .
How did that happen ? "
During sessions with Dutch sexologist Maria Schopman , Miss Tunney claimed she was promiscuous because she was lonely after her parents split up three years ago and was unable to talk about her feelings .
Mother and daughter say they have no regrets about revealing such intimate details on the show but Miss Tunney admitted she was slightly ' nervous ' about the reaction .
She said : " I am nervous - I do n't want people to think badly of me - but the show had quite a positive effect on me and my relationship with my mum .
" She still does n't want me sleeping with lots of men and I do n't want to , so we get on a lot better .
" I have n't been near an internet dating site since filming the programme .
I now want to concentrate on my life an my future and try to make a career in hairdressing . "
Carved in the hilly terrain , a thousand feet wide and 167 feet deep , Arecibo has been listening to radio waves arriving from the cosmos since 1963 , and today it remains the world ’s largest and most sensitive radio telescope .
It is also one of the most recognizable , appearing as a backdrop in the movies “ Contact ” and “ GoldenEye . ”

In an era of tight and tightening budgets , a review panel for the foundation ’s astronomy division two years ago looked for places where money could be freed up for new facilities .
It recommended a 25 percent cut in Arecibo ’s foundation financing by 2011 and then another 50 percent cut , to $ 4 million , in 2011 .
The panel said Arecibo should look to other institutions and agencies to make up for the 2011 cut ; if it could not find the money , the panel said , the foundation should consider closing it .
A quarter of its staff was laid off last year .
The telescope is now on hiatus for repainting , but when it resumes operation , the number of observing hours will be cut , and nearly half of its receivers will be furloughed .
Its emphasis will shift to large , continuing surveys , and smaller projects like Dr. Lovell ’s may be much more squeezed than in the past .
An outcry followed the review panel ’s decision , particularly from planetary scientists who thought that the group had overlooked Arecibo ’s role in cataloging potential dangers from asteroids .
Its radar can precisely plot the orbit of an asteroid to determine if it could be on course for a collision with Earth .

Protester suffers dislocated knee after clash with police in Rhode Island RAW STORY
Published : Monday August 13 , 2007

This A 22 - year - old woman remains hospitalized following a violent conflict with police on Saturday at a protest organized by the Industrial Workers of the World labor group in Providence , Rhode Island , reports the Providence Journal .
The woman , Alexandra Svoboda , was " tackled " by police during the protest and suffered a dislocated knee .
She has had one surgery to repair the damaged knee and may face another , as well as physical therapy according to the paper .
The group was protesting a restaurant 's use of a New York food distributor they say " is notorious for its slave labor conditions of up to 110 hours per week without basic labor rights . "
One of the protesters , Balthazar Ramos , said he worked for the distributor and worked " 112 hours per week , was paid $ 4.90 per hour , and was not compensated for overtime . "
Police Sgt. Michael Paiva told the Providence Journal that the protesters numbered at least 100 , though the group estimates their numbers at 30 - 40 .
There was a crowd of " 100 people screaming in the middle of the street , refusing to move and disobeying every order the officers gave them , " Paiva told the newspaper .
Paiva said that one police officer also suffered minor injuries .
Labor organizer Mark Bray told the Journal that the police reaction was " was excessive and theres no excuse for it . "
According to police , the girl who was injured was " hitting , " " kicking , " and " pushing " officers .
Svoboda has been charged with three felony counts of assaulting an officer , along with two misdemeanors .
The image below depicts Svoboda being pinned by police officers after suffering her knee injury .

Can I test my emails ?
Of course you can !
With A/ B testing tools , like those offered by Mailchimp , you can do split testing and test as many as three variations for campaigns .
You can also test subject lines , content , from names , and send times .
You can test your reach too ; that 's how many people get your emails .
Always optimize your emails for better results .
How to test your emails ?
First , choose the factor that defines success for you .
It could be clicks , opens , or money earned .
We ’ll collect the results , and show you the winner .
And you can automate it too .
Just tell Mailchimp to automatically send out the winning campaign .
It 's really pretty easy .
Email marketing tips to get you started
1. Create an email marketing plan .
To make the planning part easier , we ’ve highlighted some best practices you ’ll want to consider when devising a strategy for your email marketing .
Define your audience
No matter what you sell , you need to have a clear idea of who your audience is in order to effectively communicate with them .
Mailchimp lets you dig a little deeper to segment users within your audience so you can send them personalized and targeted emails that help increase engagement , build trustful relationships and generate greater ROI .
Signup sources
Some of the most valuable data your signup form has to offer is how and where subscribers sign up for your list .
If you ’re an e-commerce business with your store connected to Mailchimp , knowing where your customers joined your list can give you a better idea of how to communicate with them and where you might want to focus your marketing efforts going forward .
Segments and groups
Once you ’ve identified smaller collections of people within your larger audience , you ’ll be able to create groups and segments to send more relevant and personalized emails to your recipients — and the more relevant the campaign , the better the results .
There are times when you ’ll want to send to your entire list , but by segmenting users and taking advantage of Mailchimp ’s segmentation tools can significantly increase the click - through rates and e-commerce orders your campaigns generate .
Decide what to write
Now that you know who you ’re writing to , it ’s time to think about your content .
What do you want to say to your audience ?
What is your content marketing strategy ?
You ’ll want to send emails with purpose , that really speak to your subscribers , so always keep in mind what they signed up for .
Establish your sending frequency and goals
There ’s nothing set in stone about how often you should email your customers , but if you send too often , your subscribers are likely to tune out what you have to say or unsubscribe altogether .
Some users that run a blog or news website might choose to send daily updates to their subscribers , while other users only send twice a month so subscribers stay excited about their emails .
Choose to send your email campaign at your own pace , and check the unsubscribe rates and the click through rates to adjust the frequency if needed .
Make a schedule
One way to make sure you ’re staying on track is to create a content calendar to schedule your campaigns , blog posts , social media posts , and more .
Your email marketing schedule will depend on your industry , the types of content you send ( content marketing strategy ) , and your sending frequency .
2. Design your emails
Design tips
When designing email campaigns , focus on your message and keep your design straightforward .
We suggest laying out all the elements for your campaign in a hierarchy , putting your most important information or the main takeaway toward the top so people can quickly scan your email if they ’re short on time .
Code your own templates
Looking to have more control over your email design ?
You have the option to code your own HTML template and import it to Mailchimp .
3 . Test your emails
Test in different email clients and ISPs
All email clients are created differently , which means that the campaign you designed in Mailchimp might look slightly different in your subscribers ’ inboxes .
Be sure to check the emails on mobile devices as well as they can look different in responsive designs .
Send test emails to friends and coworkers
If you have any friends or coworkers who can check your email for typos and give you some feedback on the layout , you can send them a test email so they can preview the campaign directly in their inbox .
Find the best version with A / B Testing campaigns
Not sure which subject line will get the most opens and clicks ?
Think there might be a certain time of day your customers are most likely to make a purchase through your campaign ?
Running an A/ B test lets you experiment with different versions of your emails to see how the changes you make impact your results .
4 . What you can do with marketing automation
Unlike regular campaigns , an automation is a targeted email or series of emails that you can set and forget .
From a welcome email series to follow up emails after a purchase to rewarding your customers with a special incentive , automation helps you streamline your communications with customers so you have more time to focus on creating content and increasing return on investment ( ROI ) .
Plus , you can design , send , and track order notifications to update customers on purchases they made from your store .
5 . Measure your performance
The data collected in your Mailchimp reports will help you refine your marketing strategy going forward .
Opens and clicks
These are the most obvious statistics for measuring campaign engagement , as they indicate how well your subject lines and campaign content resonates with a particular list .
But it ’s important to consider how your open and click through rates compare to other companies in your industry — otherwise you ’re looking at your statistics in a vacuum .
E-commerce data
If you ’ve connected your store to Mailchimp and turned on e-commerce link tracking for your campaigns , you can view purchase data for your subscribers in campaign reports , subscriber profiles , and on the account dashboard .
Website traffic
The campaigns you send can help you direct more traffic to your website or online store .
And there are a few integrations you can sync with Mailchimp so you can track any trends in website traffic or e-commerce activity after you send a campaign .
Last week ’s article in the Wall Street Journal revealed that my blog earnings are in excess of $ 250,000 per year ( a very ballpark figure ) .
The problem with these type of articles is that they report in a few words just one element of a story – in this case my earnings .
While it ’s true that I have built my blogging to a point where I ’m able to earn good money blogging there are many things that an article like the one in the WSJ did n’t ( and could n’t ) mention about how I was able to build my blogging up to this point .
The impact of this missing ‘ back story ’ is that much of the reality of blogging for money goes unseen by those looking at blogging as a potential income stream – leading some to naively enter into blogging with false expectations .
Of course when these expectations are not met things can get ugly with disappointment and anger being a common reaction .
What disappoints me as a blogger writing on this topic is that I regularly see other bloggers feeding their readers with hype and false hopes about how easy it is to make big money from blogging .
This only adds to the distance between their reader ’s expectations and the reality of blogging for money .
The Reality of Blogging for Money
So what is the reality of building up one ’s blogging to a point where they can make a full time living blogging ?
Here are five facts that I ’d like to share about my own story to give a more realistic picture to those considering getting into blogging as a way to make a living .
1 . It takes a concerted long term effort
I have been blogging for five years .
The first year was not for money in any way ( although I learned a lot about blogging in that year ) and the next two I worked 2 - 3 jobs at a time ( and was studying part time ) while I built my blogging up from a hobby , to part time job to a full time venture ( more on my story here ) .
I ’m often asked things like – ‘ I need to make $ xxxx in the next few months – how would you do it with a new blog ? ’
The average age of blogs in the Technorati Top 100 was over 3 years when I last surveyed it – while the occasional blogger has a fast rise to frame they are the exception .
Building a successful blog takes a long time ( it takes time to build readership , to work out how to monetize it etc ) so take a long term approach and pace yourself .
2 . It takes luck
I wo n’t speak for other bloggers but in my case I was very fortunate on many fronts .
I started blogging at a good time ( it was a lot less crowded and competitive back then ) .
I stumbled on making money from blogs quite accidentally
I started my first money making blog on the spur of the moment and picked a topic ( digital
photography ) without knowing what I was doing – but for the time it was right )
I met the right people at the right time
Bigger bloggers discovered me at opportune times
The lucky list could go on – but I was very lucky .
Of course some people ‘ make their own luck ’ and to some extent I agree with this – there are ways to increase your chances of being lucky – but some of it is outside your hands .
Sometimes the luck comes and sometimes it does n’t .
3 . It takes a lot of work
There ’s been a lot of talk lately about how blogging less can mean more from your blog ( example 1 and example 2 ) .
While I agree with this – that does n’t mean you can just come up with a few posts on a whim every few days and expect the traffic ( and money ) to come rolling in .
Over the last 3 years I ’ve consistently worked 40 - 60 + hour weeks on my blogging .
At one point I was posting 20 - 30 posts per day ( mainly news related posts back then ) .
Most bloggers that make a full time living from blogging work corresponding hours on it .
4 . Many do n’t make much money blogging
I ’ve often used the analogy of Professional sports people to highlight that in any ‘ game ’ there are many who play it – less who make a little money from the game , even less who are able to earn a living from it ( just ) and just a small group who make big money from it .
The same is true for bloggers .
I ’ve run many polls here at ProBlogger on how much people are earning from the medium ( eg ) and on every single occasion they reveal that the vast majority of bloggers are making very little per month .
While it is possible to make amazing money from blogging the sad reality is that most do n’t make more than pocket money .
Even some blogs who ‘ deserve ’ to make money blogging do n’t .
5 . It ’s hard
One thing that I ’ve found to be common with when I had small / new blogs and now having blogs that are doing reasonably well is that in both instances it can be really hard to keep them going .
The pressure to keep coming up with fresh ideas , to respond to critique of others , to deal with jealousy when others do well and more can be difficult to deal with .
On some levels it gets easier to deal with as your blog grows – but on other levels the demands that you face from a larger readership can at times be overwhelming .
Most bloggers that I know ( big and small ) have at one point or another been close to giving up – I know I have .
Feeling Depressed ?
I do n’t want to put a downer on those of you wanting to take your blogs to a level where you could make good money from blogging – the fact is that it is possible and and increasing number of people are making a part time or full time living from the medium – but I do think it ’s important to have a realistic picture before getting into blogging for money .
While some bloggers do talk about blogging as a way to make quick money I ’ve not had that experience myself .
Perhaps others do get rich quick from blogging – but I ’ve not met any successful bloggers who ’ve told me that yet .
CHAPTER 17 If Gull Island Didn't Blow Your Mind — This Will !
Gull Island just proved what the oil companies have believed for some time .
It authenticated the seismographic findings .
Seismographic testing has indicated that there is as much crude oil on the North Slope of Alaska as in Saudi Arabia .
Since the Gull Island find proved to be seismographically correct , then the other testings are correct also .
There are many hundreds of square miles of oil under the North Slope of Alaska .
To clarify what I am about to say , let me first re-emphasize that the government permitted the oil companies to drill and prove many sites ( subsequently making them cap the wells and keep secret the proof of the finds ) , but they do not allow them to produce from the wells .
This is why I have referred ( below ) to a number of wells having been drilled ( after I left the North Slope ) .
The only production permitted is from the small area of the North Slope .
Gull Island is located five miles off shore from Prudhoe Bay .
It is in the Beaufort Sea .
The chemical structure of the oil at Gull Island is different from that of the oil in the Prudhoe Bay field and the pressure of the field is different , proving that it is a totally different pool of oil from that at Prudhoe Bay .
The Gull Island burn produced 30,000 barrels of oil per day through a 31/2 inch pipe at 900 feet .
Three wells have been drilled , proven , and capped at Gull Island .
The East Dock well also hit the Gull Island oil pool ( you can tell by the chemical structure ) .
For forty miles to the east of Gull Island , there has not been a single dry hole drilled , although many wells have been drilled .
This shows the immensity of the size of the field .
The Gull Island oil find is even larger than the Prudhoe Bay field , which is presently producing more than two million barrels of oil every twenty - four hours .
Where is the energy crisis ?
It surely is not on the North Slope of Alaska , so it must be only in Washington , D.C. !
Now — just in case Gull Island did n't blow your mind , try this on for size !
Only recently , just west of Gull Island , the Kuparuk oil field has been drilled .
Again , this is a totally separate pool of oil from either the Prudhoe Bay field or the Gull Island field .
The chemical make up of the field and the pressure of the field is different from the others , proving it to be a totally separate pool of oil .
In an entirely different area of the North Slope than the 100 - square - mile area of the Prudhoe Bay field , the Kuparuk field is approximately 60 miles long by 30 miles wide and contains approximately the same amount of oil as the Prudhoe Bay field .
The oil in the Kuparuk field is at a 6,000 - foot depth and there is 300 feet of oil sand .
The field pressure is 900 lbs.
at well head , and test wells have flowed at 900 barrels a day at normal flow pressure .
It is projected that 800 to 1,400 wells will be drilled into the Kuparuk field .
From 1973 through 1980 we were being told continually that America was in the midst of a major energy crisis , yet no oil production was allowed from the Kuparuk field .
It was n't until 1981 that permission was finally granted for production .
Why the delay — if there really was a crisis ?
The reason Mr. X made the statement that there is as much crude oil on the North Slope of Alaska as in all of Saudi Arabia is because the oil companies have drilled all over the North Slope and have proven that there is as much oil there , but still they are only allowed to produce from the small area .
The North Slope is everything in Alaska North of the Brooks Mountains .
Prudhoe Bay is a very small portion of this enormous area ( just remember the size of Alaska , as we illustrated earlier in the book ) .
After the first edition of this book was printed , many people requested additional technical data .
This added chapter is a result of those requests .
As I was dictating this additional material , I had the opportunity of being with a gentleman who is a speculator in oil leases .
He made the statement to me as he looked over the oath I was making public , that every oil speculator in America who is interested in Alaskan oil leases should get a copy of this , because he had never seen such pertinent information in print before .
So what you have just read will excite many oil speculators and cause them to search the maps and watch for the latest leases .
Possibly you , have heard it stated that the Alaskan crude oil has such a high sulphur content that it cannot be refined by most oil refineries in the U.S.
We are being told that this is the reason why the Alaskan oil is not helping to solve America 's energy crisis .
This is also the excuse that is being used for shipping Alaskan crude oil to other countries .
It has also been reported that major power companies are even telling this to their customers ( in their monthly statement inserts ) , using it to justify their need for rate increases .
Well , here is a statistic that should silence those false claims and blow the lid off of that phony excuse of too much sulphur in the Alaskan crude .
An August 11 , 1980 , analysis of the Prudhoe Bay crude oil , which is flowing in the Trans - Alaska Oil Pipeline , reads as follows : Sulphur content - 0.9 %
Flash point of the oil - 35 °F
Wax content - 6 %
Asphalt content - 2 %
Crude oil freeze temperature ( better known as pour point ) - 15 °F
The sulphur content of the Prudhoe Bay Alaskan oil is low in comparison to oil from other sources in the U.S. , as well as many foreign oils .
The Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil can be refined by any major refinery in America without damage to the ecology .
This means , then , that the widely publicized excuse of too high a sulphur content is simply not true .
Therefore , it is just one more link in the long chain of falsehoods that we are asked to believe as Americans .
An energy crisis ??????
More Recent Facts — A Comparison
The following is a comparison between the three oil fields on the North Slope of Alaska which have been drilled into with numerous wells , tested , and proven .
Prudhoe Bay can produce two ( 2 ) million barrels of oil every 24 hours for 20 to 40 years at artesian pressure .
Imagine what the production of the Kuparuk and Gull Island fields could be .
Field Pay Zone Oil
( Average depth of oil pool ) Area of Field Prudhoe 600 Ft. of pay zone 100 square miles Kuparuk 300 Ft. of pay zone Twice the size of Prudhoe Gull Island 1,200 Ft. of pay zone
At least four times the size of Prudhoe . . .
Estimates are that it is the richest oil field on the face of the earth .
Being stuck for a blog post topic is n’t always a case of sitting down and your brain going blank .
That was the problem we hopefully had solutions for in the previous post of this series .
There are times when you know in advance the overall subject you need to cover but somehow you still need to actually write the individual articles .
Consider the situation where you start a new blog , or get invited to write for a blog .
You get given the niche , such as “ photography ” , “ gardening ” , “ tech ” .
The problem is scale ; how do you find a focused and interesting article topic out of the entire field ?
The strategies to use in this circumstance overlap somewhat and are complimentary too .
For this post let ’s take a look at “ chunking and outlining ” .
This strategy is ideal for when you have a starting point , a country - sized subject to explore .
Chunking for Blog Topic Ideas
“ How do you eat an elephant ? ” .
Of course the answer is “ One bite at a time ” .
It ’s a clichÃ© but it ’s used so much because it works .
Your problem here is the subject is too big , it is hard to find an entry point .
The trick is to break it up into pieces .
Start looking for the chunks , look for places you can break the big subject into smaller ones .
Some ideas for where to start :
Are there obvious chunks ?
–
Many topics have chunks you can think of right away , for example photography you might talk about equipment and technique as two chunks , in SEO you might talk about on - site and off - site tactics , gardening has seasons , etc .
Are there difficulty or complexity levels ?
– I often find that any subject I am asked to write about has beginner , intermediate and advanced levels , these can be chunks too .
Are there chronological chunks ?
–
Some subjects have a beginning , middle and end , or are categorized by time .
Think how people often try to place things into eras , like Web1.0 and Web2.0 , or comics “ Golden Age ” , etc .
What is the “ history ” of your subject ?
Already you might have material to start writing !
“ The history of _____ ” or “ The 10 Types of ____ ” etc make worthwhile articles before we even get into the detail of the subject .
Once you have big chunks you need to start chunking the chunks .
You stop when you either have sufficient material to work with or have each chunk down to the atomic level and can go no further .
The way I go from “ big blob ” to “ atomic detail ” is to use an outline .
Outlining for Blog Topics
Outlines are something I learned for writing books and large reports .
Essentially it is chunking in bullet form .
You can of course like most things complicate it further , and there are even software packages and an XML format especially for outlines , but for the sake of this discussion just think of it as nested bullets .
When you look at a books content page we have chapter titles then under that you might see subheadings .
That ’s pretty much what an outline is .
Taking photography as a subject , we would start to outline it using nested bullets like so :
Photography Techniques Equipment Lenses Lighting Cameras Digital Point and shoot cameras DSLR cameras
Keep drilling down , going up and down the list to find more places where you can branch off , re-categorize items , and generally expand as best you can .
When you have exhausted your ideas then look over the list for inspiration .
If I looked at my list now I could take the last point and further break that down into directly applicable topics :
DSLR cameras
What is a DSLR ?
Choosing a DSLR Most - needed DSLR features Finding a DSLR for under $ 500 DSLR maintenance
As well as finding topic ideas , this technique is also ideal for finding your categories .
I have not only written books this way but started whole blogs using the same technique .
Summary
Although very effective , this technique works best when you are already knowledgable and comfortable with your subject area .
It ’s all about organizing knowledge you know you have .
In the next part of this series we will look at more open and creative techniques for when you do n’t know what you know until you see it 🙂
Do you use chunking and outlines ?
Is it something you can see yourself trying ?
IT WAS at a dinner party in 1856 that Florence Nightingale met William Farr .
The Lady of the Lamp was already famous for nursing British soldiers wounded in the Crimea ; Farr , the Compiler of Abstracts in the General Registry Office , was widely recognised as an innovative statistician .
Both cared deeply about improving the world through sanitation ; both understood the importance of meticulous records in providing the evidence needed to bring about change .
Farr was the first to compile “ mortality tables ” , listing causes of death in the general population ; Nightingale compared his numbers with her own on the deaths of soldiers to great effect .
By showing that even in peacetime a soldier faced twice the risk of dying in a given year as a civilian , she campaigned successfully for better conditions in barracks .
The pair were instrumental in setting up a royal commission of inquiry into sanitary conditions during the Crimean war .
Although remembered as the mother of modern nursing , Nightingale was an accomplished statistician too .
She was particularly innovative in presenting data visually .
The example above , of a type now known as “ Nightingale 's Rose ” or “ Nightingale 's Coxcomb ” , comes from her monograph , “ Notes on matters affecting the health , efficiency and hospital administration of the British army ” published in 1858 .
In the same year she became the first female fellow of the Statistical Society of London ( now Royal Statistical Society ) .
The chart displays the causes of the deaths of soldiers during the Crimean war , divided into three categories : “ Preventible or Mitigable Zymotic Diseases ” ( infectious diseases , including cholera and dysentery , coloured in blue ) , “ wounds ” ( red ) and “ all other causes ” ( black ) .
As with today 's pie charts , the area of each wedge is proportional to the figure it stands for , but it is the radius of each slice ( the distance from the common centre to the outer edge ) rather than the angle that is altered to achieve this .
Her principal message — that even during periods of heavy fighting , such as November 1854 , far more soldiers died from infection than from wounds — can be seen at a glance .
She sent the chart to the War Office ; and it is a fair assumption that it contributed to the improvements in military hospitals that she brought about .
Nightingale 's chart is a beautiful and persuasive call to action , but it is not perfect .
The red , black and blue wedges are all measured from the centre , so some areas mask parts of others .
The numbers of deaths from the various causes are not stated — although , to be fair , it was their relative size that Nightingale wished to show .
The chart to the left also tells the story of a war : Napoleon 's Russian campaign of 1812 .
It was drawn half a century afterwards by Charles Joseph Minard , a French civil engineer who worked on dams , canals and bridges .
He was 80 years old and long retired when , in 1861 , he called on the innovative techniques he had invented for the purpose of displaying flows of people , in order to tell the tragic tale in a single image .
Edward Tufte , whose book , “ The Visual Display of Quantitative Information ” is a bible to statisticians , calls it “ the best statistical graphic ever drawn ” .
Minard 's chart shows six types of information : geography , time , temperature , the course and direction of the army 's movement , and the number of troops remaining .
The widths of the gold ( outward ) and black ( returning ) paths represent the size of the force , one millimetre to 10,000 men .
Geographical features and major battles are marked and named , and plummeting temperatures on the return journey are shown along the bottom .
The chart tells the dreadful story with painful clarity : in 1812 , the Grand Army set out from Poland with a force of 422,000 ; only 100,000 reached Moscow ; and only 10,000 returned .
The detail and understatement with which such horrifying loss is represented combine to bring a lump to the throat .
As men tried , and mostly failed , to cross the Bérézina river under heavy attack , the width of the black line halves : another 20,000 or so gone .
The French now use the expression “ C'est la Bérézina ” to describe a total disaster .
In 1871 , the year after Minard died , his obituarist cited particularly his graphical innovations : “ For the dry and complicated columns of statistical data , of which the analysis and the discussion always require a great sustained mental effort , he had substituted images mathematically proportioned , that the first glance takes in and knows without fatigue , and which manifest immediately the natural consequences or the comparisons unforeseen . ”
The chart shown here is singled out for special mention : it “ inspires bitter reflections on the cost to humanity of the madnesses of conquerors and the merciless thirst of military glory ” .
The chart to the left is the earliest of our three .
It was published in 1821 by William Playfair , a Scottish engineer , political economist and scoundrel : he was convicted of libel in England and swindling in France .
Alongside these many and varied skills he was also an engraver ( he produced some of James Watt 's engineering drawings ) , which explains this image 's handsomeness , with its delicate shading and ornate attribution .
Playfair liked controversial topics .
He drew a chart comparing tax levels in various countries in order to show that Britain 's was too high .
He was the first to show imports and exports on one chart , shading the area between the two to indicate the balance of trade and explaining that the intersection of the lines showed a shift in favour of one country or the other .
This chart , his most famous , shows the “ weekly wages of a good mechanic ” and the “ price of a quarter of wheat ” , with the reigns of monarchs displayed along the top .
It is a little difficult to see the point Playfair wished to make : “ that never at any former period was wheat so cheap , in proportion to mechanical labour as it is at the present time ” .
Presumably he was not familiar with the idea of combining two variables — prices and wages — to make a third — affordability .
Still , he should not be overly criticised for this .
For a start , his conclusion was correct .
Statisticians have used his data to plot wages divided by prices ( showing how much wheat a week 's wages would buy ) against time , and the point becomes clear — as , incidentally , does a more subtle one : the increase in buying power was slowing down .
And Playfair was already making a leap of abstraction that few of his contemporaries could follow .
Using the horizontal and vertical axes to represent time and money was such a novelty that he had to explain it painstakingly in accompanying text .
“ This method has struck several persons as being fallacious ” , he wrote , “ because geometrical measurement has not any relation to money or to time ; yet here it is made to represent both . ”
He was the first in a series of economists , statisticians and social reformers who wanted to use data not only to inform but also to persuade and even campaign — and who understood that when the eye comprehends , the heart often follows .
Nightingale hoped her charts would liven up her publications ; the queen , she thought , might look at the pictures , even if she did not read the words .
Not everyone thought it was right to include such fripperies in a sober publication .
“ We do not want impressions , we want facts , ” Farr wrote to her in 1861 .
“ You complain that your report would be dry .
The dryer the better .
Statistics should be the dryest of all reading . ”
Fortunately , she ignored him .
Des Moines , Iowa ( CNN ) --
For college students , winter break is a time for vegging out and relying on mom and dad to do the laundry .
But in Iowa , Democratic presidential campaigns are crossing their fingers that this bloc of voters can snap out of vacation lethargy and drag themselves to the caucuses on January 3 .
Iowa election laws allow out - of - state students attending college there to vote , and 17 - year - olds can vote in the caucuses as long as they are 18 years old by election day .
With a recent CNN / Opinion Research Poll showing a three - way tie in Iowa 's Democratic race between Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and former Sen. John Edwards , campaigns are trying to draw new voters .
While all three candidates have worked to generate support and excitement on campuses , the Obama campaign is committing a lot of time and energy on trying to pull out college students across the state , hoping its candidate 's inspirational style and message of hope resonates with young voters .
Watch how Obama is trying to woo the student vote »
But counting on younger voters can be a tenuous proposition .
" They 're not a particularly reliable voting bloc and have n't been in the past .
That does n't mean you can't get them out , but it 's a lot of work , " said Drake University political science professor Arthur Sanders .
In the 2004 Iowa Democratic caucuses , only 17 percent of all caucus - goers were between the ages of 17 and 29 , and the majority of that age group was made up of people over the age of 22 .
If one compares those figures to the fact that more than 65 percent of caucus - goers that year were over 45 years old , it 's easy to understand why courting the traditional Iowa caucus attendee can prove more successful than relying on college - age voters .
The 2008 caucus date throws a whole new logistical wrinkle in the quest to get young voters out on the evening of January 3 .
The date falls two days after New Year 's Day , meaning an untold number of students registered to vote in Iowa will be on winter break and not on campus .
" They 're no longer going to be centrally located and easy to contact and stay in touch with and keep involved , " Sanders said of college voters .
Sanders said campaigns might be able to motivate students to attend their local caucuses , but admitted it is a daunting task .
" If you can manage to do that and get a substantial portion to do so , it could be beneficial , " Sanders said .
Josh Mahoney , a junior at University of Northern Iowa , is a prime example of the logistics conundrum facing both voters and campaigns .
He plans to caucus for Obama but will be spending his holidays at home , out of state .
Mahoney talked about his plans for caucus day when he introduced Obama at a rally in Cedar Falls , Iowa , earlier this month .
" I 'm going to drive 4 ½ hours from Sioux Falls , South Dakota , in my Toyota Camry 1993 model .
It 's terrible and I 'm embarrassed , but I 'm going to come all the way down here and I 'm going to caucus , " he told a crowd of students .
For Mahoney and others who have to travel a distance , a spell of bad weather could make it difficult to get out and caucus , something aides to several campaigns conceded was already keeping them up at night .
In an effort to keep tabs on students , the Obama campaign has spent the better part of this year collecting student supporters ' cell phone numbers and e-mail addresses .
The Edwards campaign has an organizer assigned to every college campus in Iowa who is in charge of keeping contact with students to make sure they either caucus in their home precincts or back at school .
Despite all the warning signs in the data and anecdotes from past campaigns , some young voters involved in this campaign claim 2008 could vindicate their age group and prove they are serious about participating in the electoral process .
Kris Hasstedt is a 22 - year - old Clinton precinct captain and senior at Iowa State in his hometown of Ames .
He said there is a different energy among his peers this election cycle .
" I remember the 2004 election , and it seemed like I was a needle in a haystack when it came to young people getting out to vote , " Hasstedt said .
" But I work at one of the grocery stores here which is mainly college students and a lot of them , every time I go in , there 's a buzz about the candidates who they 're supporting , where they 're going to caucus ... it 's a big wake - up call from 2004 . "

HURRICANE KATRINA HURRICANE KATRINA
Housing debate : Katrina 's wrath lingers for New Orleans ' poor | Demolition draws protest Faith : Parishioners fight for church Private or public ? :
Rebuilding pace depends on who 's paying Video : Hope blooms : 9 Gulf residents share their stories Small business : Owners struggle with worker , customer shortages | Census : Gulf economy rebouding Rebuilding risky areas : Katrina renews calls for change in rebuilding rules More
It 's not the mists of time that lay claim to abandoned cities .
It 's the undergrowth .
Fast - spreading vines and other weeds are among the first tentacles Mother Nature sends up to grip a deserted city .
So it was that Troy , Chichen Itza , Angkor and other metropolises of antiquity vanished and were forgotten .
Other classical cities , including Rome , once became partially lost to greenery and decay .
Now , in hurricane - ravaged and largely abandoned parts of New Orleans , the timeless process is being replayed .
In swathes of the once - submerged Lower Ninth Ward , for example , houses , trailers and sidewalks lie neglected and disappearing .
The weeds appear to be taking over .
The rapidity of nature 's resurgence in the fertile Crescent City is no surprise to scientists .
" We 've got exuberant vegetation down here in Louisiana , " says Steven Darwin , a botanist at the city 's Tulane University .
Before Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 and the attending floods , he says , " people were mowing their lawns , keeping this vegetation under control . "
But since then , plenty of spots have gone to seed .
" My neighbors have n't been back for two years , " says Darwin , whose uptown neighborhood , Carrollton , did n't get flooded .
" You should see their backyard .
It 's almost impenetrable . "
Mike Davis , 19 , echoed that sentiment as he surveyed the yard where he grew up on Tonti Street in the Lower Ninth .
He and his brother Jason , 18 , still have relatives in the neighborhood but have resettled across the Mississippi in Harvey , La . During a return visit , the two sat on the hood of their car in front of their old home , which lies half - obscured behind trees and weeds .
" There 's no more house , " Mike Davis says .
" It 's a forest . "
He may have been overstating the case — or he may have been foretelling the future .
" In a few decades , a lot of this stuff will just be rubble on the ground , " says Alan Weisman , author of The World Without Us , which describes how evidence of civilization would gradually evaporate if humanity vanished .
" Cities can be buried extraordinarily quickly , " says C. Brian Rose , president of the Archaeological Institute of America .
Typically , he explains , a catastrophe — armed conflict , for example , or an earthquake , fire or flood — will first depopulate a city .
Then seeds will blow in on the wind , take root and grow , particularly if a flood has deposited a new layer of soil .
Weeds also may sprout from buried roots , which can be surprisingly resistant to floodwaters .
And if remaining residents do n't put brakes on the process , the city 's architecture is doomed .
" Roots will grab hold of the foundations and bring down the structures over time , even if they 're stone , " Rose says .
" In time , nothing will be left .
All you 'll see is foliage . "
It is n't clear what plants would make up such a blanket of flora in the Big Easy , but it would be unlikely to include grasses or garden plants and shrubs .
To survive , such ornamentals require constant human attention , and , in any case , the salinity of the floodwaters might have done them in .
Though some old New Orleans species , including live oaks , fared reasonably well against the brackish flood , magnolias and other trees suffered heavy losses , experts say .
" Vines are really successful in these situations , " says Allison Snow , a plant ecologist at Ohio State University .
" They can grow really fast because they rely on other things to hold them up " — other things like houses , lampposts and street signs .
Invasive species also tend to become dominant in disturbed ecosystems , says Conrad Savy , a biodiversity analyst at Conservation International .
Tulane ecologist Jeffrey Chambers says one such invader — the Chinese tallow tree — already has made rapid inroads .
" Open areas ( will ) eventually revert into some kind of a forested ecosystem , " Chambers says .
Darwin agrees and adds : " But it 's not going to be the ' right ' kind of forest .
It 's not the seeds of the native tree species that will come in .
It may well be the seeds of the exotics that are lurking in the woodlands , especially Chinese tallow . "
Though the emerging ecosystem may be unfamiliar , it 's no less natural , Weisman says .
" These plants are just doing what comes naturally to them .
They 've been given an opening , and they 're going for it . "
To turn them back , and to avert the post - disaster cycle of urban decay and abandonment , will require Herculean effort , experts say .
" The chances of reclamation decline with every building that falls down , " says Rose , who has spent two decades sifting through the ruins of Troy .
Yet people who remain " may decide to intervene and , through sweat equity , bring it back . "
Volunteers for the group Common Ground seem willing to sweat .
In the Lower Ninth Ward , work crews often start bushwhacking by 8 a.m. , says volunteer coordinator John Freeman .
" It 's man vs. grass , " Freeman says .
" And right now , the grass is winning . "

The majority of forex traders , whether amateur or professional , can be expected to have some degree of familiarity with the fundamental factors which weigh on the Dollar .
One can plainly understand , for example , how the threat of inflation and the twin deficits make the Dollar less valuable .
In fact , currencytrading .
net has already compiled a comprehensive list of such factors , entitled 50 Factors that Affect the Value of the US Dollar .
However , many of these factors are common knowledge , and , thus , it can be difficult to gain a competitive advantage over other traders who have access to the same information .
After all , when certain closely - watched economic indicators are released , the markets react almost instantaneously , making it difficult for the average retail investor to squeeze out a profit .
Thus , it is perhaps more valuable to temporarily ignore the most obvious factors ( while maintaining a rolodex in the back of your mind ) , and instead focus on certain “ unconventional factors . ”
In fact , there are many undercurrents flowing through forex markets , which only the savviest of traders are able to identify .
Discerning these secondary factors represents the key to understanding forex , especially since many of these trends underlie the primary fundamental factors .
For example , it is not enough to understand that the US twin deficits are rising or that interest rates are falling ; rather , one must understand why they are moving in their respective directions .
The following list is intended to provide the reader both with examples of such factors as well as with a framework for developing his own list of unconventional factors .
1. Institutional Investment Trends
Ultimately , what moves the forex market is supply and demand ; in this regard forex is no different from any other securities market .
In other words , while inflation and interest rates appear to drive the market , they are actually driving the decision - making processes of market participants , who , in turn , influence the supply and demand for specific currencies .
In addition , the majority of the world ’s currency is exchanged through the interbank market .
This market consists of a few centralized exchanges located around the world , where financial institutions exchange large blocks of currency , usually in increments of $ 1 million or greater .
Since retail investors exert little or no force on the $ 3 Trillion - per - day global forex market , it makes sense to focus our microscope on institutional investors , namely hedge funds .
In fact , hedge funds have extended their tentacles into forex to such an extent that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has decided to introduce a special electronic exchange , catering specifically to hedge funds .
The hedge funds which are most prominent in forex are so - called “ Global Macro ” funds and “ Emerging Market ” funds .
Global macro funds scrutinize global economic fundamentals and allocate capital accordingly .
In reality , most of these funds make predictions about the global interest rate climate : how interest rates will behave in relation to each other .
Since currencies are often seen as proxies for interest rates , many global macro hedge funds are active participants in forex markets .
Emerging market funds , in contrast , target the capital markets of developing economies .
The stock markets of Thailand and Vietnam , for example , have surged over the last few years as hedge funds have piled in , driving their currencies higher as well .
Sometimes , emerging market funds target currencies directly , in a play on inflation .
For example , there are several countries which peg their currencies to the Dollar .
These pegs are almost always inflationary , and hedge funds have taken notice , betting that these currencies will be forced into appreciating against the Dollar .
Those who recall George Soros ( via his eponymous hedge fund ) famously “ breaking the Bank of England ” and forcing the Pound upward should appreciate this strategy .
2. Petrodollars
Due to recent geopolitical developments , it has become widely known that the buying and selling of petroleum around the world is conducted almost entirely in Dollars .
Thus , every country must necessarily maintain a reserve of so - called “ petrodollars ” to be used for the purchase of petroleum .
On the flip side , those countries that are net exporters of oil have found themselves with a surplus of Dollars , which they have piled into US assets .
Estimates of combined Middle East foreign exchange reserves number as high as $ 1.6 Trillion .
In fact , many analysts believe the Dollar ’s status as the world ’s reserve currency - despite its recent multi- year decline - can be largely attributed to the petrodollar phenomenon .
By extension , the main threat to the Dollar is the possibility that oil contracts will one day be settled in another currency .
Iran has already announced a plan to open up an oil bourse , in which oil will be sought and sold using Euros , although this plan has been hold for over one year .
3. Japanese Interest Rates
In addition to petrodollars , the ‘ carry trade ’ phenomenon should be extremely familiar to forex traders .
The carry trade refers to the trading strategy in which one currency ( the Japanese Yen ) is borrowed at a low interest rate and sold in favor of a higher - yielding currency .
Obviously , it is only because Japanese interest rates remain extremely low that the carry trade has been able to flourish .
Countries with comparatively high interest rates , such as New Zealand and Australia , will continue to have trouble holding their currencies down for as long as Japanese interest rates remain low .
Even the Dollar has remained steady against the Yen , despite the recent economic divergence between Japan and the United States .
Moreover , traders have speculated that it would require a rise of 200 basis points in Japanese interest rates for the carry trade to lose its appeal , an event which is extremely unlikely to occur by the end of 2007 .
Instead , a little bit of volatility in forex markets might go a long way in coaxing the currency upward .
The Economist has drawn an analogy of the current situation to 1998 , when Russia ’s default on its sovereign debt made hedge funds nervous , and they quickly unwound carry positions they had been maintaining at the time .
The result was a rapid appreciation in the Yen .
4 . Chinese demand for raw materials
In another feature , we noted that China ’s unending economic boom is one of the prime factors behind the global rise in commodity prices .
From cement and steel to support construction projects , to oil and natural gas to power its cars and satisfy its hunger for energy , China ’s raw material needs are massive .
‘ What does this have to do with forex ? ’ you are probably wondering .
The answer is simple : those countries with large reserves of natural resources have seen their economies boom and their currencies rise .
The Canadian Dollar has already achieved parity against the US Dollar , and the Australian Dollar is not far behind .
The Russian Rouble has also outperformed .
Those who wish to understand the appreciation of these three currencies should look no further than record - high commodity prices , for which Chinese demand is largely responsible .
5. Investor / Consumer sentiment
The importance of investor and consumer sentiment in forex markets is connected with the notion that perception is reality .
Amateur , investors often make the mistake of focusing all of their attention on coincident and lagging indicators , such as employment and GDP , when making investing decisions .
Savvy investors , however , devote equal attention to leading indicators - of which market sentiment is one - which represent a proxy for future economic performance .
For example , if investors / consumers indicate a pessimistic outlook , it is likely that future economic growth will be lower .
As a result , investors will be more likely to shift capital away from the US , which would drag down the Dollar .
6. US Real Estate Prices
This factor is probably the most conventional on this list , especially given the current economic milieu , where business headlines are dominated by coverage of the US sub - prime mortgage crisis .
The housing / construction sectors have historically only accounted for a modest portion of US economic growth .
However , the period of easy money that followed the collapse of the tech bubble in the late 1990 ’s led to a rapid run-up in real estate prices .
An exceptional tolerance for risk in the financial community enabled buyers that were barely credit worthy to take out mortgages at impossibly low interest rates .
In addition , existing homeowners rushed to cash in on the rising value of their houses by refinancing their mortgages and taking out a home equity loan .
As everyone knew , the party had to end at some point , and the collapse in confidence is now threatening to spread to other sectors of the economy , perhaps precipitating a recession .
7. IMF and World Bank
While the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and World Bank are certainly diminishing in importance , they continue to exert influence in the developing world .
Both organizations can still potentially impact economic growth by lending money for development projects and helping in times of crisis .
In some cases , they demand control over member countries ’ economic policies in exchange for favorable loan terms .
The IMF is now more visible in forex since it officially changed the way it monitors the foreign exchange policies of member nations .
Previously , the IMF focused on the internal effects of exchange rate policies , by looking at how the country in question was either harmed or benefited from the policy .
The IMF ’s new mandate , in contrast , extends to the evaluation of these policies from an external standpoint : how these policies affect other countries .
As a result , the IMF is now justified in advising against currency policies that engender global economic instability .
Predictably , Iran , Egypt and China have all voiced disapproval of this policy change .
8. Fixed Exchange Rate Regimes
Wait , I thought we were only interested in currencies covered by floating exchange rate regimes ?
By definition , currencies that are pegged do n’t fluctuate in accordance with market principles ( if they fluctuate at all ) , so they ’re probably not worth paying attention to , right ?
While there is certainly some validity to this mindset , these currencies areworth following because at the very least , they impact the currencies to which they are linked .
The Chinese Yuan , for example , remains pegged to a basket of currencies , consisting predominantly of Dollars .
In order to maintain this peg , China ’s Central Bank has been forced to stockpile over $ 1 Trillion in foreign exchange reserves , also predominated in Dollar - denominated assets .
Thus , China ’s fixed exchange rate regime , via the buying of US assets , directly supports the Dollar .
And of course there are dozens of other examples around the world .
9. Central Bank Intervention
This factor is counter - intuitively included on the list precisely because it does not influence forex .
Many policymakers have accused Japan and Korea , for example , of holding down their currencies in pursuit of policies of export promotion .
In fact , Korea has recently intervened in forex markets , while Japan has not .
Yet , the Won has soared while the Japanese Yen has remained frozen in place .
The point illustrated by this example is that Central Banks are rarely able to influence forex valuations despite concerted efforts to the contrary .
Even the US is a veteran of forex intervention , having intervened on behalf of the Dollar twice during the Clinton administration .
Both times , however , the Dollar was virtually unaffected .
In short , when you hear currency traders or policymakers griping about Central Bank intervention , feel free to shake your head and chuckle a bit .
10 . US Treasury Secretary
The list of the most influential people in forex would probably be a “ who ’s who ” of politicians , central bankers , and hedge fund managers .
However , would you believe that the US Treasury Secretary is just as important , if not moreso , when it comes to forex ?
The reason is that the Treasury Secretary represents the US in matters of currency , regardless of whether the currency in question is the Dollar or a foreign currency .
Despite having only recently been appointed , the current Treasury Secretary , Hank Paulson , has been quite vocal about currency issues .
He has criticized China and Japan for their weak currencies while maintaining that it is in the best interest of the US to have a strong Dollar .
11 . Financial Derivatives
A derivative is a financial security which has no inherent value and instead derives its value from an underlying asset .
Financial derivatives , which include forwards , futures , options , and swaps , have proliferated in every branch of global capital markets .
In fact , many analysts insist that long term interest rates are now based more on swaps valuations than on government bonds .
With regard to forex , derivatives reflect market expectations for future exchange rates .
Previously the bastion of professional investors , these securities are now available to amateur investors , who can quote a 12 - month RMB / USD futures contract to see what exchange rate investors are willing to accept for delivery of RMB ( Chinese Yuan ) 12 months from now .
With regard to options , traders can look at implied volatility , which can be induced from the price of the option based on the strike price , current exchange rate and time to maturity .
Implied volatility offers an instant snapshot of how much investors believe a currency will fluctuate over the term of the option .
12 . Composition of the EU
The composition of the European Union ( “ EU ” ) certainly has a bearing on the value of the Euro .
As of October 2007 , the EU had 27 members , and is currently in talks to add 3 more .
When a new country adopts the Euro , its effect on the collective EU economy can be labeled either “ accretive ” or “ dilutive . ”
When a country ’s economic growth is higher than the EU average and / or its rate of inflation is lower , its effect on the EU average is said to be accretive .
The opposite set of circumstances will have a dilutive effect .
You may be familiar with this concept in the context of public company mergers , where analysts use similar language to evaluate the effect of the acquired company ’s relative profitability on the acquiring company ’s stock price .
13 . Rating Agencies
You are probably wondering how rating agencies ( S&P , Moody ’s , Fitch ) can influence forex , since after all , they do n’t issue ratings on specific currencies .
They do however , issue ratings for government bonds and a mix of other public / private securities .
In theory , these ratings should merely serve to reinforce investor opinion since both investors and rating agencies have access to the same information .
In practice , however , a great deal of stock is placed on a security ’s credit rating , and securities with the same ratings tend to trade at similar valuations .
When Iceland ’s sovereign debt was downgraded last year , its currency instantly dropped over 10 % .
In addition , it was not until collateralized debt obligations tied to US subprime mortgages were downgraded that economists and investors really began to take scope of the US real estate crisis , which now threatens to spread to the rest of the economy and drag down the Dollar .
In conclusion , there are numerous factors in forex that escape the attention of the mainstream business media .
Even when such factors do receive coverage , the link to forex is n’t clear .
This list is in no way exhaustive ; while its stated purpose was to bring to the surface a few unconventional forex factors , its broader purpose was to provide insight into a new framework for looking at what drives currencies .
Ultimately , the main point is to encourage you to shift your attention to secondary and tertiary factors , which underlie the primary factors of inflation and interest rates , which in turn , drive currencies .
Nancy Benoit Hustler Pictures
Hustler magazine has obtained a videotape of , the murdered wife of pro wrestler .
The video is what remains of a nude photo shoot that Nancy did in the 1980's that she hoped would springboard her into a career in adult modeling .
When Nancy met and married wrestler Kevin Sullivan , she began her career as a wrestling personality and the negatives from the nude photos were destroyed .
Taken over 20 years ago by radio DJ Mark Samansky , the video is the source of the pictures in Hustler , which will be appearing in the magazine 's upcoming issue .
Nancy Toffoloni Daus Sullivan
Benoit was a major sex symbol in the wrestling world , as she sold a series of THE PRIVATE PHOTOS OF FALLEN ANGEL risque pictures through wrestling magazine ads in 1986 .
Before adopting the name WOMAN in Ted Turner 's WCW and Paul Heyman 's original Extreme Championship Wrestling promotions , Nancy was known as The Fallen Angel , a sadomasochistic sex kitten beholden to Kevin Sullivan 's implied Satantic Cult .

Scientists are reporting evidence that intact , double - stranded DNA has the “ amazing ” ability to recognize similarities in other DNA strands from a distance .
And then like friends with similar interests , the bits of genetic material hangout or congregate together .
The recognition — of similar sequences in DNA ’s chemical subunits — occurs in a way once regarded as impossible , the researchers suggest in a study scheduled for the Jan. 31 issue of ACS ’ Journal of Physical Chemistry B .
Geoff S. Baldwin , Sergey Leikin , John M. Seddon , and Alexei A. Kornyshev and colleagues say the homology recognition between sequences of several hundred nucleotides occurs without physical contact or presence of proteins , factors once regarded as essential for the phenomenon .
This recognition may help increase the accuracy and efficiency of the homologous recombination of genes — a process responsible for DNA repair , evolution , and genetic diversity .
The new findings thus may shed light on ways to avoid recombination errors , which underpin cancer , aging , and other health problems .
In the study , scientists observed the behavior of fluorescently tagged DNA strands placed in water that contained no proteins or other material that could interfere with the experiment .
Strands with identical nucleotide sequences were about twice as likely to gather together as DNA strands with different sequences .
“ Amazingly , the forces responsible for the sequence recognition can reach across more than one nanometer of water separating the surfaces of the nearest neighbor DNA , ” said the authors .

That these candidates stand before us – and against one another at the same moment , is both breathtakingly sweet and extremely frustrating .
If either of them were up against the usual white man , we ’d know exactly what to do .
But as fate would have it , we must make a choice and so we have chosen to support Barack Obama .
Our choice was not made lightly .
Nor is it based upon our allegiance or betrayal to our “ gender . ”
We are not secretly suffering from internalized misogyny .
We are intelligent and thoughtful , 50 + year old lesbian feminists who choose Obama over Clinton because we believe he is the best candidate for America right now .
We know this choice sets us apart from our other lesbian feminist friends who have already told us why they support Hillary .
One of our dearest friends reasons that as women , we ought to support the woman candidate and let the Blacks support the African American candidate .
Period .
Another lesbian feminist friend sent an email where she reasoned :
“ She [ Hillary ] is the first woman to be a viable candidate for the presidency since Eleanor Roosevelt , and for the same reason :
Their husbands were presidents .
No , I ’m not happy about that , but the bottom line remains :
She has a shot at it , and I do n’t believe , in my lifetime , I will see another woman candidate who has that shot . ”
I could n't agree more ! ”
So , we want to explain to all of you – especially our lesbian feminist friends – our rationale for supporting Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton .
First , as feminists , we do not take our civic duty to choose a President lightly .
A candidate ’s gender is but one factor we consider .
More important than gender is whether or not a candidate shares our feminist world view .
Does he or she work for peace ?
Do they place the rights of people over profits and power ?
And just because a Condi Rice is a woman , we would n't vote for her -- even if she were only running for dog catcher .
Second , as feminists , we believe that the patriarchal system not only oppresses women but also minorities – including gay men , lesbians , bi-sexual , transgendered and transsexual persons .
Thus , if a minority person is elected President of the United States , many of the boundaries and obstacles to power created by patriarchy will crumble , thereby opening the floodgates of opportunity for women and minorities to run for the highest political office -- in the near future and beyond .
Third , our primary criticism of Hillary Clinton has to do with her stance on the Iraq war .
Rather than questioning the wisdom of using military force in Iraq , Clinton went along with the war - mongers without ever challenging them .
Hillary ’s vote for the Iraq war resolution and her convoluted explanation for why she did so , may foretell how , as President , she would continue to prop up a male - dominated , patriarchal mindset rather than try to transform it .
Fourth , we agree that Hillary has / had a right to ride Bill ’s coat - tails to power .
It is one of the few ways women have of getting there .
But now that she is a Senator and a viable candidate for President , we are discouraged to see her continue to rely on her connection to Bill rather than claiming her own power .
Unfortunately , in this campaign , we have seen and been reminded that the Clinton team will do whatever it takes to win -- not for the good of the country – not even for the good of the Democratic party – but merely for the good of the Clintons .
Fifth , we are not for Barack because we are against Hillary .
We are seriously impressed with Obama ’s promise to change the nature of politics and inspire hope -- even in the most cynical among us .
Unlike Clinton , we believe Obama has the temperament and ability to unite the warring political factions that stall real progress .
Unfortunately for Clinton , relying on her stint as First Lady ( in Arkansas and Washington ) , makes her the candidate with both the baggage and the advantage of her “ 35 years of experience .
Other than the war , on most issues and policies , there is not much difference between Obama and Clinton .
What is different is their leadership style .
Rather than telling people how its gonna be , Obama asks us to get involved in the process of making change happen .
Whether we like it or not , Hillary is the prime target of rabid right - wing Republicans who love nothing more than to bash both of the Clintons .
If she is our candidate , they and lots of other Hillary - haters will come out , en masse , to vote against her on election - day .
And many of those newly energized - by - Obama folks may feel so defeated by the partisan bickering , they will simply stay home .
Do n’t take our word for it -- if you want to understand the depth of Hillary hating in America , just spend a few hours each week listening to Washington Journal , a call - in show that airs each morning on C - Span .
And our last and most important reason for supporting Obama is the war in Iraq .
He does n’t just want to end the war , he wants to “ end the mindset that got us into war in the first place . ”
For us , this issue trumps all of the others .
Barack Obama is the only Presidential candidate from either side that even suggested that a mindset for war is – in and of itself -- a problem .

For the past two weeks , I ’ve been spending time cleaning up my finances .
I ’ve been evaluating all of my auto payments , making sure they are all set - up like they should , looking at my automatic savings deposits for our property tax fund , Christmas fund , and emergency savings to make sure they are set - up .
I guess you could say I ’ve been doing a little spring cleaning on our finances .
I ’ve even switched from my custom budget spreadsheet to You Need A Budget , which is working rather well .
I ’ve also been updating my debt snowball and calculating where we are with paying off our debts and how much we can afford to pay against them this year .
I think about our debt frequently .
As I ’ve said , its a dark cloud that is always over me and a constant pressure that while easing up some , is continually there .
I find it hard to not get discouraged when that dark cloud just never seems to shrink as quickly as I would like it to .
I thought I would share a few tips that will tell you how to kiss your debt goodbye this year :
If you do n’t have a debt snowball , start one
I wrote about this some yesterday , so I wo n’t rehash it .
If you do n’t currently have a debt snowball , start one .
A debt snowball is the quickest and most efficient way to start taking major chunks out of your debt .
A debt snowball is visible feedback that you are making progress .
Stop going into debt
Climbing out of a hole is a bit difficult if you continue to dig the hole deeper .
If you have outstanding balances on your credit cards that you can’t payoff monthly , stop using your credit cards .
If you ca n’t stop using your credit cards , take a leap of faith and throw them out .
I have n’t used one in over a year , and have n’t needed them once .
Do n’t take out a loan on a new car , do n’t do the 90 days same as cash on that new HDTV you ’ve been wanting , etc , etc .
To begin making significant progress on your debt , you have to address the first and most difficult obstacle … you .
Yes you .
You got yourself into debt , your bad habits caused you to be where you are , and only you can get yourself out .
You just have to look at yourself in the mirror and decide to stop making bad financial choices .
Once you do this , the road is long , but the process is fairly simple .
Pay as much as you can against your debt
Create a reasonable but tight budget .
Apply whatever spare income you have against your debt snowball .
We have cut out budget back about as far as we can , and are in a position to apply about $ 900 – $ 1300 / month against our debt .
The amount varies depending on our monthly expenses .
Do n’t make the mistake of overpaying on your debt and then not being able to pay your bills or life basics .
For some money saving tips that may help you reduce your budget , read through my Money Saving Monday Tips Series or read the The Money Saving Methods Report .
Set specific goals
Set goals about paying off your debt , and make them SMART .
We set a goal to payoff a minimum of $ 1000.00 per month against our debt .
There will be one or two months where this is going to be a little difficult , but we ’ll cross that bridge when we get there ( Matthew 6:34 ) .
Setting goals helps keep you focused and driven .
A goal is a constant reminder of your commitment , and it lays out a path to the larger goal you have of getting out of debt .
Think of it as a plan or step .
Snowflake
Paid Twice over at I ’ve Paid Twice For This Already started something called snowflaking .
She advocates making lots of small payments against your debt to further the debt snowball effect .
I do this at least weekly .
We always seem to get some small check in the mail , or find spare cash laying around and even sometimes underspend a budget category .
When we do this , I take that money and immediately make a payment against the first debt in our debt snowball .
You would be amazed how how quickly these small payments can add up and significantly increase your progress .
I do n’t make a lot of money on this blog , but it is growing .
I take every single penny and apply it to our debt .
When I receive a payment from an advertiser , I turn right around and make a payment against our debts .
This is a good lead in to my next tip …
Earn some extra income
Another great way to increase your progress on paying off your debt is to earn extra income .
I do this through blogging and through doing small computer consulting jobs on the side .
I ’m also into aquariums , and have been paid to set - up and do aquarium maintenance in the past .
Others , like Ana over at DebtFREE - Revolution is getting a degree , blogs , and delivers pizza in the evenings .
Other ideas include finding a night job , selling items on eBay , making money from your hobbies such as selling crafts or starting a small photography business .
If you do a little digging , there are literally thousands of things you can do that will provide you with a little extra income .
Be creative !
Just think , if you could make an extra couple hundred dollars each month , how much would that extra money speed up your debt snowball ?
For me , it ’s cut years off .
One word of caution though , there are a number of scams on the internet that promise to make you rich if you just pay them $ 100 dollars .
Others say you can make $ 25 / hour just working at home .
I believe in the old rule , “ If it looks too good to be true , it probably is . ”
Do your homework , and do n’t fall victim to these get rich scams .
Sell some stuff
We all have tons of stuff laying around that we no longer use or need .
Have a garage sale or sell your items on eBay or Craigslist .
Take the proceeds and pay off some of your debt .
We cleaned out our closets , kid ’s rooms , and storage areas .
We sold all of it at 2 garage sales we had last year .
We paid more than $ 1,000 against our debt , and removed a great deal of clutter from our home .
Trust me , with 6 kids …we know clutter !
Regarding stuff : I know that getting rid of stuff is a little difficult sometimes .
I used to be into model trains when I was younger .
I enjoyed the hobby immensely , but once I got married started a full time job and began having children the amount of space and time I had for the hobby quickly diminished .
All of my engines , cars , scenery and magazines went into storage and sat there for 15 years .
While cleaning out our house and selling stuff , I asked myself , why am I keeping this ?
I never use it , probably wo n’t for along time down the road , if ever , and someone else could be using it .
I told my model train equipment for a very nice profit , and again paid more against our debt .
The message I am trying to convey here is take a hard look at the items you are clinging too and why you want to keep them .
I ’d rather be debt free and have to repurchase the model train equipment down the road .
Do n’t get too attached to your stuff …it ’s only stuff .
Final Thoughts
There are lots of things you can do to accelerate your debt payoff .
These are just a few of them .
Others include getting your rates reduced , transferring your balances to 0 % or lower rate cards , and even using your savings if you have a lot .
Do n’t , and I repeat , do n’t confuse trading one debt for another as paying off your debt .
If you get a home equity line to payoff your debt , you ’re still in debt , you just moved it .
If you consolidate , you ’re still in debt too … again you just moved it .
Persistence and determination is what will get you out of debt .
So I challenge you to begin the process of kissing your debt goodbye this year !
Studies show that people who commit to doing something in writing have a 90 % chance of actually doing it .
People who do n’t , have less than a 10 % chance .
Will you commit via a comment to do one or more of the above items ?
Do you have other ideas or suggestions for getting out of debt ?

So does the A.D.A. in some cases hurt the very patients it is intended to help ?
That ’s a hard question to answer with the available medical data .
But the economists Daron Acemoglu and Joshua Angrist once asked a similar question : How did the A.D.A. affect employment among the disabled ?
Image Credit ... Illustration by Paul Sahre
Their conclusion was rather startling and makes Andrew Brooks ’s hunch ring true .
Acemoglu and Angrist found that when the A.D.A. was enacted in 1992 , it led to a sharp drop in the employment of disabled workers .
How could this be ?
Employers , concerned that they would n’t be able to discipline or fire disabled workers who happened to be incompetent , apparently avoided hiring them in the first place .
How long have such do - good laws been backfiring ?
Consider the ancient Jewish laws concerning the sabbatical , or seventh year .
As commanded in the Bible , all Jewish - owned lands in Israel were to lie fallow every seventh year , with the needy allowed to gather whatever food continued to grow .
Even more significant , all loans were to be forgiven in the sabbatical .
The appeal of such unilateral debt relief cannot be overestimated , since the penalties for defaulting on a loan at the time were severe : a creditor could go so far as to take a debtor or his children into bondage .
So for a poor Jewish sandal maker having trouble with his loan payments , the sabbatical law was truly a godsend .
If you were a creditor , however , you saw things differently .
Why should you lend the sandal maker money if he could just tear up the loan in Year Seven ?
Creditors duly gamed the system , making loans in the years right after a sabbatical , when they were confident they would be repaid , but then pulling tight the purse strings in Years Five and Six .
The resulting credit drought was so damaging to poor people that it fell to the great sage Hillel to fix things .
His solution , known as prosbul , allowed a lender to go to court and pre-emptively declare that a specific loan would not be subject to sabbatical debt relief , transferring the debt to the court itself and thereby empowering it to collect the loan .
This left the law technically intact but allowed for lenders to once again make credit available to the poor without taking on unwarranted risk for themselves .
The fallow - land portion of the sabbatical law , meanwhile , was upheld for centuries , but it , too , finally gained a loophole , called heter mechira .
This allowed for a Jew to temporarily “ sell ” his land to a non-Jew and to continue farming it during the sabbatical year and then “ buy ” it back immediately afterward  a solution that helped the modern state of Israel keep its agricultural economy humming .
The trouble is that many of the most observant Israeli Jews reject this maneuver as a sleight of hand that violates the spirit of the law .
Many of these traditionalists are also extremely poor .
And so this year , which happens to be a sabbatical year , the poorest Jews in Israel who wish to eat only food grown on non-Jewish land are left to buy imported goods at double or triple the regular price  all in order to uphold a law meant to help feed the poorest Jews in Israel .
( Exclusive to Accuracy in Media )
I have just seen Hillary Clinton and her former
Yale law professor both in tears at a campaign rally here in my home state of Connecticut .
Her tearful professor said how proud he was that his former student was likely to become our next President .
Hillary responded in tears .
My own reaction was of regret that , when I terminated her employment on the Nixon impeachment staff , I had not reported her unethical practices to the appropriate bar associations .
Hillary as I knew her in 1974
At the time of Watergate I had overall supervisory authority over the House Judiciary Committee ’s Impeachment Inquiry staff that included Hillary Rodham — who was later to become First Lady in the Clinton White House .
During that period I kept a private diary of the behind the scenes congressional activities .
My original tape recordings of the diary and other materials related to the Nixon impeachment provided the basis for my prior book , Without Honor , and are now available for inspection in the George Washington University Library .
After President Nixon ’s resignation , a young lawyer , who shared an office with Hillary , confided in me that he was dismayed by her erroneous legal opinions and efforts to deny Nixon representation by counsel — as well as an unwillingness to investigate Nixon .
In my diary of August 12 , 1974 I noted the following :
John Labovitz apologized to me for the fact that months ago he and Hillary had lied to me [ to conceal rules changes and dilatory tactics ] .
Labovitz said , ‘ That came from Yale . ’
I said , ‘ You mean Burke Marshall ’ [ Senator Ted Kennedy ’s chief political strategist , with whom Hillary regularly consulted in violation of House rules . ]
Labovitz said , ‘ Yes . ’
His apology was significant to me , not because it was a revelation but because of his contrition .
At that time Hillary Rodham was 27 years old .
She had obtained a position on our committee staff through the political patronage of her former Yale law school professor Burke Marshall and Senator Ted Kennedy .
Eventually , because of a number of her unethical practices I decided that I could not recommend her for any subsequent position of public or private trust .
Her patron , Burke Marshal , had previously been Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights under Robert Kennedy .
During the Kennedy administration Washington insiders jokingly characterized him as the Chief counsel to the Irish Mafia .
After becoming a Yale professor , he also became Senator Ted Kennedy ’s lawyer at the time of Chappaquidick — as well as Kennedy ’s chief political strategist .
As a result , some of his colleagues often described him as the Attorney General in waiting of the Camelot government in exile .
In addition to getting Hillary a job on the Nixon impeachment inquiry staff , Kennedy and Marshall had also persuaded Peter Rodino ( D - NJ ) , then - Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , to place two other close friends of Marshall in top positions on our staff .
One was John Doar ; who had been Marshall ’s deputy in the Justice Department — whom Rodino appointed to head the impeachment inquiry staff .
The other was Bernard Nussbaum , who had served as Assistant U.S. Attorney in New York — who was placed in charge of conducting the actual investigation of Nixon ’s malfeasance .
Marshall , Doar , Nussbaum , and Rodham had two hidden objectives regarding the conduct of the impeachment proceedings .
First , in order to enhance the prospect of Senator Kennedy or another liberal Democrat being elected president in 1976 , they hoped to keep Nixon in office “ twisting in the wind ” for as long as possible .
This would prevent then - Vice President Jerry Ford from becoming President and restoring moral authority to the Republican Party .
As was later quoted in the biography of Tip O’Neill ( by John Farrell ) , a liberal Democrat would have become a “ shoe - in for the presidency in 1976 ” if Nixon had been kept in office until the end of his term .
However , both Tip O’Neill and I — as well as most Democrats — regarded it to be in the national interest to replace Nixon with Ford as soon as possible .
As a result , as described by O’Neill , we coordinated our efforts to “ keep Rodino ’s feet to the fire . ”
A second objective of the strategy of delay was to avoid a Senate impeachment trial , in which as a defense Nixon might assert that Kennedy had authorized far worse abuses of power than Nixon ’s effort to “ cover up ” the Watergate burglary ( which Nixon had not authorized or known about in advance ) .
In short , the crimes of Kennedy included the use of the Mafia to attempt to assassinate Castro , as well as the successful assassinations of Diem in Vietnam and Lumumba in the Congo .
After hiring Hillary , Doar assigned her to confer with me regarding rules of procedure for the impeachment inquiry .
At my first meeting with her I told her that Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter Rodino , House Speaker Carl Albert , Majority Leader Tip O’Neill , Parliamentarian Lou Deschler and I had previously all agreed that we should rely only on the then existing House Rules , and not advocate any changes .
I also quoted Tip O’Neill ’s statement that : “ To try to change the rules now would be politically divisive .
It would be like trying to change the traditional rules of baseball before a World Series . ”
Hillary assured me that she had not drafted , and would not advocate , any such rules changes .
However , as documented in my personal diary , I soon learned that she had lied .
She had already drafted changes , and continued to advocate them .
In one written legal memorandum , she advocated denying President Nixon representation by counsel .
In so doing she simply ignored the fact that in the committee ’s then - most - recent prior impeachment proceeding , the committee had afforded the right to counsel to Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas .
I had also informed Hillary that the Douglas impeachment files were available for public inspection in the committee offices .
She later removed the Douglas files without my permission and carried them to the offices of the impeachment inquiry staff — where they were no longer accessible to the public .
Hillary had also made other ethically flawed procedural recommendations , arguing that the Judiciary Committee should : not hold any hearings with — or take depositions of — any live witnesses ; not conduct any original investigation of Watergate , bribery , tax evasion , or any other possible impeachable offense of President Nixon ; and should rely solely on documentary evidence compiled by other committees and by the Justice Department ’s special Watergate prosecutor .
Only a few far - left Democrats supported Hillary ’s recommendations .
A majority of the committee agreed to allow President Nixon to be represented by counsel and to hold hearings with live witnesses .
Hillary then advocated that the official rules of the House be amended to deny members of the committee the right to question witnesses .
This recommendation was voted down by the full House .
The committee also rejected her proposal that we leave the drafting of the articles of impeachment to her and her fellow impeachment - inquiry staffers .
It was not until two months after Nixon ’s resignation that I first learned of still another questionable role of Hillary .
On Sept. 26 , 1974 , Rep. Charles Wiggins , a Republican member of the committee , wrote to ask Chairman Rodino to look into “ a troubling set of events . ”
That spring , Wiggins and other committee members had asked “ that research should be undertaken so as to furnish a standard against which to test the alleged abusive conduct of Richard Nixon . ”
And , while “ no such staff study was made available to the members at any time for their use , ” Wiggins had just learned that such a study had been conducted — at committee expense — by a team of professors who completed and filed their reports with the impeachment - inquiry staff well in advance of our public hearings .
The report was kept secret from members of Congress .
But after the impeachment - inquiry staff was disbanded , it was published commercially and sold in book stores .
Wiggins wrote : “ I am especially troubled by the possibility that information deemed essential by some of the members in their discharge of their responsibilities may have been intentionally suppressed by the staff during the course of our investigation . ”
He was also concerned that staff members may have unlawfully received royalties from the book ’s publisher .
On Oct. 3 , Rodino wrote back : “ Hillary Rodham of the impeachment - inquiry staff coordinated the work .
The staff did not think the manuscript was useful in its present form . ”
No effort was ever made to ascertain whether or not Hillary or any other person on the committee staff received royalties .
Two decades later Bill Clinton became President .
As was later to be described in The Wall Street Journal by Henry Ruth — the lead Watergate courtroom prosecutor —
“ The Clintons corrupted the soul of the Democratic Party . ”
Despite the official and media portrayal of the incident in the Strait of Hormuz early Monday morning as a serious threat to US ships from Iranian speedboats that nearly resulted in a " battle at sea , " new information over the past three days suggests that the incident did not involve such a threat and that no US commander was on the verge of firing at the Iranian boats .
The new information that appears to contradict the original version of the incident includes the revelation that US officials spliced the audio recording of an alleged Iranian threat onto to a videotape of the incident .
That suggests that the threatening message may not have come in immediately after the initial warning to Iranian boats from a US warship , as it appears to do on the video .
Also unraveling the story is testimony from a former US naval officer that non-official chatter is common on the channel used to communicate with the Iranian boats and testimony from the commander of the US 5th fleet that the commanding officers of the US warships involved in the incident never felt the need to warn the Iranians of a possible use of force against them .
Further undermining the US version of the incident is a video released by Iran Thursday showing an Iranian naval officer on a small boat hailing one of three ships .
The Iranian commander is heard to say , " Coalition warship 73 , this is Iranian navy patrol boat . "
He then requests the " side numbers " of the US warships .
A voice with a US accent replies , " This is coalition warship 73 .
I am operating in international waters . "
The dramatic version of the incident reported by US news media throughout Tuesday and Wednesday suggested that Iranian speedboats , apparently belonging to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard navy , had made moves to attack three US warships entering the Strait and that the US commander had been on the verge of firing at them when they broke off .
Typical of the network coverage was a story by ABC ’s Jonathan Karl quoting a Pentagon official as saying the Iranian boats " were a heartbeat from being blown up . "
Bush administration officials seized on the incident to advance the portrayal of Iran as a threat and to strike a more threatening stance toward Iran .
National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley declared Wednesday that the incident " almost involved an exchange of fire between our forces and Iranian forces . "
President George W. Bush declared during his Mideast trip Wednesday that there would be " serious consequences " if Iran attacked US ships and repeated his assertion that Iran is " a threat to world peace . "
Central to the depiction of the incident as involving a threat to US warships is a mysterious pair of messages that the sailor who heard them onboard immediately interpreted as saying , " I am coming at you … , " and " You will explode after a few minutes . "
But the voice in the audio clearly said " I am coming to you , " and the second message was much less clear .
Furthermore , as the New York Times noted Thursday , the recording carries no ambient noise , such as the sounds of a motor , the sea or wind , which should have been audible if the broadcast had been made from one of the five small Iranian boats .
A veteran US naval officer who had served as a surface warfare officer aboard a US Navy destroyer in the Gulf sent a message to the New York Times on - line column " The Lede " Wednesday pointing out that in the Persian Gulf , the " bridge - to - bridge " radio channel used to communicate between ships " is like a bad CB radio " with many people using it for " hurling racial slurs " and " threats . "
The former officer wrote that his " first thought " was that the message " might not have even come from one of the Iranian craft . "
Pentagon officials admitted to the Times that they could not rule out that the broadcast might have come from another source
The five Iran boats involved were hardly in a position to harm the three US warships .
Although Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman described the Iranian boats as " highly maneuverable patrol craft " that were " visibly armed , " he failed to note that these are tiny boats carrying only a two - or three - man crew and that they are normally armed only with machine guns that could do only surface damage to a US ship .
The only boat that was close enough to be visible to the US ships was unarmed , as an enlarged photo of the boat from the navy video clearly shows .
The US warships were not concerned about the possibility that the Iranian boats were armed with heavier weapons capable of doing serious damage .
Asked by a reporter whether any of the vessels had anti-ship missiles or torpedoes , Vice Adm .
Kevin Cosgriff , Commander of the 5th Fleet , answered that none of them had either of those two weapons .
" I did n’t get the sense from the reports I was receiving that there was a sense of being afraid of these five boats , " said Cosgriff .
The edited Navy video shows a crewman issuing an initial warning to approaching boats , but the footage of the boats maneuvering provides no visual evidence of Iranian boats " making a run on US ships " as claimed by CBS news Wednesday in its report based on the new video .
Vice Adm .
Cosgriff also failed to claim any run toward the US ships following the initial warning .
Cosgriff suggested that the Iranian boat ’s maneuvers were " unduly provocative " only because of the " aggregate of their maneuvers , the radio call and the dropping of objects in the water . "
He described the objects dropped by the Iranian boat as being " white , box - like objects that floated . "
That description indicates that the objects were clearly not mines , which would have been dark and would have sunk immediately .
Cosgriff indicated that the ships merely " passed by them safely " without bothering to investigate whether they were explosives of some kind .
The apparent absence of concern on the part of the US ships ’ commanding officers about the floating objects suggests that they recognized that the Iranians were engaging in a symbolic gesture having to do with laying mines .
Cosgriff ’s answers to reporters ’ questions indicated that the story promoted earlier by Pentagon officials that one of the US ships came very close to firing at the Iranian boats seriously distorted what actually happened .
When Cosgriff was asked whether the crew ever gave warning to the Iranian boats that they " could come under fire , " he said the commanding officers " did not believe they needed to fire warning shots . "
As for the report circulated by at least one Pentagon official to the media that one of the commanders was " close to firing , " Cosgriff explained that " close to " meant that the commander was " working through a series of procedures . "
He added , " [ I ] n his mind , he might have been closing in on that point . "
Despite Cosgriff ’s account , which contradicted earlier Pentagon portrayals of the incident as a confrontation , not a single news outlet modified its earlier characterization of the incident .
After the Cosgriff briefing , Associated Press carried a story that said , " US forces were taking steps toward firing on the Iranians to defend themselves , said the US naval commander in the region .
But the boats  believed to be from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard ’s navy  turned and moved away , officials said . "
That was quite different from what Cosgriff actually said .
In its story covering the Cosgriff briefing , Reuters cited " other Pentagon officials , speaking on condition of anonymity " as saying that " a US captain was in the process of ordering sailors to open fire when the Iranian boats moved away "  a story that Cosgriff had specifically denied .
Spore 's going to be massive .
To be honest , I had n't really paid that much attention to Will Wright 's terminally delayed simulation - of - everything over the last few years .
For one , I 'm not exactly into sim games , whether of the big - S or small -s variety .
Another , the concept just seemed so impossible : Going from a cell to a creature to a civilization to space ?
Yeah , good luck finishing that .
But for me , going to Maxis a few weeks ago to see the latest version was the turn - around point .
I realized something that I was n't even considering before : Spore is very much a casual game .
As we walked into Maxis ' offices in Emeryville , there were giant posters up all over the walls that iterated the designers ' mission statement .
They might have been placed there for the benefit of visiting journalists , but I got the feeling they were a semi- permanent installation , meant to remind team members every time they walked by that they want players to be able to get all the way to the " space " portion of the game without feeling frustrated .
This was reflected in other design choices .
Rather than force the player to start at the " cell " level , you can instead select between any of the five different parts of the game right from the start .
While this is certainly sure to be a controversial decision – it takes a lot away from the sense of growth and expansion that I believed the game would have if it forced you to start from the beginning – it'll let anybody jump in wherever they feel most comfortable .
This is especially important considering that Maxis sees the creature creator as a major " front door " into the Spore experience .
They 're going to give it away for free before Spore launches , just to get people involved and making creatures .
If they 're right , it 'll be a huge draw and a big online community will pop up simply based on making creatures with the intuitive and very funny creator – before the game even ships .
And then , says Will Wright , when the game is available , people using the creator will be automatically notified .
Slick .
Speaking to Wired.com , Wright said that he does n't mind if , for some people , this is all they do .
" I might decide I want to just buy the trading card of my creature , or other things we might attach , and never buy the PC game , " he said .
" So in some sense that free creature editor might become the hub of that franchise .
The PC game is just one of the big spokes off that hub . "
Imagine all the possible interactions .
You might have people creating creatures just to put them into movies .
And you might have hardcore gamers just playing the game and exploring space .
But then they might come across those characters , who 've been pollinated into their worlds automatically .
And then they 'll click on the creature and be able to see who made it , and bring up the Sporepedia then and there to see what else this person has done , and they 'll be able to watch their machinima on YouTube , right in the game .
And then they 'll become best friends and get married .
Okay , okay .
I know this is starting to sound a little bit like Will Wright 's Pee .
And the issue raised in that comic is still a valid concern .
All the people who sunk their lives into The Sims will love this , but as I said above – that 's not my cup of tea .
I even abandoned my Nintendog .
So for me , as a gamer , the crucial question is , is it a fun game ?
Is Spore going to be engaging and enjoyable to me to play through from a cell to the center of the galaxy , from a gameplay perspective ?
That , I have absolutely no idea .
But I can say now that I 'm really interested in finding out .

TOKYO ( Reuters Life ! ) - Economic forecasters beware : Japanese women are cutting their hair again .
Women tend to wear their hair long when Japan ’s economy is doing well and short when there is a slump , the Nikkei business daily reported , citing a survey conducted by Japanese cosmetics company Kao Corp .
As for Japan ’s future economic performance , the Nikkei pointed to expectations for a trend towards shorter hairstyles .
This mirrors the view among some analysts that Japan ’s longest growth cycle since the Second World War may have ended and the economy is at risk of falling into a recession .
Kao , Japan ’s second - largest cosmetics firm , has conducted regular surveys of 1,000 women on the streets of Tokyo and Osaka over the past two decades , the Nikkei said .
Until the early 1990s , when Japan ’s economic bubble burst , 60 percent of women in their twenties kept their hair long , the Nikkei said , citing the survey .
During the 1990s economic slump , short hair -- defined as above the collarbone -- became the dominant hairstyle for Japanese women .
But since 2002 , long hair has regained some popularity -- just as the economy started to expand , the Nikkei said .
The Nikkei also identified a new factor that could affect the validity of hair length as an economic indicator : the rising popularity of the chignon .
ローヤルゼリーの種類について
ローヤルゼリーといえばミツバチの女王だけが食べることを許されている特別な食べ物です。このローヤルゼリーにいくつかの種類があることはご存じでしょうか？ゼリー状のような外観をイメージしがちですが、具体的にはどんな種類が存在しているのでしょうか。
ローヤルゼリーの原材料は草花の花粉や蜜です。これらをミツバチが体内で消化し、分解し再構成したものがローヤルゼリーとなります。まず、出来たてそのままのゼリーを直接採取したものが「生ローヤルゼリー」と呼ばれています。非常に鮮度が良く、生のまま余計な熱や加工を施していないため栄養もとても豊富。逆に、そのままにしておくとすぐに品質が低下してしまうので管理が難しいものとされています。
次に、生のものの水分を飛ばし、粉末タイプにしたものが「乾燥ローヤルゼリー」です。これは生と違って長期的な保存が可能であり、持ち運びや旅行に適しているためとても人気があります。また、直接口に入れずカプセルに入ったタイプなども好評です。粉末化されたことでさらに生活に取り入れやすく、応用がきくようになっています。
そして最も知られていないものが「調整ローヤルゼリー」と呼ばれるタイプ。ゼリー以外の成分や原料を加えたりすることで栄養価をアップさせたり、食べやすくされているものです。調整ローヤルゼリーのみ生・乾燥どちらにも当てはまることがあります。調整豆乳など他の調整食品にも言えることですが、その食品全てが一種類ではないため、そのものの効果を期待することはできません。他の原料や栄養素と組み合わさることによって効果を発揮してくれるものであり、例としてはコエンザイムQ10やコラーゲン、プラセンタなど美肌づくりを意識して調整されているローヤルゼリーが最近では人気のようです。ローヤルゼリーを試す際は、用途に応じてこれらの製品をうまく使い分けてみると良いでしょう。
他にも美容効果が期待できる高麗人参の効能も考えて、高麗人参のサプリメントを使ってみると良いと思います。
ローヤルゼリーは芸能人の間でも人気があるそうです。
レーシックをやっている芸能人も多いようです。
Smoking cannabis regularly can lead to gum disease in people in their early thirties – much younger than generally expected , according to a new study .
Lifestyle factors associated with the condition are also linked to chronic diseases later in life , and some argue that gum disease itself may contribute to cardiovascular disease directly .
A quarter of people who had smoked cannabis regularly from 18 to 32 years old had established gum disease , found the study led by Murray Thomson at the Dunedin School of Dentistry in New Zealand .
In 2007 , the same team showed that smoking tobacco also significantly raises the risk of gum disease in young people ( Journal of Clinical Periodontology , vol 34 , page 828 )
In an editorial accompanying the current study ( Journal of the American Medical Association , vol 299 , page 574 ) , Philippe Hujoel at the University of Washington in Seattle , US , suggests that dentists should treat the early signs of gum disease as “ the canary in the coal mine ” and use it to identify patients at risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease .

‘ Destructive effect ’
Smoking and other lifestyle factors such as poor diet that are linked to gum disease , are also linked to chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease that usually become apparent at a later age .
Some experts even argue that gum disease may directly contribute to cardiovascular disease , although this remains controversial .
“ You can see the destructive effect of smoking cannabis or tobacco much earlier than we thought you would .
Dentists are the first witnesses of an adverse lifestyle .
They are in a good position to give a physician referral or to talk about smoking cessation , which would benefit more than the oral cavity , ” says Hujoel .
In the study , the Thomson team followed 903 people from 18 to 32 years old .
They collected information about their use of cannabis at 18 , 21 , 26 and 32 years old , and did dental examinations at 26 and 32 years old .
Only 4 % of the 400 people at age 32 who never smoked cannabis had gum disease – defined as having more than 5 mm of their gum detached from the tooth in at least one place in their mouth .
Detachment of the gum , causes jaw bone to disappear , and – if untreated – teeth to fall out .
‘ Big risks ’
In contrast , 12 % of the 428 people who smoked cannabis between 1 and 40 times a year , and 26 % of the 182 people who smoked cannabis more than 40 times a year had gum disease at that age .
“ A quarter of the people who had smoked cannabis regularly from 18 to 32 years old had established gum disease .
We were surprised at how big the risks were , ” says Thomson .
That increased risk existed even when the team took into account other factors such as tobacco smoking , sex ( women tend to look after their teeth better ) , and the amount of plaque on the teeth – a good indicator of oral hygiene .
The moderate cannabis users still had over twice the risk of gum disease , and the heavy cannabis users three times the risk , compared with people who never smoked cannabis .
The findings contradict the common perception that gum disease happens in middle age , and is caused mainly by build up of plaque and poor dental hygiene rather than lifestyle , says Hujoel .

Japan Test Fires Its First Raytheon - Built Standard Missile-3
SM - 3 is being developed as part of the MDA 's sea - based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System .
The missiles will be deployed on Aegis cruisers and destroyers to defend against short - to - intermediate range ballistic missile threats in the midcourse phase of flight .

Kauai HI ( SPX ) Dec 20 , 2007
The Japan Maritime Self - Defense Force successfully flight tested its first Raytheon Company ( NYSE : RTN ) - built Standard Missile - 3 .
The SM - 3 Block IA missile engaged and destroyed a medium - range ballistic missile target more than 60 miles above the Pacific Ocean .
Personnel at the U.S. Navy 's Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai launched the ballistic missile target while the crew of the Japanese destroyer JS KONGO ( DDG - 173 ) fired the intercepting missile .
" Today 's intercept truly paves the way for Japan to deploy a sea - based ballistic missile defense system , " said Ed Miyashiro , Raytheon Missile Systems vice president .
" The U.S. has gained an important ally that can now defend itself against the threat of ballistic missiles . "
During the test , the Japanese crew exchanged track information via satellite with U.S. naval assets , demonstrating missile defense interoperability between the two countries .
This test was the 12th successful intercept for the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system 's SM - 3 .
Japan is working with Raytheon and the Missile Defense Agency ( MDA ) to develop and deploy the next - generation SM - 3 Block IIA missile , which will provide a larger area of defense against more sophisticated threats .
SM - 3 is being developed as part of the MDA 's sea - based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System .
The missiles will be deployed on Aegis cruisers and destroyers to defend against short - to - intermediate range ballistic missile threats in the midcourse phase of flight .
" Where Should Airport Security Begin ? "
In this essay , Clark Ervin argues that airport security should begin at the front door to the airport :
Like many people , I spend a lot of time in airport terminals , and I often think that they must be an awfully appealing target to terrorists .
The largest airports have huge terminals teeming with thousands of passengers on any given day .
They serve as conspicuous symbols of American consumerism , with McDonald ’s restaurants , Starbucks coffee shops and Disney toy stores .
While airport screeners do only a so - so job of checking for guns , knives and bombs at checkpoints , there ’s no checking for weapons before checkpoints .
So if the intention is n’t to carry out an attack once on board a plane , but instead to carry out an attack on the airport itself by killing people inside it , there ’s nothing to stop a terrorist from doing so . [… ]
To prevent smaller attacks — and larger ones that could be catastrophic — what if we moved the screening checkpoints from the interior of airports to the entrance ?
The sooner we screen passengers ’ and visitors ’ persons and baggage ( both checked and carry - on ) for guns , knives and explosives , the sooner we can detect those weapons and prevent them from being used to sow destruction .
This is a silly argument , one that any regular reader of this blog should be able to counter .
If you ’re worried about explosions on the ground , any place you put security checkpoints is arbitrary .
The point of airport security is to prevent terrorism on the airplanes , because airplane terrorism is a more serious problem than conventional bombs blowing up in crowded buildings .
( Four reasons .
First , airlines are often national symbols .
Second , airplanes often fly to dangerous countries .
Third , for whatever reason , airplanes are a preferred terrorist target .
And fourth , the particular failure mode of airplanes means that even a small bomb can kill everyone on board .
That same bomb in an airport means that a few people die and many more get injured . )
And most airport security measures are n’t effective .
His bias betrays itself primary through this quote :
Like many people , I spend a lot of time in airport terminals , and I often think that they must be an awfully appealing target to terrorists .
If he spent a lot of time in shopping malls , he would probably think they must be awfully appealing targets as well .
They also “ serve as conspicuous symbols of American consumerism , with McDonald ’s restaurants , Starbucks coffee shops and Disney toy stores . ”
He sounds like he ’s just scared .
Face it , there are far too many targets .
Stop trying to defend against the tactic , and instead try to defend against terrorism .
Airport security is the last line of defense , and not a very good one at that .
Real security happens long before anyone gets to an airport , a shopping mall , or wherever .

Let us now bullet - point our praise for Mark Dytham and Astrid Klein , two Tokyo - based architects who have turned PowerPoint , that fixture of cubicle life , into both art form and competitive sport .
Their innovation , dubbed pecha-kucha ( Japanese for " chatter " ) , applies a simple set of rules to presentations : exactly 20 slides displayed for 20 seconds each .
That 's it .
Say what you need to say in six minutes and 40 seconds of exquisitely matched words and images and then sit the hell down .
The result , in the hands of masters of the form , combines business meeting and poetry slam to transform corporate cliché into surprisingly compelling beat - the - clock performance art .
The duo — Dytham is British , Klein Italian — invented pecha- kucha four years ago to help revive a struggling performance space they owned .
The first presentations were such a hit that they began hosting monthly pecha- kucha events , boozy affairs at which Tokyo architects and designers showcased their streamlined offerings to crowds of hundreds .
Now there are pecha-nights in 80 cities , from Amsterdam and Atlanta to San Francisco and Shanghai .
Why ?
Dytham believes that the rules have a liberating effect .
" Suddenly , " he says , " there 's no preciousness in people 's presentations . "
Just poetry .
At long last , my pecha- kucha presentation :

Next : Jargon Watch : Microbesoft , Geosniff , Witricity
Necessity is the mother of invention they say and while the state of the planet is of huge concern , the environmental crisis we face is certainly spurring on some amazing innovation in the field of renewable energy systems .
Take for example this very interesting contraption – a vertical axis wind turbine embedded with solar cells .
So if the sun ’s shinin ’ , but the wind ai n’t blowin’ – you ’ve still got juice ; and vice - versa .
If you have both ; even better .
The 5 kW Bluenergy Solarwind ™ Turbine ‘s double - helix curved wind vanes are mounted on a vertical axis and covered with solar cells .
Instead of using glass , the cells are covered with clear Teflon ( uh - oh , but more on that later ) .
The manufacturer states the turbine will generate electricity in breezes as low as 4 mph and is designed to produce power in winds up to 90 mph ; speeds far higher than horizontal axis turbines are able to operate in .
It ’s also reported to be silent in operation .
An interesting point is that when the wind is blowing , the solar cells are cooled by the rotation , which is said to assist in maximum electricity generation .
It ’s quite an imposing structure , standing at around 18 feet high and 6 feet wide but given the design I guess for some it would make an interesting artistic statement as well as being a source of electricity .
There ’s something very “ 2001 : A Space Odyssey ” about it – the monolith scene the beginning of the movie .
This is n’t a cheap power source by any means in terms of initial outlay .
You ’re looking at around USD $ 35 k to have a SolarWind turbine installed and the total cost over its lifetime ( 25 years ~ 330,000 k Whrs ) is estimated to be around USD $ 42 k – that includes replacing one small generator .
According to Bluenergy Solarwind ™ site , that would put the payback period at around 18 years for an installation in New Mexico without any subsidies taken into consideration .
With renewable energy rebates taken into account , it could be as little as 10 years .
The cost averages out to 13 ¢ / kWhr down to 8 ¢ / kWhr with full subsidy .
The figures are based on installation in an area with an annual mean wind speed of 14mph .
Even at 42 k , from what I understand from the info provided on the site , it ’s still cheaper to purchase an installation such as this than to buy a wind turbine and panels separately as a 50/50 setup .
Regarding my “ uh oh ” about the Teflon – perfluorooctanoic acid , or PFOA – is used to make compounds called fluoropolymers , which are then used make Teflon .
An EPA advisory board of scientists unanimously recommended PFOA be labelled a ‘ likely carcinogen ’ in 2006 .
The makers of Teflon , DuPont , claim they cannot make Teflon without perfluorooctanoic acid at this stage .
PFOA does n’t break down in the environment – ever ; and is now widespread in low levels in the blood of the general population .
Still , it ’s great to see these sorts of innovations and hopefully a more environmentally friendly coating will be used soon .
By the way , BlueEnergy are also into solar roof tiles – another great idea !
Abandoning France ’s traditional policy of solely selling arms to Persian Gulf states , President Nicolas Sarkozy signed a deal with Abu Dhabi for a permanent military base of up to 500 French troops in the UAE ; a move that reflects the new French stance towards Iran as well as its closer ties with Washington .
According to an article on the International Herald Tribune , the deal would enable France to project its troops into a crucial oil - producing region where many countries are concerned over Iran ’s rising influence .
France already has long - standing military cooperation deals with Arab Gulf states , including the UAE and Qatar .
It has sold Mirage jet fighters and AMX - 30 tanks to Abu Dhabi and has had a defence agreement with it since 1995 . " " France responds to its friends , " " Sarkozy told journalists last week following the signing of the new military accord .
" " France and the Emirates signed a reciprocal defense accord in 1995 .
Our friends from the Emirates asked that this accord be prolonged and asked that a base with 400 personnel be opened .
"
" The military accord makes France one of the first Western states other than the U.S. to have a permanent base in the Gulf region , that ’s why many analysts say that the new deal indicates that Paris is aligning itself more openly with Washington , which has also been selling arms to Gulf states .
Outside of Iraq , the U.S. has more than 40,000 troops on bases across the Gulf , including the U.S. Navy ’s Fifth Fleet headquarters in Bahrain .
The British army also has a small presence in the Gulf : The Royal Air Force operates out of Al Udeid , a U.S. air force base in Qatar , and the military is part of the coalition naval task force based in Bahrain .
Some analysts say that some Gulf leaders would welcome a French military presence as an alternative to the American or the British .
This paved the way for France to make its move , although it ’s still unclear what use Paris would make of its military base in the Gulf .
Nuclear power
The UAE and France also signed a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement , which commits Paris to build two nuclear power reactors for Abu Dhabi .
The accord is the third France has signed recently with Arab nations , after Libya and Algeria .
Sarkozy also offered Saudi Arabia nuclear assistance during his recent visit to the oil - rich kingdom .
According to the BBC , the nuclear deals indicate the interest that Gulf states are showing in nuclear power , despite their own oil and gas resources , and highlights their concerns over Iran ’s nuclear program , which the West claims is aimed at making atomic weapons , despite Tehran ’s repeated denials .
Shahram Chubin , an expert in the Middle East and Iran at the Geneva Center for Security Policy in Switzerland , said the French - UAE deals give France a shop window in the Persian Gulf , while the Emirates get an alternative Western supplier for such technology . "
" Most of the states in the Gulf are not terribly happy ( with ) — but have no alternative to reliance on — the U.S. , and this diversifies it , or at least gives the appearance of diversifying it , " " he said .
The nuclear accords also reflect the change in France ’s policy towards Iran .
Paris is already playing an active role in trying to increase UN sanctions against the Islamic Republic .
According to Chubin , the base and nuclear technology deals are consistent with Sarkozy 's more activist policies against Iran and closer ties with the U.S. " " This 500 - man base is not going to be much of a deterrent , but it 's a symbolic indicator ... that France wants to do more and does n't want to leave the region to the U.S. alone , " " he said .

With Mr. Berlusconi ’s return one of the few concrete possibilities , many Italians have expressed frustration at a political system that seems unable to produce new and dynamic leaders when people are already worried about low economic growth and low wages , and whether Italian politics will be able to change itself .
“ We ’ve tried the right , then a false left , ” said Beppe Grillo , a political comic and blogger .
“ Where is the difference between right and left ?
There is none .
If we go to elections with the same old law , people face a situation of no hope . ”
In many ways , Mr. Prodi ’s government seemed doomed from the start , a reflection of the difficulties of assembling a stable coalition in a nation with scores of small parties , each with a strong sense of self - preservation .
His coalition was composed of nine parties , ranging from conservative Christian Democrats to Communists .
They agreed on little , and at times ministers demonstrated against their own government .
After the government fell briefly in February 2007 , it collapsed fatally on Monday , after Mr. Prodi ’s former justice minister , Clemente Mastella , withdrew the three votes he controlled in the Senate .
That left Mr. Prodi without a majority there .
But rather than resign immediately , Mr. Prodi , 68 , a former economics professor and European Commission president , demanded confidence votes in the two houses of Parliament .
Although he won a vote in the lower chamber on Wednesday , it seemed unlikely from the start that he could ultimately survive .
So the confidence votes turned into something like a two - day wake , with Mr. Prodi  whose sober and high - minded demeanor is often compared to that of a parish priest  presiding over his own government ’s funeral .
I run a small business which sells software over the Internet to people who need to create bingo cards , typically parents and teachers .
Today I got a nice , polite email from someone who had lost the code which unlocks their software .
( I sell the codes , and having one makes the software more useful than the free trial version . )
Unfortunately , my customer was n’t really sure she was my customer .
She was n’t sure exactly what software she had purchased , but “ Bingo Card Creator ” sounded pretty close when she found me on Google .
She said she really wanted to use the paid version but did n’t want to purchase it again , and asked if I could please check to see if she had bought from me before .
Well , of course I checked .
As it turns out , she probably bought from one of my competitors .
Most of us have quite similar names .
Rather than having her contact the Bingo Card Maker , Printer , Butcher , Baker , and Candlestick Maker , I sent her an email substantially similar to the following :
“ I ’m afraid it was n’t me , ma’am , but have a copy free with my thanks for your continued support of small businesses . ”
Now , I can hear the skeptics going “ Alright , when a small businessman starts giving his only product away for free as thanks for patronizing his competitors , he has finally gone off the deep end ” .
That is not true —
I ’ve been off the deep end for years , and I love it , the water is fine .
As much as this sounds like a very mushy lets - get - together - and - sing - kumbaya moment , I think it defensible from a cold dollars - and - cents calculus .
( And , if I ’m wrong , I get to pull this trump card that says “ It does n’t matter if I ’m wrong , there is nobody around to fire me for a kumbaya moment here and there ” .
God , I love being my own boss . )
Let ’s talk about those reasons for a moment .
Three Totally Heartless & Mercenary Reasons For Treating Your Competitor ’s Customers Like Your Own
1 ) It costs me nothing .
One of the beauties of the software business is that serving your 307th customer is , quite literally , free .
( Its that first customer who costs you millions … or in my case , about sixty bucks . )
All I had to do was copy / paste her email address into the website of my partner which sends out the purchased CD keys , mark her for a free copy , and tell her that I did so .
The action took less than a tenth of the time it will take to actually blog about it .
2 ) It saves me from having to write additional emails to the lady , who I predict will require just one additional email ( a quick reply to the thank you note I ’m sure she ’ll send ) , as opposed to the possibility of having to write several of the “ Could you check under my husband ’s name ? ”
“ No , ma’am , it does n’t appear to be there either . ”
“ Oh , I ’m sorry for wasting your time . ”
“ Its no problem , ma’am , have a nice day . ” variety .
I do love writing emails to bingo players , do n’t get me wrong , but the cold dollars - and - cents calculus says “ End conversations as quickly as practical ” and making people deliriously happy works wonders for doing that .
3 ) I just made a passionate advocate for me ( and did I mention it cost me nothing ) ?
Within the last twenty four hours alone , I spent ten whole dollars ( half a sale ! ) bribing Google to pay the likes of myspaceglitter.com ( and other , more relevant sites who are escaping my memory at the moment ) to show wee little unemotional , unobtrusive text advertisements .
The goal of the ads is to convince largely uninterested folks to trust me enough to click on a link and give me five seconds of their time .
99.4 % of the people who saw one of these advertisements were n’t even willing to part with the five seconds !
And it was still a smart business decision to do it .
Despite the fact that after literally 199 gratuitously unmotivated partially attentive listeners turned me down , there was one who said yes .
That one person doubled my investment .
Why would n’t I do something which is much cheaper than $ 10 to achieve something which is much more valuable than catching the corner of the eyeball of a disinterested MySpace browser ?
I just , in all probability , made myself a passionate advocate for life .
Whenever she thinks of bingo cards , she ’ll think of Bingo Card Creator , and whenever someone around her talks about bingo cards , she ’ll talk about Bingo Card Creator .
Basically , she ’ll be like my own personal Apple fan .
( And I did n’t even have to call it iCreateBingoCards .
Take that , Steve Jobs . )
At the very least I made someone ’s day .
The story will rate a mention to whoever she talks to about her day today .
The chance of this getting mentioned at the dinner table or in the staffroom asymptotically approaches 100 % .
Would n’t you mention it ?
When is the last time anybody you did business with gave you what you wanted , for free , without you having to ask for it , and without expecting anything in return ?
This is what Seth Godin calls a “ purple cow ” — would you talk about a purple cow if you saw it ?
Of course !
Its a purple freaking cow .
A purple cow is remarkable ( in both the “ wow ” sense and in the “ I am going to talk about that ” sense ) just by virtue of its rare charm and charming rarity .
Heck , its probably even remarkable if it did n’t happen to you !
( “ Guys , you wo n’t believe what I just saw — a purple cow ! ” is a fun story to tell .
“ Guys , you wo n’t believe what Jimmy nearly ran into today — a purple cow ! ” still beats talking about the weather . )
Purple cows are basically designed to go viral .
( Well , you know the cow caught something , otherwise why is he purple ?
Ba -dum - bum .
Sorry , I used to be an English teacher , we have to surrender our sense of shame to learn the secret mysteries of the subordinate clause . )
Two More Touchy - Feely Bits ( Indulge Me )
1 ) Karma .
Now , I ’m Catholic and I do n’t do karma , but I find the word karma helpful for shortening the thought that some combination of cosmic justice , happenstance , and community causes good things to happen to people who do good things .
2 ) I really do believe that folks who support small businesses , like my fellow software authors ( and most of my competitors are individual authors — you think IBM is going to develop synergistic practices for best - of - breed bingo solutions anytime soon ? ) , deserve a pat on the back when possible .
There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing business with big business , do n’t get me wrong .
I have unrestrained admiration for several billion dollar a year businesses .
That said , there is something just a wee bit noble about helping the little guy when that is an option , and noble acts should be rewarded .
( I mentioned karma , right ?
Karma , like charity ( and forest fires ) begins with you ! )
Besides , any taste on the part of customers to buy from small businesses is a rising tide that lifts all our boats .
I do n’t care whether its bingo cards or wedding seat planners or superhero novels , every little marginal step that gets taken to make Joe and Jane Consumer more willing to trust their credit card details with an anonymous little shop on the Internet helps all of us move our conversion rates to the next level .
Everybody wins .
And I really love when everybody wins .
Does n’t everybody ?
[ P.S . If you liked my approach here , you ’ll probably get a kick out of my other articles about customer service . ]
[ P.P.S .
This article has been edited since it was first posted , so that it relies less on you knowing me to make sense of .
I also fixed some spelling mistakes and eliminated a run-on or three .
Professional pride , what can I say . ]

The creators of the Storm Worm botnet are known to US authorities but a lack of co-operation from their counterparts in St. Petersburg , Russia , is preventing action being taken .
St. Petersburg was the centre of the infamous Russian Business Network .
It 's also reckoned by some to be the city the Storm Worm ( more properly Trojan ) authors call home .
Dmitri Alperovitch director of intelligence analysis and hosted security at Secure Computing told The Washington Post that Russian President Vladimir Putin and political influence within the Federal Security Service ( Russia 's successor to the Soviet KGB ) was hampering prosecution efforts .
The implication is that elements of Russian intelligence agencies are protecting the city 's cybercriminals .
" The right people now know who the Storm worm authors are , " Alperovitch said .
' It 's incredibly hard because a lot of the FSB leadership and Putin himself originate from there , where there are a great deal of people with connections in high places . "
Other security experts reckon that the Storm Worm gang are based in Russia but have no real idea of their location , much less their identities .
David Emm , senior technology consultant at Kaspersky Lab UK , said coding similarities and packing techniques used with the worm suggest the authors of the malware and Russian hackers known to have attacked local websites are one and the same .
Kaspersky , like antivirus firm F - Secure , reckons that the Storm Worm gang is a multinational effort based in Russia .
" We do n't know who they are , " said F - Secure chief research officer Mikko Hyppönen , " but we believe it 's a Russian gang with an American or several Americans helping them to build the social engineering messages and the websites they use . " ®

As I�m too sick to picket today , I feel I must make up for it , and thus I blog a mighty blog .
And yes , I really do have to get my own webpage and stop mooching off you guys , but till then , I hope you don�t mind if I natter on .
STRIKE DRAGS ON FOR SECOND DAY !
IS THIS THE END OF WRITTEN WORD ?
Reporters are funny people .
At least , some of the New York Times reporters are .
Their story on the strike was the most dispiriting and inaccurate that I read .
But it also contained one of my favorite phrases of the month .
� All the trappings of a union protest were there �
� But instead of hard hats and work boots , those at the barricades wore arty glasses and fancy scarves . �
Oh my God .
Arty glasses and fancy scarves .
That is so cute !
My head is aflame with images of writers in ruffled collars , silk pantaloons and ribbons upon their buckled shoes .
A towering powdered wig upon David Fury�s head , and Drew Goddard in his yellow stockings ( cross - gartered , needless to say ) .
Such popinjays , we !
The entire writers � guild as Leslie Howard in The Scarlet Pimpernel .
Delicious .
Except this is exactly the problem .
The easiest tactic is for people to paint writers as namby pamby arty scarfy posers , because it�s what most people think even when we�re not striking .
Writing is largely not considered work .
Art in general is not considered work .
Work is a thing you physically labor at , or at the very least , hate .
Art is fun .
( And Hollywood writers are overpaid , scarf - wearing dainties . )
It �s an easy argument to make .
And a hard one to dispute .
My son is almost five .
He is just beginning to understand what I do as a concept .
If I drove a construction crane he�d have understood it at birth .
And he�d probably think I was King of all the Lands in my fine yellow crane .
But writing � especially writing a movie or show , where people other than the writer are all saying things that they �re clearly ( to an unschooled mind ) making up right then � is something to get your head around .
And as work ?
Well , in the first place , it IS fun .
When it�s going well , it�s the most fun I can imagine having .
( Tim Minear might dispute that . )
And when it�s not going well , it�s often not going well in the company of a bunch of funny , thoughtful people .
So how is that work ?
You got no muscles to show for it ( yes , the brain is a muscle , but if you show it to people it�s usually because part of your skull has been torn off and that doesn�t impress the ladies � unless the ladies are ZOMBIES !
Where did this paragraph go ? )
Writing is enjoyable and ephemeral .
And it�s hard work .
It �s always hard .

Shutting up now , - j. More Joss Strike Talk .
IN WHICH Joss goes on again about all things Guildy .
And now it�s time for a little more PURPLE PROSE .
As I �m too sick to picket today , I feel I must make up for it , and thus I blog a mighty blog .
And yes , I really do have to get my own webpage and stop mooching off you guys , but till then , I hope you don�t mind if I natter on .
STRIKE DRAGS ON FOR SECOND DAY !
IS THIS THE END OF WRITTEN WORD ?
Reporters are funny people .
At least , some of the New York Times reporters are .
Their story on the strike was the most dispiriting and inaccurate that I read .
But it also contained one of my favorite phrases of the month .
�All the trappings of a union protest were there �
� But instead of hard hats and work boots , those at the barricades wore arty glasses and fancy scarves .
�Oh my God .
Arty glasses and fancy scarves .
That is so cute !
My head is aflame with images of writers in ruffled collars , silk pantaloons and ribbons upon their buckled shoes .
A towering powdered wig upon David Fury�s head , and Drew Goddard in his yellow stockings ( cross - gartered , needless to say ) .
Such popinjays , we !
The entire writers � guild as Leslie Howard in The Scarlet Pimpernel .
Delicious .
Except this is exactly the problem .
The easiest tactic is for people to paint writers as namby pamby arty scarfy posers , because it�s what most people think even when we�re not striking .
Writing is largely not considered work .
Art in general is not considered work .
Work is a thing you physically labor at , or at the very least , hate .
Art is fun .
( And Hollywood writers are overpaid , scarf - wearing dainties . )
It �s an easy argument to make .
And a hard one to dispute .
My son is almost five .
He is just beginning to understand what I do as a concept .
If I drove a construction crane he�d have understood it at birth .
And he�d probably think I was King of all the Lands in my fine yellow crane .
But writing � especially writing a movie or show , where people other than the writer are all saying things that they �re clearly ( to an unschooled mind ) making up right then � is something to get your head around .
And as work ?
Well , in the first place , it IS fun .
When it�s going well , it�s the most fun I can imagine having .
( Tim Minear might dispute that . )
And when it�s not going well , it�s often not going well in the company of a bunch of funny , thoughtful people .
So how is that work ?
You got no muscles to show for it ( yes , the brain is a muscle , but if you show it to people it�s usually because part of your skull has been torn off and that doesn�t impress the ladies � unless the ladies are ZOMBIES !
Where did this paragraph go ? )
Writing is enjoyable and ephemeral .
And it�s hard work .
It �s always hard .

Venus Express has revealed a planet of extraordinarily changeable and extremely large - scale weather .
Bright hazes appear in a matter of days , reaching from the south pole to the low southern latitudes and disappearing just as quickly .
Such ‘ global weather ’ , unlike anything on Earth , has given scientists a new mystery to solve .
Such global weather suggests that fast dynamical , chemical and microphysical processes are at work on the planet .
During these episodes , the brightness of the southern polar latitudes increased by about a third and faded just as quickly , as sulphuric acid particles coagulate .
Venus Express watches the behaviour of the planet ’s atmosphere with its Venus Monitoring Camera ( VMC ) .
It has seen some amazing things .
In July 2007 , VMC captured a series of images showing the development of the bright southern haze .
Within days , the high - altitude veil continually brightened and dimmed , moving towards equatorial latitudes and back towards the pole again .
The cloud - covered world of Venus is all but a featureless , unchangeable globe at visible wavelengths of light .
Switch to the ultraviolet and it reveals a truly dynamic nature .
Transient dark and bright markings stripe the planet , indicating regions where solar ultraviolet radiation is absorbed or reflected , respectively .
“ This bright haze layer is made of sulphuric acid , ” says Dmitri Titov , VMC Co-Investigator and Venus Express Science Coordinator , Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research , Germany .
That composition suggests the existence of a formation process to the VMC team .
At an altitude of about 70 km and below , Venus ’s carbon dioxide - rich atmosphere contains small amounts of water vapour and gaseous sulphur dioxide .
These are usually buried in the cloud layer that blocks our view of the surface at visible wavelengths .
However , if some atmospheric process lifts these molecules high up above the cloud tops , they are exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation .
This breaks the molecules , making them highly reactive .
The fragments find each other and combine quickly to form sulphuric acid particles , creating the haze .
“ The process is a bit similar to what happens with urban smog over cities , ” says Titov .
With over 600 orbits completed , the VMC team now plan to look for repeating patterns of behaviour in the build - up and decrease of the haze layer .
What causes the water vapour and sulphur dioxide to well up in the first place ?
The team does not know yet .
Titov says that it is probably an internal dynamical process in the planet ’s atmosphere .
Also , the influence of solar activity on haze formation has not been completely ruled out .
When the team have worked out what causes the hazes and their vigorous dynamics , there is still another problem waiting to be solved .
The dark markings on these images are one of the biggest remaining mysteries of Venus ’s atmosphere .
They are caused by some chemical species , absorbing solar ultraviolet radiation .
However , as yet , planetary scientists do not know the identity of the chemical .
Now that they can spot these dark patches quickly with VMC , the team hopes to use another Venus Express instrument , VIRTIS , to pinpoint the exact chemical composition of these regions .
In about 50 % of instances where an early stage company actually succeeds in raising venture capital , the founder CEO is fired within the first year and kisses most of his or her equity good - bye .
Even the Wall Street Journal pointed this out in a article by Barnaby Federer from 09/30/02 :
" If you ask a VC what value they add , and you get them after a few drinks , they 'll say , ' We replace the CEO ' " , he said .
And that , he indicated , does not vary with the economic climate .
It usually occurs in this manner .
The venture capitalist invites the founder out for a friendly lunch .
During the meal the venture capitalist brings up a new person who would benefit the company greatly through his connections or industry experience .
The venture capitalist explains that although this person is not available to serve on the management team , he could probably find the time to serve as a director .
Yes , it would mean making the board larger than originally agreed to by everyone but this guy is a “ star ” .
The founder wishing to please his venture capitalist reluctantly agrees to the change in board size .
The new face turns out to be the extra vote the venture capitalist needed to make wholesale management changes .
Within a week the board has fired the founding team and replaced them with friends of the venture capitalist .
Oftentimes the new board member assumes the CEO role .
Yes , this scenario happens often and has little to do with the founding team ’s performance .
Venture capitalists just prefer their friends at the helm .
Bottom Line :
If you had the clout at the beginning to negotiate a board of directors balanced between management and venture capitalist , do n't be a wimp and give it away for nothing .
To do so only reinforces the venture capitalist 's belief that he was right about replacing you .
The best tactic to employ when faced with this offer is tell the venture capitalist that you 1 ) can't recommend someone for a board seat until you are satisfied that they can make an actual contribution , and 2 ) that since the board is working well it would be preferable to compensate this person -- once they have made a tangible contribution -- with consulting fees instead of a board position .
Finally , if you sense a strong negative reaction from the venture capitalist you can be assured that there 's trouble brewing in River City and it's spelled with a capital " T " .
He will always have a Plan B for pink - slipping you and it wo n't be pleasant .
Call your lawyer immediately , and I mean your lawyer not the company's .
You 're about to experience your own personal " Night of the Long Knives " .

For the first time , researchers captured video of this endangered little nocturnal mammal , the long - eared jerboa .
Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) scientist Jonathan Baillie led the team that collected footage of the elusive creature in Mongolia 's Gobi desert .
From the BBC News :
" These creatures hop just like a kangaroo ; it is amazing to watch .
Little hairs on their feet , almost like snow shoes , allow them to jump along the sand , " ( Baillie ) explained .
" And in terms of mammals , they have one of the biggest ear - to - body ratios out there … "
" The long - eared jerboa is a bit like the Mickey Mouse of the desert , cute and comic in equal measure , " Dr Baillie said …
" These amazing , remarkable creatures are on the verge of extinction and we know almost nothing about them . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Ralph Nader is entering the presidential race as an independent , he announced Sunday , saying it is time for a " Jeffersonian revolution . "
Ralph Nader is running for president as an independent .
" In the last few years , big money and the closing down of Washington against citizen groups prevent us from trying to improve our country .
And I want everybody to have the right and opportunity to improve their country , " he told reporters after an appearance announcing his candidacy on NBC's " Meet the Press . "
Asked why he should be president , the longtime consumer advocate said , " Because I got things done . "
He cited a 40 - year record , which he said includes saving " millions of lives , " bringing about stricter protection for food and water and fighting corporate control over Washington .
Nader 's decision , which did not come as a surprise to political watchers , marks his fourth straight White House bid -- fifth if his 1992 write - in campaign is included .
The two contenders for the Democratic nomination were quick to pounce .
" He thought that there was no difference between Al Gore and George Bush and , eight years later , I think people realize that Ralph did not know what he was talking about , " Sen .
Barack Obama said a town hall meeting Sunday .
Watch Nader describe whom the Democrats should be " going after " »
Calling Nader 's move " very unfortunate , " Sen .
Hillary Clinton told reporters , " I remember when he ran before .
It did n't turn out very well for anybody -- especially our country . "
" This time I hope it does n't hurt anyone .
I can't think of anybody that would vote for Sen.
McCain who would vote for Ralph Nader , " she said .
Nader was criticized by some Democrats in 2000 for allegedly pulling away support from Democrat Al Gore and helping George Bush win the White House .
Noting that he ran on the Green Party ticket that year , Clinton said Nader " prevented Al Gore from being the ' greenest ' president we could have had . "
Nader has long rejected his portrayal as a spoiler in the presidential race .
In his NBC interview Sunday , he cited the Republican Party 's economic policies , the Iraq war , and other issues , saying , " If the Democrats can't landslide the Republicans this year , they ought to just wrap up , close down , emerge in a different form . "
But Clinton said , " Obviously , it is not helpful to whoever our Democratic nominee is .
But , you know , it is a free country . "
Nader said political consultants " have really messed up Hillary Clinton 's campaign . "
Long - shot GOP contender Mike Huckabee said Nader 's entry would probably help his party .
" I think it always would probably pull votes away from the Democrats and not the Republicans , so naturally , Republicans would welcome his entry into the race , " Huckabee said Sunday on CNN .
Nader said Thomas Jefferson believed that " when you lose your government , you 've got to go into the electoral arena . "
" A Jeffersonian revolution is needed in this country , " he said .
Nader told NBC that great changes in U.S. history have come " through little parties that never won any national election . "
" Dissent is the mother of ascent , " he said .
" And in that context I 've decided to run for president . "
Nader , who turns 74 this week , complained about the " paralysis of the government , " which he said is under the control of corporate executives and lobbyists .
Obama also criticized Nader earlier this weekend .
" My sense is that Mr. Nader is somebody who , if you do n't listen and adopt all of his policies , thinks you 're not substantive , " he told reporters when asked about Nader 's possible candidacy .
" He seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work . "
Obama said Nader " is a singular figure in American politics and has done as much as just about anyone for consumers . "
" I do n't mean to diminish that , " he said .
" There 's a sense now that if someone 's not hewing to the Ralph Nader agenda , he says they 're lacking in some way . "
Responding to those remarks , Nader called Obama " a person of substance " and " the first liberal evangelist in a long time " who " has run a good tactical campaign . "
But he accused Obama of censoring " his better instincts " on divisive issues .
Nader encouraged people to look at his campaign Web site , votenader.org , which he said discusses issues important to Americans that Obama and Sen. John McCain " are not addressing . "

All About U.S. Presidential Election • Ralph Nader
From Greg Sargent at TPM :
Here 's some more on what exactly happened in the negotiations that led up to the rushed confirmation of Michael Mukasey yesterday .
According to sources inside and outside the Democratic leadership , Harry Reid allowed a vote on Mukasey because in exchange the Republican leadership agreed to allow a vote on the big Defense Appropriations Bill , which contains $ 459 billion in military spending but does n't fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
One key reason
Dem leaders wanted this defense approps bill passed , sources tell me , is that they wanted to be able to argue that they had sent a bill to the President funding the military , if not the war itself .
The idea was that doing this would allow them to protect themselves in the days ahead when the battle over Iraq funding heats up and Republicans inevitably charge that Dems are refusing to fund the troops .
" This lets us argue , ` Hey , we just sent $ 450 billion to the military , " one leadership source tells me .
Read on ...
“ You know I made it very clear that this election is about all of you , ” she said at a morning rally on a chilly street corner in Dallas Friday morning .
“ It ’s about your futures , your families , your jobs . ”
“ For me , ” she added a moment later , “ it really is about what we can do together . ”
Her opponent , Mr. Obama , spent Friday campaigning in parts of southern and central Texas , targeting areas that are home to many Hispanic voters , who are seen as potentially decisive in the March 4 Texas primary .
His first appearance was at the University of Texas - Pan American Friday , his first in the strongly Democratic Rio Grande Valley , where Hillary Clinton has a long history of support .
After that , he planned to hold rallies in Corpus Christi and Austin .
In an interview on the CBS “ Early Show , ” Mrs. Clinton was asked directly if her closing debate remarks meant she thought she was going to lose the race .
Mr. Obama has won 11 straight contests since the Super Tuesday races on Feb. 5 , all by double - digit margins .
“ No , of course not , ” she said .
“ It is the recognition that both of us are on the brink of historic change .
You know , I ’m very proud that we have the two of us in this contest seeking the Democratic nomination , hoping to become our next president .
Obviously , I believe that , you know , my record and my plans for what we can do for our country are ones that , you know , really are rooted in my experience and my strengths , being able to bring about the positive differences that people talk to me about . ”
Her appearance in Dallas was marred by the death of the city police motorcyclist killed in a crash while escorting her motorcade .
The crash occurred as Mrs. Clinton was being driven from the airport to a rally in the city .
The officer was at the head of the line of vehicles .
Dallas television station WFAA reported that the motorcycle may have struck a concrete abutment .
Keeping strong profile now could keep him at top of list should he choose to run again in 2012 or 2016 .
Is Huck still running for '08 bid , or ' 12 ?
Mike Huckabee is technically still running for president , but increasingly his bid is aimed at strengthening his public profile for the next stage in his career .
Within the campaign , there ’s a degree of optimism about his chances of preventing John McCain from garnering the 1,191 delegates needed to clinch the Republican nomination .
But Huckabee ’s supporters are also now embracing what they see as his enhanced future prospects .

As they see it , the relative success of his longshot bid — as well as his finish as the unquestioned second - to - last man standing — will grant the former Arkansas governor a visible platform and put him at the top of the candidate list should he choose to run again in 2012 or 2016 .
“ At end of day , we ’ll do whatever we can to help John McCain in the fall , ” said Huckabee strategist Ed Rollins .
“ If he wins , great .
If not , the game starts all over again . ”
And even if McCain does win in November , Rollins noted that the Arizonan will already be 72 years old .
“ It may be open again in four years .
And Mike is 51 .
He ’s got a long way to go before his political career is over . ”
Former Sen. Tim Hutchinson ( R - Ark. ) , a top Huckabee ally and frequent surrogate , is not giving up hope on this year .
But he also suggested that surviving well into the primary season would make this cycle ’s darkhorse a front - runner for the next time around the track .
“ The Republican Party has been kind to second - place finishes in the past , ” Hutchinson said .
“ He ’s a young man .
And he ’s run the kind of race that has not burned bridges or torn apart the party . ”
As McCain ’s success has underscored , the GOP has its own tradition of political primogeniture : rewarding he who is next in line for the party ’s nomination .
Dating back to Ronald Reagan ’s 1976 challenge of Gerald Ford — a race that Huckabee now frequently cites — that candidate has typically been somebody who has run and fallen short in the past .
“ Huckabee is playing for second , ” said Republican strategist Craig Shirley , a McCain backer and author of a book on the 1976 presidential race .
“ He wants the story written that he came in second to McCain and not Mitt Romney .
That way he will have what he believes is the more legitimate claim to be the heir apparent for the GOP nomination , and not Romney , in 2012 or 2016 . ”
In effect , Huckabee ’s continued campaign is as much about early jockeying for the next GOP contest as it is a last - ditch effort at this one .
“ In the long term , staying in will help him more than it will hurt him , ” argued Joe Carter , an aide at the Family Research Council who briefly worked for Huckabee last year .
To the casual voter in states that are just now holding contests , the former governor and Baptist preacher is just now making his public debut and , in a two - man race , garnering the sort of valuable exposure that he would n’t receive had he dropped out .
Carter , a native Texan , noted that he had friends from back home who were just now tuning into the state ’s March 4 primary and asking him how to get a yard sign .
“ You do n’t want to discourage that and say it ’s too late , ” he said .
Still , Carter acknowledged that Huckabee has to be mindful about the point at which he wears out his welcome with the party rank - and - file by remaining in a race he can’t win .
“ It ’s a balancing act , ” Carter said , predicting that Huckabee will take his cue from the results in Texas .
Rollins acknowledged that the Lone Star State , where Huckabee once lived and where he ’s spent considerable time raising cash and preaching in friendly churches , could be determinative .
“ If he does n’t do well there , it ’s kind of a long march , ” Rollins said .
“ Texas is really where we ’re going to focus on . ”
Even if Huckabee picks up delegates in Texas , however , his support will likely come from the same demographic where he ’s found success before — thus reinforcing perceptions about his inherent weakness for future races .
Because for all the buzz he ’s created since his triumph in Iowa , Huckabee ’s success has largely been confined to just a slice of the GOP electorate — Christian conservatives .
Beyond the Hawkeye state , he ’s only run well in the South .
And in that region , his strength has been limited to rural areas where there tend to be more evangelicals .
In the more cosmopolitan urban or suburban areas of most every state , inside and outside the South , he ’s gotten thrashed .
“ Here was a guy that had tremendous success in defying the stereotype as a preacher - politician , ” noted Max Brantley , editor of the Arkansas Times and a longtime Huckabee critic .
“ He was viewed as something of a moderate and had some crossover appeal .
Now he ’s ending his campaign by driving himself into the corner that he avoided as governor , casting himself as a one - dimensional , religious - right figure .
He ’s decided to define himself as somebody who does n’t have as broad an appeal . ”
Huckabee backers , however , suggest that his appeal to Christian conservatives could also position him well should he want to pursue a leadership role in that community .
“ He ’s certainly going to be the main spokesman for values voters in the Republican coalition , ” said Hutchinson .
In conversations they ’ve had , Hutchinson said Huckabee has n’t made clear what he wants to do next .
But Huckabee indicated what he does n’t want to do : take either a Cabinet post or run for office in Arkansas .
The alternative , then , could be to pursue a hybrid path between those pursued by Reagan and by conservative commentator Pat Buchanan .
Just as Reagan did after his ’ 76 run , Huckabee could step up his presence on the rubber chicken circuit and burnish his policy credentials by writing and offering commentary on the side in advance of another run .
Given his near - constant cable news presence , Huckabee also could formalize a more - permanent role on TV — like Buchanan did in between his 1988 and 1992 runs .
Should he want to run again , he ’d have a nice platform from which to get his message out .
But should he decide to capitalize on his affable persona and embrace punditry , he could just stick on the tube .
( Or , as Buchanan has proved , he could do both . )
Another option would be to create his own political entity , from which he could draw a paycheck ( an important factor for a politician who never made much money ) and use it to make permanent his presence on the public landscape .
“ He needs something like an Empower America , ” said Carter , citing the think tank created by Jack Kemp .
“ He needs to come here and make some friends .
That hurt him this time — nobody in D.C. really knew him . ”
Huckabee , by all accounts , does n’t really know what ’s next .
“ I have nothing else to do , ” he joked to reporters at the Conservative Political Action Conference .
One longtime Huckabee watcher thinks that there is some truth to that .
“ I think he ’s looking for a high profile and a job , ” said John Brummett , columnist for the Arkansas News and a veteran of the Little Rock press corps .
“ He ’s always needed work . ”
“ And I think he thought he could be a bigger deal if he stayed in it for a while . ”
The wealthy have got away with financial crimes for so long they no longer regard them as crimes .
When they are caught breaking the rules others must obey , they denounce the timid attempts by governments to enforce common standards as a shocking assault on a natural order in which tax is optional for those with the money to buy exemptions .
In Britain , we have seen the City in open revolt against the notion that foreign billionaires should pay a little more towards the costs of the country that protects them .
Meanwhile in Germany , the decision by tax fraud investigators to ... er... investigate tax fraud has turned the letters page of the Financial Times into a wailing wall for funny money men the world over .
Perhaps they are right to be alarmed .
Maybe for the first time in a generation , governments are seeing the irresponsibility of the rich as a threat as dangerous to a nation 's well - being as terrorism or drug trafficking and treating it accordingly .
The German authorities are being admirably firm .
In a sharp break from the indulgent treatment of the world 's elite , Germany is paying informants , receiving stolen documents and conducting mass raids with all the vigour it would deploy against an Islamist terror cell .
The German Tax Union thinks Germany loses about € 30bn ( £ 22.5 bn ) a year in unpaid taxes .
Much disappears into the statelet of Liechtenstein , which travel writers portray as Ruritanian idyll .
True , there are charming gothic castles and it is governed by the superficially quaint Prince Hans - Adam II or , to give him his full title , His Serene Highness Johannes Adam Ferdinand Alois Josef Maria Marko d'Aviano Pius von und zu Liechtenstein , Sovereign Prince of Liechtenstein , Count of Rietberg and Duke of Troppau and Jägerndorf .
But Johannes Adam etc also owns the $ 100 bn Liechtenstein Global Trust ( LGT ) , which offers ' wealth management ' to individuals and companies with the promise of absolute confidentiality .
The secrecy held until earlier this month when Der Spiegel reported that an anonymous man known as ' the informant ' had proposed a deal to the German secret service , the BND .
In return for € 4.2 m , he would hand over a stolen DVD listing details of hundreds of rich Germans who had set up accounts in his Serene Highness 's bank .
The spies passed samples of the informant 's secrets to tax investigators , who realised that they had stumbled across a gold mine .
Germany 's biggest fraud scandal in living memory is now breaking as a result .
A leading German industrialist has already resigned .
Tax inspectors have warrants to go through the finances of 900 people and all hell has broken loose in the world of the wealthy .
His Serene Highness and representatives of the tax industry have accused Germany of dealing in stolen goods .
' To advocate bribing bank officials in a foreign country , causing them to commit a criminal offence in their own jurisdiction , is somewhat astonishing , ' wrote an investment banker to the Financial Times .
The BND 'are authorised to act thus in cases of terrorism , money - laundering , organised crime and nuclear proliferation , ' added a lawyer from the tax haven of Gibraltar .
But they ' do not have the authority to act in cases of tax evasion with no link to the proceeds of crime ' .
All missed the point that tax havens are inherently criminal and would go under without the proceeds of crime .
As John Christensen , director of the Tax Justice Network , puts it , they are enemy states , pirate islands that have declared economic war on the rest of the world .
It 's not just that they happen to be used by individual criminals - drug dealers , kleptomaniac African dictators - they are criminal entities themselves that survive by sucking potential revenues out of wealthy and destitute countries alike .
If rich citizens obeyed the law , or tax havens ended their secrecy , offshore banking would n't exist .
Peer Steinbrueck , Germany 's finance minister , said last week that the ' elite must respect the law ' and threatened ' to tighten the thumbscrews on Liechtenstein ' .
I cannot imagine Gordon Brown or David Cameron talking in the same way about Jersey and the Isle of Man .
The idea that David Miliband would authorise MI6 to find informers in offshore banking systems feels equally far - fetched .
Britain is a country where councils can bug the phones of fly - tippers and put spy cameras in litter bins , but tax inspectors cannot bug the offices of fraudsters or send spies into Jersey .
After the furious reaction from the City to the government 's modest proposals to tax foreign residents and open up offshore accounts , which was , incidentally , the most sustained campaign of organised hypocrisy you are likely to see in your lifetime , the status quo has been reasserted .
The received wisdom remains that you can only ask the rich to make a minimum contribution .
To do more would drive them abroad .
Labour is chastened .
After originally proposing the taxing of non-doms , the Tories are back under the control of tax exiles .
Yet the received wisdom cannot last .
In democratic countries worldwide , governments are asking the working and middle classes to pay the taxes the rich are avoiding .
The status quo is n't merely unjust , but politically unsustainable and more politicians are realising it .
As soon as the Liechtenstein scandal broke , American Democratic senator Carl Levin announced an investigation into American plutocrats hiding money in his supreme highness 's bank .
Last year Levin introduced the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act to Congress , which included necessarily draconian measures to stop the rich robbing the rest of society .
' We cannot tolerate tax cheats offloading their unpaid taxes on to the backs of honest tax payers , ' he declared .
As with Britain , it is easy to think that his stirring words were so much wind and that nothing will change in an America in which the rich have enjoyed a second gilded age under the Bushes and Clintons .
Still , it is worth noting that a then relatively obscure senator from Illinois co-sponsored Levin 's Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act and said that 'we need to crack down on individuals and businesses that abuse our laws , so that those who work hard and play by the rules are n't disadvantaged ' .
His name was Barack Obama .
The Associated Press reported that the small fires at the embassy were quickly extinguished .
Serbian television reported that the Croatian Embassy had also been attacked , and the state news agency said that the Bosnian and Turkish Embassies were also targets .
The police said at least 140 people had been injured in the incidents , 32 of them police officers .
Security sources estimated that 150,000 people joined the protests .

Groups also broke into a McDonald ’s in central Belgrade and destroyed its interior .
Witnesses said vandals were attacking foreign - owned shops , including a Nike store , and were seen carrying off shoes and other goods as the Serbian police looked on .
The United States Embassy had been closed since Sunday after it was stoned .
R. Nicholas Burns , the under secretary of state for political affairs , telephoned Serbian officials to formally complain about the breaching of the embassy , said a State Department spokesman , Sean McCormack .
Mr. McCormack told reporters on Thursday that “ we would hold the Serbian government personally responsible for the safety and well - being of our embassy employees . ”
He added that the security that had been provided was completely inadequate .
The United Nations Security Council issued a unanimous statement of the 15 members saying they “ condemn in the strongest terms the mob attacks against embassies in Belgrade which have resulted in damage to embassy premises and have endangered diplomatic personnel . ”
The action was taken at the urging of Zalmay Khalilzad , the American ambassador .
The violence fueled fears in Washington and Brussels that Serbia was turning to the virulent nationalism of the past .
But Serbian analysts predicted the country would ultimately embrace the West as it came to terms with losing its medieval heartland .

For a compiler writer , generating good machine code for a variety of platforms is hard work .
One might try to reuse a retargetable code generator , but code generators are complex and difficult to use , and they limit one ’s choice of implementation language .
One might try to use C as a portable assembly language , but C limits the compiler writer ’s flexibility and the performance of the resulting code .
The wide use of C , despite these drawbacks , argues for a portable assembly language .
C– is a new language designed expressly for this purpose .
The use of a portable assembly language introduces new problems in the support of such high - level run-time services as garbage collection , exception handling , concurrency , profiling , and debugging .
We address these problems by combining the C– language with a C– run-time interface .
The combination is designed to allow the compiler writer a choice of source - language semantics and implementation techniques , while still providing good performance .
“ There ’s not a single person among the 850 people in my class who joined for free , ” he said .
His commanders , he added , also now collect the salaries of recruits who quit , a payout of more than $ 100,000 a month .
“ No one can stop it , ” Abu Ali said .
“ Corruption runs from top to bottom . ”
The details of Abu Ali ’s story could not be independently verified , but they fit a pattern of bribes and payroll schemes found in nearly every nook of Iraq ’s government , according to government workers , Iraqi lawmakers and some American officials .
Many Iraqis speak from personal experience .
Mr. Subihawi , the Shiite tribal leader in Sadr City , said that when he recently tried to find a job for a young member of his tribe , he was told by local government officials that there was nothing available unless he was willing to pay .
Other Iraqis , in interviews , described similar encounters .
Cash is also often what leads to promotions — with the help of a fake college degree , purchased for about $ 40 — and theft is no less common .
One government worker , who goes by the name Abu Muhammad , said a senior administrator at the ministry where he worked recently sold off computers , laser printers , office furniture and other supplies that appeared to have been paid for with American aid .
The official was never caught or prosecuted , he said .
Haider Abu Laith , an engineer at the Ministry of Culture , said a close friend and fellow engineer at a government agricultural agency recently told him he was being pressured to inflate the cost of equipment purchased abroad so that senior officials could skim the surplus .
He said his friend quit , fearing that he would be killed if he refused .
And at the Ministry of Health ’s main warehouse in Baghdad , American troops discovered this summer that two trucks full of medicines and medical equipment had disappeared while several guards on duty — young men in acid - washed jeans , with gel in their hair — said they saw nothing .
Even some Iraqi lawmakers admit that the free - for - all has become too extensive to stop easily .
“ The size of the corruption exceeds the imagination , ” said Shatha Munthir Abdul Razzaq , a member of Parliament ’s largest Sunni bloc .
“ Because there are no tough laws , no penalties for those who steal . ”

What will happen if someone impersonates you on a social network ?
Will that person be able to fool your friends and as such gain access to resources , which only you are entitled to ?... or are social network protected enough to guarantee the credibility of the social participants .
Introduction to Social Networks Evil Twin Attacks
Lets have a look at a social network like LinkedIn .
For those of you who do n't know what LinkIn is , let me say that it is probably the largest professional social network available today .
Once you give information about your place of work and the education centers you used to attend , Linked In will try its best to hook you up to everyone else that have been associated with your employer , university , etc .
The benefit is obvious : you keep in touch with people who may help you in the future .
However , nothing stops someone to register an account on the name of John Dawson , a reputable IT security expert , currently employed by HSBC , Canary Wharf , London .
If the evil twin of John Dawson inhabits Linked In , how many people will trust that shady persona and as such be fooled into one of the biggest scams ?
I find this question very interesting and quite fascinating .
The hack here is not technical but rather psychological and definitely of a social nature .
Remember , hacking could be considered is the action of outsmarting others and as such it may take any form .
Fooling people 's believes is an important craft that have been with us since the dawn of humanity , yet we often fail to acknowledge it effectiveness .
These are what Evil Twin attack are all about .
From WiFi security prospective the evil twin is the rogue access point that pretends to be a friendly network .
From the social networks point of view , the evil twin is a hacker or a bot disguising itself as the real person .
Social Networks Evil Twin Attacks work both ways .
First , the impersonator will be given the chance to trick the victim 's current friends into a trap .
Second , he will trick people , who will try to contact the real person along the way , into a trap as well .
Therefore , if the evil John Dawson is approached by someone who is looking for work in his sector , he will be in a very comfortable position to gain internal insights of the company of that person as very often people tend to serve any juicy information on the interviewing process .
Social Networks are huge threat whether you realize it or not .
The bad guys are not restricted in terms of types of tools for their malicious activities , like whitehats do as this seams to be part of technical eliteness .
The bad guys will break into the targeted network by any means necessary .
This includes fooling people , laying and cheating on their way towards their goal .
This post is kept fairly light as it is a raw idea which have n't been materialized into any form but nevertheless it is important to be considered , especially today , when we are surrounded by the Social Networks phenomenon .
The whole idea about this post is to introduce you to a concept , which you may or may not have already given any thoughts about .
Men have been beating the crap out of each other since the dawn of time , be it cavemen battling over the best - smelling woman or Jack Bauer biting out a man 's jugular .
Sure , the motives have changed , but the intent remains the same -- to feel that rush of adrenaline , the barbaric high that makes a man a man , and to be the best .
There is none of that in this list .
But do n't lose interest .
It takes a lot to be the worst .
You need more than your run -of - the - mill sucking to make it here .
More than just bad technique .
Plenty of movies have punches telegraphed in Morse Code and roundhouse kicks landing a foot shy of their intended target .
That 's not bad enough for this list .
You need more than just bad acting , too .
Maybe you cringe watching Tony Jaa 's constipated scowls , but the quality of the fights is at least ground chuck .
These videos are Mad Cow .
They 're found art , beyond bad .
But we love them all the same because everyone needs a redeeming quality -- and if you can't throw a punch , at least be able to throw a punch line .
( And to balance out the testosterone levels here , next week we 'll count down the five best fight scenes ever .

1:19 -- Perhaps we should n't quibble over realistic touches , but moments earlier a double face - slap stunned the monster into submission .
Now a boulder square to the stomach , and nothing ?
1:49 --
The fact alone that he turns his back on a reptilian monster raising a rock over his head is incredible enough .
But the look of utter shock that he threw it at him ?
What did he expect , for the lizard to carry it over , hand it to him , and burden him to death ?

1:16 -- At this point , you should be asking yourself two questions :
When did Cousin Larry get so jacked ?
And what did Balki Bartokomous do to get him this pissed off ?

We were just recently alerted here at Mashable that January 30th , just a few scant days away , is International Delete Your MySpace Account Day .
Cory Geller sent us to a blog post by Simon Owens describing his growing disgust with the constant friend requests from the fembots and the the anonymous birthday announcements , not to mention spam wrapped in a riddle , wrapped in banner ads .
He decided to catalog the many ways in which MySpace had failed him :
1 . You rarely log in to Myspace except to delete spam friend requests from nude webcam girls .
2 . You spend five minutes writing a wall post only to hit an error message when you try to post it because of all the website glitches .
3 . You ’re a girl who constantly gets marriage proposals from random men in the middle east .
4 . You visit someone ’s Myspace profile only to suddenly have music start blasting out of your speakers .
Bonus points if it happens to you while you ’re at work .
5 . You have to make redundant clicks to perform simple tasks because Myspace keeps taking you to advertisement pages where you have to click on “ return to myspace profile ” in order to continue what you ’re doing .
6 . You visit someone ’s profile only to have your eyes bleed because of terrible page layout with non-matching designs and font colors .
7 . Your experience is hindered because of intrusive banner ads that either talk to you or try to reach out and block your view of what you ’re trying to look at .
8 . You read yet another news account about how some child predator using Myspace has abducted a little girl or that some hoax myspace account has caused a teenager to commit suicide .
9 . You ’re frustrated with the fact that Myspace does n’t allow you to post your contact info , meaning to contact someone you can only use Myspace ’s glitchy Instant Messenger , message / email system , or wall commenting .
10 .
You ’re tired of seeing Tom stare out at you from millions of friends lists and just wish he would change his fucking profile picture .
Finally , reaching a breaking point , he made the decision to nuke his MySpace account .
Instead of immediately deleting it , he wanted to set an end - date that others could join him in his effort of January 30th , perhaps sending more of a message to MySpace rather than going quietly into the night .
Personally , even though I experience most of the same things that Simon says he goes through with MySpace , many of the folks in my less tech savvy circles of friends use MySpace exclusively .
For me to nuke that account would be the same as deleting my contact database .
I do n't know that I could personally join Simon in his campaign to end his MySpace involvement , but I can definitely see the motivation .
I am reminded of another startup that would be perfectly suited to giving MySpace the message to shape up or ship out :
The Point ( see the Mashable Conversations podcast from the week before Christmas ) .
Sure , a Facebook group could be started for something like this ( I 'm sure there will be one or two petition groups up within a few minutes of this post going live ) .
The Point , the way it works , is a conditional petition .
That is to say , in the example of this situation , if 10,000 people agree to delete their MySpace account , the whole group has to follow through and do it .
If the tipping point is n't reached , then it wo n't happen for anyone .
If I had a virtual guarantee that most if not all my MySpace buddies were moving over to an alternative like Facebook , I 'd be more apt to do it .
The Point would increase the likelyhood of that happening .
I 'm going to have to ponder whether MySpace ( or Facebook for that matter ) is indeed the best walled garden for my profile data to sit in .
They do provide an element of convenience for tracking people down you need to talk to .
On the other hand , it is getting increasingly difficult to squeeze out usability between the multiple layers of excruciating monetization they try to throw into their systems .
Here is a list to get the comments flowing !
First of all , this list is not my personal opinion – it is compiled from the average score of each president over 12 surveys – taken between 1948 and 2005 .
Wikipedia has the complete historical rankings .
10 . Calvin Coolidge 1923 – 1929
In 1919 , three quarters of the Boston Police Force went on strike .
Coolidge ( then Governor of Massachusetts ) had observed the situation throughout the conflict , but had not yet intervened .
Furious that the mayor had called out state guard units , he finally acted .
He called up more units of the National Guard , restored Police Commissioner Curtis to office , and took personal control of the police force .
Curtis proclaimed that none of the strikers would be allowed back to their former jobs , and Coolidge issued calls for a new police force to be recruited .
Many people criticized Coolidge as part of a general criticism of laissez - faire government .
His reputation underwent a renaissance during the Reagan administration , but the ultimate assessment of his presidency is still divided between those who approve of his reduction of the size of government and those who believe the federal government should be more involved in regulating the economy .
9. Richard Nixon 1969 – 1974
In June , 1972 , several of Nixon ’s men were caught breaking into Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in Washington , DC – bringing to light the infamous Watergate Scandal .
Nixon himself downplayed the scandal as mere politics , but when his aides resigned in disgrace , Nixon ’s role in ordering an illegal cover - up came to light in the press , courts , and congressional investigations .
Nixon owed back taxes , had accepted illicit campaign contributions , and had harassed opponents with executive agencies , wiretaps , and break - ins .
In addition , he had ordered the secret bombing of Cambodia .
Unlike the tape recordings by earlier Presidents , his secret recordings of White House conversations were revealed and subpoenaed and showed details of his complicity in the cover - up .
Nixon was named by the grand jury investigating Watergate as “ an unindicted co-conspirator ” in the Watergate scandal .
In light of his loss of political support and the near certainty of both his impeachment by the House of Representatives and his probable conviction by the Senate , he resigned on August 9 , 1974 , after addressing the nation on television the previous evening .
He never admitted to criminal wrongdoing , although he later conceded errors of judgment .
8. Zachary Taylor
1849 – 1850
The slavery issue dominated Taylor ’s short term .
Although he owned slaves , he took a moderate stance on the territorial expansion of slavery , angering fellow Southerners .
Taylor urged settlers in New Mexico and California to draft constitutions and apply for statehood , bypassing the territorial stage .
New Mexico was too small to act but California — which had high population growth from the gold rush — wrote a constitution that did not allow slavery ; the voters approved it and a new state government took over in December 1849 without Congressional approval .
Southerners were furious with Taylor and with California .
Taylor held a stormy conference with Southern leaders who threatened secession .
He told them that if necessary to enforce the laws , he personally would lead the Army .
Persons “ taken in rebellion against the Union , he would hang … with less reluctance than he had hanged deserters and spies in Mexico . ”
7. John Tyler 1841 – 1845
Tyler ’s Presidency was rarely taken seriously in his time .
Opponents usually referred him to as the “ Acting President ” or “ His Accidency ” .
Tyler shocked Congressional
Whigs by vetoing virtually the entire
Whig agenda , twice vetoing Clay ’s legislation for a national banking act following the Panic of 1837 and leaving the government deadlocked .
Tyler was officially expelled from the Whig Party in 1841 , a few months after taking office , and became known as “ the man without a party . ”
In 1843 , after he vetoed a tariff bill , the House of Representatives considered the first impeachment resolution against a president in American history .
A committee headed by former president John Quincy Adams concluded that Tyler had misused the veto , but the impeachment resolution did not pass .
6. Millard Fillmore 1850 – 1853
Fillmore ascended to the presidency upon the sudden and unexpected death of President Taylor in July 1850 .
The change in leadership also signaled an abrupt political shift in the administration , as Fillmore removed Taylor ’s entire cabinet , replacing them with individuals known to be favorable to the Compromise efforts .
Fillmore signed into law the Fugitive Slave Act as a compromise between Southern slaveholding interests and Northern Free-Soilers .
The act sought to force the authorities in free states to return fugitive slaves to their masters .
5. Ulysses S Grant 1869 – 1877
Grant achieved international fame as the leading Union general in the American Civil War .
The first scandal to taint the Grant administration was Black Friday , a gold - speculation financial crisis in September 1869 , set up by Wall Street manipulators Jay Gould and James Fisk .
They tried to corner the gold market and tricked Grant into preventing his treasury secretary from stopping the fraud .
The most famous scandal was the Whiskey Ring of 1875 , exposed by Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow , in which over 3 million dollars in taxes were stolen from the federal government with the aid of high government officials .
Although Grant himself did not profit from corruption among his subordinates , he did not take a firm stance against malefactors and failed to react strongly even after their guilt was established .
Grant ’s career is also marred by rumors of anti-Semitism due to his involvement with the infamous General Order Number 11 .
4. Andrew Johnson 1865 – 1869
Johnson succeeding to the presidency upon the assassination of Abraham Lincoln .
Johnson vetoed the first civil rights bill , stating that it gave “ a perfect equality of the white and black races in every State of the Union . ”
In a letter to the governor of Missouri he wrote : “ this is a country for white men , and by God , as long as I am President , it shall be a government for white men . ”
The Republicans in congress overrode his veto ( the Senate by the vote of 33:15 , the House by 182:41 ) and the Civil Rights bill became law .
Johnson tried to remove Edward Stanton as Secretary of War directly violating the Tenure of Office Act which Johnson had vetoed .
He was impeached ( and is the first president to be so ) but found innocent by only one vote .
3. Franklin Pierce 1853 – 1857
Two months before assuming his place as President , Pierce watched his son die in a train accident .
He took office nervously exhausted .
The most controversial event of Pierce ’s presidency was the Kansas - Nebraska Act , which repealed the Missouri Compromise and reopened the question of slavery in the West .
The Act also caused widespread outrage in the North and spurred the creation of the Republican Party , a sectional Northern party that was organized as a direct response to the bill .
Pierce is ranked among the least effective Presidents as well as an indecisive politician who was easily influenced .
He was unable to command as President or to provide the required national leadership .
Pierce is the only elected president ( as of 2007 ) not to be renominated by his party for a second term .
2. James Buchanan 1857 – 1861
In his inaugural speech , Buchanan stated that the slavery issue was of “ little practical importance ” because the Supreme Court was about to settle it .
Two days later they announced the Dred Scott decision in which it ruled that people of African descent , whether or not they were slaves , could never be citizens of the United States , and that Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in federal territories .
Buchanan was widely believed to have been personally involved in the outcome of the case .
Additionally , Buchanan ’s administration was troubled by the Panic of 1857 – a sudden downturn in the US economy .
Before Buchanan left office , seven slave states seceded , the Confederacy was formed , all arsenals and forts in the seceded states were lost ( except Fort Sumter and two remote ones ) , and a fourth of all federal soldiers surrendered to Texas troops .
Historians in 2006 voted his failure to deal with secession the worst presidential mistake ever made .
1. Warren G Harding 1921 – 1923
Harding ’s term as president was beset with scandal – both personal and political .
Albert B Fall , Harding ’s Secretary of the Interior , became the first member of a presidential cabinet to go to jail for his role in the Teapot Dome affair .
When Harding was elected , he raised many of his friends ( known as the Ohio Gang ) to prominent political positions .
Some of these appointees used their power to rob the government .
Harding is reputed to have said : “ I have no trouble with my enemies , but my damn friends , my God- damned friends … they ’re the ones that keep me walking the floor nights ! ”
Afterword
In the original list , William Harrison ranked 5th worst , but as his term was so short I do not think he can be fairly included .
Additionally , James A Garfield ranked at number 9 , but with the second shortest presidential term ( 6 months ) I have also excluded him .
As a result , Nixon , at number 11 , moved in to 10th place , and Coolidge , at number 12 , moves in at position 10 .
As he is not on the list , I am sure you are all eager to know how the current President , George W Bush , fared .
He ranked at number 21 worst , followed closely at 22nd worst by Bill Clinton .
Jimmy Carter ranked at 14th worst .

In reality , the vast majority of us have family members or relatives who make us cringe .
We dread their arrival at our holiday dinners or special events since they are often intoxicated as they make rude comments , have angry outbursts , and then bumble around the room accidentally wrecking our belongings .
I remember asking my cousin -- who had just taken a drunken tumble down the spiral staircase -- if he had ever considered attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting .
My timing may not have been the most appropriate .
He did not talk to me for five years .
Then there was also my uncle who every year would sit quietly in the corner drinking his beer falling asleep .
At intermittent intervals he would wildly arise out of his chair , threaten to challenge everyone in the room to a fight since he was so tough , and then slowly pass out back to his deep snoring sounds .
I wo n't even begin to tell you about Aunt Lorna who at the age of 79 and with a few shots of whiskey in her had an eye for all the young single bachelors in the room .
She would wink as she made her flirtatious moves , but fortunately all the men thought she was suffering from some type of early onset dementia twitch .
I could share with you hours of stories about my Christmas dinners and holiday celebrations .
In my family , we have argued about the other relatives and found ways to avoid the most obnoxious ones .
Along the way , I developed my own survival strategies .
While working with families impacted by addiction over the years , I have had the honor of witnessing the healing that can occur when families stop ignoring the behaviours of chaos - creating relatives .
Family collusion
Annoyed family members may collude , trying to hide the details of where and when future gatherings are taking place in hopes that these party - crashing relatives will not attend .
Like a wart that does not go away , these chaos - creators can be counted on to make time in their dysfunctional schedules to spoil family functions .
My Uncle Joe is a prime example .
Family members check ahead of time to see if Uncle Joe is coming to events , and if he is then they will not attend these functions .
The drama among the surrounding family members increases and plays out like a homeland security alert :
Code Green : Uncle Joe is nowhere to be found and does not look like he will be attending the family Christmas this year .
Code Blue :
One of the family members spoke with Uncle Joe and he is alive .
Code Yellow : Another one of the family members spoke with Uncle Joe and he is asking what the rest of us are doing for Christmas .
Code Orange : Uncle Joe now knows the date and time for dinner and will be arriving with his latest girlfriend .
Christmas is becoming a dreaded event .
Family members furiously call each other .
Resentments are formed towards the family member who divulged where Christmas dinner will be held .
Code Red : Uncle Joe has arrived with a smile on his face and a bottle of whiskey in his hands .

Five tips for cutting the chaos
It 's the same every year .
It is as if we are watching a train wreck about to happen and we can't help but sit back and watch .
Of course we do not have to be a captive audience .
Here are five tips that can help us salvage our holidays and other special occasions :
Tip # 1 : Do n't give the chaos creator all the power .
As family members we can needlessly stress ourselves out by anticipating how chaos - creators will take over upcoming events .
Instead , we can find some peace by deciding how much time negative people will consume of our thoughts .
Tip # 2 : Decide on your limits and set your boundaries .
Chaos - creators do not have to have free reign over events .
If you are hosting the dinner or have certain expectations about an alcohol - abuser not getting intoxicated then decide on your personal limits .
Tip # 3 : Pick the right time .
Consider the right time to set boundaries .
Do not wait until the person is intoxicated .
Approach this person well ahead of time -- weeks or even months -- with your concerns .
Tip # 4 : Identify family enablers and support them .
Some family members will take pity on chaos - creators and become upset when you set boundaries .
Remember that making people aware of the impact of their behaviours is a gift , especially if a person has an addiction that everyone else is ignoring .
Tip # 5 : Remember this is a process .
Some families have a " hands off " rule , and they protect each other from perceived attacks .
When you set boundaries and refuse to be quiet about others ' obnoxious or even self - destructive behaviours , then you are giving them a gift of self - awareness .
Remember that we teach people how to treat us , and you can never expect anyone else to change if you never let them know about the impact of their behaviours .
By setting boundaries , you stop being a victim of other people 's actions .
When we no longer ignored chaos - creators ' behaviours in our family , things began to change as well .
Fortunately , my cousin did not need AA or treatment and he did start talking to me again .
I also noticed that he has not been intoxicated at any family event since this past incident several years ago .
As for my uncle , his family did an intervention and he has now been sober for two years .
I supported them through this process and shared with them how to confront him about his drinking with great care , concern , as well as love .
Aunt Lorna is still her old gracious self and continues her penchant for younger men .

Washington senate resolution calling for Bush ’s impeachment advances
by The Associated Press
OLYMPIA — A state Senate resolution calling for the impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Cheney was approved by a committee today , taking the measure one step further than it went last year .
The resolution by Sen. Eric Oemig , D - Kirkland , had little support from lawmakers last year , never getting to the Senate floor for a vote .
But today , it was approved by the five majority Democrats on the Senate ’s Government Operations and Elections Committee .
Passing committee is a key hurdle , but does not guarantee that the measure will get a vote on the Senate floor .
Senate Majority Leader Lisa Brown , D - Spokane , has said she doubts the measure will get any time on the Senate floor this year .
More than 80 people attended a testy hearing last week about the resolution , which included a heated exchange between a Republican senator and members of the audience .
During the hearing , Sen. Pam Roach , R - Auburn , accused Oemig of using the resolution for “ campaign purposes . ”
That sparked yelling and boos from the audience , to which Roach responded by displaying a picture of her son , who serves in the military .
Roach voted against the resolution today .
A small number of towns and cities across the country have passed similar resolutions , but no state Legislature in the country has passed a measure calling for Bush ’s impeachment .

One of today 's biggest stories is the fact that India and the Middle East had about 75 % of their digital connection to Europe cut off when two cables on the floor of the Mediterranean snapped under mysterious circumstances .
Cables get damaged all the time , but never have two gone out simultaneously .
It will take days , or even a week to repair the cables .
No one knows the cause — or do they ?
See update below .

The cables , branded Flag Telecom and SEA - ME - WE 4 , for " Southeast Asia , Middle East , Western Europe " , were severed in their runs between Palermo , Italy and Alexandria , Egypt .
Data is being rerouted , in some cases " around India and back through Asia to the U.S. "
Outages or lousy connections have been experienced in India as well as Egypt , Dubai , Kuwait , Bahrain , Qatar and Saudi Arabia .

According to the AP story , " There has been speculation ... that an illegally or improperly anchored ship caused the problem .
Our best guess is Godzilla of course , but some sort of Bond villain may be to blame .

Update : Mystery solved ?
This article , dated Jan. 30 , seems to have clear information on the shipping debacle that caused the havoc :
" For some reason ships were asked to anchor in a different place to normal - 8.3 km from the beach .
One of the ship 's anchors cut our cable but there are multiple cuts — we 're not the only company having problems , " says a Flag Telecom spokesman .

One of the first rules of weight watching has always been :
Put the sugar bowl at the back of the cupboard and use low - calorie sweeteners from now on .
But researchers suggested yesterday that dieters might be better sticking with sugar after all .
They think that a sweet taste can prompt the body to prepare for a large intake of calories .
When this does not arrive , the body then becomes confused and either demands more food or burns less energy - with the result showing on the scales .
" The data clearly indicate that consuming a food sweetened with no - calorie saccharin can lead to greater body - weight gain than the same food sweetened with high - calorie sugar , " say the U.S. team behind the research .
They accept that the finding will seem baffling to those who have long recommended the use of sweeteners to
control weight .
Other artificial sweeteners such as aspartame which do not lead to the delivery of calories could have similar effects , the researchers said in the journal Behavioural Neuroscience , published by the American Psychological Association .
Scientists at Purdue University in West Lafayette , Indiana , fed some rats with yogurt sweetened with saccharin and others with yogurt sweetened with glucose , a natural sugar .
The saccharin - fed rats went on to consume more calories and put on more weight and body fat .
The research drew a critical reaction - from the food industry .
" This study oversimplifies the causes of obesity , " said Beth Hubrich , a dietitian with the Calorie Control Council , representing companies which make diet foods and drinks .
" The causes of obesity are multi-factorial .
Although surveys have shown that there has been an increase in the use of ' sugar - free ' foods over the years , portion sizes of foods have also increased , physical activity has decreased and overall calorie intake has increased . "
The council also said findings in animal studies might not be applicable to people , which the researchers acknowledged .
Davidson responded that the implication of the council 's statement " that they , too , are interested in the health of the public seems insincere .
If they were sincere , one might expect that they would be alarmed by findings from animal or human models suggesting that their products might be contributing to the obesity epidemic that continues to expand and do its damage . "
Britons eat an average 150lb of pure sugar a year - more than 12lb per month .
The typical family gets through 52lb a month of sugar in its different forms .
The toll on health can be devastating .
As well as causing dental decay , too much sugar can lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes , raising the risk of heart attack and stroke .
MORE people are getting degrees than ever before .
From 1995 - 2005 the graduation rate in rich countries increased by 12 % , according to the OECD 's “ Education at a Glance ” report , published on Tuesday September 18th .
Australians are the keenest students , with over 80 % of young people entering university in 2005 .
Australia also had a high graduation rate .
Around three - quarters of young people in Nordic countries and Poland attend university , much higher than Germany or Austria .
This may be because many degrees in the latter countries drag on for five or six years .

From Jake Tapper , at ABC :
ABC News ’ Sarah Amos reports that former President Bill Clinton — despite myriad promises he would stop assailing his wife ’s opponent given how it has backfired on her — upped his harsh attacks today in Tyler , Texas .
“ There are two competing moods in America today , ” Clinton said .
“ People who want something fresh and new — and they find it inspiring that we might elect a president who literally was not part of any of the good things that happened or any of the bad things that were stopped before .
The explicit argument of the campaign against Hillary is that ‘ No one who was involved in the 1990s or this decade can possibly be an effective president because they had fights .
We ’re not going to have any of those anymore . ’
Well , if you believe that , I got some land I wanna sell you . ”
ABC News ’ Sarah Amos is traveling with the former president and transcribed his comments .
For the record , in the 1990s , Obama was a civil rights attorney , community organizer , and was in the Illinois state senate .
Presumably , by “ any of the good things that happened ” in the 1990s , Clinton is referring to the things he did as president ( except for the ones his wife now distances herself from , such as NAFTA ) .
Sometimes , it sure feels like the former president ’s defense of his legacy gets in the way of his campaigning for his wife .

China Focus : Inflation with Chinese characteristics
Euro zone inflation to reach 2.6 percent this year
Eurozone economic growth revised down amid rising inflation
Prices forecast to keep increasing , but rate to slow
Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Global inflation has stealthily climbed to historic levels , as the world frets about a possible US recession .
Amid ongoing solid growth in the global economy for five consecutive years , few regions have not felt the sting of higher prices in everything from cooking oil and gasoline to education and health care .
Inflation is at a 16 - year high in Saudi Arabia , a 14 - year high in Switzerland , a 25 - year high in Singapore , and consumer inflation remains at a nearly 11 - year high in China .
The list goes on .
Euro - zone inflation may be more robust than the European Central Bank ( ECB ) expected , with inflation at a 14 - year high ; and the economy has shown signs of slowing .
Many fear it that will get worse if the U.S falls into recession .
Additionally , overshadowed by inflation , the ECB 's ability to go along with the US Federal Reserve ( Fed ) and aggressively slash interest rates is limited .
" In previous booms , we 've had inflation that caused central banks to tighten and brought growth to a halt , " said Gabriel Stein , an economist with Lombard Street Research in London .
" This time , we have a different weakness that prevents central banks from tightening in some areas , so there is a risk of embedding inflation expectations . "
The Fed , for example , is set to keep a lid on inflation expectations as they can influence how people behave in the marketplace , and in turn , impact future inflation .
However , the Fed has slashed benchmark interest rates by 2.25 percentage points since mid-September , despite signs of elevated inflation , in an effort to keep the economy from tipping into recession .
Concerns about inflation not only hover over the Atlantic , and sweep Australia ; but also move eastward to Asia .
Australia 's central bank on Monday bluntly stated they would need to raise interest rates to contain inflation , even though it lowered its outlook for economic growth .
A conventional analysis concludes that countries with relatively weak currencies will have an easier time battling inflation in 2008 – provided growth remains stable – since there is more room for growth .
Asia may be in a better position to face inflation , as central banks can allow their currencies to rise and counter price pressures , making them attractive to investors .
Goldman Sachs , a US investment bank , recently reported that the yuan 's appreciation is the best , most practical way to tame inflation and avoid an economically " hard landing . "
The report also noted that high inflation adds pressure to the rapidly appreciating yuan , which has revaluated more than 2.2 percent against the US dollar so far , after climbing 6.9 percent against the greenback in 2007 .
Analysts believed the PBOC would allow faster appreciation of the yuan in an attempt to curb rising inflation .
Goldman Sachs lifted China 's forecasted inflation from 4.5 percent to 6.8 percent , in light of the rapid growth in the monetary supply .
The consumer price index ( CPI ) , the main gauge of inflation , reached an 11 - year monthly high with a 7.1 percent rise in January .
Huge increases in food prices pushed the CPI up by 4.8 percent in 2007 to its highest level since 1997 , according to the report .
However , economic analysts expected that " stagflation " in the US economy , caused by the subprime crisis and the declining dollar , would have a limited impact on China .
In addition , facing stagflation , the US would not allow a further decline in the dollar ; and that would reduce the appreciation pressure on the Chinese yuan against the greenback and the euro .
Yi Gang , the vice governor of the People 's Bank of China ( PBOC ) , told a seminar in Beijing on Sunday that the primary risk to China 's economy was inflation and the government would stick to a tight monetary policy .
Evidently , global inflation is looming large and will change economic trends in 2008 .
Different nations need to respond appropriately and on the basis of de facto conditions .
By People 's Daily Online
The police blotter is among the most popular features in the Denver Daily News , and Daniel Williams is the reason .
Weekdays for over three years , Williams has trekked to the tiny press room at the Denver Police Department 's Cherokee Street headquarters to page through reports , and until recently , he found plenty of fodder : minor incidents , major felonies , and everything in between .
But beginning about six months ago , the number and variety of reports fell off precipitously .
The stack went from an average of 150 documents per day , by Williams 's reckoning , to a mere handful , and the ones available tended toward the trivial — stolen credit cards , lost cell phones — with the most significant offenses often missing entirely .
" Every day in Denver , there 'll be a burglary or robbery of a business and six or seven serious assaults , " Williams says .
" These are facts :
You can check my police reports to prove it .
Then , suddenly , there 's nothing .
And those things just did n't stop happening . "
Maybe not , but TV , radio and print reporters no longer heard about many of them — and all because of what representatives from the DPD and City Hall say are computer upgrades intended to make life easier and more efficient for police officers , the general public and journalists alike .
Info Denver Police Department
In late January , following a steady rain of complaints from folks at assorted news agencies , the DPD began placing a log of barebones case listings in the press room , and Lieutenant Ron Saunier , who supervises the department 's public information officers , began e-mailing similar data to assorted media members shortly thereafter .
But Williams is far from impressed by the new procedure .
" It does n't make any sense , " he maintains .
" It 's a terrible idea . "
The changes were necessitated by Denver 's implementation of a new Versadex Records Management System .
According to Jeremy Bronson , who served until recently as a special assistant to Denver mayor John Hickenlooper and the city 's DPD liaison , the RMS should help the department move away from a paper - based approach .
" Up until 2007 , an officer on the street would respond to a report of a crime and fill out a paper offense - report form , and that would go to the records bureau in the department , where someone would type in information , " Bronson notes .
" But throughout last year , we switched to officers having laptops in their cars .
They type the information into the laptops , which are connected wirelessly to the Records Management System .
That enables the RMS to be populated in real time . "
The advantages the RMS offers the department are obvious , and Bronson touts a benefit for the citizenry as a whole : Denvergov.org / DenverMaps /CrimeMapping , a page on the city 's website .
Internet users can seek out crime figures by neighborhood , park , school and so on .
Too bad this tool is of little use to reporters .
The site is a bit glitchy — and even if everything works perfectly , the listings only display a few basics : date , time , general location and type of crime .
In contrast , the old police reports sported the names of the individuals involved plus a narrative — a description that immediately let journalists know if the occurrence was intriguing or routine .
Bronson says staffers working on the RMS understood they needed to come up with a way for reporters to access more complete reports , but he's not certain why a strategy was n't in place before the transition began .
As for Saunier , he points to the task 's complexity .
In the past , he notes , " someone physically had to look at each report and redact information in the narrative that we have to remove under state law " — names of juveniles or sexual assault victims , Social Security numbers , etc .
The technical crew was asked to streamline this practice , and finding a fix proved daunting .
At one point , Saunier says they thought they 'd licked the problems ; then , during a test , he discovered that victims of a homicide and a suicide had been identified in reports before next of kin was notified , precipitating another delay .
During this period , he speculates that records personnel may have filled the press room with copies of paper reports filled out by people who came into the office to report minor crimes .
If so , that would explain why sheets about petty matters continued to reach scribes , while the serious stuff vanished .
In the meantime , reporters and editors were left to wonder what was going on — and recognizing a link between the press -room developments and the RMS required a very long memory .
Sarah Huntley , the former assistant city editor for the Rocky Mountain News , who recently became the public information officer for the Boulder Police Department , says Chief of Police Gerry Whitman " gave the media a heads - up two and a half or three years ago that they were going to this system .
They were trying to determine which media outlets checked the reports on a regular basis and what kind of impact it might have . "
Still , she did n't make the connection between the RMS and the shrinking stacks until she asked Saunier about it during a meeting on another topic last fall .
This dearth of communication naturally spawned conspiracy theories .
Indeed , Denver Daily News editor Tad Rickman admits that the vague explanations he received from DPD public - information officer Sonny Jackson made him wonder if the city was trying to artificially burnish its reputation by tinkering with crime statistics prior to August 's Democratic National Convention .
Rocky Mountain
News assistant city editor Luke Clarke does n't go that far , but even if serious crimes were n't being filtered out on purpose , he feels that " the net effect ends up being the same whether they intend it or not .
It 's not consistent with open government , which I believe to be Mayor Hickenlooper 's policy . "
Denver Post public affairs editor Chuck Murphy sounds similar concerns .
The shortage of reports " forced us to rely on spokespeople for the police department and others a lot more than I would like , " he concedes .
" I would prefer that Sonny Jackson not edit the metro section . "
The new press -room log and regular e-mailing is a step up in at least one respect :
Big crimes are part of the mix .
But there are drawbacks as well .
The listings appear sans narratives because , Saunier says , all that detail would make the piles ( and files ) enormous — although why that 's any different from the modus operandi six months ago is unclear .
He promises to provide PDFs of fuller reports to media types who request them by case number , but journos will have to guess what 's interesting from the names of those involved or offense types , which are often mighty broad .
As the Rocky 's Clarke notes , the sex - assault category encompasses everything from serial rapists to guys exposing themselves .
While reporters could make sure they 're not missing the good stuff by requesting copies of just about everything , Clarke 's not ready to declare war quite yet .
" I could justify doing it , " he says , " but I do n't want to overwhelm them . "
The Boulder police 's methodology represents a modest upgrade over the DPD's .
Each morning , PIO Huntley creates a call - report log as colleague Julie Brooks assembles a blotter that summarizes items that may be of interest to the media — and both are placed online at www.boulder-police.com.
If the DPD came up with something similar — or , better yet , launched a secure media site with the narratives included — the press would be pleased .
But Saunier is n't ready to commit to anything so ambitious .
Already , he 'll be expected to serve as a middleman for journalists wanting reports — potentially a very time - consuming process .
" I need to figure out if it's a manageable deal , " Saunier says .
" If it becomes way too demanding , we 'll look at something different . "
For now , Clarke and Murphy are withholding judgment about the new system until they get more staff feedback — but Williams sees more minuses than plusses .
During February 's first week , he says no log appeared in the press room at all , and he only got two e-mailed PDFs , as opposed to one for each day .
Worse , he had no idea what cases were hidden gems because they lacked narratives — and when he took a shot and requested some files from PIO Jackson anyway , the PDFs did n't arrive for nearly two days .
Williams is frustrated , to put it mildly .
Already his paper is running the police blotter less frequently , and he feels the new , improved set - up " makes it a lot tougher for writers and reporters . "
After a pause , he adds , " Maybe that 's part of the whole plan . "

An Air Force fighter pilot died Wednesday after two F - 15C jets collided during a training exercise over the Gulf of Mexico , according to Air Force officials .
Two F - 15C fighter jets , like the one pictured , collided over the Gulf of Mexico , the Air Force says .
The planes were from the 33rd Fighter Wing , a combat - flying unit out of Eglin Air Force Base , near Pensacola , Florida .
A spokesman for the wing said the pilot died after having been rescued by a fishing boat and transported to the hospital at the base .
The pilot of the other jet was also rescued and was listed in good condition , he said .
The crash happened at about 3 p.m. ET , about 50 miles south of Tyndall Air Force Base which is in Panama City , Florida .
A statement from the 33rd said the pilots were rescued at about 6 p.m. ET .
" The 33rd FW Nomads and Team Eglin have suffered a great loss today and my heart goes out to the family and friends of our former airman , " said wing commander Col.
Todd Harmer in a written statement .
" We will continue to do everything we can to assist our families and airmen at this tragic time . "
Capt .
Jim McPherson of the Coast Guard told CNN the crew of a Coast Guard aircraft on a training mission spotted a parachute dropping into the Gulf Wednesday afternoon .
The crew used radar and an automated identification system to detect a fishing boat in the area and directed that boat to the area where the parachute landed .
The Air Force was not identifying the pilots late Wednesday pending notification of their families .
Harmer said both were " assigned to the wing for quite some time . "
He said the Air Force will convene a board of officers to investigate the crash and determine its cause .

MSNBC : Leaked memos show Giuliani's ignorance of terrorism before 9/11 Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday October 26 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This David Shuster , substituting for Keith Olbermann as host of Countdown , reported on Thursday that Rudy Giuliani 's description of himself as the only candidate who foresaw the danger posed by al Qaeda before 9/11 has now been refuted by a leaked document .
Typical of Giuliani's claims on the campaign trail is a speech he gave last summer in which he said of the pre-9/11 period , " Bin Laden declared war on us .
We did n't hear it .
... I thought it was pretty clear at the time -- but a lot of people did n't see it , could n't see it . "
Wayne Barrett , a reporter for New York 's Village Voice and author of Grand Illusion : The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11 , has now obtained leaked memos describing Giuliani 's testimony before the 9/11 Commission which directly contradict that claim .
Barrett told Shuster that taken as a whole , Giuliani 's testimony " was a confession of ignorance .
He basically said , ' I knew nothing about al Qaeda . ' "
For example , Giuliani acknowledged that even though he had received information on threats between 1998 and 2001 , " At the time I had no idea it was al Qaeda . "
He further told the commission that after 9/11 , " we brought in people to brief us on al Qaeda .
...
We had nothing like this pre 9/11 , which was a mistake . "
Giuliani 's testimony , like that of other witnesses describing New York City 's response on 9/11 , was supposed to remain secret until after the 2008 presidential election .
Barrett also emphasized Giuliani's continuing ignorance of technological systems involved in the fight against terrorism .
As late as April 2004 , when he testified before the commission , Giuliani admitted that he did n't know much about a New York Police Department system called ComStat -- which he 's now saying he'd like to see extended nationwide .
He was also unable to answer questions about the malfunctioning radios which caused many deaths among firefighters or about a repeater installed in the World Trade Center after the 1993 bombing to amplify radio communications .
" He still was n't studying the response issues , " Barrett said .

Participate in a presidential frontrunner survey !
Based on my research on my last article , I now conclude that Pelosi and Reid are part of the problem , that they will not stop the war if we keep doing what we 're doing .
Let me repeat that .
Reid and Pelosi are part of the problem , keeping the war going .
If they wanted to , they could push for support so they could go to the president and inform him that they would not bring any more bills fo funding to the house or senate floor .
Either one of them could do it and it would take a majority in the house and 60 votes in the senate to over - ride .
But they 're not willing to do that .
If they were , they would have done it .
I believe we need to get commitments from every legislator , whether they will support a blocking of funds .
If enough commit , then further steps can be taken to push Pelosi and Reid to take a stand .
Article Comments Update :
It looks like Tom Murphy hijacked the thread with his nonsence about a small minority wanting the war to end .
I 'd like to see the discussion be about turning the members of congress to sign on to refusing not to further fund the war .
So do me a favor .
Ignore the thread hijacker and address what the article is about .
Another addendum .
I 'd asked Thom Hartmann to comment on his idea of what it would like like , after the dems tell Bush NO MORE when he asks for money to fund the war .
Here 's
Thom 's reply :
After years of promises , it seems that holograms are finally starting to gain a little traction , although the applications for the technology so far have been fairly limited .
At least one company thinks that 's about to change , however , with it now touting its retro-styled Holocube as an all - purpose solution for company 's to advertise their products " like never before . "
Measuring about 20 - inches square , the Holocube packs a 40 GB hard drive for storing up to 18 hours of compressed video , which can magically float at 1080i resolution within the cube at the flick of a switch .
Of course , the fact the company is targeting the device solely as a means of advertising should tell you something about the price ( which is on a need to know basis , it seems ) .
Still , it 's a start , and we 're guessing there are at least a few folks out there that 'll snag one of these to fully round out their Star Wars - inspired home theater no matter what the cost .
Head on past the break for some video of it in action .

When Kyle Burkhalter gets up in the morning , he goes into the kitchen and fixes himself a nice cup of ice .
The 24 - year - old director of research for a Web site chews the ice in the car on his way to work in Atlanta .
He downs two or three more cups before lunch .
He orders ice from drive - thru windows and dips into the office ice machine .
Sometimes , his tongue gets so numb he can barely talk to clients .
Still , he munches on .
" It 's something that you want to do and you think about doing on a constant basis , " he says .
Ice is n't just for chilling drinks anymore , or for packing fish and treating sprains .
It 's a hot snack .
Some Sonic Drive - In franchises sell it in cups and in bags to go .
Ice - machine makers are competing to make the best chewable ice , with names like Chewblet , Nugget Ice and Pearl Ice .
One manufacturer calls the ice - loving South the " Chew Belt . "
Generally , more ice is sold during the summer , but people who compulsively chew ice do so whether it 's hot or cold outside .
One Sonic in Texas sold 13 10 - pound bags , at $ 1.49 apiece , in one week this month .
Sales of machines that make easier - to - chew ice jumped about 23 % , to 16,673 units in 2006 from 2003 , according to data from the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute .
Some ice chewers , including country - music star Vince Gill , have had the machines installed in their homes .
Ice chewers swap tips on Icechewing .com .
A recipe for preparing the perfect cup of ice :
Use a glass , not a plastic cup .
Let crushed ice fuse in water .
Drink the water .
Shake the cup to loosen the ice .
Dig in .
A member , identified as Rambling , responded , " I am drooling , " and signed off , " I could chew Alaska . "
Todd Robinson started the Web site in late 2003 after a message about ice - chewing on another site he ran generated more than 100 comments .
Still , he thought Icechewing .com would be a flop .
" I was n't going to keep it that long , but then these people are really sincere , " he says .
Today , the site has 3,192 registered members and gets about 1,000 hits a day , he says .

American culture ’s overemphasis on happiness misses an essential part of a full life
David Letterman has secured a deal with the striking Writers Guild of America that will allow him to resume his late - night show on CBS next Wednesday with his team of writers on board , executives of several late - night shows said today .
Most of television ’s late - night shows are scheduled to return to the air that night after being off for two months due to the strike , but it is likely that only Mr. Letterman , and the show that follows him on CBS hosted by Craig Ferguson , will be supported by material from writers .
The reason is that Mr. Letterman ’s company World Wide Pants , owns both those shows .
The company announced two weeks ago that it was seeking a separate deal with the guild that would permit the two World Wide Pants show to return to the air .
The talks seemed to be at an impasse until today when the deal was completed .
A spokesman for Mr. Letterman ’s company declined to comment .
Beyond the obvious advantage of having writers to supply comedy material that other shows will not have , Mr. Letterman ’s and Mr. Ferguson ’s shows will likely gain a benefit by being able to book guests who will not appear on shows still being struck by the Writers Guild .
While you probably wonâ€™t hear this on the mainstream media , the Center for Responsive Politics has provided me with information about the military contributions that are going to both parties candidates .
While the military heavily favored the Republican Party in the last Presidential Elections , the trend is changing .
The top candidate for contributions from military members is surprisingly Ron Paul .
This , from a former career military man , warms my heart .
This goes to show that military people think , and donâ€™t blindly follow leader 's with pro-military agendaâ€™s .
The second highest contributions went to Barak Obama .
With the African - American vote and the anti-war feelings running through the military , itâ€™s now small wonder that Obama has received so many contributions .
This seems to say that the military thinks that fighting in Iraq is the wrong move if they are putting their money where their mouth is .
Here is the breakdown according to The Center for Responsive Politics that you can see for yourself on their website at OpenSecrets.org . :
MILITARY CONTINUES TO GIVE TO PAUL , OBAMA
Despite his anti-war stance , or perhaps because of it , Ron Paul has collected more money from members of the U.S. military than any other presidential candidate , including John McCain , a Vietnam War prisoner who backs the administration 's policy in Iraq .
Paul has brought in at least $ 53,670 from the uniformed services since the campaign 's start , compared to McCain 's $ 40,000 .
Democrat Barack Obama , who opposed the resolution to go to Iraq from the start , is the number - two recipient with at least $ 45,200 .
( Obama had been ahead of Paul after the 2nd Quarter . )
The contribution record of the military has become less Republican since the Iraq war began , and some donors say they 're contributing to express dissatisfaction with the Bush administration 's handling of the war and foreign policy .
Tallying donations exceeding $ 200 , Democrats have received 35 percent of the total $ 319,000 in contributions from uniformed service members this year .
By comparison , in 2000 , the last presidential race before the Iraq war began , Democrats received only 18 percent of contributions from the military .
* Read a Capital Eye story from September about military giving : http://www.capitaleye.org/inside.asp?ID=300
So the next time that some redneck or neo -con tells you that supporting Paul or Obama is â€ œNot supporting the Troopsâ€ , you tell them that the troops themselves are supporting these candidates .
Thatâ€™s the way I see it .

Thinking Forth - Leo Brodie
A PDF of this wonderful book is available for download .
The following is taken from the description there .
Thinking Forth is a book about the philosophy of problem solving and programming style , applied to the unique programming language Forth .
Published first in 1984 , it could be among the timeless classics of computer books , such as Fred Brooks '
The Mythical Man-Month and Donald Knuth 's The Art of Computer Programming .
Many software engineering principles discussed here have been rediscovered in eXtreme Programming , including ( re ) factoring , modularity , bottom - up and incremental design .
Here you 'll find all of those and more - such as the value of analysis and design - described in Leo Brodie 's down - to - earth , humorous style , with illustrations , code examples , practical real life applications , illustrative cartoons , and interviews with Forth 's inventor , Charles H. Moore as well as other Forth thinkers .
If you program in Forth , this is a must - read book .
If you do n't , the fundamental concepts are universal : Thinking Forth is meant for anyone interested in writing software to solve problems .
The concepts go beyond Forth , but the simple beauty of Forth throws those concepts into stark relief .
So flip open the book , and read all about the philosophy of Forth , analysis , decomposition , problem solving , style and conventions , factoring , handling data , and minimizing control structures .
But be prepared : you may not be able to put it down .

A California resident on Friday filed a class- action lawsuit against Apple over its controversial policies regarding the service of modified iPhones .
Filed by the Law Office of Damian R. Fernandez on behalf of Timothy P. Smith , the suit alleges that Apple violated California antitrust law by prohibiting iPhone owners from using the device with any carrier other than AT&T .
The suit argues that mobile phone unlocking is legal thanks to a provision in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , and that Apple 's allegedly unlawful practices are forcing consumers to pay " artificially inflated " prices for the iPhone and AT&T 's service .
To clarify , a 2006 exemption in the DMCA granted by the Library of Congress prevents the prosecution of any individual who unlocks a mobile phone for personal use .
This leaves consumers in the position of ostensibly being clear to unlock their own phones , but Apple is not legally required to facilitate this , or support it .
Additionally , some carriers in the US have implemented a practice of providing unlock codes as early as 90 days into a contract for subsidized phones .
Yet the iPhone is not subsidized through AT&T ; customers purchase the phone at full price from Apple and AT&T stores , and AT&T has said that it wo n't be providing unlock codes .
Thus , even with some legal support for unlocking , consumers are taking risks if they go that route , and Smith 's suit says that this is unfair , monopolistic behavior .
Smith 's lawsuit continues , alleging that Apple is unlawfully denying service and warranty coverage to customers who have modified their iPhones with third party software .
Among the many other listed violations , Apple is also alleged to have devalued the iPhone by significantly lowering its price only two months after introducing the product .
Going further , the suit also alleges that Apple 's conduct constitutes " unlawful , unfair , and / or fraudulent business practices within the meaning of California 's Unfair Competition Act , and California Business and Professions Code sections . "
The suit seeks an injunction to prevent Apple from selling the iPhone with any software locks and for the company to be prevented from denying warranty service to users who have unlocked their iPhones .
InformationWeek , which first reported the suit this past weekend , reports that the lawyer heading the case will determine the proper financial penalty in the trial phase , once it is more clear how many users have been affected .

The more I learn about startups the more I realize that one ’s chance of succeeding is a continuum rather than some kind of binary state .
In other words , when you read a blog post that talks about “ X Ways to Succeed with Your Startup ” what they really mean is “ X Ways to Potentially Increase Your Chance of Success With Your Startup .
But the second title is too clumsy so we bloggers abbreviate .
With that in mind , I ’ve had this list sitting around for a long time , debating the best way to present it .
The problem with this kind of list is that some people read it and see they are doing some of the things I ’ve listed and they panic .
This panic results in a need to rationalize their behavior and convince themselves they are not travelling a path to certain doom .
Who wants to admit that ?
But that ’s not the point this list .
As you read it keep two things in mind :
Doing any one of the items on this list is not a recipe for failure .
But from my experience observing and working with over 1,000 entrepreneurs , each one will have a negative impact on your chance of taking your company to profitability .
This applies to bootstrapped companies .
Funded companies can break these rules since the money they have sitting in the bank provides them with a bit of a reality distortion field .
# 1 : Choosing a Market with Funded Competition
I ’ve seen first - hand how funded competition can crush a bootstrapping company .
AdWords go from $.50 to $ 5 per click overnight .
Your funded competitor hires a PR firm and appears in Inc. , Fast Company and Wired in the same month .
And your search engine rankings drop as competitors hire high - end SEO firms .
It ’s not that you ca n’t beat funded competition .
But taking them on head to head is like wrestling 2 weight classes above your own .
Instead of attacking them head on , I recommend avoiding the head to head conflict by choosing a niche that the funded competitor ca n’t afford to enter .
Which leads us to our next one …
# 2 : Not Targeting a Niche ( Going Horizontal )
This is perhaps the most common mistake I saw two years ago .
I ’m pleased to see this changing recently ; I ’m not sure if people are listening to myself , Jason Cohen , and others who have espoused the benefits of going niche or if it ’s just the obvious approach these days .
Niches are easier to penetrate , cheaper to advertise to , have less competition , higher profit margins , and word of mouth is a vibrant force .
All of this combines to make vertical niches the best option , by far , for someone bootstrapping a company .
# 3 : Doing Everything Yourself
Launching an application , even a 1.0 , requires hundreds of hours .
Everything from graphic design to coding , marketing to setting up a payment processor .
If you are convinced you have to do every single step yourself you are decreasing the chance that you will make it to your launch day .
I ’ve actually dubbed this need to keep everything under your control one of the most common startup roadblocks , and I talk about it in more depth ( including how to avoid it ) here .
# 4 : Basing Your Business on One - time Sales
This is one of the more recent lessons I ’ve learned : one - time sales suck .
On the first day of every month you start with zero dollars in revenue , and you have to hustle like crazy to hit your number .
Starting from zero revenue every 30 days is no way to grow a business .
The more I ’ve watched successful businesses grow , the more I realize they always have a built in recurring revenue stream .
Netflix went from one - off movies to subscriptions back in the late 90s .
Many desktop software vendors are moving to subscription billing .
And I hear more and more people espousing the benefits of recurring payments , including Dharmesh Shah at his recent talk at Business of Software 2011 .
If you ’re building a product with a one - time fee I encourage you to look for a way to turn it into a recurring revenue model .
# 5 : Choosing an Idea with a Two - Sided Market
Having one group of people to market to is hard enough .
But having to find and reign in two groups of customers is just brutal .
Examples of this include Elance , eBay , Monster.com , and any sort of ad - supported website ( since you have to sell to advertisers and visitors )
It can be done .
It ’s just doubles ( or triples ) the amount of marketing needed to get off the ground .
# 6 : Going Freemium
This topic was covered by Ruben in this guest post .
Suffice to say , free plans rarely work for bootstrapped companies .
# 7 : Ignoring the Numbers
You ca n’t make money charging $ 1 per month .
Wait … you can , if you have millions of customers .
The problem is , getting to millions of customers requires more money and time than you have right now .
Trying to make money selling an app for $ 1 / month is crazy unless your market is gigantic and you have the expertise or the funds to reach them ( and even then , support will kill you ) .
Let ’s look at some numbers :
If your goal is a meager $ 2 k per month you need 2 k customers .
To begin , that ’s a lot of non-technical customers to support for that little money .
You ’ll still be working a full - time job at that point so it ’ll be nights and weekends .
Not cool .
To get 2 k customers with a 1 % conversion rate you ’ll need 200 k unique visitors ( total , not monthly ) .
If you crank really hard on promotion and word of mouth I can imagine you ’ll ramp up to 1 k - 2 k uniques per month .
Even at 4 k per month you ’ll be waiting a long time to hit that 200k mark .
These days I advise people to go up - market and try for $ 30 / month and $ 50 / month price points .
What can you build that will provide that much value to customers ?
# 8 : Starting Your Marketing Once Your Product is Complete
If validating your idea , creating an instant beta list , having your best launch day ever and building links over time is n’t enough , how about building confidence in yourself that your idea is completely kick ass during the 6 months you ’re sitting in your basement coding it up ?
Rumor has it that DropBox had 200,000 emails by the time they launched , based on driving a ton of traffic to a landing page with a single video that discussed how the service was going to work once it was built .
These days when people ask me if they have to build a product to pitch investors , I tell them they can…or they can gather 200,000 emails .
Call me if you do this and I ’ll write you a check .
For more on the specifics of how to approach this , check out Why You Should Start Marketing the Day You Start Coding .
# 9 : Expecting it to Be Easy
You ’ll often hear that the number one cause of death among startups is running out of money .
For bootstrappers this is not the case .
When you ’re launching from your spare bedroom , out of money is where you start .
From day 1 your goal is to go from out of money to covering hosting .
So for you , stalwart bootstrapper , the number one cause of death is not running out of money , but running out of motivation .
If you start with the expectation that you ’ll be able to take your company from nothing to $ 100,000 in revenue in a few months working part - time , you ’re going to be more likely to throw in the towel when it does n’t happen .
And the day you decide to throw in the towel is the day your startup dies .
No , it ’s not easy to start a company .
But knowing you , it ’s why you decided to start a company in the first place .

Many people back up their music onto computers or recordable CDs
Millions of people already " rip " discs to their computers and move the files to MP3 players , although the process is technically against copyright law .
Intellectual property minister Lord Triesman said the law should be changed so it " keeps up with the times " .
Music industry bodies gave a cautious welcome to the proposals , which are up for public consultation until 8 April .
The changes would apply only to people copying music for personal use - meaning multiple copying and internet file - sharing would still be banned .
Owners would not be allowed to sell or give away their original discs once they had made a copy .
Sales concerns
" To allow consumers to copy works and then pass on the original could result in a loss of sales , " the proposals warn .
UK music industry body the BPI said it supported the move to clarify the law for consumers , but warned that any changes should not damage the rights of record companies .
The Association of Independent Music ( Aim ) said the proposals did not go far enough - pointing out that CDs could become obsolete in the next decade .
It said that , once CDs are replaced , the law could be misused to " open the floodgates to unstoppable copying " , adding that it would like to see copyright holders compensated when music was copied .
Lord Triesman said the proposed changes would explore " where the boundaries lie between strong protection for right holders and appropriate levels of access for users " .
The proposals also suggest schools and libraries should be given greater flexibility in how they use copyrighted material like CDs and DVDs , and suggests parodies of songs and films could be made exempt from copyright law .
The consultation follows the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property , which recommended that aspects of the intellectual property system should be reformed .
W3C XML is Ten !
Community Invited to Celebrate XML Everywhere
http://www.w3.org/
-- 12 February 2008 --
To mark the ten year anniversary of the publication of its Extensible Markup Language ( XML ) 1.0 as a W3C Recommendation , the World Wide Web Consortium plans throughout 2008 to recognize and thank the dedicated communities and individuals responsible for XML for their contributions — including people who have participated in W3 C 's XML groups and mailing lists , the SGML community , and xml - dev — through a variety of activities and events .
XML is a simple , open , and flexible format used to exchange a wide variety of data on and off the Web .
The success of XML is a strong indicator of how dedicated individuals , working within the W3C Process , can engage with a larger community to produce industry - changing results .
W3C XML is Everywhere
" There is essentially no computer in the world , desk - top , hand - held , or back - room , that does n't process XML sometimes , " said Tim Bray of Sun Microsystems .
" This is a good thing , because it shows that information can be packaged and transmitted and used in a way that 's independent of the kinds of computer and software that are involved .
XML wo n't be the last neutral information - wrapping system ; but as the first , it 's done very well . "
Indeed , one can hardly get through the day without using technology that is based on XML in some fashion .
When you fill your auto tank with gas , XML often flows from pump to station .
When you configure your digital camera , on some models you do so via XML - based graphical controls .
When you plug it into a computer , the camera and the operating system communicate with each other in XML .
When you download digital music , the software you use to organize it is likely to store information about songs as XML .
And when you explore the planet Mars , XML goes with you ; see the story about open source on Mars .
W3C XML a Community Effort
W3C would like to extend congratulations to the participants of the XML Working Group that created the standard : Jon Bosak , Paula Angerstein , Tim Bray ( co- Editor ) , James Clark , Dan Connolly , Steve DeRose , Dave Hollander , Eliot Kimber , Tom Magliery , Eve Maler , Murray Maloney , Makoto Murata , Joel Nava , Conleth O'Connell , Jean Paoli ( co- Editor ) , Peter Sharpe , C. M. Sperberg - McQueen ( co- Editor ) , and John Tigue .
" The tenth anniversary of XML is a good time to reflect on the reasons for its creation , " said Jon Bosak , the Sun Microsystems Distinguished Engineer who organized and led the W3C Working Group that produced the XML 1.0 Recommendation .
" XML and its associated standards have conferred so many technical benefits over the years that it 's easy to lose track of the forces that motivated the industry to base future web development on a profile of an International Standard , SGML ( ISO 8879:1986 ) .
Underlying all the technical work was a struggle between users and vendors over the ownership of data .
Sun Microsystems sponsored the effort to make XML the standard for web data because we knew that the alternative was a closed , non-interoperable format .
Today we celebrate the success of open standards in preserving web data from vendor lock - in .
The struggle is far from over , but I 'm proud that Sun was able to foster a development that can someday make vendor - independent data a reality . "
XML is an interoperable standard that supports internationalization , extensibility , composition , and persistence ( because the format is open and can also be read by humans in a pinch ) ; learn more about XML - based data formats .
XML is supported by a rich toolkit of related standards , including XSLT ( for transforming XML content ) , XQuery ( for querying XML databases ) , Document Object Model ( for access in a programming environment ) , XML Schema , and XML Signature and Encryption .
XML interoperability has made it a natural choice for defining both document formats ( such as SVG or VoiceXML ) and services ( both SOAP - based and HTTP - based ) .
W3C Continues to Invest in XML
W3C has invested in the maintenance of XML since it was first published .
Specification maintenance can be a thankless task , but the XML Core Working Group has worked to ensure that community bug reports lead to corrections of the specification .
Indeed , on 5 February the XML Core Working Group published a Fifth Edition of XML 1.0 as a Proposed Edited Recommendation , inviting the community to review the latest round of changes .
W3C also takes this opportunity to thank the XML Core Working Group , and in particular to co-Chairs Paul Grosso and Norm Walsh for their dedication .
Join the W3C XML10 Celebration
As part of the W3C XML10 Celebration , W3C aims to include video interviews of people in the XML community , and to distribute XML10 goodies at XML - related events throughout 2008 .
To support these projects , W3C has invited W3C Members to become XML10 Sponsors .
W3C would like to thank the FLWOR Foundation for their generous support of XML10 .
Using the XML10 Greeting Card , please tell us about your blog entries , videos , articles , XML deployment facts , and other thoughts about XML .
Submitted greetings will be public .

The strict interpretation of fair - housing laws prohibits brokers from providing information about people that could be construed as discriminatory in any of 14 protected categories .
The categories include familiar ones like race , religion , sex and disabilities and less well - known ones like familial status , marital status , citizenship and occupation .
So a broker who says something like , “ There are tons of little kids in this building — it ’s really family friendly ” could be accused of specifically steering families to the building and driving people without children away from it .
When humans began to migrate out of Africa about 100,000 years ago , their skin color gradually changed to adapt to their new environments .
And when the last Ice Age ended about 10,000 years ago , marine ancestors of ocean - dwelling stickleback fish experienced dramatic changes in skin coloring as they colonized newly formed lakes and streams .
New research shows that despite the vast evolutionary gulf between humans and the three - spined stickleback fish , the two species have adopted a common genetic strategy to acquire the skin pigmentation that would help each species thrive in their new environments .
The researchers , led by Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator David Kingsley , published their findings in the December 14 , 2007 , issue of the journal Cell .
Kingsley and first author Craig Miller are at the Stanford University School of Medicine , and other co-authors are from the University of Porto in Portugal , the University of British Columbia , the University of Chicago , and the Pennsylvania State University Further studies of stickleback , they say , may reveal other malleable pieces of genetic machinery both fish and humans have used for adaptation .
The stickleback has become a premier model organism for studying evolution because of its extraordinary evolutionary history , said Kingsley .
" Sticklebacks have undergone one of the most recent and dramatic evolutionary radiations on earth , " he said .
When the last Ice Age ended , giant glaciers melted and created thousands of lakes and streams in North America , Europe , and Asia .
These waters were colonized by the stickleback 's marine ancestors , which subsequently adapted to life in freshwater .
" This created a multitude of little evolutionary experiments , in which these isolated populations of fish adapted to the new food sources , predators , water color , and water temperature that they found in these new environments , " Kingsley explained .
Among those adaptations were new colorations that helped the fish camouflage themselves , distinguish species , and attract mates in their new environments .
Until now , however , scientists had not understood what genetic factors drove the changes in skin pigmentation .
Human populations have also undergone pigmentation changes as they have adapted to life in new environments .
The ecological reasons for those changes may be quite different from the forces driving the evolution of pigmentation in sticklebacks , said Kingsley .
As human populations migrated out of Africa into northern climates , the need for darker pigmentation necessary to protect against the intense tropical sun diminished .
With skin that was more transparent to sunlight , humans were better able to produce sufficient vitamin D in their new climate .
To begin to understand the genetic basis of skin pigmentation changes in fish , Kingsley and his colleagues crossed stickleback species that had different pigmentation patterns and used genetic markers and the recently completed sequence map of the fish 's genome to search for the mechanism regulating stickleback pigmentation .
They searched for chromosome segments in the offspring that were always associated with inheritance of dark or light gills and skin .
Through detailed mapping of one such segment , Kingsley and his colleagues found that a gene called Kitlg ( short for " Kit ligand " ) was associated with pigmentation inheritance .
Kitlg was an excellent candidate for regulating pigmentation because mutant forms of the corresponding gene in mice produce changes in fur color , said Kingsley .
The Kitlg gene is involved in a variety of biological processes , including germ cell development , pigment cell development , and hematopoiesis .
Light - colored fish have regulatory mutations that reduce expression of the Kitlg gene in gills and skin , but that do not reduce the gene 's function in other tissues .
" By altering expression of this gene in one particular place in the body , the fish can fine tune the level of expression of that factor in some tissues but not others , " said Kingsley .
" That lets evolution produce a big local effect on a trait like color while preserving the other functions of the gene . "

Humans also have a Kitlg gene , and Kingsley and his colleagues wondered if it played a role in regulating the pigmentation of human skin .
One clue they had came from previous research by other groups that had revealed that the human Kitlg gene has undergone different changes among different human populations , suggesting that it is evolutionarily significant .
Kingsley and his colleagues tested whether the different human versions of the Kitlg gene are associated with changes in skin color .
Humans with two copies of the African form of the Kitlg gene had darker skin color than people with one or two copies of the new Kitlg variant that is common in Europe and Asia .
Knowing that people had also adapted lighter skin when they migrated north , Kingsley wondered whether mutations in the same gene accounted for light pigmentation in people living in northern climes .
In the north , where less sunlight reaches the ground , lighter coloring helps people absorb enough sunlight to produce vitamin D .
Kingsley and his colleagues collected DNA from people with a variety of skin colors to look for alterations in the Kit ligand gene .
Sure enough , people with lighter skin had an altered form of the gene .
He said this gene is n’t alone in controlling a person ’s skin color , but it does seem to account for about 20 percent of the differences in pigmentation between people of African and northern European descent .
“ It is the same genetic mechanism between organisms that are very different from each other , ” Kingsley said .
This gene is known to make a protein that plays a role in maintaining the melanocyte skin cells that control pigmentation .
In terms of how evolution progresses , this gene would be a large ladle of dye that helps set the paint color apart from the original .
Additional genetic changes account for the exact color of each person ’s skin .
" Although multiple chromosomal regions contribute to the complex trait of pigmentation in both fish and humans , we have identified one gene that plays a central role in color changes in both species , " said Kingsley .
" Since fish and humans look so different , people are often surprised that common mechanisms may extend across both organisms , " he said .
" But there are real parallels between the evolutionary history of sticklebacks and humans .
Sticklebacks migrated out of the ocean into new environments about ten thousand years ago .
And they breed about once every one or two years , giving them five thousand to ten thousand generations to adapt to new environments . "
Although modern humans arose in Africa , they are thought to have migrated out of Africa in the last 100,000 years .
" Humans breed about once every 20 years , giving them about 5,000 generations or so to emerge from an ancestral environment and colonize and adapt to new environments around the world , " Kingsley added .
" So despite the difference in total years , the underlying process is actually quite similar .
Whether it be fish or humans , there were small migrating populations encountering new environments and evolving significant changes in some traits in a relatively short time .
And the genetic mechanisms that can produce these changes may be so constrained that evolution will tend to use the same sorts of genes in different organisms . "
Kingsley and his colleagues are now exploring the genetic basis of other evolved traits in the stickleback that could find a parallel in humans .
" And given the degree to which evolutionary mechanisms appear to be shared between populations and organisms , we 're optimistic about finding the particular genes that underlie other recent adaptations to changing environments in both fish and humans , " he said .
The sci - fi dream ( or utter fantasy ) of getting from one place to another instantaneously continued this February 14 , with the opening of Doug Liman 's film Jumper , based on the novel by Steven Gould .
We asked quantum physicist H. Jeff Kimble of the California Institute of Technology to explain how physicists understand quantum teleportation , which turns out to be more relevant to computing than to commuting .
Note :
This is an expanded version of a Q&A published in the March 2008 print edition of Scientific American .
Scientific American :
What 's the biggest misconception about teleportation ?
Jeff Kimble :
That the object itself is being sent .
We 're not sending around material stuff .
If I wanted to send you a Boeing 757 , I could send you all the parts , or I could send you a blueprint showing all the parts , and it 's much easier to send a blueprint .
Teleportation is a protocol about how to send a quantum state — a wave function — from one place to another .
Is transmitting a quantum state hard to do ?
The most straightforward way to do it would be to imagine it was an electron : just shoot the electron from point A to point B and it takes its quantum state with it .
But that ’s not always so good , because the state gets messed up in the process .
How does teleportation get around the disruption of the quantum state ?
The special resource that enables teleportation is entanglement .
You 're Alice [ in location A ] , and I hand you an electron in an unknown quantum state .
Your job is to send the quantum state ( not the electron ) to location B , which is Bob .
If you try to measure it directly , you necessarily disturb it .
You and Bob also share a pair of electron — you have one , Bob has the other — and they 're in an entangled state such that if yours is spinning up , his is spinning down and conversely .
You make a joint measurement of two electrons — the one I handed you and the one you 're sharing with Bob .
And that gives you two bits of information .
You call up Bob on the cell phone and give him those two bits , and he uses them to manipulate his electron .
And bingo , in the ideal case he can perfectly re-create the state of the electron that I handed you .
Why does n't Alice just copy the quantum state and store the copy ?
There are uncertainty relations like Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle .
When I hand my electron to Alice , what she might think to do is just keep a copy — clone it .
The more information she tries to get about the state , the less good is the teleportation .
If she tries to keep a perfect copy , then Bob would create a state that is perfectly random .
Why would you want to transmit a quantum state ?
What are the applications ?
Imagine you want to build a quantum computer .
A quantum computer is going to have parts just like a computer on your desktop .
They have to be wired together quantum mechanically .
The quantum memory 's got to talk to the quantum processor .
Teleportation is just a fancy quantum wire .
Why not just shoot electrons around ?
If I carry this electron from the memory to the processor and I make a mistake — say it collides with some impurity in the wire — then I 've lost more than just the state of that one electron .
That one spin is entangled , potentially , with all the spins in the computer .
How has the field advanced since the first demonstrations of quantum teleportation in 1997 ?
All the initial work was done with light .
In 1998 my team demonstrated teleportation of a beam of light .
I would say that was the first bona fide demonstration .
A beam of light came in , and a beam of light came out .
In the experiments your magazine covered , there was never a moment you could say , aha , the state has emerged and been teleported .
A few years ago [ in 2004 ] a group led by David J. Wineland at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder , Colo . — and simultaneously with that , a group led by Rainer Blatt in Innsbruck , Austria — teleported the internal spin of a trapped ion .
It ’s the first time teleportation had been done with the state of a massive particle .
The quantum state of one ion was teleported to a second ion using a third ion in the middle as an intermediate .
More recently [ in 2006 ] , the group of Eugene S. Polzik at the University of Copenhagen teleported the quantum state of light directly into a material system .
All the other experiments had been teleportation from an atom or a photon to exactly the same kind of particle .
Do these demonstrations have any practical value ?
It has practical implications , because a quantum computer is going to be a hybrid system .
Light is good for propagating from one place to the other with very low loss , but it 's really hard to store light .
Some quantum information protocols require you to take light and map it into some material system , where you can store it for a long time .
Then if you want to communicate across your computer or across the country , you map it back into light .
I should tell you one other experiment .
A scientist named Akira Furusawa * at the University of Tokyo teleported entanglement .
He had one beam of light that was entangled to a second beam ; he teleported the first beam and he could show it was still entangled with the partner that was n't teleported .
How would keeping a teleported object entangled with its unteleported partner be useful ?
The quantum computer 's working on thousands of entangled spins and from time to time I need to teleport the state of the 561st electron to another place .
Well that 's not as simple as just thinking it's that one electron .
Switching gears — this new movie , Jumper , is about a kid , and some other people , who teleport from place to place .
I did n't know that .
If you saw X - Men , with Nightcrawler …
I have n't seen X - Men either .
Do you watch Heroes on NBC ?
No .
I watch some of the football playoffs .
But you know Captain Kirk …
I have some advice .
Just do n't talk about teleporting people in your story .
The technical base of our society is information commerce , and in the next 20 years it will radically change .
Read the semiconductor industry 's roadmap .
We 're just going to gleefully think it 's going to happen on the movie screen , and we will ignore investments in science and technology .
There 's a really incredibly exciting frontier in science that did n't exist 15 or 20 years ago , and it's this quantum information science , which brings together traditional computer science and quantum mechanics .
There 's stuff going on that is just titillating .
* Correction ( 1/20/09 ) : Akira Furusawa was originally identified as TK Furusawa .

WARSAW ( Reuters ) -
It ’s official .
Postal delivery is as slow as snails , at least in Poland .
An IT worker , after receiving a letter on January 3 that was sent on December 20 as priority mail , calculated that a snail would have made it even faster to his home than the letter .
Daily Gazeta Wyborcza said Michal Szybalski calculated that it took 294 hours for the letter to arrive at his home .
He also said the distance between his home and the sender was 11.1 kilometers .
Given the distance and the time , the speed of the letter was 0.03775 kilometers per hour .
Szybalski calculated that a garden snail travels at around 0.048 kilometers per hour .
ALBANY , May 2 -
It did not take long for the editor in chief of the Middlebury College weekly student newspaper , The Middlebury Campus , to resign and apologize for publishing a doctored photograph in the March 17 issue portraying the college 's next commencement speaker , Rudolph W. Giuliani , as Adolf Hitler .
But if she had the chance to do it over , Andrea Gissing , the former top editor who has taken " full responsibility " for the sardonic portrait of New York City 's former mayor , said she might publish the piece again .
" I had spent a lot of time thinking about the illustration , going into it , and my decision to run that was not a light one , " Ms. Gissing said in an interview on Monday .
" It served the purpose of a political cartoon , which is to , you know , make people think about the issue and to react to it in a positive or negative way . "
Ms. Gissing resigned her job in an editorial in the March 31 issue , and cited internal reasons , not outside pressure .
Mr. Giuliani is still planning to speak , said Sunny Mindel , his spokeswoman .
Still , questions persist about whether there will be protests , either for or against Mr. Giuliani , as various letter writers to The Middlebury Campus have taken both sides in the debate .
" There are people wondering if there will be demonstrations , " said Philip G. Benoit , the school 's spokesman .
" Although I would not think it would be on that large a scale . "

ProBlogger readers are absolutely spoilt when it comes to great articles about coming up with post ideas .
But what about thinking up the post topics your audience has been craving ?
In this post I ’ll be outlining six strategies you can use to determine exactly what kind of posts your audience wants to see on your blog .
1. Listen to comments
One thing you might have noticed is that commenters will sometimes ask you to expand on a section of your post .
Either they wanted more information on a specific point , a more thorough exploration of one of your ideas or a clear explanation of something that ’s confused them .
Instead of answering in comment form , you can turn your answer in a post ( and use the answer to drive more traffic back to your original article . )
2. Listen to emails
Part of being a blogger is receiving and answering reader questions by email .
These questions can be a great source of ideas for posts your audience is craving .
After receiving the tenth or so email on how I find and use great Flickr images in posts on my own blog , I decided to write a complete guide to the process after sensing it was something a lot of readers were interested in .
The resulting post went on to become one of the most popular articles I ’ve ever written !
Listening to reader emails can result in some fantastic post ideas .
3 . Ask them
A fairly obvious option , but one I do n’t see many bloggers explore .
Ask your readers to submit ideas for posts they ’d like to see on your blog .
Do this every couple of months and you ’ll have a list of ideas you can turn to when your well of inspiration runs dry .
If you notice several ideas on the same topic or area you can bet that it ’s something quite a few of your readers would like to see more of .
4 . Turn wants and needs into post - topics
Grab a notebook , open to a new page and put a pen in one hand .
Write down all the possible niche - related wants and needs of your target audience .
If your target audience is interested in debt elimination , for example , their wants and needs cloud might look like this :
To develop a workable budget and stick to it .
To spend less without sacrificing quality of life .
To find cheaper versions of the things they need .
To find new ways to make a bit of extra money .
To avoid getting into future debt .
To become debt - free as soon as possible .
To eliminate unnecessary expenses .
If we give each want / need its own space on the page , we can start to branch out post ideas from each one .
Because each of these post ideas is based on something our target audience wants , we can almost guarantee that it will be useful to them .

5 . What do you want ?
You ’d be hard pressed to find a baseball blogger who ’s not into baseball , a copywriting blogger who ’s not into copywriting , a travel blogger who does n’t like travel , and so on .
You are part of your target audience .
The things you ’d like to see someone else in your niche write may just be what your target audience is also searching for .
Expanding on this premise , you can use your own niche experiences , problems and triumphs as fodder for blog posts .
If you struggle with something related to your niche on a daily basis , maybe your readers are struggling with it too ?
If you ’re worked out a solution to a problem related to your niche — something you were experiencing — maybe your readers would find the solution truly useful themselves ?
If there ’s a skill you ’ve always wanted to learn , a problem you ’ve always wanted to solve or a resource list you ’ve always hoped to see , stop waiting for someone else to use your good idea , execute it yourself and turn the result into a truly useful blog post .
6. Reverse engineer what worked
Look at your blog ’s top ten most popular post .
They ’re examples of posts that your target audience truly wanted to read .
You can build on their success by adapting the same format to new content .
Let ’s say one of your most popular posts was a list of ways to make money with eBay .
You could capitalize on the success of the first article by creating an updated version ( 25 More Ways to Make Money With eBay ) , or invert the format by taking the opposite tack ( 25 Ways to Guarantee You ’ll Lose Money With eBay ) and outlining don’ts rather than dos .
Another effective strategy is to apply the same post format and headline formula to a new subject .
Your list of 10 Insane Firefox Extensions for Web Designers could be followed by a list of 10 Insane Firefox Extensions for Entrepreneurs , or Journalists , or anything / anyone you can imagine ( as long as it ’s of interest to your target audience ) .
The crux of this strategy lies in combining what has worked well previously with something fresh , new and interesting .

Apes photographed having face - to - face sex in the wild .
Caught on camera : Leah and George in a face - to - face romantic session .
Thomas Breuer – WCS / MPI-EVA
Western gorillas ( Gorilla gorilla ) copulating in the wild have only ever been seen facing the same way as each other , front to back .
But in a forest clearing in the Nouabale - Ndoki National Park in the Republic of Congo , a female gorilla , Leah , and her groups ’ dominant male silverback , George , have been photographed in the face - to face position .
This type of behaviour has only ever been seen in the wild in the bonobo ( Pan paniscus ) , as well as a single , brief , unphotographed observation in mountain gorillas ( G. beringei ) .
In captivity , gorillas often have sex face - to - face , but it is difficult to draw conclusions about ape behaviour from these animals ; they are brought up in a very different environment in captivity , says Thomas Breuer , from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology , Leipzig , Germany .
Doubly famous
Leah has been seen displaying extraordinary behaviour before — in 2005 she was spotted using a stick as a tool to test the depth of a lake .
( see Gorillas branch out into tool use )
But this double - dose of fame is unlikely to be because Leah is particularly special , says Breuer .
Instead , it is probably because she is one of only three females in a group of gorillas that has been watched closely for the past 13 years by scientists from the Wildlife Conservation Society .
The scientists tend to get ' snapshots ' of the gorillas ' behaviour , says Breuer , as the animals can be seen clearly only in open areas .
“ 99 % of the time they spend in the forest , ” he says .
So it is hard to know whether this face - to - face encounter is normal in other environmental conditions .
ADVERTISEMENT
The swampy clearing where the gorillas had their tête - à - tête might be the reason for the unusual sexual position , says Breuer — the swamp acts as a sort of water - bed , forcing the gorillas to behave in unusual ways , such as walking upright rather than on all fours .
Did Leah and George know they were being watched ?
The gorillas are aware of the observation platform up in the trees , says Breuer , but seem mostly undisturbed by the scientists ’ presence .

Using software created by an Alberta company , you can get a second computer in your house this holiday season free .
In fact , the software is capable of splitting your PC into 10 , saving you money and saving the environment at the same time .
Digital Journal -- Canadian company
The software turns one computer into many , allowing a single computer box to support multiple users at the same time .
All you need to do is connect an extra monitor , USB keyboard and mouse to your run -of - the - mill computer box , and the Desktop Multiplier software will make it possible for two people to work on the same PC at the same time .
The reason Userful is giving away its software is to prove an environmental point and show just how much " un - tapped value lies hidden in today 's desktop PCs , " as their company
In an email interview with DigitalJournal.com , Userful 's marketing and PR manager , Sean Rousseau , said , " Desktop multiplier works so efficiently because it only copies the necessary portions of the operating system while sharing the rest between each user .
However from a user 's perspective it appears that both have their own independent PC since their actions and files are completely private and separate from each other . "
As for the legality of splitting the operating system to work with multiple users , Rousseau also noted Userful 's Desktop Multiplier runs on the open source Linux operating system , so turning one computer into two is perfectly legal .
In fact , Userful 's software will allow you to create up to 10 independent workstations from a single physical computer tower .
The software is currently used around the world in schools , libraries , hotels , and other businesses .
The software manages up to 10 PCs through a central Web portal .
For a detailed diagram of how it works , " Most of what happens in an office -- word processing , internet , spreadsheets , etc. --- uses very little of the computing power of modern PC's , " said Rousseau .
" We figured there must be a more efficient way to use our computers and so we developed the technology to have up to 10 of our employees working from a single computer simultaneously .
It worked so well that we decided to share it with the world . "
The company was founded in 1999 and is currently privately held .
Userful was named Alberta 's 10th fastest growing company earning under $ 20 million in revenue .
Userful says its software has led to " huge savings " for businesses and individuals by reducing the number of PCs one needs to purchase .
The company says turning one computer into 10 can cut as much as 70 per cent from a business 's hardware investment .
The idea of splitting a computer between multiple people certainly sounds great for IT departments everywhere , so we wondered if the system would be bogged down by up to 10 people using a single computer 's processing power .
" How much it slows down your computer depends largely on how fast your computer is and what you plan on using the computer for , " said Rousseau .
" For an example of what you can do we recently tried overloading one of our 10 user stations just to see if we could .
All 10 had office programs and email open , they each had multiple YouTube videos playing , and six of them were playing RuneScape all at the same time without any slowdowns at all . "
In addition to cost savings , Userful is also finding an innovative way to be green in the PC market .
It says 10 monitors , mice and keyboards on a single computer reduces CO2 emissions by up to 15 tones per year per system .
According to the company , in the last year their software has saved more than 13,250 tons of CO2 emissions , the equivalent of taking 2,300 cars off the road .
In addition , it also saves you money because using one physical computer ( rather than two ) cuts down on your electricity bill , and it reduces hardware and support cost .
A group of kids laugh and pose for a photo beside a network that employs Userful software , allowing one computer to be turned into 10 .
Userful is also helping out in another green space , as its software cuts back on computer waste :
With an estimated 20 million PCs becoming obsolete in the U.S. each year , Userful says e-waste contains lead , mercury , cadmium , and many other toxic and bio-accumulative compounds that can compromise water and air quality .
By sharing the same box , Desktop Multiplier reduces electronic waste by up to 80 per cent .
The current promotion comes with free two - user licences , so all you need is an extra video card ( or a card that enables two monitors to be plugged in ) , a USB keyboard and a mouse .
The company says the download will not affect any software on your hard disk .
So why is the company giving its software away for free ?
Rousseau told DigitalJournal.com : " We are giving this software away for personal use only because it is our hope that people will realise what an amazing product it is and recommended the commercial version to their workplace .
It is free forever , enjoy ! "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Mary - Jo Criswell wants to vote in the November elections but is not sure if she will be able to , because of one barrier :
She does not have government - issued photo identification .
Voters would have to show a photo ID under an Indiana law being reviewed by the Supreme Court .
An Indiana state requirement , which opponents say could lock Criswell and potentially thousands of others out of the electoral process , will come before the U.S. Supreme Court in oral arguments Wednesday .
At issue is whether state laws designed to stem voter fraud end up discriminating against large groups of minority and poor Americans , who might lack proper identification .
The experience of Criswell , a 71 - year - old Democrat , was cited as part of a lawsuit before the justices .
It says that voter identification laws discourage and intimidate large groups of Americans from going to the polls .
It is perhaps the biggest voter rights case taken up by the court since the 2000 dispute over Florida 's ballots .
The current issue raises important constitutional questions but also involves race and hot - button partisan politics .
The appeals involve an Indiana law , passed by the Republican - controlled legislature in 2005 , requiring that a voter present a photo ID when casting a ballot in person .
Previously , citizens needed only to sign a poll book to vote .
State and federal courts around the country have issued conflicting rulings on voter ID laws .
Missouri 's law was found unconstitutional , but similar ones in Georgia , Arizona and Michigan were found to be proper .
Officials in Indiana justify their law , which a federal appeals court upheld .
" The real question is , does it disenfranchise anyone ? " asked Indiana Secretary of State Todd Rokita .
" After six elections in the state of Indiana , the answer has been no .
...
That 's why the opponents to this keep losing in court .
They have not been able to produce the person that was truly disenfranchised yet . "
Civil rights activists and the state Democratic Party complain Indiana 's law is the most restrictive in the nation , an effort by Republican leaders to reduce turnout among minority voters , many of whom might vote Democratic .
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union are among the groups that filed suit .
They said there was no evidence of recent voter fraud in Indiana that justified the new law .
Donna Brazile , who chairs the Democratic National Committee 's Voting RIghts Institute , offers a simple analogy for the Indiana requirement , calling it " a modern - day version of the poll tax . "
" The voter ID scam is a suppression tactic used by many people to undermine the right to vote in this country , " said Brazile , who managed Al Gore 's 2000 presidential run and is also a CNN political contributor .
Liberal activists said laws such as this one help Republicans by keeping many voters away who might be inclined to vote Democratic , an allegation state and national leaders strongly deny .
" I think it pits kind of two philosophical camps , " said Edward Lazarus , a Supreme Court legal analyst and author of a book on the justices .
" Those who think a certain amount of partisan maneuvering , with respect to voting rules , is something that is just part of the American way ... and others who are going to view the right to vote as something extraordinarily sacrosanct , where equal access to the ballot -- for everyone from the poorest person to the richest , in the absence of some real evidence of fraud -- is something that should be protected . "
Criswell 's circumstances were cited when the case was heard in the lower courts .
She had always used a private bank - issued card with her photo when voting .
The onetime precinct committeewoman had difficulty rebuilding an identity trail and still lacks a photo ID acceptable under the new law .
Indiana officials argue the Bureau of Motor Vehicles is required to provide free photo ID cards to anyone who asks and that voter turnout has increased 2 percent since the law took effect .
But Rokita concedes the state has never presented a case of " voter impersonation , " which the law purportedly was designed to fight .
Indiana argues the state has the responsibility to clamp down on the problem before it happens , to prevent any election from being tainted after the fact .
The Republican National Committee has made the voter fraud issue a prominent feature of public outreach .
A large section of the party 's Web site is devoted to allegations of ballot tampering around the country .
In a sign of the political stakes involved , at least 35 political and advocacy groups have filed amicus briefs supporting one side or the other .
State laws on voter identification vary widely , with Indiana 's and Georgia 's considered the most restrictive .
Nearly all states require a photo identification when people first register to vote .
The Supreme Court already has heard two election - related appeals this term .
One involves Washington state 's open primary system , and the other is a dispute over the selection of state judges in New York .
A ruling in the Indiana case is expected by late June -- in time , perhaps , for states to revise their laws for the November elections , if required .

This is a tale of two neighbours : one on the brink of national disaster , unless mediation can prevent a new wave of ethnic killing ; the other already in full - scale collapse , with no functioning government or basic services , and 700,000 people driven from their homes .
The first is being watched attentively by foreign governments ; the second has dropped off the radar , abandoned by those same governments because it all seems so difficult .
I refer to Kenya and Somalia , countries that illustrate the inconsistencies in international policy - making David Miliband failed to reflect in his speech on interventionism this week .
Long - standing economic injustices , grievances over land and water , ethnic and clan discrimination , and chronic under - development cannot be corrected by sudden surges of interest and moral fervour .
They need decades of subtle care and unflagging attention .
Kenya 's case is the more hopeful .
Kofi Annan , the former UN secretary general , and a team of UN advisers have been talking to both sides in a secluded safari lodge to find a power - sharing formula after December 's flawed presidential election .
This is intelligent intervention , impartial and headline - avoiding .
Foreign governments are taking a back seat .
The US initially favoured President Mwai Kibaki on the false grounds that the Kikuyu have always been the best motor for Kenya 's progress .
It also disliked the fact that Raila Odinga , the opposition leader , condemned the way suspects in the " war on terror " were subject to " extraordinary rendition " .
But now Washington is standing aside , Britain too is lying low , wary of the charge of neocolonial interference .
Whether Annan can get agreement when the talks resume next week remains to be seen .
Though the evidence points to Odinga winning the election - his party won two - thirds of the seats in the simultaneous and less riggable parliamentary elections - his side has made the larger concessions .
It has dropped its insistence on Kibaki standing down , and its demands for an early re-run of the stolen election , and is considering the Annan proposal for a two - year pause .
It has hinted at readiness to split the ministries in a coalition cabinet 50 - 50 .
A deal on these lines will be tough for Odinga to sell , especially as Kibaki reneged on a 2002 deal to reduce the power of the presidency and create a prime minister .
" Kibaki 's problem is with his elite , Odinga 's is with his base , " as one observer put it this week .
Any agreement Annan comes up with must be anchored in law and some form of continuing UN supervision .
The anti-Kikuyu anger and killings that swept through parts of the Rift Valley last month could explode again if people feel Odinga has given up too much .
So another part of the deal should be a carefully monitored role for the Kenyan army to forestall rioting - a necessary but risky proposition , since the army is poorly trained for crowd control .
If Kenya 's eruption into violence shocked the world by being unexpected , Somalia 's collapse was fully foreseen .
As many experts warned , US collusion with Ethiopia a year ago to send Ethiopian troops into Mogadishu to topple the Islamic Courts regime has backfired as badly as the invasion of Iraq .
According to reports from UN and other aid workers in Somalia , almost three - quarters of a million people have fled since the Ethiopians arrived .
Far from eliminating the Islamic Courts , the invasion attracted waves of new recruits , motivated by resentment at the presence of foreign troops and not just by jihadi ideology .
The Ethiopians installed one of the worst Somali warlords as mayor of Mogadishu , allowing him to turn his militia into the police .
Most of the capital 's people are from a different clan .
Resistance has intensified in the past months as the occupation shows no sign of ending , and Islamist insurgents now operate well beyond Mogadishu .
Indiscriminate mortaring and machine - gun fire by all sides is said by aid workers to be horrendous , though there are no TV cameras to raise international alarm .
Adding to the chaos , insurgent groups are splitting - with the same erosion of discipline and clan rivalry that have divided rebel movements in Darfur .
This reduces the chance of holding successful peace talks .
Banditry is on the rise with aid workers increasingly targets , as last month 's killing of three staff for Médecins sans Frontières demonstrates .
MSF has now withdrawn all its international doctors , leaving hospitals without surgeons .
Meanwhile , Somalia 's Transitional Federal Government ( TFG ) still sits in the town of Baidoa , with no presence in the capital except for a fortified and symbolic mini - green zone .
What little support the TFG had in Mogadishu has disappeared .
In November , fighting prompted another 200,000 people to escape into the desert , meaning that more than half the capital 's population has left .
In a grim reversal of urbanisation , they know it is safer to live outside Mogadishu .
Only the poorest and weakest remain inside the ruined city .
Here is a catastrophe crying out for sustained and well - funded UN intervention .
It would not be a case of overthrowing a government , since there is none .
It is not an issue of using " soft power " or sanctions against a bad regime .
It is a blatant example of a massive humanitarian emergency , to which the so - called international community is content to turn a blind eye .
The TFG was cobbled together by foreign governments , knowing its legitimacy was thin .
They tolerated the Ethiopian invasion because Washington wanted it .
Now these governments stumble on , bereft of ideas , privately glad that the media do not highlight the issue so their inaction can continue .
Under an African Union mandate , Uganda and Burundi have sent a few hundred troops ( their airlift paid in part by Britain ) , but Rwanda pulled out and Nigeria stalled .
Now Ban Ki-moon , the UN secretary general , has sent a mission to assess if a more powerful UN force can replace the discredited invaders .
But will the big powers back him in urgently alleviating the present misery ?
Will they recognise their earlier mistake and find a political compromise ?
Demonising all the Islamists as terror - mongers makes no sense and will not bring peace .
Talks between the TFG and the Islamists are the only way out .
In Kenya , there is at least mediation and a chance of compromise .
In Somalia , there is nothing on offer because the security council got it wrong and has all but given up .
The havoc on Wall Street following the collapse of the subprime - mortgage market boils down to a simple truth : for years , lots of very smart people took lots of very foolish risks , betting borrowed billions on dubious mortgage derivatives , and eventually the odds caught up with them .
But behind that simple truth is a more surprising one : the financial whizzes made bad decisions in part because that ’s what they were paid to do .
CHRISTOPH NIEMANN
Not literally , of course .
The way that hedge - fund managers and investment - bank C.E.O.s get paid is supposed to make them perform better for the investors they serve .
Hedge - fund managers , for instance , typically are paid “ 2 and 20 ” : they get two per cent of total assets as a management fee , and they keep twenty per cent of their investment gains ( above some agreed - upon benchmark ) .
Letting hedge - fund managers keep a chunk of their winnings gives them an incentive to do well for their clients : in theory , they get rich only if their clients do .
In practice , though , things do n’t always work that way .
Fund managers get bonuses at the end of each year , and they keep those performance fees even if the fund eventually goes south .
So if a billion - dollar hedge fund rises twenty per cent in its first year and falls twenty per cent in its second , its investors will have lost money , while the fund ’s manager might earn forty million dollars in performance fees .
Hedge funds do have a rule that ’s meant to deal with this problem : when a fund loses money , it yields no performance bonus until investors get back to even .
The catch is that nothing prevents a hedge - fund manager from simply shutting down after a bad year and walking away with the fees he ’s already accrued .
Sometimes this happens out of necessity : the two subprime - focussed funds at Bear Stearns whose closure precipitated this summer ’s market mayhem had seen their assets annihilated .
But sometimes it happens because a manager has no incentive to keep supervising a fund that wo n’t generate a decent performance fee .
In either case , the managers keep what they ’ve earned and investors are left holding the bag .
In short , a hedge - fund manager can do a lousy job and still become very wealthy .
Because fund managers reap large rewards on the upside without a correspondingly punitive downside , they have a much greater incentive to take big risks than ordinary investors do .
Hedge funds generally leverage their bets with large amounts of borrowed cash — one Bear Stearns fund , for instance , borrowed ten times its capital — which makes it possible for them to turn small gains into enormous ones .
Of course , leverage can also turn small losses into enormous ones .
That helps explain why bad bets by hedge funds have been at the heart of the biggest financial - market meltdowns of the past decade .
A similar tendency to underplay risk is at work in parts of corporate America , thanks to the ubiquity of stock options .
Options , which give executives the opportunity to buy company stock at a predetermined “ strike price ” within a certain period , seem like an ideal tool for insuring that a C.E.O. cares as much about the company ’s stock price as his shareholders do .
The problem is that if a company ’s stock price is below the options ’ strike price when they expire those options become valueless — and they ’re just as valueless whether the stock price is a dollar below the strike price or fifteen dollars below it .
To a shareholder , the difference between a stock that ’s at thirty dollars and a stock that ’s at twenty means a lot .
But to a C.E.O. who has a pile of options with a strike price of thirty - one dollars , the difference means much less .
As a result , that C.E.O. is likely to embrace projects that promise big rewards , even if they also entail a significant chance of failure .
Not surprisingly , a recent study of almost a thousand companies by the management professors W. Gerard Sanders and Donald Hambrick found that C.E.O.s whose compensation was made up mostly of stock options tended to “ swing for the fences , ” making investments and acquisitions that were riskier than those made by other executives .
As a result , the performance of the companies run by the risk - takers was far more volatile , and not for the good of the companies : the risky strategies were more likely to end in a big failure than a big gain .
Generous options grants may also encourage fraud ; the business professors Jared Harris and Philip Bromiley , who have made a study of hundreds of firms forced to restate earnings after accounting irregularities , found that companies that paid out most of their compensation in stock options were far more likely to end up restating earnings .
And , as with hedge funds , the perverse effects of performance pay are exacerbated by the fact that big bonuses are often based on short - term performance .
Stanley O’Neal , who was recently forced to resign as the C.E.O. of Merrill Lynch , made eighty - four million dollars in 2005 and 2006 , a figure based in part on the huge profits that Merrill booked as a result of its forays into the subprime market .
Last week , thanks to those same forays , Merrill announced giant losses and writedowns that obliterated most of those profits .
O’Neal , however , wo n’t be giving any money back .
One lesson of the current market chaos , then , is that it ’s hard to get incentives right .
Investors , after all , want fund managers and corporate executives to take reasonable risks — that ’s the only way to make money — and many of them do just that .
But , in trying to reward reasonable risks , we ’ve encouraged unreasonable ones as well .
And when you make it rational for people to bet the house , you may end up without a roof over your head . ♦
CIA Corrects Itself ; U.K. Territory Was Used in Rendition U.K. territory was used as a stopover point for planes transporting detainees .
Feb. 21 , 2008  --
In a serious embarrassment to the CIA 's official record on rendition flights , the agency acknowledged today that a U.K. territory was twice used as a stopover point for planes transporting terror detainees , in contradiction to previous statements that the U.K. was not involved .
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw had repeatedly told the British Parliament that neither U.K. airspace nor land was used in the U.S. rendition program .
But today the U.K. government announced that it had been informed by the U.S. that a U.K. territory in the Indian Ocean was twice used as a refueling point for flights carrying suspected terrorists .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the U.K. was not aware of these flights until being notified recently by the U.S. that they had occurred .
The correction is bound to cause tension between the U.S. and the U.K. , and Miliband said he 's already spoken to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice about the error .
" We both agree that the mistakes made in these two cases are not acceptable , and she shares my deep regret that this information has only just come to light , " said Miliband .
" She emphasized to me that the U.S. government came to us with this information quickly after they discovered it . "
CIA Director Mike Hayden sent a statement to agency employees this morning confirming that indeed the agency 's earlier statements " supplied in good faith , turned out to be wrong . "
Director Hayden wrote that after the agency took a fresh look at its records , the mistake was discovered .
" That we found the mistake ourselves , and that we brought it to the attention of the British Government , in no way changes or excuses the reality that we were in the wrong , " wrote Hayden .
In his e-mail , Hayden said that the U.K. territory known as Diego Garcia was twice used as a refueling stop for rendition flights in 2002 .
Neither of the detainees aboard each flight , according to Hayden , was a high - value terrorist .
One was transferred to Guantanamo , and the other was returned to his home country .
The statement also noted that Diego Garcia was never used as a holding facility for terror detainees and that the prisoners were not transferred for the purpose of torture .
" Torture is against our law and values , " wrote Hayden .

Soldier faces threats from military after refusing anthrax vaccine Julie Weisberg

A soldier serving in Iraq who is stationed in Baghdad says he has faced threats  and intimidation from his Army superiors  including the possibility of forced inoculations  after he refused to take the militarys controversial anthrax vaccine .
Private First Class Leif Hamre , 22 , is currently serving out a Field Grade Article 15 , a non-judicial punishment for disciplinary offenses , for refusing to take the Pentagons anthrax vaccine , BioThrax , earlier this summer .
According to Hamre , 22 , the military gave him an ultimatum in late June : Either take the mandated six - shot anthrax series or face military punishment .
He was given 24 hours to decide .
After conducting several hours of research into the drug and its history of triggering serious adverse reactions , the Minnesota native concluded that the vaccine was dangerous and should probably still be in a lab right now for further testing .
He decided to refuse it .
In March , RAW STORY revealed that Walter Reed is investigating links between the vaccine and life - threatening autoimmune diseases .
Hundreds of US servicemembers have refused the shots , fearing the side - effects experienced by some 80 percent of the soldiers who receive them , according to a 2002 General Accountability Office report .
But the Army has not taken Hamres no as its final answer .
 The tactics they have used to coerce me into taking the shot are unregulated , unscrupulous and downright un-American ,  Hamre wrote in a recent open letter to family , friends and others who are campaigning against the military s mandatory anthrax vaccine program .
 They have tried to turn my platoon against me in various ways ( which is not totally unsuccessful ) .
Along with the more common tactics like intimidation and threats ( including the possibility of a forceful inoculation ) .
I can only imagine what will come as I continue with this .
During a recent interview with RAW STORY , Hamres mother , Mary , said that after her son refused the anthrax shot series he was assigned extra duty , taken off missions , significantly dropped in rank and pay scale , and confined to a certain area on the base  all while working an 18 - hour work day , seven days a week .
Making matters even worse , she said , is the difficulty the family has had in trying to communicate with Leif since he refused the shots .
Baghdad remains a volatile and unstable city , and the electricity is still very unreliable , frequently cutting in and out , and is only on for certain portions of the day .
Hamre is pictured with Iraqis at right .
This has made speaking over the telephone to Leif sporadic at best , leaving the family to interact with him through a MySpace page .
Facing the possibility that he could be permanently dismissed from the military because of his refusal to take the anthrax vaccine has been hard on her son , Mary said , especially since Leif has been proud to serve his country and follow in the footsteps of his father , who also was in the Army .
Mary , 55 , lives in Minnesota and works as a massage therapist .
 They try to break them down ... but someone has got to take a stand ,  she said .
The Army did not respond to repeated requests for comment , even after several extensions .
A troubled vaccine BioThrax is the only FDA - licensed vaccine for anthrax in the United States .
The Pentagon has used it for the militarys mandatory anthrax vaccination program for the last ten years .
Although the military continues to publicly claim the vaccine is safe and effective ,  thousands of soldiers have suffered adverse reactions .
The vaccines troubled history has made many soldiers wary of the required inoculations .
 It is natural for people to be concerned with medicines they are not familiar with ,  Col. Randall G. Anderson , director of the Military Vaccine Program , said in an email to RAW STORY last week .
 The DoD continues to educate our forces with a variety of products , such as individual briefings and trifold pamphlets . 
 Additionally , there is a great variety of medical misinformation available on the Internet ,  he continued .
 That is why the DoD focuses on providing facts about the disease and vaccine , based on science from credible organizations like the Institutes of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and prevention . 
A federal judge ruled in 2004 that the militarys mandatory administration of the vaccine was illegal because the Food and Drug Administration had not approved its use for inhalation anthrax , only for anthrax contracted through the skin .
After FDA approval , the judge allowed voluntary injections .
The Defense Department resumed mandatory shots again in March .
The Pentagon continues to defend its efficacy and safety .
 I 'll say once again , the vaccine is safe and effective ,  former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs William Winkenwerder said last year .
The Pentagon , however , has at least four separate research studies investigating the vaccines often debilitating side effects .
And even BioPorts insurance company , Evanston Insurance , has questioned the products safety .
Last December , Evanston filed suit against BioPort in federal court for what it termed BioPorts material misrepresentations ,  alleging that the pharmaceutical company knew about but failed to disclose incidents , conditions , circumstances , defects , or suspected defects  related to the vaccines safety .
Evanston has assisted and reimbursed the company for legal costs associated with BioPorts defending itself against numerous lawsuits filed by service members who claim they have been seriously injured by BioThrax .
BioPort initially filed a motion to dismiss the case , but that motion was denied earlier this year , and the case continues to move forward in the Michigan federal court system .
Cause of vaccines side effects unknown
It remains unclear what within the drug is triggering such severe autoimmune reactions in many of the soldiers who take it .
The Army has yet to publish any information or findings related to its several research studies on the vaccines adverse reactions .
Although some have pointed to previous problems with the vaccines manufacturing process and stability , many feel the more likely culprit is the use of the experimental adjuvant -- or immune enhancer -- squalene .
Traces of squalene were found in several batches of the anthrax vaccine several years ago .
Squalene , an oil - based adjuvant that is often used to boost the effectiveness of experimental vaccines at Army and NIH research centers , has not yet been approved by the FDA for use in public vaccines because of safety concerns .
The adjuvant is frequently used by researchers to deliberately trigger severe autoimmune reactions in mice and other animals for research projects .
Hamre said when he began asking his own questions about the vaccine and how it is stored at his Baghdad bases medical aid station , he not only found that the clinic was violating the Armys own implementation standards regarding storage temperatures , but met stiff resistance to his queries from superiors .
 The result of asking questions today about a quality control issue with their storing equipment got me more than a few dirty looks and even an under - the - rug threat to my safety ,  Hamre wrote .
Mother defends sons decision
Although his mother said his future in the military is uncertain , Hamre said it is important for him to continue to refuse the vaccine and question its necessity , safety and efficacy , in hopes his struggle will make a difference in protecting the well - being and health of future Americans who choose to serve their country .
 I believe as an American soldier you are expected to follow orders and put yourself in harms way but unnecessary safety risks should not be part of the accepted risks one is asked to face ,  Hamre wrote .
 We are being forced to accept chemicals into our already weary bodies that have caused the suffering of thousands of individuals ; of course those people are easily dismissed by the government because they took a  safe drug . 
 One thing bothers me , though ,  he added .
 I am an American citizen too , with rights I thought we were fighting to protect .
Leif entered the Army when he was 20 , which was two years this July .
He is scheduled to conclude his service in the autumn of 2008 .
His unit , however , is slated to rotate out of Iraq and return home in December , where they will be stationed in Anchorage , Alaska .
Leif will serve in Alaska until his term is up next year .
Part of that is genetic and part is familiarity with the exercise .
The more familiar you are with an exercise , the fewer calories you use at the same level of effort , he found in a research study .
Subjects rode stationary bicycles six days a week for 12 weeks .
They ended up burning 10 percent fewer calories at a given level of effort after their training .
The reason , he said , is that people perform an exercise more efficiently as they become more accustomed to it .
There also is a seldom mentioned complication in calculating calories burned during exercise : you should subtract off the number of calories you would be using if you did nothing .
Almost no one does that , Dr. Bouchard said .
But for moderate exercise , the type most people do , subtracting the resting metabolic rate can eliminate as much as 30 percent of the calories you think you used , he added .
Resting metabolic rates , though , differ from individual to individual and also differ depending on age , gender , body mass , body composition and level of fitness , so guessing at your resting rate also is fraught with error .
Even if you wanted to get a rough estimate of the calories an average person your size might burn at the gym , you might not want to trust the displays on cardio machines , with the possible exception of treadmills , said William Haskell , an exercise physiologist at Stanford .
And with treadmills , the calories are not accurate if you hang on the bars .
Dr. Haskell once studied people using treadmills .
Hanging onto the rails reduced the number of calories burned by 40 to 50 percent .
The same thing happened with stair - climbing machines .
“ I ’ve seen people hanging on stair climbers who think they are doing 1,200 calories an hour , ” Dr. Haskell said .
“ They probably are doing 600 calories an hour . ”
As for the calorie counts on machines like stationary bicycles and elliptical cross trainers and stair climbers , all bets are off , researchers said .
In the span of just two weeks , Google has launched two major open source efforts with a ragtag group of partners , both without any obvious or immediate payoff for Google itself .
It 's a classic move : A giant company , looking to dominate a market where it has little presence , spins out an ostensibly collaborative project that it hopes will give it a foot in the door .
IBM , Sun , Novell and even Microsoft have all played the open source card this way in the past , with varying degrees of success .
In Google 's case , the potential payoff is huge , albeit in the distant future , and the immediate risks are low .
In the best - case scenario , Google gains entrance to lucrative mobile and social - networking markets .
Worst case ?
Its collaborative projects fade into irrelevance with little damage to Google 's reputation or bottom line .
Google 's first open source play , OpenSocial , is an interoperable toolkit for building social networking apps .
It aims to make the lives of widget and app developers a little easier .
At the same time it lets Google indirectly challenge its major social networking competitor : Facebook .
The other open project , which comprises a group of handset makers , carriers and silicon manufacturers , is dubbed the Open Handset Alliance .
It centers around a new , Linux - based mobile operating system for smartphones , called Android .
It 's Google 's long - awaited play for the mobile space .
For its own part , the Mountain View , California , company remains tight - lipped ( or at least purposefully vague ) about the underlying business strategies behind both efforts .
But one thing is clear : Google is using its clout to pave new roads into two of the hottest technology destinations today : social networking and the mobile internet .
Many are suspicious of Google 's motivations – and even of its use of the open source approach .
Mozilla 's chief operating officer John Lilly warns that just because Google happens to be using the term " open " in both of its initiatives , that does n't necessarily make them so .
" For [ Mozilla ] , the real test of ' open ' does n't speak to source code or even alliances , " Lilly says of his nonprofit organization .
" It 's about shared leadership and shared decision - making . "
On that front , Lilly says it 's still too early to tell if the OHA or OpenSocial will prove to be truly collaborative efforts .
" You have Google releasing a lot of source code under an open alliance , " Lilly says , " but can other companies have a say in what shape the project ultimately takes ? "
Google , of course , is n't the first tech giant to tinker with open source projects .
IBM , for example , released its programming environment , Eclipse , under an open source license in 2001 .
The platform has gone on to become a major industry standard and has helped IBM compete with Microsoft more effectively for developers ' hearts and minds .
For the OHA , the fragmented and dysfunctional mobile market is an opportunity ripe for the picking .
" No one will deny that the ( mobile ) ecosystem , in many ways , was broken , " says Richard Miner , a key member of Android 's technical staff .
" I think carriers realize that there 's a need for a more - open platform that 's easily accessible .
People will see that you can have it open and support other initiatives and other business models . "
Chris Hazelton , a senior analyst for IDC 's mobile devices group , agrees with Miner , and says Google seems to be on the right track with the OHA and Android .
" This is a vastly underserved space now , and by creating its own platform , Google 's Android could be huge , " says Hazelton .
Despite dismissive comments from the likes of Symbian , ARM and Microsoft , this was a canny move , Hazelton says of the OHA .
" This was a very smart play in a very complicated market , " Hazelton says , adding that partnerships are key in the mobile industry .
Currently , there 's no dominant mobile OS in the United States .
While Symbian has a huge market share internationally , it has n't taken root stateside , Hazelton says .
And in that sense , the mere announcement of Android gives Google a huge advantage in terms of mindshare .
Going open source with Android also gives Google an advantage with carriers .
Despite the absence of big players like AT&T and Verizon in the OHA , many carriers are starting to realize that Google can drive data usage on mobile devices through the roof .
That potentially means more money for carriers .
But Hazelton still warns that despite open - sourcing its development , Android will likely take years to evolve into something competitive , even with the Google alliance in place .
" This is not an overnight thing , " he says .
" The smartphone market is rapidly growing when compared to the rest of the mobile market .
In a couple years , Google 's Android could be pretty successful because of this open strategy .
But even if Android does n't take off , or there is n't a big enough commitment , what will happen is , the smartphone will still evolve . "
And there 's little doubt that people will use their smartphones , Android - based or not , to access their favorite Google applications , the Google search page and web pages carrying Google advertising .
In other words , for Google , it 's a win -win situation .

Amongst all the media teeth - gnashing over the question of whether McCain did special favors for his blondie lobbyist , his wife ’s sweetheart deal for massive narcotics theft in the 1990s has been forgotten .
If a poor black woman from Anacostia had committed the crimes that Cindy McCain committed , the black woman might have been sent to prison for the duration of her life .
John McCain has never shown any courage on the drug war .
As long as people like his wife do n’t need to fear jail time for crimes , there is no reason to reform the law to cease the persecution of other Americans .
Here are the details from an article I wrote for Playboy in 1997 .
The McCain excerpt is about a third of the way down , in bold .
Re-reading the article , it is from a whole different era — one in which it was acceptable to joke about hanging politicians .

PRISON SENTENCES OF THE POLITICALLY CONNECTED
by James Bovard
Justice has a double standard
God bless the war on drugs .
It has given us rhetorical overkill : politicians calling for drug users to be taken out and shot .
Who can forget when former drug czar William Bennett endorsed the beheading of drug dealers ?
It has also given us a new scheme of family values and tough love : Uncle Sam–not father–knows best .
If you ca n’t keep your kids off drugs , the government will .
Washington has churned out law after law mandating harsher penalties and longer prison terms for anyone involved with illicit substances .
The war on drugs has resulted in the imprisonment of more than 300,000 people during the past decade .
In 1995 the average federal sentence for “ low - level ” drug - trafficking offenders , according to the Department of Justice , was 70.5 months ( of which a prisoner will typically serve nearly five years ) .
The war on drugs has destroyed families across the nation or , should we say , it has destroyed some families .
For all the tough talk and tough love , what happens when the wayward sons , daughters and spouses of politicians run afoul of the law ?
As many well - connected Washingtonians suddenly remember , sometimes the highest element of justice is mercy .
* In June 1993 Richard Riley Jr. , son of Education Secretary Richard Riley , received a sentence of six months ’ house arrest for conspiring to sell up to 25 grams of cocaine and 100 grams of marijuana .
Seven months earlier Riley had been indicted by a federal grand jury in Greenville , South Carolina and charged , along with 18 others , with distributing cocaine and marijuana , conspiring to possess cocaine and marijuana and conspiring to possess those drugs with the intent to distribute them .
The initial charges carried a penalty often years to life in prison .
Riley ’s light sentence allowed him to continue his work at an environmental consulting firm , helping to do good deeds and save the world .
Riley Sr. has since become one of the most prominent antidrug spokesmen of the Clinton administration .
* In June 1990 Gayle Rosten , the daughter of then - House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D - III . ) , was busted and charged with possession of 29 grams of cocaine with intent to deliver .
Rosten could have been sentenced to up to 15 years in prison , but she pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and instead was sentenced to three years ’ probation and 20 hours of public service .
She paid a fine of $ 2800 and forfeited the car in which the cocaine was found when she was arrested .
Three years later Rosten was busted again after police found a gram of cocaine in her possession ; her car had been searched after she allegedly ran a stop sign .
Since Rosten was still on probation from the earlier conviction , she could have been sentenced to up to three years in prison .
Chicago Narcotics Court Judge Oliver Spurlock dismissed the charge against Rosten , giving no reason for his decision to set her free .
The charge was reinstated after Rosten was indicted by a county grand jury .
On April 12 , 1994 Cook County Circuit Judge Michael Toomin ruled that the search of Rosten had been illegal , yet ruled that packets containing cocaine supposedly “ dropped ” by two passengers in her car was admissible evidence–against the passengers .
Rosten walked again .
* Cindy McCain , the wife of Senator John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , admitted stealing Percocet and Vicodin from the American Voluntary Medical Team , an organization that aids Third World countries .
Percocet and Vicodin are schedule 2 drugs , in the same legal category as opium .
Each pill theft carries a penalty of one year in prison and a monetary fine .
McCain stole the pills over several years .
She became addicted to the drugs after undergoing back surgery .
But rather than face prosecution , McCain was allowed to enter a pretrial diversion program and escaped with no blemish on her record .
McCain did suffer from the incident , though : Shortly after the scandal broke , a Variety Club of Arizona ceremony at which she was to receive a humanitarian of the year award for her work with the medical team was canceled because of poor ticket sales .
As one editorial writer in The Arizona Republic noted : “ Conservative Republicans seemed to achieve some sort of drug - rehab epiphany when Ms. McCain made her announcement .
Politicians who had never uttered a single positive sentence about drug- prevention , - rehabilitation or - diversion programs suddenly thought they were just fine .
Newspapers that often used words such as drug addict and thug as describing the same person suddenly had a new sensitivity to the problem .
It seems that when Bill Clinton proposes significant drug rehabilitation and diversion , it is called a failed social program of the Sixties .
When Cindy McCain needs one of those programs , they suddenly became an essential ingredient in fighting drug use . ”
* Dan Burton II , the 18 - year - old son of Representative Dan Burton ( R - Ind. ) , was busted in January 1994 in Louisiana on charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute while allegedly transporting seven pounds of pot in a car from Texas to Indiana .
According to the Baton Rouge Advocate , Burton and a friend “ [ allegedly ] told agents that they heard marijuana was cheap in Houston , where they allegedly purchased the pot .
The pair were coming from Houston , where they paid $ 6000 for the drugs . ”
Even though Burton was involved in an interstate crime , his case was handled solely by officials in Louisiana .
He pleaded guilty to felony charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute , and , instead of facing ten to 16 months in federal prison , Burton was sentenced to only five years ’ probation , 2000 hours of community service , three years of house arrest and random drug screening .
After the arrest was made public , Congressman Burton declared : “ Any time one of your children gets into this kind of trouble , it ’s horrible for the parents and for the whole family . ”
Five months later young Burton was busted again after police found 30 marijuana plants in his apartment in Indianapolis .
They also found a shotgun .
Under federal mandatory - minimum rules , that should have guaranteed him at least five years in federal prison , as well as a year or more for his arrest while on probation for a previous drug charge .
However , the case was again processed in the state system , where the penalties are significantly lighter .
In a federal case , 30 pot plants are the equiva- lent of three kilograms of dope .
State prosecutors decided that the total weight of the marijuana from the 30 plants was 25 grams , thus reducing the charge to a misdemeanor .
Under an agreement whereby Burton pleaded guilty to the charges in Louisiana , an Indiana prosecutor threw out all charges against him , saying , “ I did n’t see any sense in putting him on probation a second time . ”
Once again , Dan II walked –unlike the roughly 37,000 other Americans in prison for marijuana crimeS .
* In 1993 John Murtha , the 35 - year - old son of Representative John Murtha ( D - Pa. ) , received a sentence of 11 to 23 months in jail after pleading guilty to selling a gram of cocaine to a narc .
Murtha had been busted for two burglaries in 1980 and for armed robbery in 1985 .
He had served four years in prison and was on parole at the time of his arrest .
He could have faced more than ten years in prison if he ’d been prosecuted under federal guidelines .
Had the crime occurred in a “ three - strikes - and - you ’re - out ” state , he would have faced life imprisonment .
According to the Pittsburgh PostGazette , the judge allowed Murtha to temporarily withdraw a plea bargain and resubmit it at a later date so he could enter the jail ’s school - release program and continue his education .
The judge felt that a college degree would offer Murtha a Better chance at rehabilitation .
* On August 16 , 1991 Susan Gallo , the 33 - year - old daughter of Representative Dean Gallo ( R - N.J. ) , was busted for her supposed role in a drug ring that sold $ 16,000 worth of cocaine to narcotics agents .
Gallo was charged with five counts of cocaine possession , five counts of intent to distribute , five counts of distribution and five counts of conspiracy .
Each charge could have carried a sentence of five to ten years in prison .
In December 1991 she pleaded guilty to one count of distribution and one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine .
At the same time , her father announced she had just completed a drug - rehab program and was living in a halfway house .
The congressman announced , “ I ’m very proud of her effort to rehabilitate and her acknowledgment of the seriousness of her problem . ”
She was sentenced to five years ’ probation in September 1992 .
* Warren Bachus , the 19 - year - old son of Congressman Spencer Bachus ( R - Ala . ) , was busted on June 19 , 1993 for second - degree possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia .
Rather than being convicted and sentenced to jail , he was set free in a “ pretrial diversion remedy . ”
Bachus had to pay $ 56 in court expenses and was required to submit twice to drug testing in the following six months .
* In 1993 Josef Hinchey , the 26 - year - old son of Congressman Maurice Hinchey ( D - N.Y. ) , was busted along with more than a score of accomplices for allegedly running a drug ring in upstate New York .
Hinchey was accused of possession with intent to distribute individual cocaine doses , a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison Hinchey pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to 13 months in prison , with the term suspended until he completed a drug - treatment program .
* Perhaps the most special treatment was granted to the son of Vice President Al Gore .
It was reported in the foreign press that 13 - year - old Al Gore III was caught smoking what appeared to be marijuana by school authorities at the exclusive St. Alban ’s School .
Al III was suspended as a result of the offense while his father managed to suppress the story .
The Daily Telegraph of London noted : “ The crusading American media and Washington ’s political elite have closed ranks to protect Vice President Gore from embarrassment over his teenage son ’s indiscretion . ”
If what young Gore was smoking was indeed marijuana and he had been busted for possession , that could have resulted in fingerprinting , mug shots and a drug- possession conviction on his juvenile record .
If we are going to fight a war on drugs , we should at least demand fairness .
Let the children of the poor be judged by the same standard as the children of the rich and powerful .
Instead of sending regular citizens to jail under harsh mandatory - minimum sentencing guidelines , let every citizen qualify for house arrest , pretrial diversion , work - study programs , community service and probation .
Or hang all of them .
All politicians , that is .
It ’s amazing .
Just when you think there are no new depths of shamelessness and betrayal of trust to which the Bush administration can sink , they manage to sink deeper into unchartered infamy .
Hold on now , I ’m not even mad yet .
I ’m talking about the seventy seven percent cut in the medical assistance for 9/11 first responders in the current federal budget .
Gravely ill firemen , police , and other workers who labored at that site , workers who have come down with life threatening cancers and respiratory illnesses linked to their heroic efforts at ground zero are being shafted once again .
In the name of full disclosure , I am not writing this from some disinterested “ good citizen ” viewpoint .
I have a young nephew , John McNamarra , a heroic fireman who worked as a first responder at that site and who later volunteered for rescue work after Katrina in New Orleans .
For the past few years he has been suffering from various cancers resulting from that work for which he is currently under treatment at Sloan Kettering .
Last weekend he called me to talk about the government ’s new betrayal .
As the father of a one year old son , Jack , John is fighting the battle of his life , and there is no godly reason why men such as John have to fight the government as well for proper medical care and compensation .
One pill – yes one small pill that reduces the agonizing nausea of his chemotherapy costs as much as a thousand dollars .
Okay , I can rail about the greedy drug companies and their obscene profits , but my first concern is our government ’s ingratitude and cruelty , something which the congress must address and remedy to help all these men and women .
As Representative Carolyn Maloney writes , “ It ’s shocking that the president would use his final budget to take an axe to 9/11 health care programs . ”
Ms. Maloney is a wonderful representative but her use of shocking seems naïve .
Are you shocked ?
After Katrina ?
After Walter Reed ?
Not me .
I recall that first lie told by the federal government about the risk at ground zero to workers , one that came through the Bush mouthpiece , Christie Todd Whitman , then head of the Environmental Protection Agency , now a lobbyist for nuclear power .
This former New Jersey governor claimed that anyone in the area of ground zero , meaning not only the workers who worked in the rubble trying to rescue the buried and reclaim body parts , but the residents of the apartments in the area , were safe from the toxic fumes that filled the air for days , sometimes weeks .
According to a later report of the New York City Department of Health “ The collapse of the Twin Towers brought 200,000 tons of steel , 5,000 tons of asbestos , 12,000 miles of electric cables and 425,000 cubic yards of concrete crashing down into lower Manhattan …
The combustion produced a toxic cauldron of concrete , dust , glass fibers , and cancer - causing asbestos , as well as particles of lead , chlorine … 24 gallons of jet fuel , and burning plastics released carcinogens including dioxins etc . ”
As someone who lived more than eighty long city blocks north of ground zero I could smell the bitter , toxic air coming in through my bedroom window for days .
The first Bush betrayal was the unscientific , false reassurances which endangered so many ; and according to John and others , was not the result of ignorance but done by design .
It seems that the federal government and the city wanted to reopen Wall Street quickly , fearing the economic repercussions of 9/11 .
In order to do so they had to reassure the public that the area was safe , without having any scientific evidence that it was indeed safe .
So the health of many thousands was put at risk , thousands of ground zero workers and ordinary citizens who would have taken greater precautions to guard their lungs against these toxins had not the government told them that this was unnecessary .
How many babies living in that area at the time of 9/11 are doomed to serious lung disease in the future thanks to George W ’s reassurance ?
We wo n’t know about future ramifications until years from now , but right now there are thousands of people who might otherwise be healthy today who are suffering from some form of respiratory disease or cancer , thanks to the Bush government ’s criminal reassurance , and continuing negligence .
Over 3,000 firefighters sought respiratory treatment since 9/11 .
In the year after the attacks city firefighters as a group lost lung function equivalent to twelve years of aging .
There are other appalling statistics for the police and similar statistics for construction and iron workers .
I could go on , but we get lost in numbers , at least I do , and this is n’t about statistics , it ’s about simple justice for these men and women , medical and financial compensation , and human decency .
The decency part is not now possible .
We wo n’t get it as long as George W is president , and we can only hope that these valiant first responders will not be forgotten by the next administration .
When you add this to the atrocious way our wounded Iraqi soldiers and vets have been treated it is a panorama of governmental malfeasance verging on atrocity .
It is hard to forget that this is the Republican government that profited politically from the fear of terror brought on by 9/11 , both on the national level through Bush ’s red alert re-election , and on the local New York level in terms of that B movie ghoul who impersonates a human so ineptly , Rudy Giuliani ; a man who built his fortune on other men ’s misfortune from 9/11 .
ABC TV had scheduled a full report on the health crises faced by the first responders in 2007 .
But then that nut in the Philippines falsely confessed to the killing of Jon Benet Ramsey so that critical report was replaced by perp shots and the usual sad pictures of the murdered child in her beauty queen paraphernalia
The ABC in depth report on the 9/11 first responders and their health problems was never aired .
So much for the concerns of the MSM for anything but the last murder or the next scandal .
Despite collecting an estimated several hundred million dollars in P2P related settlements from the likes of Napster , KaZaA and Bolt , prominent artists ' managers are complaining that so far , they have n't received any compensation from the labels .
According to a lawyer , some are considering legal action .
When EMI , Universal Music and Warner music reached settlement agreements with the likes of Napster , KaZaA and Bolt , they collected hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation – money that was supposed to go to artists whose rights had been allegedly infringed upon when the networks were operating with unlicensed music .
Now , according to an article , the managers of some major artists are getting very impatient , as it appears the very people who were supposed to be compensated – the artists – have n’t received anything from the massive settlements .
They say the cash – estimated to be as much as $ 400 m – has n’t filtered through to their clients and understandably they ’re getting very impatient .
Lawyer John Branca , who has represented the likes of The Rolling Stones and Korn , said : “ Artist managers and lawyers have been wondering for months when their artists will see money from the copyright settlements and how it will be accounted for . ”
Indicating the levels of impatience with the big labels holding the money he added : “ Some of them are even talking about filing lawsuits if they do n’t get paid soon . ”
Of course , EMI , Universal and Warner have a different take on the delay , with sources suggesting that it ’s down to the difficulties in deciding who gets what money , based on the levels of copyright infringement for each individual group or artist .
A recording industry on the back foot having spent most of its time fighting the digital revolution rather than becoming part of it , is clearly trying to hang on to every penny , even when it comes to compensating the artists who they claim they were defending by taking legal action in the first place .
Irving Azoff , who manages Christina Aguilera , The Eagles , Van Halen , REO Speedwagon and Seal ( amongst others ) says it ’s hard for artists to get what they deserve from the labels : “ They will play hide and seek , but eventually will be forced to pay something , ” he said .
“ The record companies have even tried to credit unrecouped accounts .
It ’s never easy for an artist to get paid their fair share . ”
Typically , the labels see it a different way .
An EMI spokeperson said that it was “ sharing proceeds from the Napster and Kazaa settlements with artists and writers whose work was infringed upon ” while Warner ’s said the label is “ sharing the Napster settlement with its recording artists and songwriters , and at this stage nearly all settlement monies have been disbursed . ”
The Universal spokesman spoke only of the label ’s ‘ policy ’ of sharing “ its portion of various settlements with its artists , regardless of whether their contracts require it ” with no mention of whether it had actually done this or not .
But typically , when money is involved , things start to get murky .
The same sources who suggested the reasons for the delay in making payments are also suggesting that there might not be much money to even give to the artists .
It ’s being claimed that after legal bills were subtracted from the hundreds of millions in settlements , there was n’t much left over to hand out .

After being passed by Congress , Bush just signed into law a massive energy bill that will , among other things , spell the end of traditional light bulb .
USA Today reports that the bill will phase out the venerable ( but power - hungry ) incandescent bulb over the next dozen years in favor more efficient fluorescent , halogen , and LED bulbs .
Specifically , the new law holds that all light bulbs must be 25 to 35 percent more efficient by 2012 to 2014 .
A LED - based light bulb
Incandescent bulbs are highly inefficient , and today many compact fluorescent bulbs have a light quality that is similar the warm , incandescent light most of us of familiar with .
Each fluorescent bulb installed will chip about $ 5 off your annual electricity bill .
U.S. News has a great FAQ on why the bulbs are being banned , and why fluorescent bulbs are more efficient overall .
How about these stats : $ 40 billion in savings over the years spanning 2012 to 2030 , 14 fewer coal - fired power plants , and 51 million fewer tons of carbon emissions annually .

Dear Internet Porn , These last ten years have been quite a trip , have they not ?
My letter to you now , however , is not one of celebration ...
I do n't feel like we are the same anymore .
We just do n't have that passion we used to .
When we first met I was a loser , and you were there for me .
My parents told me that you were no good for me , but I did n't listen .
You showed me that there were plenty of people like myself getting laid .
It was beautiful and passionate .
Your softcore erotic videos were a tasteful introduction to my budding sexuality .
As I got older I started seeing girls on the side .
I knew you were jealous , but you have always held a special place in my heart .
You became naughtier and it affected my relationships .
I started wanting all the things I had seen you do .
I wanted to be just like you .
I wanted to cover my girlfriend 's face , put it up her ass , choke her .
But that 's when I realized your dark secret , Internet Porn .
You are n't real : you are a fake and shallow individual .
No girl wants a load on her face !
Anal sex hurts and humiliates , and choking only leads to bruises that friends and loved ones ask about .
You lied to me and changed my sexual expectations .
Now no girl can please me .
I know it is n't all bad .
You 've taught me so much .
I can surf the internet with either hand and I know all the keyboard shortcuts for my browser .
I know positions that are n't even in the Kamasutra .
But you have such a dark side .
I 've been late for work more than once and I find myself wanting to jerkoff at six in the morning .
That 's what you 've done to me .
Even now , on the eve of Christ 's birth , I sit hunched over my computer , penis in hand .
I had to turn the nativity scene around so that Jesus would n't see your filth .
Try as I might , I can never hide you well enough either .
It is harder to find you squirreled away on my hard drive than it is to get into my online bank account .
Yet there is always lingering evidence .
I 've told you time and again to stop leaving your things at my place .
But you ALWAYS forget something : a shortcut here , an unclear history there .
There 's no acceptance when you are discovered either .
It might have been ok when we started - just innocent flirting with softcore .
But now my girlfriends discover my asphyxiation collection , or that one goat video .
I hate that you always invite your shadiest friends over when you come .
So I have one request .
I know I can't get rid of you ... you are the psychopathic stalker to my teenage horror film .
But if you wo n't leave me alone , can you at least do me one favor ?
If I ever die , can you please format my hard drive ?
All of them ?
If you can't do that , just burn my place down .
My family can never know of my shame . -
Your shamed lover
per GMD :
GMD has learned that State Police representatives are going to Vermont Pharmacies and demanding complete dumps of all information about patients with Schedule II prescriptions ( the class of medications that include prescription drugs with street value ) .
After talking to a few pharmacists , I found one in Franklin County that confirmed they had been approached , and had been advised by the state that they did , indeed need to comply with the request .
Needless to say , he was n't too happy about it .
What 's even more disturbing ?
When I asked if he knew of any other pharmacies that were being mined for data in this way , he responded that it was his understanding that this was a process that was to take place across the state .
So here 's what we 've found since :
it appears as though this is a broad - reaching sweep of medical records .
I.e. , if you receive schedule II ( restricted narcotic ) medications and you also receive Prozac or Viagra or anything else that you thought was private , you were wrong ; there appears to be no mechanism in place to notify people when their records have been turned over to state police ; there appears to be no mechanism in place to warn people that their records may be turned over to state police .
This does not come without its irony .
As Doug Hoffer posted in the comments at GMD :
the state should NOT be carrying out warrantless searches .
And pharmacists should not be required to participate .
Indeed , this is happening at the same time the state is considering a suit against the phone companies for turning over records to Homeland Security .
We are definitely through the rabbit hole .
But it turns out there 's an interesting background to this story .
A few weeks ago , Vermont Public Radio produced a piece about violent crime and drug use .
Some choice quotes :
... Vermont police are also seeing enormous problems with illegal pharmaceuticals , especially oxycontin .
This comes at a time when Baker says all law enforcement agencies in the state are understaffed .
( Baker )
" The local police departments are carrying around 60 vacancies .
The state police are carrying somewhere around 20 vacancies .
And some of that 's attributed to financial reasons .
But in many cases it 's about recruiting and the inability to find qualified individuals . "
( Host ) Baker says modern - day police candidates need computer and problem solving skills - skills that can earn them higher salaries in other industries .
Baker says the state has already started talking about long - term solutions to these problems .
Meanwhile , he says police are working on short - term strategies to combat crime more effectively with the resources they have .
So here 's the burning question : is this one of their creative solutions ?
Instead of targeting criminals , target everybody who has ever had contact with one of these medications ?
I want to mention a couple quick items here about this before I close :
this is a great example of the power of blogs and web - based media .
We found the story .
We researched the story .
We got it out there .
As far as I can tell so far , no one else is reporting it , which means that asking the other Vermont media why they 're not covering it might be a good idea ; this diary is built almost entirely upon the work of people who are not me .
I 'm posting it here to keep the story in the public view and to see if we can get broader coverage of it , but it is not my own research or work that discovered any of it .
As usual , we have choices here .
Pharmacies are , as far as we can tell , complying with the state police .
As citizens , we do have the right to call our pharmacies and ask if our records have been released and to whom .
As citizens , we do have the right to sue pharmacies which release our records without valid medical purpose .
As citizens , we do have the right to speak out about this and publicize it whenever possible .
Or , of course , we can just hope nothing bad happens .
Databases are n't just places to collect information .
They 're places to lose information .
In 2006 , an employee at the Vermont State Colleges system lost a laptop containing social security numbers , payroll information and other data .
This is n't just about the police collecting data .
It 's about an underfunded department securing it and keeping it out of the wrong hands .
So I 'll end with a few questions :
Who do you think controls this data and where do you think it will be stored ?
Do you think the state police have the resources to keep it all in house , or do you think they 'll end up privatizing the information ?
Do you think that everyone who comes into contact with this information will keep all of it private ?
My iPhone , with my Shure E500 canalphones , has WAY better picture and sound then most stereo SD TVs out there .
And that 's what most people have still ... a CRT with stereo speakers .
No HD , no 5.1 .
And , Mr. Lynch , perhaps if you cannot convey the intended emotions with the resolution of the iPhone screen , I suggest that it is YOU who are the " f*cking " failure .
I was just over at the OpenOffice site browsing through some of their marketing materials to see if there was anything interesting .
I came across a presentation that was given on September 19th at the OpenOffice 2007 Conference .
The presentation was called “ OpenOffice.org 3.0 and Beyond , ” and it walked through some of the most notable features that are expected to be released in the next big OpenOffice milestone .
The presentation was actually pretty interesting to flip through , but the one thing that really caught my attention was their reference to including a Personal Information Manager ( PIM ) .
More specifically the presentation mentions bundling Thunderbird with their Office Suite , and refers to it as an “ Outlook replacement . ”
This is all assuming that Thunderbird recently losing two of it ’s main developers does n’t affect the decision , because I ’m sure OpenOffice wants to ensure that Thunderbird will continue to progress before including it .
A post that I made earlier this year regarding Thunderbird as an Outlook replacement really sparked some heated debates in the comments .
People were saying that it will never happen , yet this is the direct goal of the new OpenOffice .
They plan on including the Lightning add - on for Thunderbird so that in addition to email support , users will also be able to manage their schedule and appointments .
This is pretty big news , but the PIM that is to be included in OpenOffice 3.0 wo n’t be the only notable feature ( click on a thumbnail to enlarge it ) :

OpenOffice 3.0 is due out in September 2008 which is perfect timing for the Linux world .
Most Linux distributions have a new version that comes out every spring and fall , so OpenOffice 3.0 should be able to make it into the fall lineup of Linux distributions .
A Rate Cut appears to be the only way Wall Street may put the brakes on a steep decline next week , is anticipated from the Fed , and Friday ’s monthly jobs data may trigger a comeback for stocks after their January dump .
Even after this week ’s two - day rally , stocks finished on Friday in the red and remain down sharply for the year so far .
The Federal Reserve ’s meeting is expected to result in a reduction of 50 basis points in the fed funds rate , now down to 3.5 pc .
The central bank ’s announcement will come only eight days after the Fed took emergency action on Tuesday and cut rates by 75 basis points .
The move was surprising – not only for its size – but also because it came outside of a scheduled policy meeting .
The Fed acted as stocks were falling almost worldwide and about an hour before the market opened on Tuesday after a three - day holiday .
The Federal announcement is expected on Wednesday , at the conclusion of a two - day meeting .
A blizzard of economic reports , including data that may show contraction in fourth - quarter gross domestic product , and quarterly earnings from several Dow components , as well as a major speech by the president , will compete with the Fed and the jobs data for investors ’ attention .
Investors on Wall Street and Main Street are likely to pay more attention than usual to the president ’s remarks on his views of economy following this week ’s decision on a tax - rebate plan .
Read
On Thursday , Bush and congressional leaders agreed on a $ 150 billion fiscal stimulus package that would include tax rebates for individuals and families .
The plan awaits formal action by Congress .
News of the tax - rebate plan helped stocks extend Wednesday ’s rally , a day after the Fed ’s emergency rate cut , into sharp gains on Thursday .
For the past week , the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9 pc and the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index gained 0.4 pc .
The Najdaq Composite Index fell 0.6pc .
While Wall Street will have a heavy load of economic numbers to consider next week , one that stands out is the report on non-farm payrolls , due on Friday .
Lawrence Lessig is known for his work at the interface between technology and law .
Why is he shifting his focus to corruption ?
WHEN working as a clerk in the early 1990s for Antonin Scalia , a Supreme Court Justice , a twenty - something law graduate became frustrated by the limitations of the creaking mainframe technology used by the court to publish its rulings — a system called Atex that is well known to veteran journalists .
So he and another clerk made a presentation about the virtues of personal computers to the Supreme Court 's technology committee .
The verdict from its chairman , Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , was swift .
“ I want PCs on everyone 's desk on Monday , ” she ruled .
This was more than a one - time judicial victory .
The incident also hinted at a legal career in which Lawrence Lessig — today one of America 's leading cyberlaw experts — would always argue on the side of technological progress .
Today the 46 - year - old is a professor at Stanford Law School and founder of its Centre for Internet and Society .
He is also a board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a internet lobby group , an avid blogger and a prolific columnist .
He is the driving force behind Creative Commons , a non-profit organisation that promotes the use of copyright licences that encourage the sharing of creative works , extending the principles of open - source software into other fields .
But ultimately Mr Lessig 's real skill is bridging the gap between law and technology , encapsulated in his dictum “ code is law ” .
Mr Lessig has concentrated for a decade on copyright law and its interaction with the internet .
So he left some people feeling confused earlier this year when he announced a new focus for his campaigning efforts : tackling corruption .
Not everyone understood that this change in academic and activist emphasis is more of a shift in strategy than in substance .
For years Mr Lessig has presented legal arguments against excessive copyright extensions .
But he says lawmakers are so in thrall to big- media lobbyists that they do not even realise that counter - arguments to copyright extensions exist .
Even though Britain 's Gowers Review , published in 2005 , argues against such extensions , and eminent economists such as the late Milton Friedman have declared the importance of copyright limits to be a “ no brainer ” , Mr Lessig says legislators are clueless about “ an issue that any rational policymaker has no problem understanding . ”
Swayed by campaign contributions from vested interests — such as film studios , music companies and book publishers — America 's Congress has lengthened copyright terms 11 times in the past four decades , he observes .
And Mr Lessig sees the same sorts of interference in other domains , such as the influence of sugar lobbies on government nutrition boards and that of pharmaceutical lobbies on doctors .
“ I felt I was spending too much time on the substance of copyright , as if that was the issue , ” he says with palpable frustration .
“ I 'm really getting tired of telling this story .
It 's not rocket science .
But governments always get it wrong .
What links these issues is that there is so much money involved in protecting them . ”
Technically legal
To use an analogy from the world of computing , having failed to get a piece of software ( copyright law ) to run properly , Mr Lessig believes that the problem is caused by flaws in the underlying operating system ( the political process ) .
He has yet to reveal exactly how he hopes to expose and reduce the inappropriate influence of money on important matters such as copyright law and health — something that , it must be said , he is hardly the first to attempt .
But it is sure to involve a big dose of technology .
Mr Lessig 's work has always been inextricably linked with it , whether teaching law students , writing books or promoting innovation .
It all began when he learned to program on a mainframe computer as a high - school student in Pennsylvania .
After that , he recalls , “ I started buying things at Radio Shack and began tinkering . ”
There was no question , however , of this hobby becoming a full - time career .
Years before , during the Watergate scandal , Mr Lessig 's uncle had inspired him to pursue law .
Richard Cates , the associate special general counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during Richard Nixon 's impeachment hearings , told his nephew that law was the only place where reason controls power .
Though Mr Lessig 's later battle to reverse copyright extensions suggested otherwise , the young man decided that law was the career for him .
He remained wedded to this choice even as his views in other areas changed .
A church - going Protestant who belonged to the National Teen Age Republicans , Mr Lessig was the youngest member of the Pennsylvania delegation to the 1980 Republican Convention .
After studying economics and management at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia , Mr Lessig entered Cambridge University in England as an economics scholar — his strongest chance at gaining admission , he calculated — but with no intention of taking a degree in economics .
“ It was a total bait and switch , ” he says , with a rare grin of mischievousness .
Instead Mr Lessig ended up taking a degree in philosophy .
“ Copyrights will not expire so long as Congress is free to be bought to extend them again . ”
While in Europe he travelled several times to the Soviet Union , at times smuggling in heart - valves for Jewish refuseniks .
Today Mr Lessig may complain that “ the Democratic Party excessively listens to Hollywood ” on copyright issues , but he is no longer the fervent Republican of his teenage years .
He is a “ card - carrying member ” of the American Civil Liberties Union , quotes Al Gore and bemoans how far George Bush has strayed from the constitutional powers granted to him .
After returning to America and attending law school at Yale , Mr Lessig began his legal career .
He worked as a clerk for Judge Richard Posner in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and later for Justice Scalia .
He went on to teach at the University of Chicago before moving to Yale and then Harvard , teaching what was then a relatively obscure subject — cyberlaw — at all three law schools .
In 1997 this led Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to appoint Mr Lessig as the “ special master ” in the antitrust case against Microsoft .
He was later removed from the case after an appeals court ruled that the powers he had been granted were broader than those allowed by the rules governing special masters , and he was asked instead to file a brief as a “ friend of the court ” .
The case established Mr Lessig as one of America 's experts in technology law .
In 2000 he switched coasts and moved to Stanford Law School , in the heart of Silicon Valley , where he teaches today .
By this time he had become involved in the case launched by Eric Eldred , a literacy advocate known for making out - of - copyright books available free online , who was contesting the 20 - year copyright extension granted in the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act .
Mr Lessig has no beef with copyrights per se , but he objects on constitutional , educational and creative grounds to their continual extension , which makes them , in effect , perpetual .
The constitution gives Congress the power to “ promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries . ”
Having started as a renewable 14 - year term in the 18th century , American copyright terms now endure for the life of the artist plus 70 years .
And where copyright once concerned only an elite class of authors and publishers , the internet now makes it a daily issue for millions around the globe .
For people creating videos , digitising books and mashing up online content of all kinds , “ it 's impossible not to bump up against copyright , ” says Mr Lessig .
So in 2001 he founded Creative Commons , offering everyone an alternative to standard copyrights through various gradations of permission for use ( right down to “ no rights reserved ” ) .
“ Before Creative Commons , there was no easy way to do all that , ” says Jonathan Zittrain , professor of internet governance and regulation at Oxford University in England .
Today more than 100 m online documents sport Creative Commons licences in place of the standard copyright symbol .
But in spite of this and three copyright cases Mr Lessig has brought to court — including arguing the Eldred case before the Supreme Court — copyright terms have not been rolled back .
The Supreme Court ruled that copyright extensions do not violate the spirit of the constitution , provided they are still for “ limited terms ” , and rejected Mr Lessig 's argument that such extensions can have the effect of limiting freedom of speech .
Although some see his shift from copyright to corruption as a sudden change of heart , Mr Lessig 's writings have long drawn a connection between the two .
In a 2004 article about the Eldred case called “ How I Lost the Big One ” , Mr Lessig bemoaned that “ copyrights have not expired , and will not expire , so long as Congress is free to be bought to extend them again , ” adding that congressmen are , indirectly , defending their “ gravy train of contributions ” .
Not everyone agrees with Mr Lessig 's view that industry money has had an undue influence on copyright .
A few wins in the legislature do not constitute “ massive corruption ” , says Hilary Rosen , who for years locked horns with Mr Lessig when she was head of the Recording Industry Association of America , a body that represents the music industry .
“ I do n't buy into the premise — unless he thinks that Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson started the corruption , ” she says .
As he prepares to embark upon his new campaign , Mr Lessig — whose conversation frequently sounds footnoted , so often does he credit the book or person who inspired the point he is making — is already examining the model used by organisations such as MAPLight.org and the Sunlight Foundation , both of which provide databases that enable American voters to see which groups fund particular politicians , what their voting records are , which companies they own shares in , and so on .
These are good examples of how technology can promote transparency .
“ Technology will be a crucial part of solving this problem , ” he says , because it “ challenges the balance of power ” .
Mr Lessig goes to Washington
He is also arguing his case in speeches and on his blog , with the hopes of inspiring and encouraging others to participate in his campaign , in a manner akin to Wikipedia .
If “ you can architect the problem into bite - sized chunks ” and then motivate volunteers , the results can be impressive , he says , noting that Wikipedia has grown to be one of the internet 's ten most popular sites .
“ If we mobilise people to think of [ corruption ] as a trackable problem , we can use this technology to change Washington , ” he declares .
His supporters reckon that if anyone can do it , Mr Lessig can .
Whether speaking to a legal , policy or technology crowd , says Mr Zittrain , “ Larry can take the incomprehensible debates from academia and put them on a bumper sticker . ”

Scores of Muslim inmates at a high security prison are set to launch a multi-million pound claim for compensation after they were offered ham sandwiches during the holy month of Ramadan .
They say their human rights were breached when they were given a special nightly menu - drawn up to recognise their specific dietary requirements - by officers at HMP Leeds last month .
More than 200 Muslim inmates at the jail are believed to have been offered the meat which is strictly forbidden by Islam .
Scroll down for more ...
The sandwich was one of three options on the menu card which was created to cover the religious festival during which Muslims are required to fast during daylight .
They later complained to prison officers on duty but say they were told that the menus had been printed in error .
Yet when they opened the sandwiches , having ordered cheese , some claim they were still filled with boiled ham .
Scroll down for more ...
They are now launching legal action , insisting that their human rights were breached and could each be entitled to up to £ 10,000 in compensation if they win their case at court .
One Muslim inmate , a 28 - year - old who was serving a 16 - week sentence for driving whilst disqualified , said : ' When I opened my meal that night I found I 'd been given a ham sandwich .
I 'd asked for cheese .
' It was a breach of my human rights and I want compensation . '
He claimed that some inmates were so hungry they ended up eating the sandwiches .
The prison denied that any Muslim prisoners had been given ham sandwiches but admitted there had been a mistake when the menus were printed .
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said : ' An inappropriate menu card was printed during Ramadan .
This mistake was rectified immediately .
' Appropriate menu options for the Iftaar evening meal were available throughout Ramadan .
' Prison Service guidelines state that prisoners must have a diet which meets the requirements of their religion . '
It comes as 16 Muslim inmates at Leeds Prison prepare to launch a separate legal case over claims of mistreatment , including being given food that is forbidden by their religion .
They are expected to claim at a hearing next year that they were given meat which was not halal .
Kate Maynard , from law firm Hickman and Rose Solicitors who is representing some of the men , said : ' One of the issues they are worried about is that they were being told food was halal when it was n't .
' They are taking this to court to try to change conditions in the prison and make conditions better . '
Last year the Prison Service was forced to apologise to Muslim inmates at a category B jail after a kitchen worker was caught throwing ham into halal curries .
Prisoners at HMP Blakenhurst in Worcestershire each received a written apology .
The inmate behind the attack at the prison , which houses 1,070 offenders , was observed throwing tinned ham into curries destined for Muslim inmates and suspended from his job in the kitchen .
“ It ’s not the be-all and end - all , ” said Joe Garcia , the former executive director of the Cuban American National Foundation and currently a Democratic candidate for Congress .
“ But it marks a turning point .
There ’s no question that the Cuban revolution is nearing its conclusion . ”
The diversity of reaction seemed to reflect , in part , an evolution of Cuban - Americans ’ posture toward Cuba over several decades .
While Mr. Castro is still disliked among Cuban - Americans here , attitudes have softened and diversified with time .
As first - generation Cuban immigrants who fled the country in the face of Mr. Castro ’s rise have passed away , they have been replaced by new generations of Cubans , many of whom were born in the United States and , unlike their forebears , have no burning desire to return to the island and reclaim what their families abandoned when they fled .
“ It depends how you came from Cuba , it depends how many people you have in Cuba , ” said Raquel , 68 , a Cuban - American who owns a store in Little Havana .
She asked that neither her last name nor the name of her store be published for fear that her political opinions might anger some Cuban - American hard - liners and cost her customers .
“ Every family has different feelings , every family is different , ” she continued .
“ The people who came in the ’60s think one thing , the people who came in the Mariel boatlift in the ’ 80s think another thing , people who came a year ago and are going back think another thing . ”
I 've taken my shots at Vista in many past blog posts , and deservedly so .
But I thought I would balance that out with another perspective and talk the things I like about Vista .
This is n't a technical or in depth review of all the intricate changes or new things buried in the internals of Vista .
I 'm talking about the things in Vista that I use or help me everyday in my work , using Vista as the OS on my daily work computer .
Why I Like Windows Vista
1. Vista Worked , From Day One
I 've had Vista running on two machines I use pretty much every day , almost since Vista 's introduction in early ' 07 .
The first machine I installed Vista on was a custom built rig my son Phill and I built , the second was a newly purchased HP laptop with Vista pre-installed .
I approach technology differently that most users probably do .
I try new products until they either win me over , or become sufficiently frustrating to use that I move on to something else .
I like to experience what most organizations will be deploying for their users and developers so I regularly use Windows boxes along side Linux , networking , VoIP and other security gear .
With relatively few problems , I 've been able to use and stick with Vista since its introduction .
I 'm pretty surprised that 's been the case .
I would n't have predicted it .
That 's better than many Mac OS X Leopard users can say .
2. Sleep and Hibernate Are Much More Reliable
My everyday computer is an HP Pavilion Intel laptop .
I 'm constantly putting it to sleep and moving between my home network , office networks , and local coffee shops .
I prefer to put the laptop to sleep and then pick right back up again where I left off when I arrive at my new work destination .
Most of the time , sleep mode works perfectly - far better than what I experienced in Windows XP or other operating system versions .
Only occasionally does something get out of sync ( like the network connections not passing data ) and I have to shutdown and restart the system .
I 've not experienced the long resume times that other Vista users have complained about .
Sleep and hibernate mode might sound like a strange thing to list at # 2 but I use it all the time and it is much more stable on this HP laptop running Vista than previous Windows operating systems .
3. Search Built Into Windows Explorer ( And Outlook )
I rely heavily on searching the content of files .
I loved Google Desktop Search when it first came out , that is until I did some research about some poor security practices implemented in Google Desktop Search software .
Since then , I 've come to rely heavily on this search capability .
Integrating search into the Windows Explorer file browser makes my job easier .
I like product features that improve my productivity and still allow me to work the way I like to work .
Occasionally I get annoyed at Vista spinning my hard disk drives like it 's performing some kind of hard disk speed test , but most of the time it 's not a problem .
It also helps that I upgraded the hard drives on my laptop to 7200rpm drives , and I use Diskeeper to keep them defragmented and optimized .
4. Broad Hardware Driver Support
I 've installed many different video cards , printers , keyboards / mice , Bluetooth devices and I rarely have an issue with finding or locating a hardware driver .
Most of the time Vista has the proper driver unless its a high performance video driver I need to download from Nvidia or some other vendor .
Again , I know others have had some issues with driver support but my life has been easier with Vista 's hardware support than with previous Windows OSs .
Installing Vista from scratch is a snap because of it ( and it 's much faster than other Windows OSs too . )
5. Handy Tools , Security , Software Updates and other Doodads
I 'm a gadget person .
I like tools and utility software that tell me what 's going on with my system .
I love the Windows Sidebar ( though it likes to reorder the gadgets , and does n't always adjust properly when I hook up another monitor to the video out port . )
I 'm always running gadgets for process monitoring , reporting the wireless connection state , battery life , processor and memory utilization , a clock and calculator .
I wish Microsoft would put serious thought into redesigning the desktop metaphor so the Window Sidebar at least makes the commonly used tools and information I want right there on the desktop .
I also love the new Reliability and Performance Monitor .
It provides a wealth of information about what 's happening in the OS .
OneCare anti-virus and firewall production are well built and work with the OS well .
I like the new Windows Update , which does a great job of keeping my system up - to - date with required and option patches and upgrades .
There You Have It
I know it 's not fancy .
It 's not all the features and buzzword topics Microsoft would promote about Vista .
But it 's what makes Vista usable and an improvement upon Windows XP and Windows 2000 .
It 's kind like an everyday , blue collar top 5 list but these are the things that make Vista an improved operating system over my Windows XP and 2000 desktop OS experience .
Now , I could start into the things I do n't like about Vista but in keeping with my stated intent for this blog post , I 'll just leave it at that .
Valeria “ ValBlu ” McCulloch
Shoe Designer .
Yves Klein blue .
Why blue ?
In college , I majored in color theory .
Blue was the most interesting color , historically .
Germanic tribes wore it to ward off enemies ; Christians used it to denote divinity .
Wearing blue for me is being in a dream all day .
Do you make your own blue shoes ?
I go to leather fairs and have the factory make me shoes .
I also buy white Chanel and Christian Louboutin shoes , and I color them blue with custom - ordered electric - blue Sharpies .
Do you wear blue makeup ?
I wear YSL No. 3 mascara , Chanel Blue Satin nail polish , and blue Lancôme lip gloss , which looks clear when you put it on .
And my bathroom products are blue , like my toothbrush .
Does the color reflect your personality ?
Blue signifies loyalty , and I ’m very loyal .
It ’s hard in this industry , but I ’m a humanist .
There was a lot of electric blue in recent seasons .
It ’s getting trendy .
When it hits “ mass , ” it ’s a turnoff .
What do your friends think ?
My friend studied photography , and I was part of her thesis .
She did a color study and took photos of me .
What color is your apartment ?
My living room is neutral , but just go into my bedroom .
I have a blue Nintendo , bedside table , suitcase , pillow , BlackBerry .
And I collect blue gemstones .
People once believed that sapphires had healing properties .
How does blue make you feel ?
Blue is a peaceful color .
The U.N. has a blue flag ; all the presidential campaigns have blue .
It touches every realm of life , from cosmic to future .
Rebecca Turbow
Fashion Designer .
Gray .
Why gray ?
I actually wore turquoise for eight years , but last September , I switched to gray .
I ’d had a bad year and needed to get out of it .
That ’s a big switch .
I like everything to be clean , and gray is clean .
Gray is between black and white , so it ’s a noncolor , almost .
I feel messy and unclean if I wear other colors .
Where do you shop ?
I make all my own clothes .
I ca n’t wear anyone else’s .
What about shoes ?
That ’s hard because even the soles of my shoes have to be gray or white .
I get annoyed if the soles are black .
Do you ever miss turquoise ?
When I was in turquoise , people would stare at me everywhere I went .
It ’s still the color of my clothing line , so my business cards and stickers are turquoise .
But I ’ve separated myself from it , so I ’m separated from my work .
Is that a good thing ?
Gray is refreshing .
My boyfriend says it looks classy .
Sometimes he ’ll wear black , and I ’ll wear silver .
I like that ; we match .
Does it bother you when other people wear mixed colors ?
I like mixed colors on other people .
I just ca n’t wear or make them .
I work for the singer of Of Montreal , and he lets me make him wild , monochrome outfits .
Will you wear gray for the rest of your life ?
My mom thinks I should branch out , but I ca n’t imagine that .
I do n’t know if it ’s a condition ; I ’ve always wondered if there ’s a name for it .
Karim Rashid
Industrial Designer .
White half the time , pink half the time .
Why white ?
In college , I was obsessed with wearing all white .
I felt angelic and free .
But then , in the early eighties , I started wearing black .
That was status quo in the avant - garde .
If you were interesting — a designer , an architect — you wore all black .
How long did that last ?
I went to Rome to do my master ’s in ’ 82 .
I wore all black , with pink hair .
But that was considered Fascist .
I had to tone down my dress .
Why did n’t you return to black back in New York ?
Every profession has dress codes .
In 2000 , I was on a panel with nine architects , and I wore a white suit .
Everyone was wearing black except me .
I felt detached from the incestuous profession .
Now you also wear pink .
Why ?
Sometimes I think it ’s because my mother dressed me in pink when I was a child .
She wanted me to be a girl .
How do people react to a grown man in pink ?
I make them smile .
They say , “ You make me happy . ”
What about underwear ?
The only place in the world that sells men ’s pink underwear is American Apparel .
How do you keep your clothes clean ?
I carry Tide to Go .
If I spill red wine , I just rub it off .
I should write a book about wearing white .
Do people try to convince you to wear other colors ?
I was shopping in Europe with a couple friends , and they talked me into trying on a black shirt and black jeans .
If you look good in white , you look really good in black .
But you did n’t buy the jeans ?
My statement is , Be who you are .
Do what turns you on .
Elizabeth Sweetheart
Fabric Designer .
Kelly green .
Why green ?
I ’m from Nova Scotia , where green is in your surroundings .
I missed nature when I moved to New York .
I started wearing green nail polish , and it spread all over me .
When did you move here ?
I hitchhiked down in 1964 .
I had long braided hair ; I was a beatnik .
Where did you live ?
We used to live on the Lower East Side .
A hippie gang was on our block , and you had to know them to get down the street .
They had weapons and chains .
They babysat for our son .
What ’s your son up to these days ?
Sam is a mentalist , a magician .
It ’s classic mind - reading ; he ’ll memorize a deck of cards .
He ’s our one and only .
How long have you been married ?
Forty - one years .
Every Saturday morning , we ’d say , “ Maybe we ’ll make it to City Hall this morning . ”
We missed a few because we slept late .
Finally , we went and got married .
We did n’t have a ring , so my husband , Robert , made one out of paper .
Do you have any grandchildren ?
No , but I have a grand - puppy .
My son asked me to babysit him , and I airbrushed his tail green .
Sam flipped out .
Tell me about your style .
I always wear overalls .
I have 30 pairs .
I buy children ’s sizes from GapKids and Chadwick’s .
And I dye everything — my Nike sneakers , my underwear .
I ca n’t fall asleep unless I ’m wearing green .
Do you wear green to work ?
Every day .
I ’ve been in the design business over 44 years .
How do strangers react ?
Many people say , “ Oh !
That ’s my favorite color . ”
On 42nd Street , tourists ask to take my photo .
I take the F train and know everyone on it — kids , Japanese girls with green in their hair , all the junkies .
I ’ve never had a negative experience .
Stephin Merritt
Singer - Songwriter .
Brown .
Why brown ?
Years ago , I did a photo shoot with my dog , Irving , for Esquire magazine , where they had various celebs wearing fake eighties clothing .
They put me in a preposterous outfit .
Blondie was also part of the shoot , and they gave me advice : Just say , “ Sorry , I only wear black . ”
So why did n’t you start wearing black ?
Unfortunately , black at this point tends to make you look like a French tourist in Soho .
It also makes me look ill .
I look ill enough ; I really do n’t need to call attention to that .
But brown is good ?
I have brown hair and eyes , and I believe in matching .
It must be hard to clash when you wear all brown .
Impossible .
The great thing about brown is when it fades , you ca n’t tell what color it originally was .
There ’s no sense of the “ right ” color saturation .
What else do you like about it ?
Brown shows absolutely nothing .
You ’d have to spill some fuchsia paint .
If you wear black , dandruff is horrific and lint is a nightmare — and dog hair , in my case , is a particular problem .
What color is your dog ?
White and beige with a little brown nose .
He ’s incredibly cute .
Are there any downsides to wearing brown ?
I ’ve been invited to two events that required black tuxedoes , so I did n’t go .
I always said I ’d wait until I ’d been asked to three tuxedo events before I accepted .
So I ’m in danger of needing to wear a tuxedo .
What were the events ?
The first was a party at an embassy ; the second was a wedding .
I do n’t know why tuxedos were necessary .
But obviously I ’ve never been to a tuxedo event .
Maybe it ’s glorious fun .
I have pointed out before that the press and popular media love this meme .
It 's always good for a provocative headline or a special three - part series during sweeps week .
Jay Leno has practically made a sub - career out of exploiting it .
And there can be no question that the advertising industry buys into it wholesale -- essentially willing it to be true .
Nor would I suggest that buying into this meme is strictly a blue - state or left - of - center affair .
Conservatives need this meme to argue for school choice , or -- if they are of a more paleo variety -- just to argue that the world ( especially these here United States ) is going to hell in a handbasket .
In fact , I daresay that the Digger who got all enthusiastic upon finding this piece is most likely an American , and certainly many of the frothy commenters who could barely restrain their glee upon reading this news are also Americans .
Now these folks might not necessarily agree with the blanket statement that " Americans are stupid . "
They might prefer " Americans are stupid compared to Europeans , " or better yet , " Red -State Americans are stupid , " or something like that .
But again , the underlying premise remains .
Now you 'll see a lot of variations on this , particularly from our brethren across the pond who are quick to point out that Americans are ignorant fundamentalists , racist louts , provincial rednecks , etc .
But the underlying theme of stupidity is always there .
However , what makes the " Americans are stupid " meme so effective is that it 's beloved not just by Europeans ( and to a lesser extent Asians , Africans , and others ) but by many if not most Americans !
The nine - year - old Gallup poll reveals that nearly 20 % of Americans believe ( or at least believed back then ) that the Sun revolves around the Earth .
So what makes the story so compelling is that it falls in line with a meme that is ( almost ) universally loved , to wit :
Why would a nine - year - old Gallup poll suddenly emerge on Digg Science earlier this week as if it were news ?
This happens on Digg sometimes -- it has happened on this site , too , I must confess -- where a news story is found to be so compelling and so in line with the kinds of things that a particular blogger ( or Digger ) wants to write about that the enthusiastic blogger ( or Digger ) goes at it without noticing the date .
It then takes an astute commenter to point out the vintage of the news item in question .
I have no particular interest in arguing the merits of this meme .
Like its sister , " America is evil , " it 's an extremely subjective proposition .
It would be hard to convince anyone who buys into it that it is false , notwithstanding the fact that most of the " proof " offered up on behalf of it is pretty shaky .
For example , in the Gallup article linked above , we read the following :
In the new poll , about four out of five Americans ( 79 % ) correctly respond that the earth revolves around the sun , while 18 % say it is the other way around .
These results are comparable to those found in Germany when a similar question was asked there in 1996 ; in response to that poll , 74 % of Germans gave the correct answer , while 16 % thought the sun revolved around the earth , and 10 % said they did n't know .
When the question was asked in Great Britain that same year , 67 % answered correctly , 19 % answered incorrectly , and 14 % did n't know .
So the US actually scored higher on this question than Germany or Great Britain .
If we want to generalize from these kinds of results ( which is probably a bad idea anyway ) , then we 're stuck with " Americans are stupid , but not as stupid as German and Brits . "
But nobody seems to read this story to say that .
( Although it is very much to the credit of the Digg community that a number of commenters pointed out this discrepancy . )
Moreover , the meme is generally not considered something that has to be proven at all .
It is usually just assumed to be true .
Consider this from the Wall Street Journal Business Technology blog , reflecting on the surprising finding that many Americans have a moral objection to nanotechnology :
Our first reaction was that 70 % of people must not know what nanotechnology is – President Bush , who has openly relied on moral views to shape his scientific agenda , has made nanotechnology one of his scientific priorities , after all .
And Dietram Scheufele , the U of W professor who led the survey , agrees to a point .
People ’s understanding of what nanotechnology is has n’t advanced much over the last few years , he tells the Business Technology Blog .
“ So people rely on mental shortcuts , ” lumping nanotechnology in with other new technologies like stem cell research and genetically modified foods , he tells us .
The same people who object to those fields – often on religious reasons – object to nanotechnology .
( Incidentally , the heathen Europeans are just fine with nanotechnology . )
See how deftly it 's done ?
Stupid religious Americans , clever " heathen " Europeans .
Unfortunately , in the context , this does n't make a heck of a lot of sense .
Americans are opposed to stem cell research because we 're ignorant religious bigots .
Okay , sure .
But we 're opposed to nanotechnology for the same reasons ?
And GM foods ?
GM foods ?
Now wait a second ... a lot of Europeans are opposed to GM foods .
I bet they would even say it 's on moral grounds !
Yet somehow , they manage to pull that off without being either 1 ) religious or -- more importantly -- 2 ) stupid .
Personally , I think being morally opposed to GM foods is kind of stupid , and being " morally " opposed to nanotechnology is idiotic .
However , I do n't see how American stupidity is dumber than European stupidity ; one may be informed by religious belief , the other by a paranoid superstitious dread of scientific progress .
Advantage : Europe ?
If you say so .
But ultimately none of that matters because -- like other memes -- " Americans are stupid " is an idea that is easily and readily copied ; it tends to be " sticky , " and it seems to be encoded with an implied ( if not an outright ) " pass it on . "
People do n't believe that " Americans are stupid " primarily because it 's true ; rather , it is accepted as true because it is useful .
As noted above , it can serve as the rationale for any of a number of political positions ; it has great attention - getting value ; it has great entertainment value , and -- for non-Americans , anway -- it provides a kind of self - aggrandizement ( or at least self - validation ) function : " Americans are stupid ( unlike us ) . "
I think for many Europeans , this meme serves all of those purposes at once .
No wonder it is so cherished there .
All well and good , I suppose .
It 's nice that virtually the entire world can agree on something , even if that something is that I 'm an idiot .
Still , when you consider what a fundamental concept stickiness is to outfits like Digg -- or to the blogosphere -- you can't help but wonder where the truth is in all the information we 're pushing around here on version 2.0 of the Web .
Is truth too lofty a goal for Web 2.0 content ?
Or was it always just too lofty a goal for human discourse ?
Is usefulness enough ?

Effi : Finnish police censors a critic of censorship
===================================================
Electronic Frontier Finland ( Effi ) demands the `National Bureau of
Investigation`__ ( NBI ) of Finland to explain why it has censored a net
site that criticises Internet censorship .
__ http://www.poliisi.fi/poliisi/krp/home.nsf/pages/indexeng
NBI maintains a secret blocking list of web sites allegedly containing
child pornography , pursuant to a law passed last year .
*[ Most of the major Finnish
Internet service providers use this list in a DNS based
filtering system under pressure from the government . ]*
The purpose of
the law is to prevent the access to the foreign sites that contain
child pornography .
Now the censorship list has been appended with a site called
`lapsiporno.info`__ *[ translates to childpornography.info ] * that is
maintained by a Finnish Internet activist Matti Nikki .
The site does
not contain child pornography , but articles that criticise censorship
and a list of blocked IP addresses .
__ http://lapsiporno.info/
Leena Romppainen , a member of the Effi board wonders : “ If the site
really had some illegal content , would n’t the correct solution
be to take the site down and take the site owner to the court ?
The site is
located on a Finnish server and the name of the site owner appears
visibly on the root page of the site . ”
“ The whole net censorship project is just a hat trick that is used to
sweep under the carpet the real problem , that is , the sexual abuse of
the children ” , shoots Tero Tilus , a member of the board of Effi .
Most of the censored sites are located either in the United
States or EU countries .
“ The local authorities have taken no action on these sites .
Therefore ,
either the sites do not contain child pornography or the NBI has not
informed the local authorities ” , says Leena Romppainen .
“ Both of the
alternatives are equally scary . ”
Major part of the censored sites are legal adult sites .
From the
beginning , there have also been attempts to expand the censorship for
example to the net poker sites .
“ Some faceless official decides which sites the Finns may not see , and
this decision cannot be appealed .
Now he has apparently decided that
net filtering may not be criticised ” , finishes Tero Tilus .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday April 16 2007
We stated in error in the article below that the land above 50 degrees latitude in the northern hemisphere is where Scandinavia and Siberia sit , but those countries begin around the 60th parallel .
The British Isles begin at 50 degrees of latitude , a line that joins the southern tip of Cornwall to Luxembourg , and passes south of Frankfurt and Prague .
It may have become the penance of choice for the environmentally conscious individual , but planting trees to offset carbon emissions could contribute to global warming if they are planted outside the tropics , scientists believe .
They argue that most forests do not have any overall effect on global temperature but , by the end of the century , forests in the mid and high latitudes could make their parts of the world more than 3C warmer than would have occurred if the trees did not exist .
Govindasamy Bala , an atmospheric scientist at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in the US , has shown that only tropical rainforests are beneficial in helping slow global warming .
The problem is that while the carbon dioxide forests use for photosynthesis indirectly helps cool the Earth by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , forests also trap heat from the sunlight they absorb .
Dr Bala and his colleague , Ken Caldeira of the department of global ecology at the Carneige Institute in Standford , used a computer model to show that , outside a thin band around the equator , forests end up trapping more heat than they help to get rid of through a cut in carbon dioxide .
Planting trees above 50 degrees latitude - the equivalent of Scandinavia or Siberia in the northern hemisphere - can also cover up tundra normally blanketed in heat - reflecting snow .
The scientists said that the results , published yesterday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Scientists , are explained by the way in which the sun 's rays are absorbed or reflected by different parts of the world .
Forest canopies , being relatively dark , absorb most of the sun 's heating rays that fall on them , warming the surface of the Earth all around .
In contrast , grassland or snowfields reflect a lot more of the sun 's rays back into space , keeping temperatures in open areas lower .
Dr Bala said that trees at lower latitudes have a dual role .
" It is a win - win situation in the tropics because trees in the tropics , in addition to absorbing carbon dioxide , promote convective clouds that help to cool the planet .
In other locations , the warming from the albedo effect [ the amount of sunlight reflected back into space ] either cancels or exceeds the net cooling from the other two effects . "
The results follow increasing criticism from climate scientists of the benefits of forestry schemes to offset carbon emissions .
Kevin Anderson , a scientist with the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research , warned recently that offsetting was a dangerous delaying technique that helped people " sleep well at night when we should n't sleep well at night " .
Environmental groups have also been debating the issue .
When Dr Bala 's preliminary findings were discussed at the American Geophysical Union 's annual meeting in San Francisco , a spokesman for Greenpeace USA said that the charity had always encouraged limiting the number of trees which countries and firms use to mitigate climate change .
" What we see here is another reason to limit this , " he said .
He added that forestry projects were difficult to manage .
" There are a lot of reasons why buying credits can be very fleeting , from a consumer point of view .
You do n't know what 's going to happen to your forest in 10 years .
All that effort you made to store that carbon can disappear in a heartbeat . "
Dr Caldeira warned that chopping down trees outside the tropics was not a good idea .
" Preservation of ecosystems is a primary goal of preventing global warming , and the destruction of ecosystems to prevent global warming would be a counterproductive and perverse strategy . "
Dr Bala added : " Apart from their role in altering the planet 's climate , forests are valuable in many other aspects .
Forests provide natural habitat to plants and animals , preserve the biodiversity , produce economically valuable timber and firewood , protect watersheds and indirectly prevent ocean acidification . "
Planting trees to neutralise carbon emissions has become a big business : £ 60 m worth of trees have been bought this year , up from £ 20 m in 2005 .
By 2010 the market is expected to reach £ 300m .
Alternatives
Ways to cut carbon include :
· Replacing CO2 - producing energy with human energy technologies ... a project in India has replaced diesel pumps with people - operated pumps for irrigation .
· Introducing energy - saving light bulbs , which use 80 % less electricity on average , reducing energy consumption and therefore the amount of pollution by power stations .
Inefficient coal power stations in Kazakhstan create three times as much CO2 when producing electricity as UK counterparts .
Because electricity is so cheap , many schools and homes use cheaper , but inefficient , traditional bulbs instead .
· Efficient stove projects .
In Mexico more efficient stoves have been introduced because they are cheaper and burn less fuel .
They also make the kitchen safer as they produce less smoke , and cut CO2 by 1.5 tonnes a year , a home .
· Renewable energy projects , such as wind farms in India .

You have sur­vived the 2007 shop­ping and eat­ing sea­son .
Con­grat­u­la­tions !
Now it ’s time to shift gears and focus on 2008 … whether you write down some New Year res­o­lu­tions or con­tem­plate some things that you want to let go of from last year and set inten­tions and goals for this year — as is a friend ’s tra­di­tion on the win­ter sol­stice .
To sum­ma­rize the key find­ings of the last 20 years of neu­ro­science research on how to “ exer­cise our brains ” , there are three things that we can strive for : nov­el­ty , vari­ety and chal­lenge .
If we do these three things , we will build new con­nec­tions in our brains , be mind­ful and pay atten­tion to our envi­ron­ment , improve cog­ni­tive abil­i­ties such as pat­tern - recog­ni­tion , and in gen­er­al con­tribute to our life­long brain health .
With these three prin­ci­ples of brain health in mind — nov­el­ty , vari­ety and chal­lenge — let me sug­gest a few poten­tial New Years res­o­lu­tions , per­haps some unex­pect­ed , that will help you make 2008 a year of Brain Fit­ness :
1. 2008 Pri­maries and Elec­tions :
If you have n’t yet done so , reg­is­ter to vote — active par­tic­i­pa­tion is good for your brain health .
But , before rush­ing out to vote , take some time to think through the cri­te­ria you want to set up to eval­u­ate who deserves your vote .
Do n’t let politi­cians and their spin doc­tors set your agen­da .
Ask your­self , what mat­ters most to me ?
What type of Pres­i­dent do I think we need ?
Why ?
I per­son­al­ly find it quite intrigu­ing that no can­di­date so far is res­ur­rect­ing the “ It is the econ­o­my , stu­pid ” mantra , and propos­ing sol­id plans to get our econ­o­my back on track .
2 . Next time out shop­ping :
Do n’t let adver­tis­ers treat you as if you were Pavlov ’s Dog — remem­ber the dog that was trained to sali­vate auto­mat­i­cal­ly every time a bell rang .
There is a whole indus­try out there try­ing to make you buy stuff on impulse .
Notice your reac­tions to a movie trail­er or a TV ad Resist .
Be the true “ Decider ” .
For bonus points , once you learn to iden­ti­fy and man­age your own buy­ing impuls­es , try explain­ing this to your kids …
3 . Read­ing habits :
If you usu­al­ly read non-fic­tion , try some­thing new this sea­son .
Pick up a good fic­tion book .
Or vice ver­sa .
For bonus points , sub­scribe to or sim­ply read a new mag­a­zine , per­haps one that your part­ner craves ?
It will help you under­stand anoth­er per­spec­tive .
4. Learn about the Brain : Pick up one of the books in our Books sec­tion .
In the unlike­ly sce­nario that you read as many brain - relat­ed books as I do , pick up some Russ­ian poet­ry book and let ’s dis­cuss this instead .
5 . At work : Find , or cre­ate , an intel­lec­tu­al­ly and social­ly stim­u­lat­ing new job for your­self at your cur­rent work­place or a new one .
Engag­ing work has been shown to con­tribute to life­long cog­ni­tive per­for­mance ( see recent study ) .
At the very least , go out of your way to make what­ev­er job you have more stim­u­lat­ing : try talk­ing to a new col­league or client every­day and learn a new thing about them .
You will not remem­ber every­thing , but sure­ly more than if you do n’t even try .
6. Grat­i­tude vs. the Sub­prime mess :
With increas­ing cov­er­age of eco­nom­ic woes , the sub­prime mess , reces­sion risk , the falling dol­lar and a bal­loon­ing deficit , it is easy to lose per­spec­tive and become depressed .
Which does­ n’t help any­one , much less our brains .
To put things in per­spec­tive , it pays off to devote some time to keep a Grat­i­tude Jour­nal and sim­ply scrib­ble a few notes a day .
For bonus points : do this while you are watch­ing TV news and share your notes with your part­ner .
7. Cul­ti­vate your Crit­i­cal - think­ing abil­i­ties :
Ask your­self , “ Where is the evi­dence ? ” at least once a day — see points 1 &2 above .
Do n’t just believe this arti­cle .
Even if it had been endorsed by 20 Har­vard Med­ical School researchers and doc­tors , noth­ing sub­sti­tutes your own brain in action .
And the more you prac­tice , the more you refine your judg­ment .
8. Par­tic­i­pate in cre­at­ing a bet­ter envi­ron­ment .
Our plan­et , our fam­i­lies , our com­mu­ni­ties , our schools , all can ben­e­fit from our help .
What project do you care enough to com­mit some of your time to in 2008 ?
If you have school age kids , have you con­sid­ered join­ing the school board ?.
9 . Com­put­er - based pro­grams :
With the grow­ing num­ber of “ brain train­ing ” prod­ucts , you may be think­ing of giv­ing one a try , either for you or for a loved one .
As men­tioned in point num­ber 2 above , it makes sense to do some research before mak­ing a purchase … so check this eval­u­a­tion check­list .
10 .
Where to start ?
OK , now you have read many sug­ges­tions , resolve to keep at least one of them … which one will you choose ?.
Enjoy a Hap­py and Fruit­ful 2008 , for you and your loved ones !

To create art , you need peace and quiet .
Not only does Scrivener save like a maniac so you need n’t bother , you also get to drop the curtain on life ’s prosaic demands with a feature that makes its users swoon : full screen .
When you ’re working on a Scrivener opus , you ’re not surrounded by teetering stacks of Firefox windows showing old Google searches or Citibank reports of suspicious activity .
Life ’s daily cares slip into the shadows .
What emerges instead is one pristine and welcoming scroll : Your clean and focused mind .
Full screen is not a Scrivener invention ; Scrivener credits Ulysses , another excellent Word alternative for Mac .
But full screen has been refined by Nisus Writer , which Michael Chabon used to write “ The Yiddish Policeman ’s Union , ” as well as the seminal program CopyWrite .
For PCs , programs like NewNovelist , StoryView and Liquid Story Binder get raves .
But if , when it comes right down to it , full screen is your holy grail , and the ultimate antidote to the bric - a - brac of Word , then you must enter the WriteRoom , the ultimate spartan writing utopia .
Where Scrivener calls itself a “ writer ’s shed , ” which suggests implements like duct tape and hoes , WriteRoom pitches itself as the way to “ distraction - free writing ” for “ people who enjoy the simplicity of a typewriter , but live in the digital world . ”
With WriteRoom , you do n’t compose on anything so confining as paper or its facsimile .
Instead , you rocket out into the unknown , into profound solitude , and every word of yours becomes the kind of outer - space skywriting that opens “ Star Wars . ”
What I mean is this : Black screen .
Green letters .
Or another color combination of your discerning choice .
But nothing else .
For those of us who learned Basic on a Zenith Z19 and started word processing on a Kaypro ( anyone ? ) , the retro green - and - black now takes the breath away .
It ’s not just the vintage features available on WriteRoom , it ’s also that the whole experience is a throwback to a time before user - friendly interfaces came to protect us from technology ’s dark places .
In those days , the mystery of the human mind and the mystery of computation seemed both to illuminate and to deepen each other .
Yes , with WriteRoom , your sentences unfurl in prehistoric murk .
Yes , your green letters seem like civilization ’s feeble stand against entropy .
Yes , when you write , you have lighted a candle instead of cursing the darkness .
Yes , you can and should also curse the darkness .
The new writing programs encourage a writerly restart .
You may even relearn the green - lighted alphabet , adjust your preference for long or short sentences , opt afresh for action over description .
Renewal becomes heady : in WriteRoom ’s gloom is man ’s power to create something from nothing , to wrest form from formlessness .
Let ’s just say it :
It ’s biblical .
And come on , ye writers , do you want to be a little Word drip writing 603 words in Palatino with regulation margins ?
Or do you want to be a Creator ?
SHAKE TO DELETE : The Etch A Sketch was the typewriter generation ’s introduction to a screen that could make words simply vanish .
The Web is filled with Etch A Sketch art , preserved as it could never be on the original shakable and protean palette .

Professor Lewin revels in his fan mail and in the idea that he is spreading the love of physics .
“ Teaching is my life , ” he said .
The professor , who is from the Netherlands , said that teaching a required course in introductory physics to M.I.T. students made him realize “ that what really counts is to make them love physics , to make them love science . ”
He said he spent 25 hours preparing each new lecture , choreographing every detail and stripping out every extra sentence .
“ Clarity is the word , ” he said .
Fun also matters .
In another lecture on pendulums , he stands back against the wall , holding a steel ball at the end of a pendulum just beneath his chin .
He has just demonstrated how potential energy turns into kinetic energy by sending the ball flying across the stage , shattering a pane of glass he had bolted to the wall .
Now he will demonstrate the conservation of energy .
“ I am such a strong believer in the conservation of energy that I am willing to risk my life for it , ” he says .
“ If I am wrong , then this will be my last lecture . ”
He closes his eyes , and releases the ball .
It flies back and forth , stopping just short of his chin .
“ Physics works ! ” Professor Lewin shouts .
“ And I ’m still alive ! ”

Creating Excel Files with Python and Django
Introduction
When a client needs to manipulate data , it 's easiest to give them an Excel spreadsheet .
Creating a spreadsheet is easy with Python , and making it available for web download is just as easy with the Django web framework .
After a brief tangent into evolutionary history , you 'll find out how to do both .
Sharks have n't evolved much in millions of years , mostly because they 're wildly efficient .
They have n't had to adapt , or change , because they 're really good at their job .
How could you possibly improve on a shark ?
They 're perfectly terrifying fish eating machines .
Much like sharks , spreadsheets have n't evolved much in the past few decades .
Following the shark pattern , the reason for their near - stagnation is because they 're really good at their job .
Take a bunch of data , present it in a table , allow non-programmers to sort and manipulate the numbers to achieve new views of the data .
They 're perfectly terrifying data eating machines .
Given the efficiency of spreadsheets , sometimes it pays to acknowledge their power , and not waste your time trying to improve on it .
A huge swath of web applications can be described as " taking a database and putting it on the web . "
In an iterative development environment , the first few cycles are taken by " getting the data into the database . "
Once that 's completed , product owners start asking for views of the data in the web app .
This is where it gets sticky .
It 's rare to find a client that knows exactly how they want to manipulate the data you 're going to be presenting to them .
At times , they might think they know what they want , but as soon as you complete the work , it 's most likely not really what they wanted .
This is n't some flaw in a product owner 's mind ; rather , it 's a direct result of their probably never having actually seen all the data in one place before .
The fact is , once they start playing with this new source of information , patterns they had n't considered emerge .
Given the above , whenever possible , I like to give a product owner an Excel representation of their data .
I usually allow them to download it through a web application .
When they 've played around with the data in Excel , they 'll have a better idea of how they use the data , and then know how they ultimately want to see the data presented .
It saves me time , and leads to a better end product .
In many cases , a " download data as Excel " button is also a great way to make data portable .
As the application matures away from needing the Excel view , the app will keep its Excel export function as a way for a user to take data offline .
Any way you look at it , having the ability to download to Excel is an attractive feature that solves a lot of headaches .
Now that I 've established that spreadsheets are great , how do you create them and allow them to be downloaded on the fly from a web application ?
I 'll start with creation , and then explain how to make them available for download .
The following example uses Django as the web application framework , but the general concept is portable to any toolkit you like .
Creating an Excel Spreadsheet with Python
Excel is ( obviously ) a proprietary format , but it tries its best to be open ( sort of ) .
It 's pretty easy to open a comma-separated file from Excel and treat it as if it's a spreadsheet .
At the same time , it 's pretty easy to create a comma-separated file from Python .
Clearly , Python and Excel are made for each other , their common language being csv files .
The Python standard library comes with a nice csv writer class .
This brief example shows its use :
import csv w = csv.writer ( open ( ' output.csv ' , 'w ' ) ) for i in range ( 10 ) : w.writerow ( range ( 10 ) )
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
The contents of output.csv look like :
When the file is opened in Excel , you 're presented with a dialog that asks for the separator character .
Tell it comma and you 're all set .
That said , the extra step of working with a csv file might not be attractive to an end user .
Luckily , Roman Kiseliov has created an excellent library for writing binary Excel files with Python .
The library is called pyExcelerator and is available from its project page on Sourceforge .
The writer does n't require Windows , or Excel , which makes it even easier to run .
Similar to the previous csv example , you can write a 10 by 10 grid with pyExcelerator :
from pyExcelerator import * wb = Workbook ( ) ws0 = wb.add_sheet ( '0 ' ) for x in range ( 10 ) : for y in range ( 10 ) : # writing to a specific x , y ws0. write( x , y , " this is cell %s , %s " % ( x , y ) ) wb.save ( ' output.xls ' )
The scripts are similar , but there are a few key differences .
With pyExcelerator , you have to explicitly create a Workbook object and add a Worksheet object to it .
When you write to the Worksheet , you write to a specific x ,y location .
This gives you much more flexibility , but also requires you to visualize the grid as you write to it .
Although pyExcelerator is trickier to use , it 's much more powerful .
In addition to writing simple grids of data , you can format cells , insert Excel formulas , and generally take advantage of all the features you 'd expect from Excel .
With the csv writer , you 're limited to simple grids .

This article provides information that will be useful to developers that wish to update their extensions to work properly under Firefox 3 .
Before going further , there 's one helpful hint we can offer : if the only change your extension requires is a bump to the maxVersion field in its install manifest , and you host your extension at addons.
mozilla.org , you do n't actually need to upload a new version of your extension !
Simply use the Developer Control Panel at AMO to adjust the maxVersion .
You can avoid having to have your extension re-reviewed this way .
The first step -- and , for most extensions , the only one that will be needed -- is to update the install manifest file , install.rdf , to indicate compatibility with Firefox 3 .
Simply find the line indicating the maximum compatible version of Firefox ( which , for Firefox 2 , might look like this ) :
<em:maxVersion >2.0.*</em:maxVersion >
Change it to indicate compatibility with Firefox 3 :
<em:maxVersion >3.0.*</em:maxVersion >
Then reinstall your extension .
Note that Firefox 3 does away with the extra " .0 " in the version number , so instead of using " 3.0.0 . * , you only need to use " 3.0 . * " .
There have been ( and will continue to be ) a number of API changes that will likely break some extensions .
We 're still working on compiling a complete list of these changes .
Note :
If your extension still uses an Install.js script instead of an install.js scripts in XPI files .
If your extension still uses anscript instead of an install manifest , you need to make the transition to an install manifest now .
Firefox 3 no longer supportsscripts in XPI files .
Add localizations to the install manifest
Firefox 3 supports new properties in the install manifest to specify localized descriptions .
The old methods still work however the new allow Firefox to pick up the localizations even when the add - on is disabled and pending install .
See Localizing extension descriptions for more details .
If you are hosting addons yourself and not on a secure add - on hosting provider like addons.mozilla.org then you must provide a secure method of updating your add - on .
This will either involve hosting your updates on an SSL website , or using cryptographic keys to sign the update information .
Read Securing Updates for more information .
Step 3 : Deal with changed APIs
Several APIs have been changed in significant ways .
The most significant of these , which will likely affect a large number of extensions , are :
DOM
Nodes from external documents should be cloned using document.importNode ( ) ( or adopted using document.adoptNode ( ) ) before they can be inserted into the current document .
For more on the Node. ownerDocument issues , see the W3C DOM FAQ .
Firefox does n't currently enforce this rule ( it did for a while during the development of Firefox 3 , but too many sites break when this rule is enforced ) .
We encourage Web developers to fix their code to follow this rule for improved future compatibility .
Bookmarks & History
If your extension accesses bookmark or history data in any way , it will need substantial work to be compatible with Firefox 3 .
The old APIs for accessing this information have been replaced by the new Places architecture .
See the Places migration guide for details on updating your existing extension to use the Places API .
Download Manager
The Download Manager API has changed slightly due to the transition from an RDF data store to using the Storage API .
This should be a pretty easy transition to make .
In addition , the API for monitoring download progress has changed to support multiple download manager listeners .
See nsIDownloadManager , nsIDownloadProgressListener , and Monitoring downloads for more information .
Password Manager
If your extension accesses user login information using the Password Manager , it will need to be updated to use the new Login Manager API .
The article Using nsILoginManager includes examples , including a demonstration of how to write your extension to work with both the Password Manager and the Login Manager , so it will work with both Firefox 3 and earlier versions .
nsILoginInfo
nsILoginManager
You can also override the built - in password manager storage if you want to provide your own password storage implementation in your extensions .
See Creating a Login Manager storage module for details .
The XUL Popup system was heavily modified in Firefox 3 .
The Popup system includes main menus , context menus and popup panels .
A guide to using Popups has been created , detailing how the system works .
One thing to note is that popup .
has been deprecated in favor of new popup .
and popup . .
Autocomplete
The nsIAutoCompleteController interface 's handleEnter ( ) method has been changed to accept an argument that indicates whether the text was selected from the autocomplete popup or by the user pressing enter after typing text .
DOMParser
When a DOMParser is instantiated , it inherits the calling code 's principal and the documentURI and baseURI of the window the constructor came from .
is instantiated , it inherits the calling code 's principal and the and of the window the constructor came from .
If the caller has UniversalXPConnect privileges , it can pass parameters to new DOMParser ( ) .
If fewer than three parameters are passed , the remaining parameters will default to null .
The first parameter is the principal to use ; this overrides the default principal normally inherited .
The second parameter is the documentURI to use .
The third parameter is the baseURI to use .
.
If fewer than three parameters are passed , the remaining parameters will default to .
If you initialize a DOMParser using a contract , such as by calling createInstance ( ) , and you do n't call the DOMParser 's init ( ) method , attempting to initiate a parsing operation will automatically create and initialize the DOMParser with a null principal and null pointers for documentURI and baseURI .
Stop using the internal string API
The internal string API is no longer exported ; you must migrate to the external string API .
See these articles for helpful information :
Removed interfaces
The following interfaces were removed from Gecko 1.9 , which drives Firefox 3 .
If your extension makes use of any of these , you 'll need to update your code :
nsIDOMPaintListener
nsIDOMScrollListener
nsIDOMMutationListener
nsIDOMPageTransitionListener
nsICloseAllWindows ( see bug 386200 )
Step 4 : Check for relevant chrome changes
There have been a few changes to chrome layout that may affect some extensions .
New boxes
There has been a minor change to the chrome that may require changes in your code .
A new vbox has been added , called " browser - bottombox " , which encloses the find bar and status bar at the bottom of the browser window .
Although this does n't affect the appearance of the display , it may affect your extension if it overlays chrome relative to these elements .
For example , if you previously overlaid some chrome before the status bar , like this :
< window id =" main - window " > < something insertbefore = " status - bar " /> </window >
You should now overlay it like this :
< vbox id =" browser-bottombox " > < something insertbefore= " status - bar " /> </vbox >
Or use the following technique to make your overlay work on both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3 :
< window id =" main - window " > < vbox id =" browser-bottombox " insertbefore = " status - bar " > < something insertbefore = " status - bar " /> </vbox > </window >
Changed boxes
Extensions that attempt to overlay onto the " appcontent " box try to float chrome over document content will no longer display that material .
You should update your extension to use the new < xul : panel > XUL element .
If you wish to keep the panel from automatically disappearing after a delay , you can set the noautohide attribute to true .
Other changes
Add simple changes you had to make while updating your extension to work with Firefox 3 here .
A friend of mine contacted me asking my opinion on why Google is n’t loving Celebrity Cowboy .
Celebrity Cowboy is a celebrity blog that should be ranking well for a variety of terms is , for some reason , continually under - performing for its niche .
I told him that I would take a look at it , and while my speciality is n’t really search engines , I did notice a few things right off the bat .
Code
Positioning
One of the first things I noticed about the xhtml generated by the theme used at Celebrity Cowboy is that the blogroll is near the top of the page , with more than twenty items linking out to other sites .
While this is only on the front page of the site now , it was n’t always like this and could have lead to a black mark for the site .
Then there is the content , and then the list of internal links to each one of the more than two dozen categories .
Could Google be penalizing the site for having so many outbound links at the top of the page of code , and so many links near the bottom ?
Could they see this as an attempt to effect search engine rankings by stuffing links in a site ?
Things like this have happened before and Google has always been harsh on such things .
The flip side though is that all of these links are relevant .
Google does n’t penalize for relevant links , do they ?
With Google ’s war against paid links , I would be surprised if a few sites got caught in the crossfire , and with these links being site - wide , Google may have mistaken them as paid links .
No doubt they would like sites to make sure to no -follow their blogrolls and other external links that are n’t part of the normal daily content , despite being relative .
Validation
The theme that Celebrity Cowboy is using does n’t validate .
Google has proved time and time again that if you do n’t work hard on making your code valid , you can cause yourself to drop in the rankings , and even sometimes to be marked as a “ bad ” site .
Sometimes sites get listed on stopbadware.org just because their JavaScript does n’t work correctly , or advertising does n’t load properly .
I have seen this happen to more than a few sites .
Fixing up as many validation issues as possible , could help remove the penalty placed on the site , as Google ’s indexing bots might then be able to index the content more efficiently , and without error .
One of the things I first noticed was that there is an ID used more than once , something that probably does n’t effect the Google search bots , but something that is not correct in xhtml .
Classes should be used for repeating items , not ID’s .
Correcting such things should also improve how various browsers render the site , which could have the side effect of increasing traffic , page views , and even links to the blog .
Just Plain Strange
There was one more thing about the coding of the site that really got me scratching my head .
It seems that the header image is displayed via CSS , and so rather than showing an image with the proper hyperlink code around it , the coder chose to use JavaScript to make the div that the header is shown thanks to , into a clickable item that uses location .
href to bring the visitor back to the index page .
To me this seems like a very bad way to do this effect , and probably not one that Google looks highly on .
Content
One issue that Google has with many sites , especially celebrity sites is “ thin content ” .
They constantly adjust rankings based on this issue .
So many articles on Celebrity Cowboy have less than one hundred words , and this can make Google cranky .
An example of a post that has really thin content is the George Clooney Reacts to Nicole Kidman ’s Pregnancy post .
There are less than two dozen words here , and an image .
Surely the writer could give a few more points about both George Clooney , Nicole Kidman , and older actresses being pregnant .
I suggest increasing the number of articles that include over a one hundred words , reducing blockquotes from other sites , lists of external links , and other content which does n’t increase the usefulness of Celebrity Cowboy .
There should be at least one hundred words of fresh , original content in as many articles as possible .
This is made worse when you remove information around a single post .
Remove images , external links , advertisements , repeated content like the popular articles list , and about text , and you are left with very little actual content for Google to sift through , with a very high amount of code .
Another way of reducing this thin content issue , on the front page , and each subsequent page and archive area is to increase the amount of stories shown per page , and while this might not be as important on the front page , it is definitely an issue on other pages , and archive areas where only summaries are shown .
There is a plug - in for WordPress that allows you to change how many posts are shown depending on where the user is on the site .
I would suggest enacting this plug - in , and increasing each page to between fifteen and twenty - five posts .
While this will make pages longer , it will mean more content per page for Google to see , and the increase in code and loading times should be negligible .
Comments
Another suggestion on how to help your blog would be to find a way to increase user participation in the form of comments .
You could highlight the person who has commented the most , or feature the best comment of the week .
The cost would be an outbound link , but the reward could be more comments , which can help keep a post fresh in the eyes of search engines , and contribute to the content indexed on the page .
I have actually ranked fairly high for a keyword that I did n’t write , but instead it was because a person commented and Google saw it .
Links
Just like the “ thin content ” penalty that Celebrity Cowboy may be getting , another issue might be the sheer number of links on each and every page .
Also , in talking to the owner of the site , it seems that at one point they were both selling text link advertisements and promoting unrelated websites , neither of which Google looks very kindly on .
Content Scrapers
We all know what it means to deal with spam blogs , but it looks like Celebrity Cowboy has been targeted hard .
A search on the popular search engines for specific titles show some very interesting results .
It seems that Google has basically given in to content scrapers in this case , and Celebrity Cowboy is nowhere to be seen .
Something that might help identify content scrapers is to make sure you use plugins for WordPress that allow you to put a copyright notice before the content only in RSS .
Also , Feedburner should list people using your content for bad things .
Then it is just a matter of “ nicely ” asking them to stop or using htaccess to block their server ’s IP address from even seeing the feed .
A good example of what is happening in regards to the content scrapers is when you take an article , with a unique title and search for it on Google .
You will see a the post that was made on Celebrity Cowboy about Constantine Maroulis showing up on a content scraper site , before Celebrity Cowboy , where it was originally written .
This unfortunately seems to be happening on nearly every post .
Images
One of the things I noticed on a quick view of the code being generated is that on each image and embedded item in the content , there is extra style being added to remove padding , margins and borders .
This is only beefing up the amount of code that Google sees , and contributing to the “ thin content ” problem I mentioned earlier .
This is most likely being added thanks to the WYSIWYG editor built into WordPress .
Advertising
Recently , there was a big issue with sites selling text link advertisements , and Google took steps to persuade people to stop selling such links , and while Celebrity Cowboy no longer has paid text links on the site , Google may not have fully restored the site in their search engine rankings .
I have n’t heard of anyone else really having such issues , in fact , most people that saw their PageRank drop due to a penalty for selling links , did n’t notice any shift in their search engine results .
Context
When a site changes both in design and server , which Celebrity Cowboy has , I am sure that Google “ raises and eyebrow ” .
Google , or at least the program that indexes our blogs probably asks itself , “ has the site been sold , or changed so much that we should re-index it ?
Is it really the same site we have come to know and love , or should we put it in the sandbox for a while ? ”
Surely , with all the changes that Google has seen happen to the site , it is n’t going to carry on without giving it an extra dose of scrutiny .
Unfortunately , if there was some extra weight behind the site in the past , it may have lost this through changing IP addresses .
I have n’t heard of this happening before , but it does n’t mean it is n’t a possibility .
Google has done some strange things in the past , and Celebrity Cowboy is n’t the only example of something like this happening .
You could be doing everything right for a long period of time , yet something changes with Google , and you are pushed so far down the rankings , that you almost have to start again with a new site .
Steps Already Taken
Over on Celebrity Cowboy , they have been trying very hard to take every step they can think of to rectify their search engine problem , and here are just a few that were mentioned to me :
Changed the blogroll to only show up on the front page Show categories in the right column after the content
Only show categories with at least 5 posts Removed all text link ads Removed all unrelated , self - owned cross promotion Cleaned up theme code to remove unnecessary tags Worked on building more links within the celebrity niche
It seems like many steps have been taken , but the search engines , especially Google , have n’t changed their view towards Celebrity Cowboy .
Could it be a waiting game now , as the last major change was changing servers in the middle of November 2007 ?
I doubt it .
I am positive that there needs to be more work done on the site in order for the search engine penalty to be removed .
Suggestion Rundown
Get your code to validate
Increase content per post
Promote people that comment
Decrease outbound links
Fight content scrapers
Deal with garbage code being added to posts
Nofollow all links that are not in your content , or part of your own site
There is no reason why Google would prefer content scrapers over the original content providers , and I hope this is just an error on their part that they will eventually fix , but the reality is that their mistakes effect bloggers and business owners , and if they do n’t get better at providing helpful , valuable , and correct search results , people will eventually move somewhere that does .
For Celebrity Cowboy , and other sites that have been similarly effected , I know this can be very frustrating , but the best thing you can do is complain loudly , and hope that the Internet backs you up in your fight to be properly considered in the major search engines .
Hopefully , this will change soon and that the tips I have listed will help enough to at least be ranked higher than the scrapers .

When members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence gather Wednesday afternoon to take the special unmarked elevator to the secure “ crypt ” to hear a closed briefing on the destruction of CIA videotapes , they wo n’t be hearing from their star witness .
Jose Rodriguez Jr. , the former CIA director of operations , who has been identified as having ordered the destruction of two videotapes recording the waterboarding of two terrorism suspects , “ remains under subpoeana , ” says a committee staffer .
But the committee has agreed to defer his appearance .
“ His lawyer has indicated he is not going to answer questions , ” without immunity , the staffer continued .
“ The committee reserves the right to call him ” at a later date .
“ We ’re pleased that the committee is considering our request for immunity , ” says Robert S. Bennett , Rodriguez ’ attorney .
“ It ’s only fair in light of the fact that he has not been given access to the documents he needs to defend himself with . ”
The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that among those documents which might explain Rodriguez ’ order to destroy the tapes are a late 2005 classified cable from the retiring Bangkok station chief asking if he could destroy the videotapes recorded and stored in Thailand .
Perhaps more influential on his decision , the Post reports , in the same time period as the retiring station chief ’s request , “ the CIA had a new director [ Porter Goss ] and an acting general counsel [ John Rizzo ] , neither of whom sought to block the destruction of the tapes , according to agency officials . ”
Appearing at the closed House intelligence committee briefing Wednesday at 2 pm will be only one witness : Rizzo , who served as acting general counsel at the time the videotapes were destroyed .
Earlier news reports indicate that both Rizzo and Goss claim they expressed opposition to the destruction of the tapes .
The Post piece Wednesday would call the strength of that opposition to the tapes ’ destruction into question .
News reports and his attorney indicate that Rodriguez says he was advised by lawyers in the Directorate of Operations that he had the legal authority to order the destruction of the tapes in 2005 .
The tapes reportedly record the 2002 interrogation of two terrorism suspects , Abu Zubayda , an al Qaeda suspect captured in Pakistan in March 2002 , and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , a suspect in the bombing of the USS Cole .
Members of the 9/11 commission , which had repeatedly asked the CIA to turn over all relevant material for their investigation , have indicated that they believe the CIA may have obstructed justice in destroying the tapes .
So too have defense lawyers for other terrorism suspects .
On Tuesday , House Judiciary committee Democrats asked the attorney general to appoint a special counsel in the CIA destroyed tapes case , according to the AP .
Attorney general Michael Mukasey had previously appointed a federal prosecutor to investigate the case .
Should the House intelligence committee grant Rodriguez immunity from prosecution , it would certainly complicate and potentially imperil the parallel Justice Department criminal inquiry into the tapes ’ destruction .
Yet , some Washington observers question Congress ’ commitment to getting to the bottom of the decision to destroy the tapes .
They also note that once again , the episode has all the hallmarks of a classic Washington scandal : all the attention is focused not on what ’s on the tapes — waterboarding — but on their destruction .
“ There is a concerted effort in Washington to keep the focus of the investigation away from torture , ” says George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley .
“ Both Democrats and Republicans are struggling to do that , as if there is nothing on the tapes . ”
“ The reason is obvious , ” Turley continued .
Congressional intelligence oversight committee members “ knew about the torture program .
It ’s the only explanation ” for their confirming Mukasey even though he refused to answer the question of whether waterboarding is torture .
FTP hosting is often much cheaper than regular web hosting .
The upload with an ftp client is for sure the most common way , but could be a problem for people behind a firewall or without enough rights ( capabilities ) to install a FTP client .
For those a upload via a web form is the best solution .
Upload limitations by your web server
The default value for file uploads within PHP is 2MB , if you need to upload bigger files you need to change your PHP configuration or need to create a .htaccess file with this code to upload files of max .
16MB :
php_value upload_max_filesize 16 M
php_value post_max_size 20 M
The value for the post_max_size is larger than the value for the upload_max_size because we want to be able to upload more than just a file ( also other data via text fields or text areas ) .
The .htaccess file needs to be in the same directory than your PHP upload script .
Using cURL for file transmissions
cURL is a great library for file transmissions via different types of protocols .
The library supports the transport via POST , GET , FTP upload and much more .
cURL is also able to authenticate on the target server or website .
In this tutorial we want to upload a file to some ( password protected ) remote FTP server via a web form .
< form action =" curlupload.php " method= " post " enctype=" multipart/form-data " > < div > < label for = " upload " >
Select file </ label > < input name = " upload " type = " file " /> < input type =" submit " name = " Submit " value= " Upload " /> </div> </ form >
The form is simple and has only one file field and the submit button .
Do n’t forget to protect this kind of pages .
Next we need some PHP code to handle the upload and opens a stream to send the file via cURL to the remote FTP server ( place this code above the html code ) :
if ( isset ( $ _POST [ ' Submit ' ] ) ) { if ( ! empty ($_FILES [ ' upload ' ] [ ' name ' ] ) ) { $ ch = curl_init ( ) ; $ localfile = $ _FILES [ ' upload ' ] [ ' tmp_name ' ] ; $ fp = fopen ( $ localfile , 'r ' ) ; curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT_URL , 'ftp://ftp_login:[email protected ]/'.$ _FILES [ 'upload ' ] [ ' name ' ] ) ; curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT_UPLOAD , 1 ) ; curl_setopt ( $ch , CURLOPT_INFILE , $ fp ) ; curl_setopt ( $ch , CURLOPT_INFILESIZE , filesize ( $ localfile ) ) ; curl_exec ( $ ch ) ; $ error_no = curl_errno ( $ch ) ; curl_close ( $ ch ) ; if ( $error_no == 0 ) { $ error = ' File uploaded succesfully . ' ; } else { $ error = ' File upload error . ' ; } } else { $ error = ' Please select a file . ' ; } }
After the user has selected a file , the data is uploaded to the web server .
We open the temp file with fopen and the cURL session is initialized .
Together with the URL for the remote FTP server , we send the FTP login and password to the target location .
The other cURL settings are required to send the file via the FTP protocol to the target server .
If the returned error code is equal “ 0 ” , the upload was successful .
This small PHP snippet is responsible for the upload to some remote FTP server .
We suggest using more validation routines in a production environment .

Browse column T he low point of the Bush - Putin press conference last month in Bratislava came when a Russian " journalist " in the press pool threw out what appeared to be a clearly - scripted question .
It went to the heart of Russia 's profound grievance with America - its " double speak " or " double standards " or " hypocrisy . "
After several questions aimed at pressing Putin on the sorry state of democracy in Russia , an Interfax journalist asked , " To follow up on the issue of democratic institutions , President Bush recently stated that the press in Russia is not free .
What is this lack of freedom all about ?
: Why do n't you talk a lot about violations of the rights of journalists in the United States , about the fact that some journalists have been fired ? "
" So between us , George , how do you censor your press and still get to lecture me ? "
" I ... what ?
Vladimir , I really do n't know what you 're talking about . "
To Americans , especially the American press , the question was absurd .
It provoked , at best , a giant sneer , and at worst , a " toldya the Russians are still a bunch of evil commie bastards ! " reaction from the Russophobic Right .
Bush 's actual response - " I do n't know what journalists you 're referring to " - summed up American delusional thinking best .
Such a thing could not possibly happen in America .
Even when it does happen - which is pretty often , in ways both covert and overt - Americans would still look at you like a complete loony , a " conspiracy theorist , " if you told them journalists get fired in the US for not behaving the way people in power want them to .
The most recent example of American censorship was also the most personal and threatening example .
This past Monday , Jeff Koyen , editor of the alt - weekly The New York Press , was forced to resign ( he was given two weeks suspension without pay , which left Koyen with no choice but to resign or accept castration ) after New York 's top politicians , from Senators Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer down to New York Congressman Weiner and aides to Mayor Michael Bloomberg , all attacked the last issue 's cover story , " 52 Funniest Things About the Upcoming Death of the Pope . "
The piece was written by former eXile co-editor Matt Taibbi , who writes a regular column now for the Press ( both I and Dr. Dolan are also regular contributors ) .
For those of you who do n't know , The New York Press is a weekly free alternative newspaper that was founded about a decade ago to challenge the Village Voice , which had withered into cultural and dynamic irrelevance over the years .
The Pope - Dying piece in question was one of those ideas that are hilarious as a concept but wind up getting ruined in the transfer from idea to print , something our readers have grown accustomed to over the years due to our rigorous corporate culture which enforces shoddy work habits at the eXile .
Organized types are brutally hazed and find they hit a glass ceiling at about the intern level : after all , we 're geniuses , you know :
Yet the Pope gag sent the entire East Coast Power Elite into full spectrum mob attack mode , starting with the highest powers in the state .
Here are some examples .
New York Senator Chuck Schumer : " This is the most disgusting thing I 've seen in 30 years of public life " ; Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton : " It is outrageously offensive to make light of [ the Pope 's ] physical suffering , which he has borne with such strength , dignity and grace " ; and New York Representative Anthony Weiner , a future candidate for mayor , actually called on the people of New York to commit a serious crime when he publicly stated , " Everyone has a right to free speech , but I hope New Yorkers exercise their right to take as many of these rags as they can and put them in the trash .

The Most Revolutionary Microsoft Technology You ’ve Never Heard Of 12 Apr 2007
Nope , it ’s not from Microsoft Research .
It does n’t hail from Cambridge or Mountainview , nor is it some underbelly technology in Microsoft Vista that only Mark Russinovich and the responsible SDE is aware of .
Rather , it ’s a new service - oriented application model built on two overlapping technologies : Decentralized Software Services ( DSS ) and the Concurrency and Coordination Runtime ( CCR ) .
It is currently shipping as part of the Microsoft Robotics Studio ( more on that later ) and is poised to disrupt the way we think about the Windows Communication Framework ( WCF ) and the way we design , architect , and implement distributed applications .
It is a work of genius .
CCR / DSS ( which clearly needs a more catchy moniker , such as Erlang# or Microsoft Nano ) is the brainchild of Henrik F Nielsen and George Chrysanthakopoulos , a Lennon - McCartney , Morrissey - Marr pairing of gearheads that is n’t often seen in software since Carmack met Romero and formed id Software .
Henrik was co-author of the HTTP protocol and Microsoft ’s lead envoy to the W3C SOAP committee , and George was one of the wizards that got all the bits and bare metal talking to each other in the original Xbox project .
I spoke with them on a recent visit to Redmond and heard first - hand about the things they ’re working on .
The story about how these two met and came to work with each other is unfortunately unsatisfying and arbitrary .
Plucked by whim from Microsoft ’s technologista , Henrik , a fair bespectacled rail , and George , a raucous Dale Carnegie of the software world , were thrust together in an office to have a think about how complex distributed software ought to be written .
As luck would have it , they hit it off , and they have been vibrating with technological creativity ever since .
An early prototype demonstrated a bank of computers , each outfitted with mouse , keyboard , audio , and graphics .
In their demo , they mixed and matched the peripherals in real - time through a web - browser , routing the keyboard of one to the other , the graphics from one to the other , and so forth for all of the peripherals .
It was a perfect , seamless , high - performance Frankenstein , and it challenged many ingrained assumptions at Microsoft about how operating systems should be written .
They have since generalized their work and developed something that should scare the bejeezus out of the .NET Framework guys , if only they were paying enough attention to it .
Imagine an application model composed of ubiquitous state - driven services .
Each service has a little bulletin board of richly - typed key / value pairs and can trigger events whenever a value is changed .
Services can be instantiated anywhere where there is a lightweight service host ( such as a PC , microprocessor , browser , or smartphone ) and can register themselves as visible to other services , either by kind or identity .
Services easily detect , address , and send messages to each other , requesting changes to each other ’s state values and registering for another ’s change notifications .
Running services can migrate from machine to machine .
Service state is completely versioned and serializable and can be backed up , restored , and rolled forward and back in time .
Rich exception information flows between deep trees of services along lines of causality , regardless of whether the services are on the same machine or across the world .
Each service and its state can be trivially viewed and modified from a web browser with no extra work , but can also be locked down using several different layers of security .
Now imagine that that application model supported a level of high - performance concurrency usually relegated to specialized language systems like Erlang .
If you were to imagine all that as a fully - managed .NET system , you ’ve got a decent picture of what CCR / DSS is all about .
Working with the framework offers many “ duh / aha / of course ” moments ; it quickly becomes clear that the way they did it is exactly the way it should be done .
The idea of a constellation of communicating , state - driven services is n’t necessarily revolutionary , but their conception and execution of that idea is .
The framework was conceived not just as a library , but as a full - blown application model .
It ’s an elegant work , esoteric to a point , but transformative and crystalline in purpose .
It is also yet another reminder that the top one percent of engineers are of an entirely different ilk than the rest of us .
It ’s not that the quality or quantity of their work is untouchable ( though it comes close ) ; rather , it comes down to the completeness of their work and the ease with which they do it , like they were jumping over a puddle .
Capable of glimpsing a sublime solution to a problem and sketching it up without syntax errors in the back pages of a Moleskine notebook , the top one percent of engineers are the technological equivalent of a three - year old solving a Rubik ’s cube or a twelve - year old scoring symphonies for the New Haven Symphony Orchestra .
They can bind creativity to purpose and realize it with great fidelity .
Henrik and George are in that top one percent .
So why then , as previously mentioned , is this incredible Leninist technology squirreled away in the oddball Microsoft Robotics Studio ?
It ’s not that CCR / DSS has any deep relationship to robots or robotics .
There are at least two answers to that question .
First , it is true that robotics marry well with a state - driven application model .
Servos have speed and position values , on / off flags , and service records .
Sensors have sensor data .
Robots can contain an arbitrary number of services that need to route information and events to and from each other .
In a sense , a robot is kind of distributed system on a chassis .
Though robotics are n’t the fat part of the market for a technology like CCR / DSS , it certainly is an interesting playground for it .
Second , Microsoft ’s internal version of Pin the Tail on the Donkey is called Pin the Product on the Ship Vehicle .
For various reasons , Microsoft ca n’t simply ship a couple assemblies and a lone executable all by itself .
It did n’t fit temporally or politically in the Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 effort , and it was n’t large enough to stand on its own .
So , for better or worse , it became the backbone of Microsoft Robotics Studio ( along with the very interesting Visual Programming Language or VPL ) .
I ’ll write some more about CCR / DSS in the near future , but in the meantime , check out the wiki , watch a video or two and install Microsoft Robotics Studio .
Right now it ’s a bit like a 1966 VW Bug fitted with a turbocharged Porsche engine .
And , yes , the documentation is meager .
But that ’s okay .
We know how to pop the hood .

On September 10 , 2001 , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld admitted that the Pentagon had lost , by the estimate he chose to use for his speech , 2.3 trillion dollars .
Many of you good readers know about this , and are asking where the money went .
That 's a good question , but what really intrigues me is :
Where did it come from ?
If you add up the entire US defense budgets from 1996 to 2001 , you only come up with circa 1.6 trillion .
Yet , according to Rummy , not only was that much money lost , but an ADDITIONAL 700 BILLION dollars has disappeared .
Remember , we 're talking about 2.3 trillion dollars " missing . "
Exact figures very by source , but are close to each other , so I 'll deal in round numbers .
To come up with 2.3 trillion dollars of military spending , you have to add up all the defense budgets from about 1991 to 2001 .
For all those years , the Pentagon spent hundreds of billions and did n't get a single receipt , did n't account for a single dime ?
Not possible , and no one 's claiming that it happened .
The missing money was part of some budget , but it 's a number bigger than the defense budgets we 're to believe it 's a " part " of , so it was a part of some OTHER budget , one we do n't know about .
1996 through 2001 is a lot of years for the Government Accounting Office ( GAO ) to fail to notice that the entire defense budget went missing .
I do n't believe they did fail to notice it , because the missing money was n't on the books to begin with .
It could n't have been ; it 's more money than we gave them .
This is not an accounting error .
We know the soldiers and sailors got paid , the tanks and planes got bought , and the missiles got purchased , because the companies that made them cashed the checks , and the banks issued statements showing that the money went out and to whom it went .
We know that most of that money got properly accounted for , because the GAO and OMB have been checking figures , making recommendations for savings , etc. , and would have spotted a gap of any real size .
We also suspect the usual drugs , cars , mansions , and hookers of all ages and sexes .
But all these only add up to the official hundreds of billions , not the missing thousands of billions .
Most of the missing money could never have been part of a defense budget , and could not have come from our government .
It had to have come from someone else , someone who MUST want the Pentagon to do something for them .
Nobody gives gifts that big but God .
So , just who hired the Pentagon to do whatever they hired it to do ?
Who wrote those checks ?
What are they paying for ?
When do they expect it ?
Who is its target ?
How can we put a stop to this blatant prostitution ?
I have no answers , but I can narrow the list : not many people outside the Federal Reserve owners have access to that kind of money .
And not many people beside the Federal Reserve owners want to use the American military and its loyal , devoted troops to bend the world to their will .
Come to think of it , NO ONE outside the Federal Reserve owners meets those two criteria .
You can't change the plantation , and there has never been a successful peasant revolt throughout history .
You can , however , leave the plantation , build a position of strength , and then take the plantation from the slavers and run it according to sane principles .
I 'm preparing to do exactly that .
I think you should , too .

+ Child and Adult — Me and You and Everyone We Know
This highly controversial kiss ( combined with the earlier teenaged sex scene ) probably lead to the film earning an 18 rating despite the absence of violence and foul language .
Here we see the young boy , Robby , meeting the middle - aged Art Gallery owner that he had been leading on ( on the internet ) with his talk of “ pooping back and forth ” .
The gallery owner realizes that he is the “ man ” she has been chatting with and kisses him goodbye despite the fact that he is about 8 years old .
Surprisingly the scene illicits a feeling of sympathy for the lady rather than disgust .
This controversial film has won awards at Cannes , Sundance , Philadelphia , San Francisco , Newport , and Los Angeles .

In an otherwise unremarkable case involving a homeowner 's personal injury dispute , a Florida appeals court judge recently issued a remarkable dissent on the evils of mandatory binding arbitration .
It opens with a somewhat sarcastic how - to guide for home manufacturers who want to deprive consumers of their judicial remedies and then launches into a critique of the state of the law .
Here 's an excerpt :
What we have begun to see is that virtually all consumer transactions , no matter the size or type , now contain an arbitration clause .
And with every reinforcing decision , these clauses become ever more brazenly loaded to the detriment of the consumer -- who gets to be the arbitrator ; when , where , how much it costs ; what claims are excluded ; what damages are excluded ; what statutory remedies are excluded ; what discovery is allowed ; what notice provisions are required ; what shortened statutes of limitation apply ; what prerequisites even to the right to arbitrate are thrown up -- not to mention the fairness or accuracy of the decision itself .
The drafters have every incentive to load these arbitration clauses with such onerous provisions in favor of the seller because the worst that ever happens , if the consumer has the resources to go to court , is that the offending provisions are severed .
The state courts , demoralized by the United States Supreme Court 's disapproval , have too often allowed these overreaching provisions to succeed .
Most consumers can't read them , wo n't read them , do n't understand them , do n't understand their implication and can't afford counsel to help them out .
It is the role of the state courts to determine whether an arbitration provision is unconscionable and it is time that we take that responsibility seriously .
This dissent does n't say anything that has n't been said many times before , but it does say it forcefully -- and at a time when Congress is beginning to take notice .
Ultimately , the question is n't whether state courts take their role seriously , but whether federal law should stand in the way , and only Congress can decide that question .

Muscles usually contract when a neurotransmitter molecule is released from nerve cells onto muscle cells .
But University of Utah scientists discovered that bare subatomic protons can act like larger , more complex neurotransmitters , making gut muscles contract in tiny round worms so the worms can poop .
“ There are relatively few molecules that serve as neurotransmitters to trigger electrical changes in cells .
Protons are the only new members of this group in nearly 20 years , ” says biology Professor Erik Jorgensen , scientific director of the Brain Institute at the University of Utah and senior author of the study in the Jan. 11 issue of the journal Cell .
While conventional neurotransmitters such as serotonin , dopamine and GABA are molecules made of many atoms , the new study revealed a surprise : Protons – which are single hydrogen atoms stripped of their electrons – are pumped out of a round worm ’s gut by one kind of protein and then bind to receptor proteins on neighboring muscles , making the muscles contract so the worm defecates .
Not only did the researchers show protons can act like neurotransmitters , they identified the genes and proteins involved in the process in round worms , which are about 1 millimeter ( a 25th of an inch ) long and also are known as nematodes .
Previous research indicated the brains of humans and mice also have proton pumps and receptors to move protons between cells .
The new study raises the possibility those protons may be transmitting nerve signals in the brain , says Jorgensen and study co-author Wayne Davis , a research assistant professor of biology .
“ This is the first time we have found protons acting as transmitters , ” Davis says .
“ It could be that these processes occur in humans .
There are proton pumps present in intestinal cells and in the brain of humans and mice .
Some of the pumps are thought to make acid for the gut to digest food .
But why are proton pumps in the brain ? ”
Jorgensen adds : “ Mice lacking the proton receptor cannot learn .
It may be that the proton pump and receptor are required for learning , ” and thus protons may act like neurotransmitters in the brain .
Utah graduate student Asim Beg ( now at Columbia University ) conducted the study with Jorgensen , Davis , graduate student Paola Nix and postdoctoral researcher Glen Ernstrom .
A Discovery from Constipated Worms
Atoms are made of nuclei that contain positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons , orbited by negatively charged electrons .
So protons are among the smallest components of matter .
Previously recognized neurotransmitters such as serotonin ( known for its role in preventing depression ) and dopamine ( involved in addiction to cocaine and other drugs ) are more than 100 times larger than protons .
That makes protons “ the world ’s smallest transmitter , ” says Jorgensen , also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator .
Acids burn because they contain high concentrations of protons , which already were known to help the stomach digest food .
The new study shows that at least in some circumstances , protons also may be used by cells to communicate .
“ Normally you think of proton concentration increasing to digest food , ” Davis says .
“ Now we see the cell is using these protons to communicate .
The protons are acting like a word in a language that cells use to talk to each other . ”
When the study began , nobody thought a new transmitter would be identified .
Instead , the researchers were trying to understand how worms poop .
Why " “ Eating , moving , having sex and pooping are common things that all animals do , ” says Davis .
Nematodes , or Caenorhabditis elegans , have about 1,000 cells and are simple animals studied by researchers worldwide .
Nematodes have many of the same tissues – nerves , muscle and intestine – that are found in humans , and most of the same genes , making the worm a model for studying human biology .
Defecation in round worms is surprisingly complex .
The animal has muscle contractions every 50 seconds that result in expulsion of intestinal contents .
The 50 - second cycle is an example of a biological clock , like those that regulate wake - sleep cycles and many other behaviors in animals .
“ We were interested in teasing apart the components required for [ defecation ] clock function , ” says Nix .
“ To do that we searched for mutations that affected the clock . ”
By exposing worms to chemicals that altered their DNA , the researchers found mutant worms that could n’t defecate or had trouble doing so .
“ The worms are constantly eating , so if they do n’t poop regularly , they become very constipated , ” says Nix .
In the round worm ’s tail , muscles surround the tube - shaped intestine , and there is a fluid - filled space between the intestine and the surrounding muscles .
The muscles contract to help the worm defecate .
The researchers identified two different gene mutations that prevented such contractions .
Proteins and Protons Propel Pooping Process
One gene , named pbo -4 ( for posterior body contraction ) , produces a protein that pumps protons out of the intestine , acting “ like a revolving door where sodium is allowed in [ the gut ] while protons go out [ of the gut ] into the fluid - filled space that is very close to the surrounding muscle , ” says Davis .
The second gene , pbo -5 , makes a receptor protein on the muscles that surround the gut .
After the protons are released from the intestine , they bind to the receptor protein .
“ The receptor acts like an ear that allows the muscle to hear that protons are present , ” says Beg .
The receptor opens when the proton binds to it , forming a hole in the muscle cell that allows large numbers of ions like sodium to flow in .
The ions make the muscle contract .
The researchers knew protons were being released from the gut because they could see their effects through a microscope .
They bred worms with a green fluorescent protein that loses it color when many protons are present .
The adult worms had the green protein in the fluid - filled space between the intestine and the surrounding muscle – a space that Ernstrom says “ is approximately 1,000 times smaller than the width of a hair . ”
The scientists were able to show protons were pumped from the intestinal wall and to the surrounding muscle because , under a microscope , the fluid - filled space became less green .
In mutant worms lacking the proton pump , the green remained unchanged , showing that protons were not released from the gut into the space .
In the next experiment , the researchers added protons to the fluid - filled space between the intestine and surrounding muscle in the mutants lacking the proton pump .
The added protons made the muscle contract .
That indicated protons indeed were acting like a neurotransmitter to carry the signal for contraction from the intestine to the surrounding muscle .
“ To prove that it is the protons triggering the contraction , we want to supply the protons ourselves , ” says Davis .
“ A fine needle filled with protons was used to inject protons in the space between the muscle and gut .
We can bypass the gut and fool the muscle into thinking the gut is releasing protons , and the muscle contracts . ”

■ iPod touchの時刻が狂う状況を確認した
昨日、iPod touchを同期すると激しく時刻が狂うと書いたら、ツッコミでタイムゾーンの設定によって直るという情報をもらい、喜び勇んで確認したら、狂わないはずの設定になっていた。ガセでした。
その後2chなどの噂話をたどっていて、「スタンバイから復帰すると狂う」という情報を見かけ、これを追試してみたらビンゴだった。スタンバイじゃなくて休止状態だったけど。以下のようにすると確実に狂う。他の条件( Vistaとか)はつめていない:
WindowsXPでiTunesを立ち上げっぱなしで「休止状態」にする 休止状態から復帰後、iPod touchをつなげて同期させる
ケーブルにつなぐと、まだiTunesが認識してないじゃないかと思うくらい間髪を入れずに時刻が狂う。あまりに見事なので、思わずビデオに撮ってしまった。こんな動画でわざわざニコ動の帯域を使うまでもないのでYouTubeに:
本体とケーブルをつなぐために手が2本必要なため、カメラを持つための余分な手がなくなってしまったので一時的にフレームが乱れているが気にしないこと。ケーブル接続後、改めてカメラを構える余裕もほとんどないくらい瞬時に時刻が狂っているのがわかる。
おれはノートだけじゃなくデスクトップでもスタンバイ(というか休止状態)を活用しているので、毎回毎回、同期するたびに狂うわけだ。一度発狂したiTunesは、立ち上げ直さない限り確実にiPod touchを狂わせる。明らかにiTunesのバグだろう。とっとと直せ〜

If this Times report is at all right , Republicans will hold any attempt to help the economy now hostage to yet another try at making the Bush tax cuts permanent — thereby , among other things , crippling future possibilities for health care reform .
I suspected that ’s what would happen , but thought that maybe , just maybe , the GOP would be sufficiently scared by the prospect of a nasty recession in an election year that it would back off .
Guess not .
Just a reminder : here ’s the evidence on which Republicans base their faith that making the Bush tax cuts permanent is absatively , posolutely , essential to prosperity :
Update : Rereading this , I think I could have been clearer .
The only way anything useful will get done by way of stimulus in the next few months is if both parties agree not to demand anything that would tie the hands of the next president and Congress — that means no long - term spending plans from the Dems , no long - term tax cuts from the GOP .
And it seems that the Republicans are already making it clear that they wo n’t play it that way ; they ’re trying to hold any help for the economy hostage to their agenda , which is exactly what happened 7 years ago .
REDMOND , Wash. , Nov. 6 ( AP ) — Microsoft said Tuesday that it had fired its chief information officer , Stuart L. Scott , for violations of company policies , but a spokesman declined to give the exact reason for the dismissal .
“ Stuart Scott ’s employment with Microsoft was terminated after an investigation for violation of company policies , ” a Microsoft spokesman , Lou Gellos , said , reading from a company statement .
Mr. Gellos said Mr. Scott was dismissed Friday .
He would not elaborate .
According to Microsoft ’s Web site , Mr. Scott was responsible for the information technology infrastructure at the company , the world ’s largest software maker .
He reported to B. Kevin Turner , Microsoft ’s chief operating officer , who in turn reports directly to the chief executive , Steven A. Ballmer .
Mr. Scott joined Microsoft in 2005 after 17 years at General Electric , according to Microsoft .
Mr. Gellos said that Alain Crozier , a corporate vice president who also reports to Mr. Turner , and Shahla Aly , a general manager in the services group , would take over Mr. Scott ’s duties until a successor is found .
One of the most fascinating talks at the TED conference so far was given by Jill Bolte Taylor , a neuroanatomist , who gave a riveting account of a stroke she experienced in 1996 .
( TED stands for Technology , Entertainment and Design . )
Taylor 's knowledge of the brain made her the perfect witness to her body 's gradual shutdown .
Over the course of four hours she watched her body deteriorate in stages , all the while processing its breakdown as if she were a curious explorer taking field notes .
The first to go was her perception of herself as separate from the objects around her .
I should step back and say that before she described what happened to her brain and body , she brought out a real brain on stage , with spinal cord attached to it , and explained the distinctions between the functions performed by the right and left hemispheres of the brain .
The right hemisphere , she said , is all about the present .
It processes information from the sensory systems to give us a picture of the current moment – what it looks , smells , sounds and feels like .
The left hemisphere makes a collage of the present moment , picks out details and categorizes them and associates them with everything in the past that we 've ever learned and then projects it into the future to determine possibilities .
It 's the left hemisphere she says where brain chatter resides and the voice that says " I am . "
This is the part of the brain that says we 're something separate from the scenery around us , and this is the part of the brain she temporarily lost during her stroke .
So on the morning of December 10 , 1996 , Taylor awoke with pounding , caustic pain behind her left eye .
It came in waves , gripping and releasing her .
Nonetheless , she started her morning routine , oblivious to what was happening .
She jumped on an exercise machine and looked down at her hands and says they looked like primitive claws to her .
She did n't recognize her body as hers .
" It was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my consciousness of personality to where a mysterious person was having this experience , " she said .
She also could n't define the boundaries of where her body ended and the things around her began .
The molecules of her arm blended with the molecules in the wall .
It made her feel enormous and expansive and connected to all of the energy around her , which gave her a sense of peace .
" Imagine what it would feel like to lose thirty - seven years of emotional baggage , " she said .
It occurred to her that she had to get to work , but then her right arm became paralyzed and that 's when she finally realized she was having a stroke .
She says rather than feel panic , her brain said , " Wow , this is so cool " – proof that scientists do n't think like the rest of us .
She decided to call her office but did n't know the number .
So she pulled out a stack of business cards , sifting for one with her work number .
It took 45 minutes to get through a third of the cards .
By then , however , the hemorrhage had grown and she did n't know how to work the phone .
She waited for a moment of clarity to return – it came in waves – but when she tried to dial the number from one of the cards it just looked like squiggles .
She matched the shapes of the squiggles on the card to the squiggles on the phone and eventually reached a colleague .
When he answered the phone , all she heard him say was , " Whaa , whaa , whaa " – a bit like the sound the adults in Peanuts cartoons make .
When she opened her mouth to respond , the same sound came from her .
Later when she was in the ambulance she felt the energy in her body lift and her spirit surrender .
" In that moment I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life , " she said .
She woke up later that afternoon , surprised that she was still alive .
Two and a half weeks later surgeons removed a blood - clot the size of a golf ball from her skull .
It took her eight years to completely recover .

Troubles for Tuna IV – An End to Toro
( N.B . This is a follow on article from Troubles for Tuna III )
At the ICCAT ( International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna ) meeting last week , a critical decision was to be made regarding the 2008 bluefin tuna quotas , a decision that could be one of the most important in saving the species .
While the head of the ICCAT ’s scientific committee pled that new restrictions were necessary to preserve the species ( he in fact stated that the species ’ “ collapse at this point is probable ” ) , the committee instead effectively raised quotas for 2008 .
Interestingly , no statement was issued at the conclusion of the meeting , leading me to conclude that they know that they may have signed the death warrant for the bluefin tuna by kowtowing to certain member nations who simply wanted more at the expense of the bluefin tuna .
The proposed “ recovery plan ” is rapidly turning out to be an extinction plan .
The bluefin tuna is the most valuable fish in the sea , bringing in large streams of revenue to the fisheries ( and nations ) that harvest this creature .
It is the most popular sushi item on the menu , and toro , the fatty belly meat , is considered a delicacy by sushi fans the world around .
The ICCAT is doing their best to keep this item on the menu for the time being , but in a few years , good luck finding it anywhere as , at this rate , there will be no more bluefin tuna in our oceans to catch .
I have stopped eating maguro and toro for now , and while I am just one person , each of you will need to make a decision as to whether you want to help save the species and make your opinion known , or act as if none of this matters .
A world without toro is not a life - threatening issue , but to cause the extinction of another of Earth ’s great species because of our greed , in my opinion , is .
Feel free to contact the ICCAT by clicking the “ contact us ” link on their website to voice your concern , if you wish .
I will be .
Meshi agare !

Planets are believed to develop within swirling discs of dust and gas around nascent stars .
So studying very young examples could tell astronomers much about the birth and evolution of planetary systems - including our own Solar System .
Details of the discovery , by a team in Germany , appear in the journal Nature .
Johny Setiawan , from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg , and colleagues say the planet has nearly 10 times the mass of our Jupiter ; and it circles TW Hydrae , a nearby young star which is only eight to 10 million years old .
The planet orbits the star with a period of 3.56 days at a distance of about six million km ( four million miles ) , inside the inner rim of the system 's dusty disc .
The researchers tell Nature the study shows how planet formation can occur quickly before a burgeoning star has had time to clear debris from its neighbourhood .
" This demonstrates that planets can form within 10 million years , before the disc has been dissipated by stellar winds and radiation , " they write .
The observations were made using the 2.2 m Max - Planck - Gesellschaft telescope at the European Southern Observatory 's La Silla facility in Chile .
TW Hydrae is is situated about 182 light - years away in the constellation Hydra .
There ’s a lot of advice on this blog about how to interview :
Tell good stories , ask good questions , be a closer .
But here ’s only one most important thing to remember : when it comes to discussing your potential salary , never give the number first .
The right answer to the question , “ What ’s your salary range ? ” is almost always some version of “ I ’m not telling you . ”
The person who gives the first number sets the starting point .
But if that ’s you , you lose .
If you request a salary higher than the range for the job , the interviewer will tell you you ’re high , and you ’ve just lost money .
If you request a salary lower than the range , the interviewer will say nothing , and you ’ve just lost money .
So you can only hurt yourself by giving the first number .
You want the interviewer to tell you the range for the position , because then you can focus on getting to the high end of that range .
But you ca n’t work to the high point if you do n’t know it .
So if there are two good salary negotiators in the room , it will be a game to see who has to give the first number .
Fortunately , the company cannot make you an offer without also offering a salary , so the cards are stacked in your favor , as long as you hold your ground .
So here ’s a list of responses for all the ways the interviewer will ask you how much money you expect to make .
The more times you can fend off the question , the less likely you will have to be the one to give the first number .
This works , even if you do n’t have the upper hand and you really need the job .
What salary range are you looking for ?
“ Let ’s talk about the job requirements and expectations first , so I can get a sense of what you need . ”
That ’s a soft answer to a soft way to ask the question .
What did you make at your last job ?
“ This position is not exactly the same as my last job .
So let ’s discuss what my responsibilities would be here and then determine a fair salary for this job . ”
It ’s hard to argue with words like “ fair ” and “ responsibilities ” — you ’re earning respect with this one .
What are you expecting to make in terms of salary ?
“ I am interested in finding a job that is a good fit for me .
I ’m sure whatever salary you ’re paying is consistent with the rest of the market . ”
In other words , I respect myself and I want to think I can respect this company .
I need to know what salary you want in order to make you an offer .
Can you tell me a range ?
“ I ’d appreciate it if you could make me an offer based on whatever you have budgeted for this position and we can go from there . ”
This is a pretty direct response , so using words like “ appreciate ” focuses on drawing out the interviewer ’s better qualities instead of her tougher side .
Why do n’t you want to give your salary requirements ?
“ I think you have a good idea of what this position is worth to your company , and that ’s important information for me to know . ”
Enough dancing –this is one last attempt to force you to give the number first .
Hold your line here and you win .
You can see the pattern , right ?
If you think you sound obnoxious or obstinate by not answering the question , think of how he feels asking the question more than once .
The interviewer is just trying to get a leg up on you in negotiations .
If you give in , you look like a poor negotiator , and the interviewer is probably not looking for someone like that .
So stand your ground , and understand that the interviewer is being as insistent as you are .
And it might encourage you to know that research shows that if you mirror the behavior of the interviewer , you are more likely to get the job .
Sure , this usually applies to tone of voice , level of enthusiasm , and body language , but who ’s to say it does n’t apply to negotiation tactics , too ?
Try it .
You could come away lots richer .

On April 27 , 2006 , the Ontario government announced the end of a bizarre venture .
Canada 's first large privately run prison , a 1,200 - inmate maximum - security superjail in the cottage country north of Toronto , was a failure and would be taken over by the province .
The Penetanguishene - based Central North Correctional Centre was a striking attempt at getting in on the controversial private - prison craze that has swept the United States , where for - profit businesses now run approximately 150 prisons housing about 150,000 inmates .
Ontario's five - year experiment with the concept , launched with much fanfare in 2001 by Robert Sampson–at the time the law - and - order Tory correctional services minister–ended amid revelations of flawed security , inadequate prisoner health care , and higher reoffending rates once the privately housed inmates were let back out into the world .
Today , Sampson has secured a gig with the Stephen Harper Conservatives leading a federal panel reviewing Canada 's prison system .
Its mandate includes finding " opportunities for savings including through physical plant realignment and infrastructure renewal " .
Does the choice of Sampson mean the feds want to privatize Canadian prisons ?
Stockwell Day , the federal public safety minister , says no .
" The question of privatization is not on the table , " he told journalists after Sampson 's appointment last April .
But some critics are n't so sure .
" We have to be very vigilant to see where this review is going and how broad it gets in terms of an agenda around privatization , " NDP MP Libby Davies ( Vancouver East ) told a reporter .
Len Bush , national representative of 15,000 provincial prison guards in the National Union of Public and Government Employees , is also skeptical about Day 's denial .
" He 's not actually come out and said , ' No , I wo n't privatize . '
We would welcome him saying so .
It looks to us that this is their direction , even though they 're not in a situation where they feel they can say it publicly , " he said on the phone from his Ottawa office .
Sampson submitted his report to the government on October 31 , but it remains under wraps .
In late October , though , news leaked from the Sampson panel suggesting that it was preparing to scrap statutory release , the virtually automatic discharge of prisoners under conditions similar to parole after they 've served two - thirds of their sentences .
Instead , " you 'd have to show why you deserve to be released [ at the two - thirds point ] , " a Canadian Press story quoted an unnamed source " familiar with the panel 's report " as saying .
" It 'll put more people in [ prison ] , so they 're going to need more resources . "
This has stoked the privatization fears : that the Harper government 's law - and - order agenda could unleash a crisis of overcrowding in prisons , and guess what the magical solution will be ?
Private prisons .
There is just one catch : crime experts say all this –dramatically increased prisoner numbers , possible privatization of prisons , and get - tough measures , including increased and mandatory sentences –will probably make Canadian communities less safe , not more .
At first glance , the plan may seem reasonable to some : make wrongdoers show they 've changed .
What could be wrong with that ?
It would force some to shape up , right ?
Wrong .
Such a change would create instant havoc in already overcrowded provincial and federal prison systems by adding up to 30 or 40 percent more inmates virtually overnight , according to Neil Boyd , an SFU criminology professor who spoke to the Georgia Straight from his Bowen Island home .
The change in the statutory release rule could suddenly add another 2,200 prisoners to the federal corrections system , which currently houses 12,000 inmates–an increase of almost 20 percent , Anthony Doob , a criminology professor at the University of Toronto , estimated on the phone from his office .
" The math is pretty straightforward .
You could create a crisis almost overnight by changing parole practices . "
Combined with other tough crime measures being proposed by the Harper government , a sudden tsunami of inmates would also swamp provincial prison systems , since many of those affected are those with sentences under two years .
In B.C. , provincial jails are already overcrowded and boiling with violence since the province closed nine facilities in 2001 , said Dean Purdy , chair of the corrections and sheriff 's - services component of the B.C. Government and Service Employees ' Union , representing 2,000 provincial corrections officers and sheriffs .
At the Vancouver Island Regional Correctional Centre , where Purdy works as a supervisor , there have been 39 assaults on guards since 2001 , compared to five in the prior 15 years , he said .
" I can't imagine what it will be like to run the jails with a higher count . "
" It [ the increase in inmates ] will come as a rude surprise to the provinces , " said Craig Jones , executive director of the John Howard Society of Canada , speaking on his cellphone from a conference in Toronto .
" The feds will crack down on crime , but the provinces will be punished . "
In October , Harper introduced his Tackling Violent Crime Act , Bill C - 2 , into the House of Commons , complete with a shopping list of ideas courtesy of the U.S. law - and - order lobby , including mandatory minimum sentences for certain offences and harsher penalties for gun crimes .
Harper declared the bill a confidence motion and said he 'd accept no amendments to it , meaning the government will fall should it be defeated by the opposition–unlikely , since the Liberals desperately want to avoid an election .
Criminologists and prison guards say the actual result of the Harper crime package will probably be not safer communities but , rather , private prisons in which the bottom line is king , not inmate rehabilitation .
With five to 10 years needed to build a new prison from conception to construction , coupled with Harper 's ideological predisposition to outsourcing government programs , Jones said it 's not a big leap to privatized prisons coming to Canada in a big way .
" Our anxiety is they 're going to grow the prison population so quickly , they will be left with few options . "
Creating a crisis to push through a controversial change is straight out of the playbook of Mike Harris 's Conservative government in Ontario when it privatized the Penetanguishene prison , NUPGE 's Bush said .
" The strategy of the Harris government was to create a crisis and bring privatization forward to deal with the crisis , " he said .
" You take an overcrowded situation , add more people , and you create a crisis .
We were hoping the experience elsewhere would have taught them . "
The U.S. experience with privatized prisons is full of cautionary tales .
After federal and state authorities brought in tougher law - and - order crime laws ( among them the infamous " three strikes " statutes ) –like the mandatory minimum sentences now being proposed by Harper–in the 1980s and '90s , the American prison population quadrupled , from 500,000 in 1980 to 2.2 million today .
( Another 4.8 million Americans are out on parole or probation , meaning a total of one in 32 adult Americans is under the control of the justice system in one fashion or another . )
It 's a myth , however , that the explosion in inmate numbers was about getting violent , hardened criminals off the street .
Instead , the crackdown disproportionately targeted marginalized people and small - time drug offenders .
In 2003 , racial or ethnic minorities made up 68 percent of the U.S. prison population , according to U.S. Justice Department data .
So who were these new offenders driving the U.S. prison boom ?
Turns out a huge number of them were POWs –prisoners of the war on drugs .
Between 1990 and 2000 , the portion of inmates jailed for a drug offence shot up by 59 percent while those in for violent crimes actually fell from 17 to 10 percent , according to Justice Department numbers .
By 2004 , drug offenders made up 54 percent of sentenced federal prisoners , up from just 25 percent in 1980 .
Of all drug arrests , about two in five were related to marijuana .
Moreover , nine in 10 marijuana busts involve possession only , not sale or manufacturing .
Early on , the big question became what to do with all these new guests of the correctional system .
The crime crackdown led to a boom in the number of U.S. federal and state prisons , from 592 in 1974 to 1,023 in 2000 .
In one Texas county , 33 percent of the population is behind bars , according to a 2004 study by the Washington , D.C. –based Urban Institute .
Authorities turned to private companies to build and run many prisons .
The largest operator by far is the Nashville , Tennessee–based Corrections Corp. of America , with 65 facilities under management , including 40 it owns outright , that house 72,000 inmates .
Business at CCA is booming .
Since 2000 , its shares have shot up from $ 4 to almost $ 29 .
But an independent study of CCA in 2003 found the company had failed to : provide adequate medical care to inmates , control violence in its facilities , and prevent a rash of escapes .
Civil - rights violations have also been raised in hundreds of lawsuits against CCA by prisoners and their families , including several that revolved around inmate deaths .
The study , cowritten by the U.K. – based Prison Privatisation Report International and the U.S. community group Good Jobs First , also said CCA tried to keep down costs by paying staff poorly , which resulted in high turnover and mistreatment of prisoners .
Substandard conditions also had resulted in prisoner protests and uprisings , while several CCA guards had been convicted of drug trafficking inside the facilities .
A low point for the company came in the late 1990s , when it agreed to a payment of $ 2.4 million to settle a class - action lawsuit filed by prisoners at its Youngstown , Ohio , prison who said the facility was unsafe after a rash of stabbings .
" It 's been a nightmare , " Youngstown 's mayor , George McKelvey –who helped lure CCA to his city –said in an October 1998 Washington Post story .
" [ CCA 's ] credibility is zero . "
CCA officials did n't return calls for this story .
The plague of scandals at CCA and other private prison operators prompted Business Week to publish a story in 2000 titled " Private Prisons Don't Work " that said " the industry 's heyday may already be history . "
" It 's horror story after horror story in the U.S. , " Lyle Stewart , spokesman for the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers , representing 6,000 federal prison guards , said from his office in Montreal .
" It 's frigging terrible . "
In recent years , many American states have retreated from the incarceration - oriented approach , largely because corrections now eat up seven percent of state budgets , on average .
In 2000 , California voters passed a resolution eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for certain crimes and requiring treatment , not prison time , for nonviolent drug offenders .
In November , even the hard - line Bush administration eased minimum sentencing guidelines for federal crack offences .
But while U.S. authorities step back from the ailing crime policies of the 1980s and 1990s , the John Howard Society 's Jones sees the Harper government embracing the same troubled approach .
" This government seems enthralled by the Bush administration , " he said , noting that Harper 's crime policies " seem to reflect a close study of the American model " .
Jones said the Harper crime agenda is likely to fall heaviest on marginalized people , just as the measures did in the U.S. " Police go where the pickings are easiest .
It will fall disproportionately on marginalized , mentally ill , and minority youth .
You will not see more Conrad Blacks in jail , " he said .
" It 's not about justice ; it 's about acting Old Testament . "
From Bowen Island , SFU 's Boyd agreed .
" Why would we want to dramatically increase the number of people in jail for cannabis ?
That 's what it [ mandatory sentencing ] did in the U.S.
Why would we want to look at them [ the U.S. ] when looking at crime ? " he asked , noting that the U.S. has 2.5 times more murders per capita than Canada .
" There 's just no support for the idea that punishment will get the social safety we want .
We should be looking at success stories , " Boyd said , pointing to European countries that have promoted crime prevention and improved social housing over incarceration .
In fact , that 's exactly the approach that was favoured by a crime prevention council within Canada 's Public Safety Ministry when it reviewed corrections policy back in 1996 .
The council 's study , which is posted on the ministry 's
Web site , does n't mince words in its criticism of U.S. mandatory minimum sentencing as a failed model that did little to reduce crime rates while merely increasing the prison population .
" Not only is the cost of automatic incarceration brought about by this policy inordinately high , but it does little to stem the ongoing tide of new offenders , " noted the study , titled Money Well Spent : Investing in Preventing Crime .
" Minimum mandatory sentencing requirements rely upon the false assumption that people who are contemplating a criminal act–youths in particular–go through a rational process of planning their act and weighing the consequences of being apprehended . "
As for Harper 's plan to tighten parole eligibility , U of T's Doob said the notion goes against everything that 's known about the importance of transitioning prisoners into society through supervised programs like parole and halfway houses .
" Probably the worst thing you could do is hold a guy his whole sentence and then give him a bus ticket with no job , no program , and no controls . "
Jones is also flabbergasted .
" The evidence is clear that incarceration is the last resort .
Most people do not benefit from it and a number of people get worse .
Prison is an expensive way to make bad people worse . "
Jones also is alarmed about privatized prisons making a return .
" The staff [ in private prisons ] has less training .
They employ harsher measures because they 're cheaper ; the conditions deteriorate .
The inmates eventually get out , so it passes on the costs of dealing with them to future governments and generations .
The issue is they 're going to be worse when they get out . "
Doob agreed , saying the evidence on privatized prisons is clear : " The data that exists in various countries suggests there are real problems in the ways that private companies run these things . "
Any money saved in direct operational costs is offset by the added expense of monitoring prison companies for contract compliance , a greater rate of prisoner escapes , and a higher recidivism rate .
" It would be an ideological decision [ to privatize prisons ] , not a financial one , " he said .
The BCGEU 's Purdy said provincial corrections officials were n't impressed when they travelled to Ontario to investigate the Penetanguishene experiment a few years ago .
" They came back and told us they were n't interested in privatizing any jails in B.C. , " he said .
Whatever Harper has in mind for the prison system , one thing is for sure :
There 's little chance he 'll unveil any plans for privatizing prisons before the next federal election .
Unless Harper wins a majority , it seems suicidal for him to take a chance on such a controversial idea .
He 'd have his hands full with furious federal prison guards who " would fight it to the death if there was any sense at all " of privatization plans , vowed Stewart .
Already , other elements of Harper 's crime agenda seem destined for a collision course with the provinces , which are likely to flip out when they 're hit with massive numbers of new prisoners .
Harper apparently is n't even finding many allies within the Correctional Service of Canada , even though it is likely to enjoy a massive budget increase to accommodate the new inmates .
Jones said senior corrections officials see Harper 's regressive policies as reversing years of hard - won policy gains in areas like parole and crime prevention .
" When the tide turns so dramatically , they [ corrections officials ] see their work as being undone , " he said .
" It turns back the clock on 40 years of progressive corrections policy . "
BILL CLINTON and Al Gore made a campaign promise to help build a national data network , hoping it would lead to new digital information services .
While waiting to see if the new Administration follows through , businesses can get a taste of the future with the rapidly growing commercial networks of computer services .
The first networks were on - line services like Prodigy , Compuserve and America Online .
Although they provide useful services , these networks are based on minicomputer and mainframe technologies of the 1960's and 1970's , in which thousands of users can connect simultaneously by telephone to a central system that dispenses electronic information .
And that technology has drawbacks : the systems can become congested , and for the most part customers have limited options .
In sharp contrast is the Internet , a collection of computer networks that does a little of what a national data highway would do and that already has hundreds of thousands of computer users .
The Internet is a web of networks with shared software standards , allowing users on one network to reach anywhere into a global thicket .
Created by the Pentagon , the Internet was originally limited to academic and corporate researchers and government officials .
It began as a simple mechanism for sharing data , using remote computers and exchanging electronic mail .
Now it contains large and small , commercial and nonprofit networks that offer a remarkable array of services .
Obama lawyer warns of ' reckoning ' for Clinton 527 donors and staff
Obama lawyer Bob Bauer reiterated the charges made in a memo yesterday ( after the jump ) that the new pro-Clinton 527 , the American Leadership Project , is breaking the law and warned that donors and aides to the group could face criminal liability — an apparent effort to stop the group before it starts , and to scare off other , similar efforts .
Bauer argued on a conference call with reporters that the group 's " major purpose " is supporting Clinton and that it 's " a very clear runaway case of lawbreaking " because it has n't filed papers with the Federal Election Commission or reported the money it spent producing its ad and posting it to YouTube .
" There ’s going to be a reckoning here , " he warned .
" It ’s going to be rough — it ’s going to be rough on the officers , it ’s going to be rough on the employees , it ’s going to be rough on the donors . "
" Whether it's at the FEC or in a broader criminal inquiry , those donors will be asked questions , " Bauer said .
Asked how this differs from the pro-Edwards 527 in Iowa , which Obama also denounced , but which he did n't call illegal in these terms , Bauer said he was n't sure " how to answer that . "
His charges seem to hinge , however , on some details that are n't entirely clear : whether the group has already spent more than $ 1,000 and whether the FEC ( which is currently not sitting because of a congressional standoff ) will rule that this group is engaging in " express advocacy " for Clinton .
Roger Salazar , a spokesman for the American Leadership Project , laid out his position in a statement yesterday :
The type of 527 we have organized does not intend to engage in express advocacy or the functional equivalent of express advocacy , and so will not qualify as a political committee under the Federal Election Commission rules .
It will , however , fund “ electioneering communications ” — ads that feature a candidate and run within the 30 days before the election — and so will have reporting requirements with the FEC as well as the IRS .
( Unlike the Swift Boat ads , we will be fully disclosing our donors to the FEC . )
Salazar 's full response , and Obama 's original memo , are after the jump .
RESPONSE FROM ROGER SALAZAR :
The American Leadership Project was established to amplify the primary election ’s focus on issues of importance to the middle class — the economy , jobs , education , and the mortgage crisis , among others .
Because of recent U.S. Supreme Court decision , there have been changes in the law since 2004 and the FEC has acknowledged those changes by issuing a new regulation , effective December 26 , 2007 , spelling out in detail the types of electioneering communications that do not result in the entity running afoul of the FEC source and amount limitations .
We are following that regulation .
Moreover , our advertisements focus on public policy issues and the candidate 's position on those issues , not on anything else .
The type of 527 we have organized does not intend to engage in express advocacy or the functional equivalent of express advocacy , and so will not qualify as a political committee under the Federal Election Commission rules .
It will , however , fund “ electioneering communications ” — ads that feature a candidate and run within the 30 days before the election — and so will have reporting requirements with the FEC as well as the IRS .
( Unlike the Swift Boat ads , we will be fully disclosing our donors to the FEC . )
The ALP must file quarterly and pre-election reports with the IRS in which it discloses the identity of its donors .
In addition , every time the ALP spends $ 10,000 or more on an electioneering communication , it must file within 24 hours a report with the FEC that lists its donors of $ 1,000 or more .
Those reports will be publicly accessible on the FEC website .
OBAMA MEMO :
FW : MEMO : A New 527 & the Law of the Swift Boats
TO : Interested Parties
FR : Obama Campaign
RE : The American Leadership Project and the Law of Swift Boats
DA : February 20 , 2008
The America Leadership Project is organized on the same model as Swift Boats Veterans for Truth and other " 527s " operating outside the financing limits of federal campaign finance law .
It has been established without regard to the changes in the law , made after 2004 and under court supervision , to stop this type of activity .
Under those changes , the Project should be registered with the Federal Election Commission as a regulated " political committee , " and it should be complying with all the rules such committees should follow - such as limits on contributions they receive .
The Project is flouting those requirements , so that it - like Swift Boats and others before it - can use six - figure checks from wealthy contributors to influence the outcome of the primaries ahead in Ohio , Texas and Pennsylvania .
The law , however , provides clearly that the American Leadership Project is indeed a political committee subject to the federal financing limits .
The FEC has stated specifically that any 527 becomes a political committee if it ( a ) spends or receives more than a $ 1,000 in a calendar year on federal election - related purposes and ( b ) has an overall organizational major purpose of influence of elections .
( a) Press reports make clear , moreover , that the Project will spend in the millions of dollars , crossing well over the $ 1,000 annual threshold for political committee spending .
The monies received and spent will be treated as political " contributions " or " expenditures " for campaign purposes .
In addressing this issue of purpose , the Federal Election Commission has specifically considered what contributors will be told about the use of their monies .
Where the money was solicited with an " indication " that it will benefit Hillary Clinton , nothing more is needed to trigger federal regulatory jurisdiction , under rules adopted by the FEC in 2004 .
In the light of the large sums the Project will be asking , for commercials built entirely around Hillary Clinton and broadcast to primary state electorates , there is no question here about purpose .
( b) Organizational " major purpose " is then determined by a whole range of factors , any one of which will be decisive .
How does the organization explain its purpose ?
What other evidence is there of its purpose ?
Has it conducted other activities , beyond the communication it disseminates about particular candidates in particular elections ?
What is the timing of those activities — immediately before an election ?
Here we have a committee that springs up on the eve of an election , promotes a specific candidate , and has no history or apparent purpose of lobbying specific issues outside the benefit to the candidate of these communications .
Its " major purpose " is no mystery .
Liability for violating the federal campaign finance laws is both civil and criminal .
Any investigation , like the investigations conducted after 2004 , will involve the Project 's officers , staff and donors .
Because the FEC specifically addressed and publicly explained the applicable standards in the recent past , the violation of those standards in this instance presents a clear indication of knowing violations of the law .
Once again , the issues raised here affect all who knowingly participate in a scheme to violate the rules : the officers , the staff and the donors .
Due to the ubiquity of advertisements , consumers have become accustomed to them and are able to tune them out .
To combat this " problem , " advertisers are coming up with continually more creative ways to get their messages across .
The new and unique methods some firms have devised are surely memorable .
Of course , if they become as commonplace as scented perfume ads or product placement in TV shows and movies , they too will cease to be memorable .
The 10 most memorable new methods of advertising are ...
1. Escalator : Rediffusion DY&R in Mumbai , India , chose to advertise Juice Salon on an escalator .
On the bottom of the escalator is an image of a man 's head ; on each step , a hairstyle .
As the steps slide into the bottom of the escalator , the man 's hairstyle changes .
2. Moldy Cheese :
The main competitor of Adobe InDesign ( publishing software ) is Quark , which has long dominated the publishing industry .
" Quark , " in German , is also the name for " curd cheese , " a theme that Adobe played off of with a recent promotion for InDesign .
Rapp Collins in Germany sent tubs of past - the - expiration - date Quark .
Inside was a layer of " mould , " and then a recipe book - inspired flyer advertising InDesign and offering a free download of the program .
3. Fruit : Klas and Maria Lindstrand 's new book , Tutti Frutti , is a fruits and berries resource with facts , recipes , and photographs for each fruit and berry .
The advertisements ?
Fruit stickers .
The stickers are the size of the brand stickers usually found on supermarket fruits , but bear the book 's name and instructions to purchase the book online at adlibris .
The advertising strategy was conceived by Klas , who also thought to mail the book to critics in the mesh packaging in which fruits , apples , and other fruits are often bought .
4. Dogs in the Park : Pedigree chose to time its adoption drive and the opening of its NYC Dogstore with the Westminster Dog Show .
For the 21 - year sponsor of the Westminster Dog Show , TBWA \Chiat \Day placed advertising dogs in Central Park .
The orange , wooden dogs bore the message , " Wish I was here .
But I 'm not .
Come visit me and other great shelter dogs at the PEDIGREE DOGSTORE on 46th and Broadway . "
5. Bubble : For the Latin American candy company Arcor , Leo Burnett created a bubble ad .
When a magazine reader opens the spread containing the Arcor ad , a 3 - D " gum bubble " pops up , creating the illusion that the person in the ad has blown a bubble with Arcor gum .
6. Welcome Mat : BBDO New York produced limited edition welcome mats to promote Havaianas flip - flops .
The mats contained flip - flops so , when leaving for the day , one can simply step onto the welcome mat to put on shoes .
Upon return , the flip - flops pop right back into the mat .
7. Flowerbeds : Another three - dimensional ad created for Havaianas by BBDO New York were giant flip - flop flowerbeds .
Located where Havaianas are sold , such as in malls , the flowerbeds were designed to " remind people of Havaianas ' unique aesthetic of color , design , and the brand 's connection to nature and the outdoors . "
8. Codes : Several companies have employed this method in somewhat different ways .
Google created a now - famous billboard that simply read , " {first 10 - digit prime found in consecutive digits of e}.com " .
The billboard was displayed in Silicon Valley , while banners in Harvard Square carried the same message .
Those smart enough to solve the puzzle discovered a Web site with another puzzle .
Eventually , those who solved all the puzzles were asked to submit a resume .
When an expert typographer was needed at Lunar BBDO in London , the creative directors devised a similar plan .
They created three coded advertisements .
In one , the text was completely in Webdings , Wingdings , and Zapf Dingbats .
The ads were placed at local design schools and ran in typographic publications .
The campaign drew thirty responses .
9. Paint - by - Gum : Hubba Bubba chose to promote its product while fighting the gum - on - the - street problem .
DDB designed paint - by - number posters for the company ; the posters ' color palettes are comprised of different flavors of gum .
Gum chewers are encouraged to fill the famous images ( the Mona Lisa and Marilyn Monroe ) with their used gum .
Ha-Joon Chang is a Cambridge economist who specializes in the abject poverty of the Third World and its people , groups , nations , and empires , and their doctrines that are responsible for this condition .
He won the Gunnar Myrdal Prize for his book “ Kicking Away the Ladder : Development Strategy in Historical Perspective ” ( 2002 ) , and he shared the 2005 Wassily Leontief Prize for his contributions to “ Rethinking Development in the 21st Century . ”
The title of his 2002 book comes from the German political economist Friedrich List , who in 1841 criticized Britain for preaching free trade to other countries while having achieved its own economic supremacy through high tariffs and extensive subsidies .
He accused the British of “ kicking away the ladder ” that they had climbed to reach the world ’s top economic position .
Chang ’s other , more technical books include “ The Political Economy of Industrial Policy ” ( 1994 ) and “ Reclaiming Development : An Economic Policy Handbook for Activists and Policymakers ” ( 2004 ) .
Bad Samaritans By Ha-Joon Chang Bloomsbury Press , 288 pages
His new book is a discursive , well - written account of what he calls the “ Bad Samaritans , ” “ people in the rich countries who preach free markets and free trade to the poor countries in order to capture larger shares of the latter ’s markets and preempt the emergence of possible competitors .
They are saying ‘ do as we say , not as we did ’ and act as Bad Samaritans , taking advantage of others who are in trouble . ”
“ Bad Samaritans ” is intended for a literate audience of generalists and eschews the sort of exotica that peppers most economic writing these days — there is not a single simultaneous equation in the book and many of Chang ’s examples are taken from his own experiences as a South Korean born in 1963 .
Ha-Joon Chang ’s life is conterminous with his country ’s advance from being one of the poorest on Earth — with a 1961 yearly income of $ 82 per person , less than half the $ 179 per capital income in Ghana at that time — to the manufacturing powerhouse of today , with a 2004 per capita income of $ 13,980 .
South Korea did not get there by following the advice of the Bad Samaritans .
Chang ’s prologue contains a wonderful account of how post - Korean
War trade restrictions and governmental supervision fostered such projects as POSCO ( Pohang Iron and Steel Co. ) , which began life as a state - owned enterprise that was refused support from the World Bank in a country without any iron ore or coking coal and with a prohibition on trade with China .
Now privatized , POSCO is the world ’s third largest steel company .
This was also the period in which Samsung subsidized its infant electronics subsidiaries for over a decade with money made in textiles and sugar refining .
Today Samsung dominates flat - panel TVs and cell phones in much of East Asia and the world .
Chang remembers quite clearly that as a student “ We learned that it was our patriotic duty to report anyone seen smoking foreign cigarettes .
The country needed to use every bit of foreign exchange earned from its exports in order to import machines and other inputs to develop better industries . ”
He is frankly contemptuous of New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman ’s best - seller “ The Lexus and the Olive Tree ” ( 2000 ) and its argument that Toyota ’s Lexus automobile represents the rich world brought about by neoliberal economics whereas the olive tree stands for the static world of no or low economic growth .
The fact is that had the Japanese government followed the free - trade economists back in the early 1960s , there would have been no Lexus .
Toyota today would be , at best , a junior partner to some Western car manufacturer or , worse , have been wiped out .
In Chang ’s conception , there are two kinds of Bad Samaritans .
There are the genuine , powerful “ ladder - kickers ” working in the “ unholy trinity ” of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the World Bank , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) .
Then there are the “ ideologues — those who believe in Bad Samaritan policies because they think those policies are ‘ right , ’ not because they personally benefit from them much , if at all . ”
Both groups adhere to a doctrine they call “ neoliberalism . ”
It became the dominant economic model of the English - speaking world in the 1970s and prevails at the present time .
Neoliberalism ( sometimes called the “ Washington Consensus ” ) is a rerun of what economists suffering from “ historical amnesia ” believe were the key characteristics of the international economy in the golden age of liberalism ( 1870 - 1913 ) .
Thomas Friedman calls this complex of policies the “ Golden Straitjacket , ” the wearing of which , no matter how uncomfortable , is allegedly the only route to economic success .
The complex includes privatizing state - owned enterprises , maintaining low inflation , shrinking the size of the state bureaucracy , balancing the national budget , liberalizing trade , deregulating foreign investment , making the currency freely convertible , reducing corruption , and privatizing pensions .
It is called neoliberalism because of its acceptance of rich - country monopolies over intellectual property rights ( patents , copyrights , etc. ) , the granting to a country ’s central bank of a monopoly to issue bank notes , and its assertion that political democracy is conducive to economic growth , none of which were parts of classical liberalism .
The Golden Straitjacket is what the unholy trinity tries to force on poor countries .
It is the doctrinal orthodoxy taught in all mainstream academic economics departments and for which numerous Nobel prizes in economics have been awarded .
In addition to being an economist , Ha-Joon Chang is a historian and an empiricist ( as distinct from a deductive theorist working from what are stipulated to be laws of economic behavior ) .
He notes that the histories of today ’s rich countries contradict virtually all the Golden Straitjacket dicta , many of which are logically a result rather than a cause of economic growth ( for example , trade liberalization ) .
His basic conclusion : “ Practically all of today ’s developed countries , including Britain and the US , the supposed homes of the free market and free trade , have become rich on the basis of policy recipes that go against neo-liberal economics . ”
All of today ’s rich countries used protection and subsidies to encourage their manufacturing industries , and they discriminated powerfully against foreign investors .
All such policies are anathema in today ’s economic orthodoxy and are now severely restricted by multilateral treaties , like the WTO agreements , and proscribed by aid donors and international financial organizations , particularly the IMF and the World Bank .
Chang offers some fascinating vignettes of men and books that were infinitely more important in the economic development of the rich countries than Adam Smith ’s “ The Wealth of Nations . ”
These include a precis of a virtually unknown book by Daniel Defoe , “ A Plan of the English Commerce ” ( 1728 ) , on Tudor industrial policy in developing England ’s woolen manufacturing industry .
As a result of many of Defoe ’s ideas , manufactured woolen products became Britain ’s most important export industry .
Chang continues with a short life of Robert Walpole , the chief architect of the mercantilist system .
By 1820 , thanks to Walpole ’s protectionist policies , Britain ’s average tariff on manufactured imports was between 45 and 55 percent , whereas such tariffs were 6 - 8 percent in the Low Countries , 8 - 12 percent in Germany and Switzerland , and around 20 percent in France .
Turning to the United States , Chang focuses on Alexander Hamilton , the first American secretary of the treasury and the man who coined the term “ infant industry . ”
Although he did not live to see it , by 1820 Hamilton ’s 40 percent tariff on manufactured imports into the United States was an established fact .
Hamilton provided the blueprint for U.S. economic policy until the end of the Second World War .
The 19th and early 20th century U.S. tariffs of 40 to 50 percent were then the highest of any country in the world .
Throughout this same period , it was also the world ’s fastest growing economy .
Much like contemporary China , whose average tariff was over 30 percent right up to the 1990s , neither American nor Chinese protectionism inhibited foreign direct investment but rather seemed to stimulate it .
With the U.S. abandonment of overt protectionism after it became the world ’s richest nation , it still found measures to advance its economic fortunes beyond what market forces could have achieved .
For example , the U.S. government actually paid for 50 to 70 percent of the country ’s total expenditures on research and development from the 1950s through the mid-1990s , usually under the cover of defense spending .
The Third World was not always poor and economically stagnant .
Throughout the golden age of capitalism , from the Marshall Plan ( 1947 ) to the first oil shock ( 1973 ) , the United States was a Good Samaritan and helped developing countries by allowing them to protect and subsidize their nascent industries .
The developing world has never done better , before or since .
But then , in the 1970s , scared that its position as global hegemon was being undermined , the United States turned decisively toward neoliberalism .
It ordered the unholy trinity to bring the developing countries to heel .
Through draconian interventions into the most intimate details of the lives of their clients , including birth control , ethnic integration , and gender equality as well as tariffs , foreign investment , privatization decisions , national budgets , and intellectual property protection , the IMF , World Bank , and WTO managed drastically to slow down economic growth in the Third World .
Forced to adopt neoliberal policies and to open their economies to much more powerful foreign competitors on unequal terms , their growth rate fell to less than half of that recorded in the 1960s ( 1.7 percent instead of 4.5 percent ) .
Since the 1980s , Africa has actually experienced a fall in living standards — which should be a damning indictment of neoliberal orthodoxy because most African economies have been virtually run by the IMF and the World Bank over the past quarter - century .
The disaster has been so complete that it has helped expose the hidden governance structures that allow the IMF and the World Bank to foist Bad Samaritan policies on helpless nations .
The United States has a de facto veto in both organizations , where rich countries control 60 percent of the voting shares .
The WTO has a democratic structure ( it had to accept one in order to enact its founding treaty ) but is actually run by an oligarchy .
Votes are never taken .
Because of the shortcomings of neoliberalism , the main international development bureaucracies as well as much of the academic economics establishment have been busy trying to find plausible scapegoats or excuses .
One of the most transparent was Paul Wolfowitz ’s emphasis on poor - country corruption during his short tenure as president of the World Bank .
He propounded the increasingly popular view that the World Bank gave good advice that failed because Third World leaders were corrupt and subverted its implementation .
The problem with this idea is , as Chang puts it , “ Most of today ’s rich countries successfully industrialized despite the fact that their own public life was spectacularly corrupt . ”
He has in mind places like the late 19th century United States and post - World War II East Asia , about which Chang as a South Korean speaks with insights from the inside , and China today .
Among the conundrums encountered in trying to argue that corruption has subverted neoliberalism are the cases of Zaire ( yesterday , the Congo ) under Gen. Mobutu and Indonesia under Gen. Suharto .
Both Mobutu and Suharto were flagrantly corrupt , murderous military dictators of the sort often preferred by the United States , but with one major difference — whereas Zaire ’s living standards fell threefold during Mobutu ’s rule , Indonesia ’s rose by more than the same amount during Suharto ’s rule .
The explanation seems to be that in Indonesia , the money from corruption mostly stayed inside the country in the hands of Suharto ’s numerous relatives , who used some of it to create jobs and incomes .
In Zaire , the proceeds from corruption went straight into Swiss banks and other hidden foreign accounts .
Corruption is , of course , a problem , but to say that it is the reason for the spectacular failures of neoliberal economic programs is unconvincing .
Rather than acknowledging that free trade , privatization , and the rest of their policies are ahistorical , self - serving economic nonsense , apologists for neoliberalism have also revived an old 19th century and neo -Nazi explanation for developmental failure — namely , culture .
Chang believes that this reflects the popularity of Samuel Huntington ’s thesis that we are experiencing a “ clash of civilizations ” or Francis Fukuyama ’s contention that trust extending beyond family members critically affects economic development .
Fukuyama argues , astonishingly , that the absence of such trust in the cultures of China ( the fastest growing economy on Earth today ) , France , Italy , and ( to some extent ) Korea makes it difficult for them to run large firms , which are key to modern economic development .
This is not so different from the 19th century German economist and sociologist Max Weber , who in 1904 identified the Confucian / Buddhist countries of China and Japan as economically backward because they did not have the Protestant ethic .
Chang argues that culture simply does not work as an explanation for economic success .
Extremely broad categories such as “ civilization , ” “ Christian , ” or “ Muslim ” obscure more than they reveal , and the modern histories of Germany , Japan , China , and many other countries suggest that Protestant - work - ethic - type cultures are the results of economic development , not their cause .
In the early 19th century , the British endlessly generalized about Germany and Germans , calling them “ a dull and heavy people ” and “ indolent , ” saying “ the Germans never hurry , ” they are a “ plodding , easily contented people … endowed neither with great acuteness of perception nor quickness of feeling , ” they are “ not distinguished by enterprise or activity , ” they are “ too individualistic and unable to cooperate with each other , ” they are “ overly emotional , ” and “ the [ German ] tradesman and shopkeeper take advantage of you wherever they can , and to the smallest imaginable amount rather than not take advantage of you at all .
…
This knavery is universal . ”
It is discouraging to see this kind of thought rampant again in economic discourse , this time directed against the poor people of Africa , Latin America , and elsewhere .
Commentators who denigrate the Philippines as East Asia ’s only Catholic and therefore Latin American - type culture forget that only a half - century ago it was the second richest country in Asia ( after Japan ) .
Cultural explanations offer powerful support for the List / Chang proposition that economically successful nations are almost pathologically afraid of competitors coming up from below and therefore try to block their progress by kicking away the ladder .
It is time to recognize , particularly in the English - language economic press , that a “ level playing field ” leads to unfair competition when the players are unequal .
We have no trouble recognizing that a boxing match between people with more than a couple of pounds difference in weight is unfair .
Why should we accept that the United States and Honduras should compete economically on equal terms ?
One of the strengths of Chang ’s new book lies in the half - dozen lucid chapters on particular , often rather technical aspects of development and international trade .
These add up to a jargon - free primer on contemporary economic thought leavened with a sound knowledge of history .
The best of these are on trade liberalization , foreign investment , public versus private enterprises , patents and copyrights , and macroeconomics .
The most interesting of these are on trade liberalization and what today are rather ostentatiously called “ intellectual property rights . ”
We live in an allegedly enlightened age of free trade .
Nonetheless , European citizens support their dairy industry with subsidies and tariffs to the tune of 16 billion pounds sterling a year .
This amounts to more than 1 pound per cow per day , when half the world ’s people live on less .
The pattern is repeated with regard to a vast range of agricultural commodities grown in rich , developed countries .
The U.S. subsidizes corn and exports it to Mexico , where it is the staple diet of most of the people .
These exports , however , drive small Mexican farmers into bankruptcy and encourage their illegal immigration into the United States , where a racist backlash is directed against them .
In many cases , the American proponents of farm subsidies are one and the same people who stir up hatreds against Mexican farm workers .
Japan is one of the world ’s richest countries , with a remarkably even per capita income distribution , but it still lavishly subsidizes its extremely inefficient rice growers and prevents the import of rice that could easily compete on price with domestic rice .
This system helps perpetuate the one - party rule of the Liberal Democratic Party by mobilizing rich , protected farmers , who vote for the conservatives .
What ’s wrong with such practices ?
All countries have domestic political interests , and successful politicians cater to them .
The problem is the hypocrisy surrounding “ free trade ” and the lies that distort political rhetoric in virtually all economically advanced countries .
According to Chang , “ Belief in the virtue of free trade is so central to the neo-liberal orthodoxy that it is effectively what defines a neo-liberal economist .
You may question ( if not totally reject ) any other element of the neo-liberal agenda — open capital markets , strong patents , or even privatization — and still stay in the neo-liberal church .
However , once you object to free trade , you are effectively inviting ex-communication . ”
Under the Anglo - American - dominated World Trade Organization , a great deal of trade liberalization has taken place , but it has virtually all come at the expense of infant industries or cash crops in developing countries and has enriched exporters and consumers in rich countries .
Not surprisingly , the system allows for protection and subsidies much more readily in areas where the rich countries want them and rejects any exceptions for developing countries .
This is the main reason for the current revolt by virtually all Latin American countries against further U.S. interference in their economic policymaking .
Reduction of tariff revenues also plays havoc with national budgets in poor countries .
Because they lack efficient tax collection capabilities and because tariffs are the easiest taxes to collect , developing countries rely heavily on them .
Add to this lower levels of business activity and higher unemployment that results from IMF - ordered trade liberalizations , which reduce income tax revenue .
When such countries are then put under further IMF pressure to reduce their budget deficits , falling revenues mean severe cuts in spending , often eating into vital areas like education , health , and physical infrastructure , damaging long - term growth .
Neoliberal theorists believe that when it comes to golden straitjackets “ one size fits all ” — except for those countries rich enough to afford a private tailor .
The chief effect of the golden straitjacket has been not to promote growth but to turn healthy countries into basket cases .
“ In the long run , ” writes Chang , “ free trade is a policy that is likely to condemn developing countries to specialize in sectors that offer low productivity growth and thus low growth in living standards .
This is why so few countries have succeeded with free trade , while most successful countries have used infant industry protection to one degree or another . ”
Another salient aspect of the neoliberal canon has a much less hoary history than free trade .
The idea of the state intervening to grant a monopoly to an inventor or a creative artist to exploit his or her device is relatively new and was once thought to be contrary to the idea of liberalism .
Chang observes , “ The technological ‘ arms race ’ between backward countries trying to acquire advanced foreign knowledge and the advanced countries trying to prevent its outflow has always been at the heart of the game of economic development . ”
During the 18th century , this competition took on a new dimension with the emergence of modern industrial technologies that had much greater potential for productivity growth than traditional technologies .
The result was a vicious international competition to recruit skilled foreign workers , machine smuggling , and industrial espionage .
The origins of patents , copyrights , and protection of trademarks are to be found in Britain ’s attempts to protect its advanced technologies by erecting legal barriers against their outflow .
The other industrializing countries in Europe and the United States had to violate those laws in order to acquire superior British technologies .
The first measure to protect IPRs ( intellectual property rights ) was a 1719 English ban on the migration of skilled workers .
The law made it illegal to recruit experienced workers for jobs abroad — known as “ suborning . ”
Emigrant workers who did not return home within six months of being warned would lose their right to lands and goods in Britain and their citizenship would be revoked .
This was followed by a new act in 1750 prohibiting the export of “ tools and utensils ” in the wool and silk industries , extended by the Tools Act of 1785 to the export of many different types of machinery .
The development of science in conjunction with industry meant that a lot of disembodied knowledge could be written down in a language that could be understood by anyone with appropriate training .
Once an idea is written down in general scientific and engineering language , it becomes much easier to copy .
It thus became more important to protect the ideas themselves than the workers or machines employing them .
Beginning with some German states in the 16th century and with Britain in 1623 with the Statute of Monopolies , governments granted 10 years of protected monopoly to inventors of “ new arts and machines . ”
Britain introduced the first copyright law in 1709 and the first trademark law in 1862 .
It is not obvious that providing incentives to inventors and accepting the social costs of monopolies increase innovation or do anything more than enrich corporations who can file endless patent infringement suits and slow down change by making frivolous but patentable minor changes in old techniques .
According to Chang , “ The patent lobby talks nonsense when it argues that there will be no new technological progress without patents . ”
For example , nonprofit organizations , such as universities , subsidize a great deal of research .
Several classical students of innovation , such as the economist Joseph Schumpeter , discounted the importance of patents .
Schumpeter believed that the natural if short - lived monopoly that comes with invention was more than enough .
One thing is certain : Extending the term of protection for existing work , which is advocated by all the Bad Samaritan rich countries , cannot create new knowledge .
The United States is the most serious protectionist .
In 1998 , the U.S. Copyright Term Extension
Act extended the period of copyright protection from the life of the author plus 50 years to the life of the author plus 70 years .
The Disney Corp. led the fight for this extension since the copyright on Mickey Mouse , created in 1928 , was due to expire .
As a result the new law became known in some circles as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act .
Despite the enormous sums paid to lawyers for work on patent law , it should be understood that as a practical matter patents are important in only three industries — computer software , entertainment , and the pharmaceutical industry .
But they are a critical stumbling block for economic development .
Some 97 percent of all patents and the vast majority of all copyrights and trademarks are held by economically advanced countries , which use them to deny medicines , textbooks , and computers to underdeveloped countries , exploit epidemics such as HIV / AIDS to extract excess profits , and kick away the ladder for countries trying to catch up .
As Chang concludes , “ The most detrimental impact [ of the patent system ] lies in its potential to block knowledge flows into technologically backward countries that need better technologies to develop their economies .
Economic development is all about absorbing advanced foreign technologies . ”
Among the best things we could do today to help the Third World would be to shorten the period of protection , drastically raise the originality bar , and make compulsory licensing and imports of generics easier .
With “ Bad Samaritans , ” Chang has succinctly and comprehensively exposed the chief structures of economic imperialism in the world today .
What is now required is the leadership to undermine and dismantle the barriers that keep so much of the world so poor .

These are words that have been brewing just below the surface in Germany for quite a while , and now they were uttered aloud , right here in Israel .
In a conference held Monday at Netanya ’s Academic College , German professors asserted that their country “ should stop giving the Sate of Israel preferential treatment ” .
This statement comes at the heels of a manifesto , recently published by 25 German scholars , which maintained that Germany must be more ‘ balanced ’ in its political relations with Israel and its Arab neighbors .
Lifelong Debt Survivors : Germans paid nothing compared to damage Yael Branovsky Members of governing council of Center of Organizations of Holocaust Survivors to coordinate next week issues to be raised in meeting with German finance minister .
Center 's chairman says , ' I am not ashamed to ask Germany for money .
They should take care of the survivors until the end of their lives '
Survivors : Germans paid nothing compared to damage
The aforementioned professors stated that Germany helped strengthen the burgeoning State of Israel by deporting 160,000 German Jews during the Nazi reign .
These refugees ultimately ended up in Israel and bolstered its Jewish population at the Arabs ’ expense .
Furthermore , noted the professors , Germany has paid its “ debt to the Jewish nation ” in full through its reparations agreement with Israel .
Whereas the Holocaust was an indelible stain on the annals of German history , they stated , Germany must now improve its relations with the Arab world by taking on a more balanced approach to its foreign policy and its treatment of Israel .
This German manifesto was hotly contested by Israeli professors in a debate held Monday at the Strategic Dialogue Center at Netanya College .
This debate was organized by Dov Ben - Meir , a member of the center ’s steering committee and former vice speaker of the Knesset .
Ben -Meir has recently published a “ counter - manifesto ” of his own , which challenges the German professor ’s assertions .
In his manifesto , Ben Meir maintained that it is only after Germany ’s reparations agreement with Israel that the world began to see Germany in a different light and give credence to the “ new German nation ” .
Furthermore , stated Ben Meir , Israel purchased goods from Germany at a value far exceeding the amount given to it in reparation payments .
At any rate , he noted , the money Israel had attained from Germany can not be deemed “ preferential treatment ” , but rather a moral debt paid to those that had been robbed .
Ben -Meir concluded his manifesto with a stark warning to Germany , warning the country that if it ceases its “ preferential treatment ” of Israel , this could very well signal a slow return to the dark days of the Nazi regime .
NEXT month the Burning Bush Baptist Church will hold its first service in a converted Sears department store .
When the church was founded , in 1995 , it had a congregation of 12 .
About 750 now attend Sunday services , and more are joining all the time .
One reason for the church 's growth is the oratorical skill of David Denson , its pastor .
Another is that Burning Bush is a mostly black church , and there are a lot more blacks around these days .
Between 2000 and 2006 the black population of Victorville and Apple Valley swelled from 11,900 to 24,500 .
Two hours ' drive from central Los Angeles and surrounded by Joshua trees , it is an improbable black haven .
Victorville is a former military town on the edge of the Mojave desert to which Orson Welles exiled the writers of “ Citizen Kane ” to ensure they would finish the film without distractions .
Yet Victorville is typical .
Other sprawling exurbs , such as Palmdale and Lancaster , are also seeing an influx of blacks looking for cheaper housing and safer streets .
They reveal a dramatic shift in southern California 's population , and provide clues to how America is changing .
Victorville 's gain is Los Angeles ' loss .
Since 1990 the city 's black population has dropped by a quarter , from 488,000 to 364,000 , even as the overall number of residents rose .
The exodus is most noticeable in areas where blacks were once concentrated , such as Compton and Crenshaw .
The population of the 35th congressional district , over which the old - fashioned race warrior Maxine Waters holds sway , is now less than one - third black .
“ It 's becoming hard to find black neighbourhoods , ” says Dowell Myers , a demographer at the University of Southern California .
It is not easy to find them in Victorville , either .
The city has black apartment buildings and the odd black street but no black districts .
Nor do the other cities to which blacks are moving .
So far , at least , southern California 's ghettos seem to be disintegrating , not relocating .
Price alone seems to determine where the new arrivals settle .
“ If you 've got the money , you can move wherever you want , ” says Eloise Gibson , a retired teacher in Victorville .
A similar drift is evident in northern California , where blacks are leaving the Bay Area for inland spots such as Stockton and Sacramento .
Across America blacks are leaving inner-city areas .
William Frey , a geographer at the Brookings Institution , a think - tank , calculates that the black population of suburban counties increased by a startling 26.5 % between 2000 and 2006 .
They seem to be moving farther out of the city , and faster , in southern California than anywhere else .
A big reason is immigration .
New arrivals from Latin America and Asia have pushed up rents in the metropolis .
Until recently they pushed up house prices , too , benefiting the roughly 40 % of black householders in south - central Los Angeles who own property .
They could afford to move on .
Immigrants have also blurred racial lines , producing a kind of confused tolerance .
Boundaries that might be stark if there were only two races are a lot harder to police when there are more , especially since the groups are gradually blending .
Most of all , Mr Myers says , high house - prices have forced different groups together .
In southern California people will happily trade ethnic homogeneity for an extra bedroom .
It helps that most of the places blacks are moving are fast - growing , with little sense of history .
Victorville has no traditionally white areas because it has no traditional areas of any kind .
Black churches are the clearest sign of Victorville 's changing demography .
These do not , however , resemble the community edifices that one finds in more established neighbourhoods .
Many meet in shops or living rooms .
Mr Denson 's attracts the biggest black congregation in the area , he says , largely because he caters to commuters who want to spend precious hours with their families .
He can get worshippers in and out in an hour and a half — quick for a black church .
Other changes are more worrying .
Ken Jones , a high - school dropout who is learning construction skills , says his family moved from Los Angeles to get him away from gangs .
It worked — he describes his life in Victorville as a “ retirement ” .
But he says gangs and crime are becoming entrenched .
Between 2000 and 2006 the number of robberies in Victorville increased by 62 % .
“ They bring their lifestyle with them , ” says Jim Melton , a youth worker .
At the moment , one of the engines that has driven this migration is stalling .
Victorville and Apple Valley are mired in a housing crisis : San Bernardino county had 22,000 foreclosures last year , compared with 7,800 in 1996 .
Fewer people are moving as house prices fall .
Yet this seems to have slowed , not stopped , the black exodus from Los Angeles .
The pull of the suburbs is strong .
State officials are investigating a Web site that charged New Jersey residents $ 9.95 to fill out voter registration forms .
It 's unclear how many New Jersey residents used IWantToVote.com .
Voter registration is free , and the forms must be hand - signed and mailed in .
State Public Advocate Ronald
Chen said during last week 's presidential primaries , he heard from three people who tried to register to vote on the commercial Web site .
They were turned away at the polling place because they were not officially registered .

Video : Again flustered by Sherri 's views
by Jeremy Hooper
Whoopi , Joy , and even Elisabeth are totally down with teaching their children that same - sex penguins can raise their own little flightless birds .
Sherri Shepherd , however , cries fowl foul :
What does that even mean , that you 're not raising your kid to understand such matters " right now " ?
What are you waiting for , the opportunity for bias to sneak in ?
Because let 's be honest here :
When it comes to acceptance of gay couples , the concept should be such a no - brainer for you as a parent that the " when " you will teach them such is not even up for debate .
It 's simply part of the value system that you instill in them on a daily basis !

One need not look too hard to find a “ moderate ” pundit projecting his or her own desire for a third - party presidential campaign onto the public .
This became especially fashionable a couple of weeks ago , when NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg and a bipartisan group of allies chatted in Oklahoma about some kind of independent bid .
( Unity08 effectively closed its doors to concentrate on its Bloomberg - backing efforts . )
The David Broders of the world argue that most Americans , reasonable and in the center , are fed up with Democrats and Republicans , and are clamoring for someone new to step up and challenge the two parties .
It sounds nice , but it ’s not true .
A new Gallup poll offers some interesting data :
[ R]ecent Gallup polling has assessed some of the public ’s attitudes that could be related to the ultimate success of an independent or third - party candidate running against the two major - party candidates this year .
The data show that Americans are quite positive about the candidates running for president so far , and believe they have suggested good solutions to the nation ’s problems , marking a sharp contrast with what these same measures showed in early 1992 .
Thus , while dissatisfaction in general is high , the American public does not appear to believe it is important or necessary for an independent candidate outside of the traditional two major parties to step into the race in order to save the nation .
Gallup asked , for example , “ Is there any candidate running this year that you think would make a good president , or not ? ”
At this point in the 1992 campaign , only 40 % saw a good president among the candidates .
In 1996 , it was 57 % .
In March 2000 , the number was 71 % .
Now , it ’s 84 % .
That ’s pretty one - sided .
In fact , 84 % of Americans do n’t agree on much , but they ’re looking at the fields of presidential candidates and seem pretty satisfied .
There is a strong message in the film Idiocracy that shows a future due to happen if Hollywood has its way .
Entertainment was in a slow spiral of stupidity , and independent thought was discouraged and civilization crumbles .
We see this brave new world through the eyes of an “ average ” man who is put into hibernation for 500 years .
When he emerges , he is easily recognized as the smartest man on the planet .
So this brings me to ask , can we just be entertained without being made stupid ?
I started thinking this based on a question DJ Machismo offered in a comment .
“ Does anyone go to the movies anymore to be entertained ?
To have fun ? ” and I have to agree .
Does every movie have to be an Oscar contender .
Can movies be made with tons of entertaining qualities and still not just be an insult to our intelligence ?
I am not talking about BAD movies , but why is it when there is an entertaining movie , people automatically start calling it a crap movie because it did n’t change their entire life .
Ca n’t we just watch something blow up without going into a deep dissection of why and how it happened .
Sometimes things just blow up .
And it makes us smile .
The obvious example of this is the often debated and hated Transformers .
I thought the movie rocked .
I love it .
As a purist , I had to admit that despite the changes , it still held true to the “ spirit ” of Transformers .
People complained that it had too many of Bay ’s trademarks ( waving flag , meteor strikes , wide pan angles ) and are quick to make presumptions about the sequel because they do n’t like Michael Bay movies .
At the same time , people are quick to defend Jackass and spoof movies like Meet the Spartans .
If I dare say that Jackass was stupidity , I get a lot of flack saying “ You just do n’t get it ” .
Some movies are just bad because they are stupid .
Not because I “ feel ” they are stupid , but because they are .
People cannot even begin to think they can defend the deeper meaning of the Jackass movies .
They purely are just one scene after another to make you say “ WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT ? ” and flinch a lot .
I know some people have some entertainment with that , and that is fine , but call it what it is .
Stupidity .
So can movies just be entertaining ?
Why are people so critical over movies just because they were just entertaining .
Perhaps you did n’t like a movie or did n’t find it entertaining .
If someone else enjoyed them then so be it .
Let them .
Movies are made to entertain .
Despite some failures , we have to assume that this is the mission of every filmmaker out there when they undertake the process .
Not all movies are going to be moving like The Power of One .
And not all comedies will make you laugh .
If people enjoy fluffy action , cool .
Stupidity , that ’s fine too .
Opinions are like bellybuttons .
We all have em .
What movies are you tired of hearing the same griping about that you still managed to be entertained with ?
Ummm ... you might want to re-phrase your question ... it sounds like you 're looking for drugs .
Try searching for " pottery dealers in Idaho " on Google .
Or look in your local yellow pages under pottery .
Most cities have a number of stores that specialize in them .
Also stores like Home Depot , Costco , Sam's Club and others have them in their outdoors / garden sections .
Doug Giles ’ Unabashed Anti-Atheist Bigotry
Atheists would love for everyone to believe that their motive for not believing is an intellectual one .
Yes , the atheists ardently suppose that they are wise and the Christians , well , we ’re the buckle - shoed buttheads .
Yes , darling , the atheists would love all of us to suppose that they cannot believe because they are so astute and rational , and we theists , heck we ’re toads . . . a veritable troop of abecedarian simpletons who believe in God and Christ simply because we ’re straight goofy .
I think the atheists believe in not believing , however , not because they ’re intellectual little dandies but because they want to be autonomous , loose and randy .
As an atheist , I ’ve always been careful about crying bigotry , because I ’ve felt the freedom and even the necessity to criticize all religions equally .
While atheism is clearly not a religion , ( in the way bald is not a hair color , or celibacy is not a sexual position ) ideas , including our own , must be open to question and most especially mockery and ridicule .
Because humor is a method of getting to the truth and saying things which cannot be said any other way .
As long as we stay in the realm of ideas , then we can freely attack the bad ones , with or without humor .
But once we start with a direct attack on people ’s character , then it becomes bigotry .
Painting your opponents as sex-crazed and amoral libertines firmly crosses this line .
More than anything else , it ’s a sign of religious desperation .
With all their best arguments refuted , they have to resort to tarring and feathering .
First , he quotes several atheist luminaries correctly skewering the arbitrary sexual morality of religion :
Aldous Huxley : “ … the philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation . . . liberation from a certain system of morality .
We objected to the morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom . ”
Bertrand Russell : “ The worst feature of the Christian religion is its attitude toward sex . ” Christopher Hitchens :
“ The divorce between the sexual life and fear . . . can now at last be attempted on the sole condition that we banish all religions from the discourse . ”
Then , with a wave of the hand , he dismisses across the board any and all humanistic moralities , blithely smearing every atheist as the epitome of the irresponsible , amoral , and animalistic sexual libertine , ( presumably just waiting to come and steal the virtue of every righteous daughter–or son for that matter ) .
They did n’t like the thought of being responsible and having to account for their lives in the afterlife .
Such thoughts really screwed with getting their groove on , ya know what I ’m sayin ’ ?
They were the first metrosexuals .
Yep , they figured that if they could just get the gods out of the way they could focus on selfishly milking this life for all it ’s worth and then die without any eternal repercussions .
They were living in a material world , and they were material girls .
Pretty ballsy .
Or stupid .
But at least they were honest about their motivations .
In addition , ladies , Darwin did n’t lose his faith because he discovered natural selection ; he dumped God because he could n’t stomach the doctrine of eternal accountability and damnation .
That ’s what made him switch teams .
I think that was about ten years after he had married his first cousin .
Git -R- Done , Charlie !
Y’know , Karl Marx said religion is the “ opiate of the masses . ”
I think the real poppy derivative is the black tar belief that tells you atheist lads and lasses that when you take the big dirt nap that ’s it .
Ah what peace .
What a high .
No God .
No accountability .
All our sins of commission and omission will never ever come up again .
No pain .
No penalty .
No heaven .
No hell .
Imagine .
Yeah , dude .
Hold that hit .
Let it out slowly .
Ahhh .
Feel better ?
There ’s your opium .
Giles categorically applies this condemnation to all atheists–simply because we have rejected his gods and guilt - based moral prescriptions .
It ’s a good thing we do n’t live in times like pre-WWII , where the Nazis used similar propaganda to make Jews seem subhuman .
( Not that I ’m implying that he has the same political clout to do us harm , but his methods are every bit as bigoted and dehumanizing . )
Nazi films portrayed Jews as “ subhuman ” creatures infiltrating Aryan society .
For example , The Eternal Jew ( 1940 ) , directed by Fritz Hippler , portrayed Jews as wandering cultural parasites , consumed by sex and money .
Or when the U.S. used similar tactics on the Japanese .
A common technique used by propagandists was to liken the Japanese to animals like snakes and rats .
But the most common animal used to portray the Japanese was the monkey .
In several posters and editorial cartoons , the Japanese were drawn up as monkeys hanging from trees or lumbering around like big gorillas .
The image of a subhuman primate was key to undercutting the humanity of the enemy .
The enemy was less than human , thus much easier to kill .
Giles ’ hit piece is right up this alley .
We atheists are less than human , dangerous and not to be trusted , because we reject his gods .
He opines “ They appear to be humming the Marquis de Sade ’s tune more than Sagan’s . ”
While he does n’t explicitly call atheists “ animals , ” he does call us animalistic ( by implication of sexual libertinism ) in every way possible .
The title of his editorial is “ Atheism : Intellectual Revolt or Pelvic Rebellion . ”
While I personally have no problem either with de Sade ’s literature , or with acknowledging my own animal nature , in the conservative religious world Giles inhabits , this is a terrible slur .
We have firmly established the important intellectual beachhead of innate human morality , which has been devastating to the exclusivity of religious morality claims .
But by falsely equating our morality arguments with advocacy of amoral and uncontrolled sexuality and the shirking of all responsibilities , Giles mines the same vein of prejudice creationists use when they tell their children atheists claim “ their grandmother was a monkey . ”
This is cynical last - ditch attack politics .
It ’s an attempt to separate humanity from our vitally important animal origins and animal nature .
Ironically , it is the most religious ( who vehemently deny their nature ) who seem to get caught in a sex scandal about every five minutes .
Giles fails to see the irony and failure of religion to control these impulses , and the failure of his own scriptural ideals .
Yet these cartoon distortions of hedonistic atheism persist , diverting attention from the very same problems and hypocrisies of religion , and attempting once again to remove the discussion from where the zealots are weakest : the realm of ideas .
Rescuers picked through the rubble in the southern United States on Wednesday , a day after a deadly string of tornadoes destroyed houses , uprooted trees and overturned transport trucks .
The death toll climbed to 55 by Wednesday evening .
Thirty - one people died in Tennessee , authorities said , and 13 others perished in Arkansas , seven in Kentucky and four in Alabama .

Hundreds more were injured in the storms that struck Tuesday night , as millions of Americans voted in the Super Tuesday primaries .
Twisters also struck in Mississippi , although no deaths were immediately reported .
National Guard and rescue teams went from home to home in the devastated areas , looking for injured survivors and bodies among the heaps of debris .
Ray and Nova Story tried to drive their badly injured uncle to a hospital after a tornado destroyed his mobile home near Lafayette , north of Nashville , Tenn .
The 30 - minute ride turned into a two - hour ordeal , as neighbours used chainsaws to try to clear a path through the debris so that the Storys ' pickup truck could get through .
" He never had a chance , " Nova said of her uncle , Bill Clark .
" I looked him right in the eye and he died right there in front of me . "
The United States has not seen such a deadly barrage of tornadoes since May 31 , 1985 , when 76 people were killed in Pennsylvania and Ohio .
On Tuesday , there were 67 eyewitness accounts of tornadoes , but some of those were probably twisters that were counted more than once , said Oklahoma meteorologist Greg Carbin .
The actual number is probably more like 30 or 40 , he said .
President pledges government aid
U.S. President George W. Bush expressed his condolences Wednesday to the families of those who died and pledged that his government would come to their aid .
He said he called the governors of Alabama , Arkansas , Kentucky , Mississippi and Tennessee to assure them help was on its way .

" The American people will hold those who suffered up in prayer , " Bush said .
" This government will help them . "
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Wednesday it was sending teams into the region to assist local authorities and assess the damage .
The storms were part of a rare spasm of winter weather that stretched over the south and central regions .
As the extent of the damage quickly became clear , several U.S. presidential candidates paused in their speeches to supporters to remember the victims .
In Castalian Springs , Tenn. , a passerby discovered a crying baby lying alone in a field across from a demolished post office .
Emergency officials said the baby seems unharmed , although they have not been able to locate the parents .
The death toll in Arkansas included a couple and their 11 - year - old daughter who died when a tornado hit their house in Atkins , a city of 3,000 in the centre of the state .
" Neighbours and friends who were there said , ' There used to be a home there , ' " Pope County coroner Leonard Krout said .

" We looked up and saw the funnel coming in .
We started running and then glass just exploded , " he said .
" I hit the floor and a couch was shoved up against me , which may have saved my life because the roof fell on top of it . "
At least two dormitories on campus were destroyed , but the school 's president , David S. Dockery , said the students were well - versed in evacuation drills , as the campus had been hit by tornadoes before .
Fifty students were sent to hospital , but are said to be recovering .
A massive explosion erupted at a natural gas pumping station outside of Nashville Tuesday after the station was apparently hit by one of the tornadoes , but no one was killed , a company spokesman said Wednesday .
The blast shot flames hundreds of metres in the air and rattled windows for kilometres , witnesses said .

1 . First off , lets put in a simple fact : Pizza delivery is considered a hazardous job by the US government .
They are third most likely to be murdered on the job , right after police officers and taxi drivers .
Myself being a 22 year old female , that risk is approximately 5 times greater .
Although I ’m not in the US , Canada has plenty of latent axe - wielding maniacs , disgruntled computer geeks that have n’t stepped out of their house in months , crazy cat ladies , pig men , and other potentially dangerous creatures .
That brings me to my next point … 2 .
If I drive 10 km out of town to your trailer park , and you open the door in a sleeveless plaid shirt , and then ask me to come in , do n’t get offended if I do n’t .
Do n’t get offended if I take off running either .
You might be a decent guy , but I ’ve seen enough cliché axe murderer movies to know better .
3 . Chances are , though , if you ’re the creep in the plaid shirt living in the trailer park , I will probably like you a lot more than that family in the mansion in the most affluent part of town .
Because , you , scary redneck friend , are probably going to tip me close to 30 % of the order .
Whereas foreign mansion family will end up giving me a 20 on a $ 19.80 order and generously tell me to keep the change .
Ever wonder how some people can afford to live in a 6500 sq ft house with a swimming pool ?
They do n’t tip .
4 .
That brings us to tipping .
To the lady that asked me if I was in school , and upon my affirmative reply gave me a quarter , and said “ I know how hard it is to be in school and work so hard ” – Thanks !!
You were pretty young too , and of course living in one of those mansions .
I thought you ’d know better .
To the guy who told me I was really cute for a pizza delivery driver and left me no tip – thanks !!
My cuteness wo n’t pay for nursing school .
To the Korean broad that waited for me to count out the nickels and dimes and then got mad because I do n’t carry pennies and thus could n’t give exact change ( 3 more cants ) , who then called my boss and told him she was “ lipped off ” ( think she meant ripped off ) – Fuck you !
5 .
If you tell me you ca n’t afford to tip when I get there , you ca n’t afford delivery .
6 .
If you ca n’t afford delivery charges , you ca n’t afford delivery .
To that guy who called the pizza place and asked us to deliver 2 towns over ( we ’re in Coquitlam , he was in maple ridge ) and asked us to take off the delivery charge too because he can’t afford gas for even himself :
Fuck you , you selfish prick .
Clearly you know the price of gas these days , and you ’re probably smart enough to know that the petroleum pixies do n’t come and fill my tank every night , so do n’t tell me it ’s my loss when I refuse to deliver to you .
7 .
Lets put down some blatant honesty : I ’m not hot .
I can maybe pull off cute on a good day , so I do n’t know why I suddenly transform into a goddess when I come to your door with food .
Clearly you ’ve been watching way too many pornos .
8. # 7 goes double for rainy days .
Apparently runny makeup and flat hair mixed with pizza are major turn for the lazy Dom asses of Coquitlam .
No I do n’t need a towel .
No I will not come in to dry off .
I ca n’t give you my number .
What ?
No , really , I ’m not into that .
9 . Do n’t get mad at me if we made a mistake on your pizza .
Chances are you knew we were going to make a mistake if you check the pizza at the front door .
Also , most of the high school kids I work with do n’t have a clue as to what a quadrant is …
“ I want pineapple in quadrants 1 and 2 , and ham in quadrants 1 and 4 and half of quadrant 3 with pepperoni ” Gimme a fucking break !! .
And who the hell orders pizza in quadrants anyways ?
10 .
Do n’t get mad at me if your pizza is 45 minutes late .
I was trapped on some guy ’s front porch while a bear was sniffing around my car that now permanently smells like a pizza .
Yes , a bear .
And do n’t act surprised , we live in the middle of fucking nowhere .
And do n’t leave me no tip me because I ’m “ a liar ” .
If I wanted to swing by a friend ’s house on my way to your place , I ’d say I was caught in traffic , or something more believable than a fucking bear !
11 .
Speaking of traffic …
The neighborhood where I work is predominantly foreign ( I wont say what nationality but you can probably guess where bad drivers that happen to be non-tippers come from ) .
So if I ’m late because a hummer that has “ environmental consultants ” written on it ( ah , how I love cliché ’s ) runs a red and almost kills me , pardon fucking me if I have to pull over for a few minutes to collect myself , thus making your pizza 4 minutes later than the promised time .
Okay , I ’m off to work now .
Be nice to me !!!
Oprah Winfrey Takes Over Discovery Health Channel
will soon own the world .
The queen of talk shows has bought Discovery Health Channel and will rename it OWN : the Oprah Winfrey Network .
With her latest purchase , Oprah will have full control over all editorial , programming and branding decisions .
I wonder if Oprah has any motivational books out .
I really need to get some of what she has .
Just one question .
Will Oprah 's best friend Gayle King have her OWN show ?
NEW YORK ( AP ) 
The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report will resume production on Jan. 7 without their striking writers , the Comedy Central network announced Thursday .
Both late - night shows were shuttered after the Hollywood writers strike began seven weeks ago .
The comedy duo are the latest late - night hosts to announce their return to the air while the ongoing writers strike continues to devastate much television and film production .
Jay Leno , Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Kimmel have all recently said that they will resume their programs on Jan. 2 with or without their writing staffs .
On Friday , leaders of striking television writers plan to meet with David Letterman 's production company in an attempt to reach a separate deal that could return the Late Show to the air with its writing staff .
But The Daily Show and The Colbert Report rely far more on scripted material than those shows , which are more centered around interviews and musical guests .
In a joint statement , Stewart and Colbert said : " We would like to return to work with our writers .
If we cannot , we would like to express our ambivalence , but without our writers we are unable to express something as nuanced as ambivalence . "
A spokesman for Comedy Central said neither the network , Stewart nor Colbert would have any further comment .
A call to the Writers Guild of America was not immediately returned late Thursday .

Descendants of Sitting Bull , Crazy Horse break away from US Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday December 20 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This The Lakota Indians , who gave the world legendary warriors Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse , have withdrawn from treaties with the United States , leaders said Wednesday .
" We are no longer citizens of the United States of America and all those who live in the five - state area that encompasses our country are free to join us , " long - time Indian rights activist Russell Means told a handful of reporters and a delegation from the Bolivian embassy , gathered in a church in a run-down neighborhood of Washington for a news conference .
A delegation of Lakota leaders delivered a message to the State Department on Monday , announcing they were unilaterally withdrawing from treaties they signed with the federal government of the United States , some of them more than 150 years old .
They also visited the Bolivian , Chilean , South African and Venezuelan embassies , and will continue on their diplomatic mission and take it overseas in the coming weeks and months , they told the news conference .
Lakota country includes parts of the states of Nebraska , South Dakota , North Dakota , Montana and Wyoming .
The new country would issue its own passports and driving licences , and living there would be tax - free -- provided residents renounce their US citizenship , Means said .
The treaties signed with the United States are merely " worthless words on worthless paper , " the Lakota freedom activists say on their website .
The treaties have been " repeatedly violated in order to steal our culture , our land and our ability to maintain our way of life , " the reborn freedom movement says .
Withdrawing from the treaties was entirely legal , Means said .
" This is according to the laws of the United States , specifically article six of the constitution , " which states that treaties are the supreme law of the land , he said .
" It is also within the laws on treaties passed at the Vienna Convention and put into effect by the US and the rest of the international community in 1980 .
We are legally within our rights to be free and independent , " said Means .
The Lakota relaunched their journey to freedom in 1974 , when they drafted a declaration of continuing independence -- an overt play on the title of the United States ' Declaration of Independence from England .
Thirty - three years have elapsed since then because " it takes critical mass to combat colonialism and we wanted to make sure that all our ducks were in a row , " Means said .
One duck moved into place in September , when the United Nations adopted a non-binding declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples -- despite opposition from the United States , which said it clashed with its own laws .
" We have 33 treaties with the United States that they have not lived by .
They continue to take our land , our water , our children , " Phyllis Young , who helped organize the first international conference on indigenous rights in Geneva in 1977 , told the news conference .
The US " annexation " of native American land has resulted in once proud tribes such as the Lakota becoming mere " facsimiles of white people , " said Means .
Oppression at the hands of the US government has taken its toll on the Lakota , whose men have one of the shortest life expectancies -- less than 44 years -- in the world .
Lakota teen suicides are 150 percent above the norm for the United States ; infant mortality is five times higher than the US average ; and unemployment is rife , according to the Lakota freedom movement 's website .
" Our people want to live , not just survive or crawl and be mascots , " said Young .
" We are not trying to embarrass the United States .
We are here to continue the struggle for our children and grandchildren , " she said , predicting that the battle would not be won in her lifetime .

Nick Hornby and the rest of the Islington soccerati were not the first football fans to toss salad ; Chelsea fans have been flinging celery around at games since the mid-80s .
So it came as something of a shock to three of their number when they were hauled out of the crowd during their team 's FA Cup semi-final against Fulham and charged with " throwing celery without lawful authority " .
Charlie Driver , 40 , David Blake , 28 , and Robbie Sanders , 28 , were today given good behaviour orders by Birmingham magistrates after they were dragged from the Villa Park stands for throwing the vegetable in the general direction of Fulham manager Jean Tigana .
The court , which was told how Chelsea fans traditionally lob the vegetable about to the refrain " if she do n't come , I 'll tickle her bum with a stick of celery " , took into account the friendly atmosphere surrounding the semi-final , and the fact that no celery was actually thrown onto the pitch / allotment .
The three will each be fined £ 300 if they break the order or are caught throwing celery in the next 12 months .
Speaking after the hearing , Mr Driver , who has never been in trouble with the police before , said : " I 'm relieved I can still go and watch Chelsea , still keep my season ticket and I 've got no criminal convictions .
" I wo n't be eating any celery anymore , or throwing it . "
But how does a fan gain " lawful authority " to toss salad in the direction of the opposition 's bench ?
Guardian Unlimited Football asked a leading sports law expert to find out .
" Throwing celery without lawful authority is assault , " he explained .
" The fans in question could only have receive permission from Tigana himself , who must give his express consent to throw celery at him .
" It does n't have to be written consent , so long as he makes himself clear that he is willing for celery to be thrown at him .
" However , the fans would be allowed to throw celery at Tigana if they were defending themselves against him .
Perhaps if he was chasing them with a pointed stick . "

The Oscar nominated star has revealed he had no idea he lived so close to the Toxic singer until the media frenzy happened the night she was hospitalised .
Now Clooney insists he is looking for a new home because he can't cope with all the press swarming the area .
Clooney told the Huffington Post : " I 'd gone upstairs , and I came out and I 'm in a robe .
All of the sudden I see all this s*** going on .
" I have a guest house where my assistant sometimes is , and I think , someone has broken out of prison and like escaped , because it 's a chase scene .
It 's something out of Die Hard .
" I get my baseball bat , which is what you always get in every film - and I called up my assistant , who I thought was in the guest house , and I said , ' Are you OK ? '
Scroll down for more
" And she 's like , ' Yes . '
And I said , ' Look , if there 's someone in the place , say the word Stonehenge . '
" And she 's like , ' What the f --k are you talking about ?
I 'm in my apartment . '
" I go , ' You 're not in the guesthouse ? ' " ' No . '
" So I 'm , like , ' Well , then , what the f*** is going on ? '
And I go out and I 'm running around with a baseball bat in my robe .
" And it turns out it 's Britney Spears ' house is like , 300 yards from mine .
So now I have to move . "

Top 10 Secure Coding Practices
Validate input .
Validate input from all untrusted data sources .
Proper input validation can eliminate the vast majority of software vulnerabilities .
Be suspicious of most external data sources , including command line arguments , network interfaces , environmental variables , and user controlled files [ Seacord 05 ] .
Heed compiler warnings .
Compile code using the highest warning level available for your compiler and eliminate warnings by modifying the code [ C MSC00 - A , C++ MSC00 - A ] .
Use static and dynamic analysis tools to detect and eliminate additional security flaws .
Architect and design for security policies .
Create a software architecture and design your software to implement and enforce security policies .
For example , if your system requires different privileges at different times , consider dividing the system into distinct intercommunicating subsystems , each with an appropriate privilege set .
Keep it simple .
Keep the design as simple and small as possible [ Saltzer 74 , Saltzer 75 ] .
Complex designs increase the likelihood that errors will be made in their implementation , configuration , and use .
Additionally , the effort required to achieve an appropriate level of assurance increases dramatically as security mechanisms become more complex .
Default deny .
Base access decisions on permission rather than exclusion .
This means that , by default , access is denied and the protection scheme identifies conditions under which access is permitted [ Saltzer 74 , Saltzer 75 ] .
Adhere to the principle of least privilege .
Every process should execute with the the least set of privileges necessary to complete the job .
Any elevated permission should only be accessed for the least amount of time required to complete the privileged task .
This approach reduces the opportunities an attacker has to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges [ ] .
Sanitize data sent to other systems .
Sanitize all data passed to complex subsystems [ C STR02 - A ] such as command shells , relational databases , and commercial off - the - shelf ( COTS ) components .
Attackers may be able to invoke unused functionality in these components through the use of SQL , command , or other injection attacks .
This is not necessarily an input validation problem because the complex subsystem being invoked does not understand the context in which the call is made .
Because the calling process understands the context , it is responsible for sanitizing the data before invoking the subsystem .
Practice defense in depth .
Manage risk with multiple defensive strategies , so that if one layer of defense turns out to be inadequate , another layer of defense can prevent a security flaw from becoming an exploitable vulnerability and / or limit the consequences of a successful exploit .
For example , combining secure programming techniques with secure runtime environments should reduce the likelihood that vulnerabilities remaining in the code at deployment time can be exploited in the operational environment [ Seacord 05 ] .
Use effective quality assurance techniques .
Good quality assurance techniques can be effective in identifying and eliminating vulnerabilities .
Fuzz testing , penetration testing , and source code audits should all be incorporated as part of an effective quality assurance program .
Independent security reviews can lead to more secure systems .
External reviewers bring an independent perspective ; for example , in identifying and correcting invalid assumptions [ Seacord 05 ] .
Adopt a secure coding standard .
Develop and / or apply a secure coding standard for your target development language and platform .
Bonus Secure Coding Practices
Define security requirements .
Identify and document security requirements early in the development life cycle and make sure that subsequent development artifacts are evaluated for compliance with those requirements .
When security requirements are not defined , the security of the resulting system cannot be effectively evaluated .
Model threats .
Use threat modeling to anticipate the threats to which the software will be subjected .
Threat modeling involves identifying key assets , decomposing the application , identifying and categorizing the threats to each asset or component , rating the threats based on a risk ranking , and then developing threat mitigation strategies that are implemented in designs , code , and test cases [ Swiderski 04 ] .
Bonus Photograph
We like the following photograph because it illustrates how the easiest way to break system security is often to circumvent it rather than defeat it ( as is the case with most software vulnerabilities related to insecure coding practices ) .
The photograph depicted a street ( named Konsequenz ) in the University Bielefeld , Germany , at lat / long .

Zoey 101 Season Finale Hit Ratings Jackpot
has captured the full attention of the age 9 - 14 viewing audience with her Zoey 101 cable TV show .
The season finale , the first episode to air since Spears pregnancy was announced , drew a phenomenal crowd of watchers .
Nielsen Media Research put the number at 7.3 million households who tuned in to watch the hour long broadcast .
The Nick show was already enjoying a great ratings run with an average of 3 million tweens and young teens tuning in to view the antics of the 16 year old .
Friday 's broadcast was the second most watched cable show for the entire day - a huge ratings bonanza .
Nickelodeon will begin airing the all new fourth season of Zoey 101 in February .
The filming of those episodes was already completed before Spears pregnancy news .
It will be interesting to see if the younger set will stay loyal and if they do , will the Nick network welcome Jamie Lynn back with open arms for a fifth season .
Revenue usually trumps anything else so it should be interesting .
Jamie Lynn Spears has returned to her home in Louisiana and is working toward her GED , an alternative to getting a high school diploma .
The U.S. military buildup that was supposed to calm Baghdad and other trouble spots has failed to usher in national reconciliation , as the capital ’s neighborhoods rupture even further along sectarian lines , violence shifts elsewhere and Iraq ’s government remains mired in political infighting .
In the coming days , U.S. military and government leaders will offer Congress their assessment of the 6 - month - old plan ’s results .
But a review of statistics on death and displacement , political developments and the impressions of Iraqis who are living under the heightened military presence reaches a dispiriting conclusion .
Despite the plan , which has brought an additional 28,500 U.S. troops to Iraq since February , none of the major legislation that Washington had expected the Iraqi parliament to pass into law has been approved .
The number of Iraqis fleeing their homes has increased , not decreased , according to the United Nations ’ International Organization for Migration and Iraq ’s Ministry for Displacement and Migration .

Military officials say sectarian killings in Baghdad are down more than 51 % and attacks on civilians and security forces across Iraq have decreased .
But this has not translated into a substantial drop in civilian deaths as insurgents take their lethal trade to more remote regions .
Last month , as many as 400 people were killed in a bombing in a village near the Syrian border , the worst bombing since the war began in March 2003 .
In July , 150 people were reported killed in a village about 100 miles north of Baghdad .
And in a sign that tamping down Sunni - Shiite violence is no guarantee of stability , a feud between rival Shiite Muslim militias has killed scores of Iraqis in recent months .
Last week , at least 52 people died in militia clashes in the Shiite holy city of Karbala .
At best , analysts , military officers and ordinary Iraqis portray the country as in a holding pattern , dependent on U.S. troops to keep the lid on violence .
“ The military offensive has temporarily suppressed , or in many cases dislocated , armed groups , ” said Joost Hiltermann of the International Crisis Group .
“ Once the military surge peters out , which it will if there is no progress on the political front , these groups will pop right back up and start going at each other ’s , and civilians ’ , throats again . ”

Political stalemate
Iraq ’s political stalemate and the continued violence have forced a major shift in the mind - set of U.S. officials , who had lofty visions of the plan creating conditions under which Prime Minister Nouri Maliki ’s Shiite - led government would foster reconciliation among Shiites , Sunni Arabs and Kurds .
Like the Baghdad neighborhoods where Sunni and Shiite Muslims and Christians once lived side by side , the early troop - buildup “ benchmarks ” have been whittled down to remnants of their former selves .
Now , military and government officials highlight progress on the local , neighborhood and even street level .
Much of it hinges on the future of deals struck with former insurgents who until recently were aiming their guns at U.S. forces .
Advertisement
“ There are . . . if you will , mini - benchmarks where things are happening , ” U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker said Aug. 21 .
Crocker cited Anbar province , west of Baghdad , where violence has dropped substantially since Sunni Arab leaders there began working with U.S. and Iraqi security forces .
“ We ’ve seen that phenomenon in different forms move through different parts of the country , ” Crocker said .
“ It ’s the steps these tribes , communities , individuals are taking .
. . .
You ’ve got to keep an eye on that too . ”
Anbar ’s situation is far from solid , though .
A bomber attacked a mosque in one of its main cities , Fallouja , on Aug. 27 , killing at least 10 people , and scores of civilians and Iraqi security forces have died in bombings elsewhere in the province in recent months .
Anbar also represents just one particularly homogenous Sunni Arab slice .
There is no indication that progress made there can be replicated on a grand enough scale to have a nationwide effect .
Advertisement
“ It ’s always easy to get the prospective loser in a civil war to agree to a cease - fire , ” said Stephen Biddle , a counterinsurgency expert at the Council on Foreign Relations who has advised military commanders in Iraq .
Sunnis are a minority and far more open to switching loyalties if it ensures them a future stake in governing Iraq , he said .
“ It ’s a lot tougher to get the prospective winner to agree to a cease - fire , ” Biddle said , referring to the majority Shiites .
“ Getting them to sign on is going to be harder because they see themselves in ascendancy . ”
Expressing optimism
Publicly , at least , U.S. military leaders express optimism .
Advertisement
“ The effects of our surge and reconciliation efforts are beginning to pay off , ” the day - to - day commander of U.S. ground troops , Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno , told a Pentagon news briefing Aug. 17 .
“ Total attacks are on a monthlong decline and are at their lowest levels since August of 2006 .
Attacks against civilians are at a six - month low . ”
President Bush and Crocker also lauded an announcement by Maliki that Shiite , Kurdish and Sunni leaders had resolved differences over some of the legislation sought by Washington .
But Sunni leaders say this is not enough to make them end their boycott of parliament , which reconvenes today after a summer break .
The lack of Sunni participation would undermine the credibility of any bill passed into law .
Privately , many troops say the military buildup should have been able to do far more by now than cut the number of attacks in some neighborhoods .
Advertisement
Pouring troops into the capital is no doubt going to make some areas safer , said one Marine officer , who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the upcoming assessment .
“ I do n’t know anyone who said , ‘ Let ’s have an argument on whether 20,000 troops can have an impact on some neighborhoods , ’ ” the officer said .
“ I heard a debate about whether a 20,000 - man surge would appreciably enhance the security of the Iraqi people and end the sectarian violence so political reconciliation could occur across the country , not just in Baghdad neighborhoods .
“ This is not a military contest , ” he said .
The shakiness of Iraq ’s capacity for reconciliation under current conditions is especially evident in Baghdad , the focus of the buildup .
The sprawling capital is a patchwork quilt of neighborhoods split along sectarian lines that appears to have become more balkanized , not less , in the last six months .
Advertisement
“ The surge now is isolating areas from each other . . . and putting up permanent checkpoints .
That is what I call a failure , ” said Yousif Kinany , an engineer in Hurriya , a northwestern area that has become primarily Shiite .
Sectarian ‘ cleansing ’
People who describe their neighborhoods as calm often attribute this to the sectarian “ cleansing ” of Sunnis or Shiites .
Many say that better security is attributable to a heavy U.S. presence in their neighborhoods and that whenever those troops scale down operations , trouble returns .
Hamid Abdul Kareem , a supermarket owner in the northeastern neighborhood of Shaab , said the area was relatively secure .
He said that was because of an exodus of Sunni families from Shaab , where the Mahdi Army loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr has a strong presence .
Advertisement
“ Sunnis still live in the region , but I think within the next year , the region will be totally Shiite , ” Kareem said .
Hassan Shimari is one such Sunni .
He lives in Shaab with his wife , a Shiite .
He also wears a beard and is grateful for his dark complexion because it makes him look more Shiite than Sunni .
He said Shaab was quiet because Sunnis were lying low and because there was still enough of an American presence there to keep Shiite militias under control .
“ If there is any weakening of the American forces here , it will be very , very bad , ” said Shimari , a taxi driver .
“ In the last three days , I ’ve driven four families at 6 in the morning to travel companies so they could leave for Syria .
Those who can afford it leave . ”

Civilian toll
Determining accurate civilian death tolls is virtually impossible in Iraq , where the government has no single source for reporting deaths related to the war .
Whichever numbers one uses , however , it is clear that thousands of Iraqis continue to be slain or driven from their homes .
According to U.S. military figures , an average of 1,000 Iraqis have died each month since March in sectarian violence .
That compares with about 1,200 a month at the start of the security plan , the military said in an e-mailed response to queries .
This does not include deaths from car bombings , which the military said have numbered more than 2,600 this year .
Figures from Iraqi government ministries point to far higher casualty numbers and show that this year , an average of 1,724 civilians a month have died in sectarian attacks , bombings and other war - related violence .
Advertisement
In February , the civilian death toll was 1,646 .
Last month , it was 1,773 , according to numbers from officials in the ministries of Defense , Interior and Health , who cite morgue , hospital and police reports .
It was the second straight month that casualties have increased since the security plan began .
Dana Graber - Ladek of the International Organization for Migration said internal displacement had escalated since the troop buildup began .
The increase is partly because of people fleeing military offensives , and partly because of better record - keeping by the Ministry for Displacement and Migration , Graber - Ladek said .
But 63 % of those displaced this year said they had moved because of threats to their security , according to the International Organization for Migration .
One - fourth said they were forced from their homes .
The organization also said that 69 % of newly displaced Iraqis had left homes in Baghdad , a sign that sectarian cleansing continues in the capital .
These people had either moved to new neighborhoods in the capital or had left Baghdad altogether .
Advertisement
“ Basically , Iraqis are fleeing because they flee for their lives , ” Graber - Ladek said .
“ As long as the violence continues , displacement will continue . ”
Opposition in U.S .
Bush faces heightened opposition to the war even within his own party .
That opposition probably will increase unless the report given to Congress offers a positive picture that remains elusive to most in Iraq .
But no matter how much of a letdown Iraqis say the troop buildup has been , many here say withdrawing U.S. forces would make things worse .
In areas where they are present , at least , violence is at bay , most Iraqis said .
Advertisement
For the troops , the fear is that any gains will be lost if there is an abrupt pullout .
“ As a professional soldier , you want to make sure that when you walk away , all the blood , sweat and tears you and your soldiers put in achieved something , ” said Capt .
Jonathan Fursman , a company commander with the 2nd Battalion , 3rd Infantry Regiment , in south Baghdad ’s volatile Dora neighborhood , a Sunni area .
“ It may be the right time for the American people , but in no shape or form is it the right time for the Iraqi people . ”

‘ There used to be marriages between Shiite and Sunnis , but now there is nothing like that , as if the two are from two different religions .

Or is it because many merchants and residents have left ? ’

These seem to be the daze of shooting into a crowd .
Mass shootings for no reason into students by students , wackos shooting many people for no reason .
The press is for keeping an eye on the government , and it is not like there is nothing going on in government that needs to be watched by the press .
Either dKos has been infiltrated , the leadership there planned it this way , or the leadership just does not have a clue .
On the other hand there is something to be said of having multi-faceted views .
But the dKos problem is that they handle it like neoCons , attacking the messenger instead of the message .
That is the DNA of an intellectual bankruptcy trying to equalize it with a power trip putting down another instead of countering the argument .

It 's a real shame .
And I mean that sincerely .
There used to be a lot of interesting and thoughtful commentary over there --- you still had to sift through some lame posts , naturally , but it was n't that hard .
Because there was so much variety and diversity of opinion , it was easy to find something for everyone .
Not anymore .
The pissy hall monitors have run off all the interesting people , or crushed them under the weight of the accumulated groupthink .
Those who do not adhere to the dKonventional Wisdom are vilified and metaphorically drawn and quartered .
Perhaps they will return to sanity and open , decent discourse after the primaries are over , but somehow I doubt it .
The true character of some of their regulars is rather disturbing , and very disappointing .
Granted , ' it takes all kinds to make a world ' , as the saying goes , but for some reason I expected better of progressives .

David Sirota is just one of the last to receive lambasting ... they just pilloried Ralph Nader for announcing his presidential run , acknowledging that his run was only in order to get his message heard .
I could not finish reading the comments they were so vituperative .
What happened to promoting democratic ideals ?
As a blog they should be discussing the issues brought up by his run .... not repeating the repug talking points that Ralph stole the election from Gore ... WAKE - UP .. the repug dominated Supreme Court stole the election from the US people and Gore !
Divide and conquer , marginalize and vilify ... just do n't ... GASP ... have a reasoned discourse .
David Sirota is just one of many being attacked .
Why ?
Markos has recently been made a mainstream media pundit ... it seems to me that there may have been a deal to add some ' moving to the center ' type front pagers on his staff .
Well .... " et tu brutus " ... someday soon from those he thinks are his friends .

Looks like Josh Marshall at TPM is another who repeats the repug talking points on Nader .
I thought these supposedly progressive thinkers were more intelligent and respectful of democratic ideals .
I want to commend BradBlog for the more open and easy to use posting policy .

Archicoot # 8 , #9 : Speaking of Nader , his entry into the presidential race is a big boon for election fraudsters .
The reason for this is that the concept of plausible deniability has been introduced .
Those engaged in election fraud can use as one of their techniques the siphoning off of votes to Nader to help their " chosen candidate " win the election .
It is amazing what comes to mind when you look at things from an election integrity perspective .
Some would call this paranoia or cynicism but in our current universe all of this is entirely doable .

Attacks by the party hacks on David Sirota , Nader and Brad continue to remind me that there is only one political party in the US , the corporate / big money party , controlled by the ultra-rich .
They 're not on my side .
The more I hear these lizard - brained FOX News style attacks on anyone not 100 % with the ruling class party line , the more likely I am to change my mind and vote for Nader .
So go ahead boys , cut your own throats .

This is sort of off topic I guess but I can’t help myself .
Sirota is one of my favorite writers yet he is clearly a very strong party loyalist and hesitates to talk about anything that might be considered too near the “ fringe ” .
That observation is not intended as an attack or even criticism ;
It is eyebrow raising though .
I read him all the time but I ’ve always been worried that the day would come when I would click on his blog and see a nasty attack on Nader or on election integrity activists .
Does anyone know his positions ?

I think the author of this article and the readers of this Website should disavow themselves of any notion that DailyKos is in any way a " progressive " site , " supposedly - , " " purportedly - , " or in actuality .
The main purpose , as expressed in DKos 's " mission statement , " is to elect Democrats - not progressives , not socialists , not Greens - to political office at all levels of government .
Here 's a link directly to the part of the FAQ that addresses this issue : http://dkosopedia.com/wi..._purpose_of_this_site.3F
While DailyKos does air a certain percentage of " progressive " viewpoints , there are also many " centrists " and " conservative Democrats , " whose posts are barely distinguishable from what used to be called " moderate Republican thinking . "
The Website 's owner himself regularly savaged Dennis Kucinich during the early months of this primary season before offering his self - described half - hearted endorsement of Kucinich .
Today 's highlighted journals include a number that curse Ralph Nader for daring to take advantage of his First Amendment rights and run for President .
So if any of you , including the owner of _this_ site , think that what 's talked about at Daily Kos reflects a broadly progressive consensus , please think again .

Keep up the good work Brad .
We 've got a long way to go and if Kos does n't want to help then just ignore them .
We 'll probably find some Independents and Republicans along the way who will see value in Election Integrity .
There 'll be enough patriotic Americans who will fight for fair accurate elections .
It 's just gonna take some time .
You 're a hero to me , but let 's just keep that between you and me .

Daily Kos keeps digging itself into a deeper hole .
Maybe Brad{CIA} and RawStory {Russian Mafia} could come together and make us a forum .
There is a real need for an honest , fair place for amateur and professional bloggers to work together .
Just kidding with the CIA / Russian Mafia thing .
I still can't believe the John Caylor dude posted that .
Most of us post because it gives us the hope that even nobodies can make a difference .
It 's one thing for Kos and others to trample on regular folks , and I 'm not condoning that , but to attack a nationally syndicated columnist willing to post at their forum is beyond ridiculous .
I believe that there are insidious people who are paid to post on the internet .
They are n't like Brad or Sirota , trying to craft an open agenda niche on the internet .
Rather , they appear to be simply making disinformation posts as part of their job .
Here is one example that seems to fit the bill for that , someone named Ferrous .
He works for a law firm with ties to Jack Abramoff and Chalabi .
Is Ferrous part of another type of Netvocates scam which uses the internet to further hidden agendas ?
Maybe " Ferrous " can enlighten us to the origin of the astroturfing campaign about " conspiracy nutters . "
Right - wing smear machine tries to crucify Al Gore posted by Ferrous " They have never , and I repeat , never smeared anyone on the right like this , not even close . "
You must be joking .
I suppose all the constant hatred at the current President of the United States of various members of his cabinet does n't qualify as smearing in your warped little reality .
And that 's just the tip of the iceberg .
It must be great to live permanently in liberal la la land .
Give my regards to Al Gore , Jimmy Carter , and Michael Moore who all own massive palace complexes there .
Here is something the original blogger said in reply .
Maybe he based this on access to Ferrous ' ip address ?
posted by Richard Oh , and by the way , the commenter Ferrous works for a firm called Preston Gates Ellis .
Here 's the first line of its write - up in Wikipedia : " From 1994 to 2001 , Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds LLP employed Jack Abramoff , a Republican lobbyist later convicted for his illegal activities .
" So now we know .
Congratulations Ferrous - you 're in fine company .

Let me ask a simple question .
If you were boarding a plane , and there were 4 or 5 young mid-eastern men , some with heavy accents speaking broken English , would you feel at ease , knowing that their Civil Rights were n't being violated by us not taking a little notice of them ?
We are at war , and the enemy has been identified .
Now it is up to us to sort through all of those that fit the description .
War is hell , and a lot more people are going to be killed .
Should we do everything that we can , to give us an advantage over these terroist , that hide among their own kind ?
Would n't you think that lawful Islamic people in this country would wish to help ?
That might be the biggest question .
Are the lawful Islamic people willing to help the West , by betraying the radical fundamentalists ?
If the Islamic people can't aid us in tracking down these crimminals and putting an end to their " Evil " then this might be the " Jihad " .
In that case , it will mean either the end of Islam or " Hell on Earth " Here Ferrous admits to working with that firm mentioned above .
http://soundpolitics.com/archives/006540.html
... I can vouch for this .
Pedersen is one of the partners at the firm .
( I work there .
Does n't mean I have to like it . )
Posted by : ferrous on July 27 , 2006 02:21 PM
People can engine search that firm , Jack Abramoff , throw in Chalabi and the CIA if they want .
My question is where do all these hotshots get the time to make thousands of posts ?
Are we supposed to believe they are doing this in their free time ?

Sirota has an interesting expose on Clinton 's NAFTA history .
It shows that Obama is correct about her statements and positions on NAFTA .
Ohio may give her a dose of accountability , from their dire straights economic condition , for having done so .

Afterll , Marcos did admit he once was CIA .
What do they say about that ?
You never leave the Company .

Well , Jillian , to be precise I do n't think Marcos has ever said " he was once CIA . "
Both you and I should have links to these assertions , however !
It 's important that , if we 're going to slam someone or cast aspersions on their associations , that we take the time and care to back it up .
Thank you for qualifying your statement to reflect that you were n't sure .
They do n't do that over at Kos --- just read what they 've said over there about this site for an ugly taste of defamatory , unsourced , yellow ( as in ' piss on everything ' ) " journalism " .

Kos was or still is in the CIA .
That is a fact .
He 's creepy and fits in nice and cozy on an internet full of fakery and paid trolling .
Anderson Cooper too .
As for Chuck Barris , who knows .

At the SETI conference last week I was surprised to hear NASA ’s Chris McKay suggest we look for dinosaur relics on the moon .
Dinos went suddenly extinct about 65 M years ago , and the dino fossil record seems spotty enough that we could have missed a lineage that went from possum to human sized brains in the ~ 10 M year period it took mammals .
We could also have missed relics of a stone - tool phase that lasted only .2 M years .
But a dino lander left on the moon should stay visible a very long time .
Humans have apparently already dug up a substantial fraction of the richest near - surface Earth metal deposits .
So a dino civilization that went much beyond our metal usage would have left a signature in reduced rich metal deposits .
And since the metal does n’t actually disappear , they would also have left " strange " metal - junkyard deposits .
If modest efforts by geologists could exclude this possibility , that seems well worth the effort .
It would be very big and bad news to hear that metal - using dinos suddenly went extinct just when the other dinos did , and immediately after becoming big metal users .
If so , either dinos destroyed themselves with far more power than we humans can now muster , or powerful aliens exterminated them .
From McKay ’s 1996 paper " Time for intelligence on other planets " :
It is now considered probable that the dinosaurs were not the lumbering clods of urban myth but that they were biochemically and behaviorally as sophisticated as present mammals .
Evidence continues to point to parentling and social behavior that is on a par wit small mammals and birds .
… [ Considero ] the small carnivorous dinosaur Stenonychosaurus , which stood about 120 cm , weighed about 40 kg , and had [ a brain size ratio ] about equal to that of a possum or an octopus , and lived over 12 million years before the end of the dinosaurs . …
One might speculate that perhaps Stenonychosaurus or her progeny did build radio telescopes , but their civilization was destroyed by some internal or external catastrophe .
Perhaps the lifetime of their civilization was so short compared with the resolution of the geological record ( typically millions of years ) that it is simply lost without a trace in the depths of time .
It is difficult to say what evidence would survive of human civilization – if it was terminated now – after 65 million years of tectonic activity , erosion , and sea level change .
It is interesting to note that there is one place where the record of human technology will be preserved for times much longer than 100 million years .
…
The Apollo landing sites on the Moon would bear mute testimony to technological humans .

The Moreno brothers arrived at the building shortly before 10 a.m. , their usual starting time .
They took an elevator to the roof and began preparations for the day ’s work .
Yesterday may have been unusual for the men , investigators said .
New cables connecting the scaffold to the track had been installed  or partially installed , investigators said .
That was one of their open questions .
Major questions about the new cables remained unanswered , officials said .
It was unclear , for example , who had installed them , and when .
It was also not clear whether the installation had been adequately completed , or whether some work had been left to the window washers .
Investigators said there was no question that the brothers had not hooked themselves up to their safety harnesses , but it was not clear whether this was negligence or if the men had not had a chance to do so before the accident occurred .
Image Police officers removed the body of Edgar Moreno , who fell 47 floors .
Alcides Moreno , his brother , was gravely injured .
Credit ... Marko Georgiev for The New York Times
One police official said the cables were adequately hooked up to the scaffold , but that the brothers apparently were trying to secure them solidly to the beam - track .
Somehow , the official said , the cables seem to have come loose from the beam and may have whipsawed as the scaffolding fell , dragging the brothers over the side with it .
It all happened in a moment .
Pedro Nuñez , 32 , who was working on the fifth floor of a building across East 66th Street , was a witness .
“ I was painting , looking out the window , and I saw the scaffolding come down very fast , ” he said .
It was just a blur , he said , the scaffold falling so fast he could not make out the men falling with it , and he then heard a roar that resounded in the neighborhood .
Sometimes , you just want a steak and you do n't want to go through a whole process to get it .
Who wants to light the grill just so you can have one measly steak ?
Why make a whole production out of it ?
What you need , my friend , is a steak toaster .
Advertisement
OK , so it 's not called the steak toaster , it 's called the Ariete SteakHouse Indoor Grill , but that 's pretty much what it is .
It holds your hunk of meat vertically , keeping the heating elements on the side so all the fatty , greasy juices drip down to a tray and do n't smoke .
Sure , for $ 220 you could just fire up the grill , go to a steak house or get a cheap George Foreman grill to get similar results , but then you would n't be able to brag to your friends that you have a steak toaster .

A new study finds that the attractiveness of interviewees can significantly bias outcome in hiring practices , showing a clear distinction between the attractive and average looking interviewees in terms of high and low status job packages offered .
“ When someone is viewed as attractive , they are often assumed to have a number of positive social traits and greater intelligence , ” say Carl Senior and Michael J.R. Butler , authors of the study .
“ This is known as the ‘ halo effect ’ and it has previously been shown to affect the outcome of job interviews . ”
The study explored the influence of the halo effect in a mock job negotiation scenario where male and female interviewers were shown pictures of attractive or average looking male and female job applicants .
Female interviewers were found to allocate attractive looking male interviewees more high status job packages than the average looking men .
Female interviewers also gave more high status job packages to attractive men than to attractive women .
Average looking men also received more low status job packages than average looking women .
Male interviewers did not differ in the number of high or low status job packages that were given to attractive looking interviewees of either sex , though the male interviewers gave out more low status job packages overall , irrespective of the sex of the interviewee .
However , the male interviewers were not entirely without bias .
The electrodermal response ( EDR ) , a psycho- physiological response measured when emotions are used to make a preferential decision , of the interviewers was measured .
When emotions are used to make a preferential decision , it is thought that the anticipatory EDR level increases .
There was a highly significant increase in the anticipatory EDR when the male interviewers assigned the low status job packages to the attractive female candidates .
The fact that this difference only occurred when assigning low status job packages ensures that the effect could not have been driven by interpersonal attraction , but rather by emotion .
Female interviewers did not exhibit any significant EDR differences , suggesting their bias occurs on a cognitive level .
This study is the first application of EDR to examine the influential role of beauty , status and sex during job negotiations .
“ From a business point - of - view , there is a need for leaders / managers to be aware of their assumptions in decision - making processes , be they strategic or operational , and that they may be prone to emotion and bias , ” say the authors .
This study , entitled “ Interviewing strategies in the face of beauty : A psychophysiological investigation into the job negotiation process , ” is published in volume 1118 of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences : The Social Cognitive Neuroscience of Corporate Thinking .
Remember the whole crazy Internet Explorer 8 meta http -equiv hub - bub , yesterday ?
There was one post in all of that mess that was really , really , important .
To sum it up : Internet Explorer 8 will support DOCTYPE switching for new DOCTYPEs ( like HTML5 ) .
“ Steve “ :
Are there any doctypes that do not require this new meta tag to render with the IE8 rendering engine ?
Chris Wilson : @ Steve – sure .
Any unknown ( i.e. not widely deployed ) DOCTYPE .
HTML5 , for example .
This really does change any frustration that someone should have concerning the new meta tag .
This means that you can write your web pages in a completely standards - based way ( CSS , HTML5 , JavaScript ) and not have to use a single browser - centric tag in order to do so .
For those of you who are n’t familiar with the HTML5 DOCTYPE , it looks like this :
<! DOCTYPE html >
You ’ll note that it ’s significantly simpler than most DOCTYPEs that you ’ve seen – and that was intentional .
A lot has changed in HTML5 in an attempt to make it even easier to develop a standards - based web page , and it should really pay off in the end .
What ’s nice about this new DOCTYPE , especially , is that all current browsers ( IE , FF , Opera , Safari ) will look at it and switch the content into standards mode – even though they do n’t implement HTML5 .
This means that you could start writing your web pages using HTML5 today and have them last for a very , very , long time .
If nothing else , this should be a good excuse to look through the changes in HTML5 and familiarize yourself with what ’s in the pipeline for browsers – Internet Explorer included .
I really , really , wish this was made clear yesterday – it would ’ve avoided a whole lot of pain and suffering on the part of the Microsoft Task Force of WaSP and of the Internet Explorer team as a whole .
I ’m really glad that this is happening , though – the future of standards - based web development still looks quite bright .
If you live in Washington or just visit for a few days , you may run into the entitlement people .
Some of them are former senators , cabinet officers or other previously powerful folks .
Others are maverick members of Congress or agency heads , who are not in a position to set policy but are prominent enough to get noticed .
They bombard you with alarming statistics about unsustainable entitlements .
The U.S. government has $ 43 trillion in unfunded liabilities , or $ 350,000 for every taxpayer .
Standard & Poor ’s projects that in 2012 , the U.S. will lose its AAA bond rating .
Everyone listens and puts on a long face to show that they , too , are gravely concerned .
The facts are indisputable , and everybody agrees abstractly that something really must be done .
But then the conversation is over and most people are relieved to slip back into a different reality .
In the different reality , everybody plays by Mardi Gras rules .
The norms are different , masks are worn and certain unpleasant facts fall away .
Presidential candidates vow to offset the cost of health care plans through “ cost savings ” measures , and everybody pretends those savings are actually real .
Republicans promise tax cuts and people pretend those pledges are not absurd .
Democrats vow to pay for their grand spending plans by raising taxes on the rich , even though each one percent increase in the top tax rate only produces $ 6 billion in revenue .
Can we agree that there is something very poisonous and wrong with the state of the union when our finest leaders choose not to seek the highest office in our land , even at a time of danger and crisis , while 70 percent of the nation has lost all confidence in virtually everyone in Washington ?
I met Norman Mailer once .
When I was a very young man I was with a group of people he knew when he strutted into the room and invited his friends to join him for a beverage .
I got swept with the crowd to the bar , too young to legally drink , and too drunk to remember much of what was said .
I do remember one thing .
I paraphrase for lack of clarity due to intoxication , but this is a fair representation of what he said :
The job of the novelist and the journalist is not to kiss the ass of the establishment , or be a simple partisan of the right or left ( though Mailer called himself at various times " a man of the left " or a " left conservative " ) .
The job of the novelist and journalist is to attack , provoke , to get to the heart of the matter , to paint a portrait of what is really happening in a way that gives the reader whole new insights into the complexities and truths of the matter .
One can sweep aside much of the pitter - patter of the cable news and insider blogs as the clash of irrelevance and nonentity , the mere regurgitation of dinner party talk , insider lunches , courtier chatter and politician spin debating in their common out - of - touchness with what is really happening in America .
The low point in our times was how falsehood and lies about pre-war Iraq came to saturate the front page of The New York Times , the editorial page of The Washington Post and the floor of the United States Congress .
The high point was when Stephen Colbert made himself unwelcome at the White House Correspondents dinner , with the legacy that poor Rich Little was invited the next year , to tell sad and inoffensive jokes about Richard Milhous Nixon .
We now have presidential debates that are the idiot 's delight , where some of the most qualified candidates are barely invited to speak , where candidates are given 90 seconds to discuss World War III , where the candidates and voters are insulted with idiot questions such as :
Will you guarantee that Iran will never have nuclear weapons ( a guarantee that can be enforced only by the willingness of the candidate to hypothetically guarantee a thermonuclear attack against Iran , because that is the only way to 100 percent guarantee the undesirable result ) ?
( But these debates are not about the true complexities of the world , they are about 90 seconds of junk food , spoon - fed by consultants , offering bromides to create or alleviate fear , depending on the candidate 's motive , offered by " reporters " who view their job as to elicit headlines or score points with the politicians who feed them questions , or look clever , rather than educate or inform the citizenry about who should lead the free world at a time of crisis and danger . )
In last night 's debate , a campaign that has had virtually zero to say about Pakistan , which may be our greatest security threat ( except for Joe Biden , who often does not receive permission to speak during the debates , and who appears to be running for secretary of State ) , the great contribution of last night 's debate was to elicit
from two candidates , including the Democratic front - runner , that sometimes our great nation must sacrifice human rights to protect our security ( a view that is shameful and false because it misses the heart of the soul of the matter we should be debating ) , which cannot be spoken in 90 seconds of bromides written by consultants uttered in sound bites , which is this :
The heart of what has gone wrong is our disrespect and devaluation of our democratic values , procedures , discourses and debates at home , which have led to gravely unwise disasters and our failure to remember our
highest values abroad , which has led to policies such as torture , most recently enabled by a Democratic Senate , that create enemies and terrorists and loses the battle of ideas , which by far is the most important battle we must win , and are now losing .
Digression : Memo to Joe Biden :
If you really want to run for president and not secretary of State , the next time you are not allowed to speak in a presidential debate because the powers do not believe you are an important enough candidate , and the others are speaking triteness in 30 seconds , walk off the stage in protest and give a press conference outside that speaks truth and substance and depth about what really needs to be said , and is not being said , in what passes for our national debates .
Regarding Al Gore , having been an advocate , supporter , friend , whatever , for a very long time , I reserve the right to say this :
It is a damn shame that he feels he has more important things to do than be president of the United States and leader of the free world with our country engulfed in divisiveness and our world threatened with a planetary emergency that will not be solved by prizes , awards or venture capital funds .
Those who believe in him the most are reduced to being virtual beggars ( a position I will not take , which is why I have simply written him off for 2008 after my best efforts have come to naught ) .
In my view , no candidate was even remotely as right for the times as Gore in 2008 , and no result is more tragic for the times than the fact that he concluded he was above participating in American democracy in the one way that matters the most .
Gore can win the Oscar , the Emmy , the Nobel and win every award except being named the manager of the New York Yankees , and join every venture capital fund and private equity fund and make important documentary films , but the planetary emergency , the crisis of $ 100 oil , the evils and dangers of this , are about
power and powerful forces that create these dangers and corruptions .
Those powerful forces are now laughing and mocking and feeling great relief that one more threat to their power structure , a president who understands the danger and solution the most , has chosen to watch from outside the one arena that truly matters .
How sad and symbolic : for us , for him , for our democracy .
Sen. Chuck Hagel ( R - Neb . ) is a more complicated story because he is trapped in a political party that he could have led to renewed greatness but which treats him as a prophet without honor .
Like Al Gore for the Democrats , being right does not reap the great rewards in our current system , which has created the tragedies we watch every night on the network news .
Chuck Hagel is one of the great senators who walks the floor of that chamber , which is no longer what the Founding Fathers intended , which is not nearly what it used to be , a man of enormous credibility , patriotism and respect from both sides of the aisle , who has an extraordinary reach of admiration from those who opposed the Iraq war the strongest to those who have served our country the most bravely , who view him , correctly , as a great and true champion of active - duty troops and American veterans .
Gore and Hagel may well have greatness in their futures , but what is sad for our democracy is the role they play , and do not play , in our present .
Something about our democratic system pushes our best people out of it ,
depriving our citizens of the best men and women who should lead our country , depriving our world of the best leadership America can provide , depriving our troops of the wisest and most noble commanders in chief , who choose not to compete in the arena to be commander in chief .
We leave the arena to those who hunger for power the most , who raise the most money , who have the most consultants , who utter the trite and insignificant platitudes and bromides in debates that do not equal what our best young men and women can say in their civics classes in school .
Imagine what could have been , with an October debate about the future of America with Al Gore representing the Democrats and Chuck Hagel representing the Repubicans ( or Independents , a subject for another day ) .
In 1960 Norman Mailer wrote one of the great political essays in the history of freedom , titled " Superman Comes To The Supermarket , " which was about John Fitzgerald Kennedy at the time of the 1960 Democratic Convention in Los Angeles .
Mailer wrote about the limits of American politics and the aspirations for greatness that are the precondition for transcending those limits and making America what it can be , what it should be , what it has been before , what it must be again .
Mailer was right about JFK , and right about America , and right about the aspiration for heroism in politics , which is the height of true Americanism and has led us to the highest heights in our nation 's history .
Perhaps one of our candidates will rise to those heights , and then again , perhaps not .
We are leaving a lot to chance , and America deserves far better than what our politics are giving her , and if past is prologue , we are sailing farther into very dangerous waters .

Bisexuality among women is n't just a phase , according to new research that followed 79 non-heterosexual women for a decade and found that bisexual women continue to be attracted to both sexes over time .
Being bisexual is a distinct orientation , not a temporary stage , says the study by Lisa Diamond , an associate professor of psychology and gender studies at the University of Utah .
It is being published next week in the January issue of Developmental Psychology , a journal of the American Psychological Association .
Diamond conducted face - to - face interviews around New York state in 1995 , when the women ( who identified themselves as lesbian , bisexual or unlabeled , but not heterosexual ) were ages 18 - 25 .
She then spoke with them by phone every two years .
" These findings are therefore more consistent with the model of bisexuality as a stable identity than a transitional stage , " the study says .
Diamond suggests that most women " possess the capacity to experience sexual desires for both sexes , under the right circumstances . "
She found that bisexual women were more likely than lesbians to switch between describing themselves as bisexual and unlabeled , rather than to identify as lesbian or heterosexual .
" If it was a phase , it should have burnt out , " Diamond says .
" They might have a change in identity and relationships , but that pattern of non-exclusive desire is still there , even among those who have married .
It debunks the notion of it being a phase . "
Sociologist Paula Rust of East Brunswick , N.J. , has conducted quantitative research on bisexuality and says Diamond 's study is important as the only long - term look at women 's bisexuality to date .
" What she 's doing is an in - depth study of people 's lives , " Rust says of the 79 women who participated .
" For qualitative research , that 's a pretty good number . "
Other limitations noted in the study include a reliance on a small , exclusively female and disproportionately white and middle - class sample .
New attention has focused on young women today and their interest in experimenting with their own sexual identity , which Rust says is because the young are more open about sexuality and are more tolerant .
" I think young women are feeling a little bit freer , " Rust says .
" If they have anything other than purely heterosexual feelings , they are more free to think about it … and question their identity . "
Diamond says heterosexual women may " experiment with same - sex desires and behaviors , but if they really are predominantly heterosexual , they may enjoy experimentation but may not change their sexuality . "
The study also debunks the stereotype that bisexual women are n't able to commit to monogamous relationships because they 're always thinking about desire for the other gender .
Denise Penn , a clinical social worker who serves on the board of the American Institute of Bisexuality , based in San Diego , says there has n't been enough research on these questions : " Women 's sexuality in general has taken a back seat in terms of research overall . "

This article originally appeared in the " Inner Product " column in Game Developer Magazine , January 2006
Last month I described an optimization that needs to be done early on in a project , if it is to be done at all .
This month I expand on the theme of early optimizations , and present a few examples of what I call " Mature Optimization " .
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM
Every year a fresh crop of young programmers enters the games industry with the wisdom of books and lectures swirling around their heads .
One pearl of wisdom is drilled deep into their tender programming muscles ; the pearl sometimes known as " Hoare 's Dictum " :
" Premature optimization is the root of all evil " - C.A.R. Hoare .
Unfortunately , in the mind of the freshly minted programmer entering the games industry , this quote seems to turn into :
" Early optimization is evil " - Junior Game Programmer , 2005
The legendary Donald Knuth most famously weighed in on this subject when he wrote these often quoted ( and often misleadingly punctuated ) sentences :
" We should forget about small efficiencies , say about 97 % of the time .
Premature optimization is the root of all evil " - Knuth , Literate Programming , 1992 , p28 .
Nobody wants to argue with Knuth - it is the equivalent of arguing against the second law of thermodynamics .
However , the problem here is that too often people misunderstand what Knuth was getting at .
Ask a game programmer when optimization should be done , and they will tell you " after the code is written , we can profile it , see where the bottlenecks are , and eliminate them " .
CONVENTIONAL GAME OPTIMIZATION
Often that is exactly what happens .
Towards the end of the project we profile the code , and find that 20 % of our CPU time is taken up by a function like HandleMessageEvent ( ) , so we track down why that 's taking so much time , then we fix it .
Then we tackle our next function on the profiler 's list ; maybe one that takes 10 % of the CPU time .
We fix that , and then tackle a few more .
Our game now runs 30 % faster , and our fattest function takes just 1 % of our CPU time .
However , if after that the code is still too slow , you will now find it is not because of a few weighty functions , but rather a general problem with all of the code .
The code is just generally inefficient .
By ignoring optimization until the end of the project you have ended up with " sick code " that contains multiple inefficiencies too deeply ingrained within the fabric of the code to be removed in a timely manner .
WHAT KNUTH REALLY SAID
When Knuth said , " we should forget about small efficiencies , about 97 % of the time " , he was actually defending something he just did on the previous page , which was to optimize a loop to make it 12 % faster , using " goto " .
Knuth then states my main point here - something contrary to what most programmers initially seem to take from Hoare 's Dictum
" The conventional wisdom shared by many of today 's software engineers calls for ignoring efficiency in the small ; but I believe this is simply an overreaction to the abuses they see being practiced by penny - wise - and - pound - foolish programmers , who ca n't debug or maintain their ' optimized ' programs " ( Knuth , 1992 , p28 )
There you have it .
Conventional wisdom was wrong in 1992 .
Sadly , conventional wisdom continues to be wrong 14 years later .
Programmers , even game programmers , are still starting out with the misconception that optimization is evil , and so they ignore optimization until the end of the project .
MATURE OPTIMIZATION
What is evil here is a very specific type of optimization : " Premature optimization " which is optimization done early in development without a real understanding of if it is necessary , and which may have an overall negative effect on the project .
Given we have an evil type of optimization called " premature optimization " ,
It then follows that there is a contrasting type of optimization that is not evil , which we naturally call " Mature Optimization " .
Mature optimization is any optimization done early in development that you know in advance will provide a significant performance boost without unmanageable side effects .
Mature optimizations are often well - known techniques that were successfully used before .
Mature optimizations include small local modifications , coding standards , and architecture - level design decisions .
GAME OPTIMIZATION
Game programming is complicated , and getting more complicated every year .
I think it 's now more complicated than either Hoare or Knuth really could appreciate .
A game engine is comprised of a large number of systems , each handling a part of the game , and each system is itself often vastly more complex than an entire game of 20 years ago .
Since each system is so complex , and each system only contributes a little to CPU usage , then individual optimizations are not often going to have much effect on overall performance .
To ensure our game runs as fast as possible , we need to optimize our code as it is developed , using every mature optimization available to us .
Developing a game is more and more about developing the content for that game ( rather than developing the code ) .
When developing that content , you cannot really get a good idea of how the game plays unless the code is running at the speed you hope it will run at when you ship the game .
This is especially true of action and sports games , where the " feel " of the game is a vital part of the gameplay , and very important in establishing a difficulty curve .
Thus , it is beneficial to do as much optimization as possible in the early stages of a project .
Most games are real - time applications .
A very large chunk of the code is running thirty ( or hopefully sixty ) times per second .
In developing business applications , a response time of a large fraction of a second for a single transaction is quite acceptable .
In the games industry we need to advance the state of the entire game in just 0.0166 seconds .
It is very rare for a single transaction or operation ( say total collision detection ) to be budgeted for more than one millisecond ( 0.001 seconds ) .
Processing of triangles and other graphics primitives has mostly been off - loaded to the GPU .
The CPU is mostly concerned with iterating over game objects , and doing things with them .
Optimization of games even a few years ago was often heavily weighted towards optimizing the rendering loop .
The balance here has been shifting over the years to the bulk of the CPU time being used by game logic , AI and physics .
The result is that there is less " low hanging fruit " to optimize .
The relatively high power of modern CPUs has also contributed to a shift toward physic calculations taking up more and more of the CPU 's power .
Here again it is important that optimization be completed early , so that the designers can design their game scenarios within well - defined limits as to the complexity of the physics simulations they can use , specifically the number of objects in a scene .
If you leave the optimization until too late , then you are either going to have a scene that runs too slow ( and may require some last minute butchering ) , or a scene that is much lower in complexity than the engine can support , and which looks weak compared to the competition .
Given that overview of the issues relating to optimizing game , I will now give a few representative examples of mature optimizations .
AVOID ALLOCATIONS
Memory allocations are expensive .
If you have some system that is doing a large number of small allocations from the main heap , on a continuous basis , then consider making some kind of custom allocator .
A good example of this is a particle system .
If you know a particle system has a maximum of 1024 particles , then you should use a high - speed pool rather than a heap .
This kind of memory system optimization is well known in game development .
However , it does fall into the category of a mature optimization , since it can be tricky and dangerous to replace one method of memory allocation with another toward the end of a project .
AVOID RTTI
RTTI , or Run Time Type Inspection , is what allows you to use < dynamic_cast > on a base class pointer to see what type of derived class it actually is .
The problem with RTTI is that it is very slow .
It depends on the specific compiler implementation , but on many compilers a < dynamic_cast > is implemented using the strcmp function on the name of the class .
If your profiling shows that strcmp is registering above 0.1 % of CPU time , then suspect RTTI .
Instead of using < dynamic_cast > you should first identify those classes that require some kind of run-time type inspection , consider if you really need it , and then incorporate a type member variable into the base class , with an enum providing the type numbers .
You then do your own RTTI by checking the type variable to verify the type ( if needed ) , and then use < static_cast > to do the actual cast .
The reason avoiding RTTI qualifies as a mature optimization is that it can be almost impossible to apply towards the end of the project .
If a programmer starts implementing a complex system with many usages of RTTI , then it can be a significant undertaking to remove it .
Adding your own optimized version of RTTI is best done early .
AVOID ALIASING PROBLEMS
Aliasing is an insidious problem with compiled code .
Aliasing itself is a straightforward concept - the same piece of memory can be pointed at by two different pointers .
The performance problem occurs when the compiler assumes that the contents of memory can be changed by something other than the current code , and hence will continually re-fetch something from memory when you the programmer know that it 's not going to change .
How you handle aliasing problems depends on your compiler .
You could simply turn off aliasing entirely .
You might be able to use the " __restrict__ " keyword selectively to tell the compiler that a pointer cannot be aliased .
Both of these solutions have the characteristics of a mature optimization , in that they are best done early in the project if they are able to have an effect safely .
It is also a mature optimization in that it often takes a mature programmer to spot it as a problem .
Detecting aliasing as an issue can require that you look at the disassembly to see exactly what instructions are being generated .
AVOID PER - FRAME CODE
Not everything needs to be done 60 times a second .
A huge saver of CPU time is to make certain aspects of the game logic run at a frame rate slower than the screen refresh rate .
Most physics will look quite reasonable running at 30 frames per second .
Some types of logic , such as path - finding , can be spread over a large number of frames .
This is a good example of a mature optimization .
Many games use this form of optimization .
It can be a massive time saver , cutting as much as 20 % to 50 % off your CPU time .
It is something that is very difficult to add late in the project .
The change in timing from running logic synchronized with the rendering frame advance , to logic running independently can introduce all kinds of obscure timing bugs .
AVOID ITERATIONS
Doing any single thing on a modern CPU takes no time at all .
Where we fall over is when we need to do that single thing multiple times .
Whenever you are iterating over some list of things in your game , consider how you might be iterating over fewer things , or not iterating at all .
For example , let us say we want to automatically target enemies that are within range .
The simple way to do this is to iterate over all objects in the game , see which can be targeted , and of those see which are within range .
The problem here is that the list of all object might only contain a few that are actually targetable .
You could optimize this by maintaing a separate list of all the objects that can be targeted .
When targetable objects are created , and destroyed , they are added to , and removed from , this list .
Then when you want to target something , you just iterate over the shorter list .
PROFILE INLINE FUNCTIONS
When profiling your code at a function level , most profilers will not be able to give you any kind of reading for inline functions .
This is because the optimizing compiler will interleave the inline functions instructions with the instructions in the calling function , making it impossible to tell when the inline function is being executed .
While this is expected behavior , it can often hide problems with weighty inline functions that are either too slow , or called too often .
The culprit will often show up as some large higher level function , which calls several inline functions .
To get a clearer picture of exactly what is going on here , you can turn off the expansion of inline functions just for the compilation unit that contains the high level function .
This should reveal the inline functions to the profiler .
Recognize that it is not an entirely accurate picture of what is going on , but it will give you an indication of the balance of CPU usage between the high level function , and the inline functions , and hence indicate on what you need to focus your optimization efforts .
PROCESS OFFLINE
Load times for games need to be short .
Yet too often we get to the end of a project and find the load times are over a minute .
Some advance optimization here can save you a lot of trouble later .
The most obvious optimization is to load your assets all as one big file ( a ZIP , PAK or WAD file ) , rather than a large number of individual files .
This is a very mature optimization - all developers should be using this technique , especially when developing for consoles - and yet it is surprising just how often the problem comes up .
Developers often start off by loading individual files , as at the start of development , there are simply not many files to load , and the load times are bearable .
Towards the end of a project , there is a rapid increase in the number of assets in the game , and load times soar .
Patching a quick load system at this point can be very difficult , especially with limited memory available on a console to act as a buffer .
You will be forced to do some kind of optimization at the end of a project .
Do it early .
Do it maturely .

Ancient Middle Eastern texts suggest that more than 3,300 years ago the Hittites may have sent rams infected with a brutal bacterial infection to their enemies as a form of biological warfare .
According to researcher Siro Trevisanato , the disease Tularemia , also known as rabbit fever , jumps between species via insects .
Form New Scientist :
He believes tularemia is to blame for a deadly epidemic dubbed the " Hittite plague " which raged through the Middle East in the 14th century BC .
Around 1335 BC , letters to the Egyptian king Akhenaten reported a pestilence in Simyra , a Phoenician city near what is now the border between Lebanon and Syria .
The ( letters from 1335 BCE to the Egyptian king Akhenaten ) describe a terrible illness causing disabilities and death .
Most tellingly , they mention that , because of the plague , donkeys were banned from being used in caravans .
According to Trevisanato , this indicates that the people living in the city were hit by tularemia .
The disease can infect donkeys and the insects that they carry , so preventing the use of donkeys for transport may have been an attempt to quell its spread .

No one predicted what has come over Kenya in the last month since its disputed presidential elections .
But since then , the country has fallen from the grace of being one of the most - stable countries on the African Continent to being the host of machete wielding street mobs of young , angry , disenfranchised men .
Tourists and ex-patriots have largely left the country as security and the economy have plunged amid the unrest .
In all likelihood , Orange - Democratic Movement leader , Raila Odinga , won Kenya ’s presidential election against incumbent Mwai Kibaki on December 27th .
Raila , an ethnic Luo , widely led in opinion polls up until the election , accusing Kibaki , a Kikuyu , that he had not done enough to tackle corruption .
Kenya ’s other various minority tribes have long been hungry for a more prominent role in government .
With the slow and non-transparent way the votes were counted in the days following the election , many were convinced fraud had taken place .
I knew something strange had come over the city on December 29th when I took an early morning stroll on the shores of Lake Victoria in the Western city of Kisumu , the hometown of opposition candidate Raila Odinga .
The election results had not yet been released but tension was in the air because the results had been delayed for a second day .
I was followed down a dirt road by two men , when one , bearing a machete , announced somewhat casually that , “ We are going to kill you . ”
It was a little too casually in fact , for he was not convincing enough for me to readily cede my camera .
Nevertheless I began to scream for help as I was hit twice in the arm with his ( luckily dull ) machete and knocked to the ground .
I screamed as loud as I could as the two men tugged on my camera bag while I took a few kicks .
I could not physically let it go .
It was impossible .
I had come to Kenya to work , and work was now my life .
Within a minute , several dockworkers heard my cries from inside the port and came running , sending the thieves to scurry off down some nearby railroad tracks .
I was left only with bruises , scrapes and a small laceration where the machete had hit .
Thanking my helpers profusely , I marched on to my hotel in order to wash up before going to the police station to report the incident .
The police were surprised that this would happen in a normally safe and peaceful town .
However , within the hour the city descended into chaos as a shocked police force stood in passive observance of mobs looting shops and burning the houses of anyone not of the Luo tribe .
The fact that I had just walked away from a machete attack camera in hand may have given me an air of invincibility , but I began to photograph the mayhem as it unfolded on Kisumu ’s streets .
In a tense moment of being surrounded by a crowd , a man named Joseph stepped out and began to mediate between me and the mob , demanding they go about their business and let me do my job .
Joseph stayed with me like a guardian angel for the next several hours as the rioters looted and burned every shop in town and did the same to the houses of rival tribesmen .
Even the livestock were not spared .
Goats and cows were savagely torn apart , their limbs paraded around like trophies .
All the while chanting “ No Raila , no peace ! , ” the rioters seemed indifferent that I was documenting their actions .
This phenomenon was to last only a short while however , and after a few attempts at my camera and a few more close calls with machetes , shooting became impossible .
Joseph and I holed up in my hotel room and prayed for peace to come over the city .
Calm came to the city that night after the Kenyan army marched in , firing tear gas and rubber bullets at anyone left on the streets .
But the quiet was to be only temporary .
On the following evening , the Kenyan Electoral Commission announced the results in Kibaki ’s favor and swore him in within 30 minutes of doing so , prompting new and increased outbreaks of violence .
Unable to get food or water and out of cash , by this time I was waiting at the airport for the next flight to Nairobi .
After waiting 12 hours for the flight , it was canceled due to security concerns .
I was able to make it on a later flight with a different airline that evening .
The riots that had taken place the previous day in Kisumu were no longer just an affair of Western Kenya , where I was , but had now spread throughout the country .
As our plane flew out of town I could see the flames engulfing the streets and buildings below .
The violent aftermath that has engulfed Kenya has not subsided in the past month .
It has begun to take on an eerie resemblance to Rwanda in 1994 , whose genocide occurred under similar post-election tribal strains that descended into civil war .
Mediators including former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , have failed to nip the problem in the bud .
Last evening , Mugabe Were , an Orange - Democratic Movement MP elected on December 27th , was killed outside his home in Nairobi .
Officials have stopped short of calling it an assassination .
Since its independence in 1963 Kenya has been ruled by only three presidents : Kenyatta , Moi and currently Kibaki .
All men have followed the pattern of being ever - reluctant to relinquish their presidential powers .
Despite his failure to implicate corrupt government officials as promised before winning his first term , Kibaki is most remembered for making primary education universal for all children in the country .
After years of peace and functioning democracy , Kenya ’s brutal tribal tensions have come to a rolling boil and are now exposed to the rest of the world .
But before too much sympathy is given to Odinga and his supporters , there is n’t much evidence to show he would have acted any differently as an incumbent .
While most likely the true victor , Odinga and his ODM party is also the likely perpetrator of electoral irregularities according to the New York Times .
Let us also remember that Kibaki , the current incumbent , himself came to power in 2002 as the opposition candidate of change , vowing to rid the country of corruption but keeping many of the crooks from the Moi administration in office .
At the center of the problem is a nasty tribalist mentality that will continue to draw blood and tear apart the country unless ordinary citizens can look past tribe and see one another as united Kenyans .
With thanks to Joseph Otieno .
It was never about winning or losing with Dr. J. Robert Cade .
From our first telephone conversation 41 years ago , it was always about helping others and solving problems , like the dozens of young football players across the country who were dehydrating and having strokes during practices and games .
Concerned about training misinformation , Cade and his researchers at the University of Florida collected the sweat of freshman football players in rubber gloves during practice in the fall of 1965 and found something startling : each one lost 2.5 to 4.2 liters , or as much as 9 pounds , each session .
A year later , as Florida roared through a 9 - 2 season and a victory in the Orange Bowl , the electrolyte solution that some players called Cade ’s Cola became Gatorade , and as much a part of Florida football lore that year as Steve Spurrier ’s Heisman Trophy season .
I wrote the first article on Gatorade , for The Miami Herald , on Nov. 30 , 1966 .
In his typically unaffected fashion , Cade was astonished about the fuss .
One of the greatest challenges neurologists face is successful delivery of drugs to the brain .
This is because a special filtering layer of tissue , called the blood brain barrier , protects the brain and spinal cord .
The barrier acts like a molecular sieve , allowing only properly sized molecules through .
This means that any medication needing to reach the brain ( for example , to kill a brain tumor ) needs to be small enough , and even then , it is difficult to target the drug to specifically reach the brain .
Kumar and his colleagues from Harvard Medical School have developed a potentially revolutionary drug delivery method , taking advantage of a known master infiltrator of the brain : the virus responsible for rabies , also known as the rhabdovirus .
Rabies viruses travel from the site of infection ( a local wound bite ) to the nerves , through which it gains access to the brain .
It is one of the few viruses known to be nearly 100 % deadly to mankind , when vaccination has not been administrated .
Kumar and colleagues took advantage of the virus ’ neurotropic ability by isolating a protein from the viral outer layer used to bind to the brain cells .
They then attached an experimental drug to the purified fragment of protein , a small - interfering RNA .
This RNA - peptide complex showed highly specific ability to access neurons in the brain that expressed receptors to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine .
This high specificity of drug action was demonstrated to only occur in the brain , and not in other tissues of the body .
In this study , the drug was injected into the tail of the mice , targeting the blood vessels .
Using small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) as a drug treatment for many diseases has been powerfully successful in other animal models , but the problem has always been the process of making it a practical drug for clinical application .
Therefore , this new technology developed by Kumar et al sheds light into a new , non-invasive and feasible way to deliver siRNA specifically to the brain .
siRNA is gaining popularity as a preferred drug treatment method since its early conception in the past seven years .
It takes advantage of the cell ’s ability to stop its own protein production as soon as a short RNA sequence corresponding to the protein is detected outside of the cell ’s nucleus .
This triggers a powerful protein synthesis arrest , which can be harnessed to modulate or treat diseases such as diabetes , Hepatitis C , and even transplant rejection .
In 2006 the discoverers of siRNA , Andrew Z. Fire and Craig C. Mello , won the Nobel Prize in Medicine .

Six -- count 'em , six -- major financial firms now declare that the United States is in recession .
That list includes heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , and Morgan Stanley .
Several other financial institutions , while not yet using the " r " word , are nonetheless pessimistic .
The Wall Street Journal quoted a Wachovia report that said , " There is no question that the economic news has taken an unusual and disturbing turn for the worse . "
Of course , the stock market has done nothing to contradict this outlook .
The S&P 500 is already down nearly 8 % year to date .
If the worst is yet to come , you 'd be daft not to sell ... right ?
" An adverse feedback loop "
After all , every part of our economy seems to be spiraling downward together .
Federal Reserve official Janet Yellen called this " an adverse feedback loop -- that is , the slowing economy weakens financial markets , which induces greater caution by lenders , households , and firms , and which feeds back to even more weakness in economic activity and more caution . "
Students of American history will remember that a similar feedback loop prolonged the Great Depression -- and it took a world war to break the cycle .
So if the stock market does tank this year , we 're all going to look back and say we saw it coming .
Why not sell and wait for safer times ?
Not so fast
My Foolish colleague Paul Elliott called this way of thinking " the real threat facing investors today . "
But he advises you to stick it out -- as do I .
Two key points apply :
Recessions do not last long .
Since 1945 , none of the 11 recessions on record lasted more than 16 months -- and none longer than eight months since 1982 .
Stocks do not all go down during recession .
In reality , you can make a lot of money by investing when economic confidence is weak .
Take our last recession ( March 2001 to November 2001 ) , for example .
During that time period , the market had nearly the same number of gainers as decliners ( 2,000 or so on each side ) .
While bellwethers such as ExxonMobil ( NYSE : XOM ) , General Electric ( NYSE : GE ) , and Cisco Systems ( Nasdaq : CSCO ) were down ( 8 % , 16 % , and 17 % , respectively ) , Intel ( Nasdaq : INTC ) , Genentech ( NYSE : DNA ) , and UnitedHealth ( NYSE : UNH ) were all up ( 12 % , 10 % , and 21 % , respectively ) .
The killer stat , though , is this :
Since the 2001 recession began , 826 stocks have tripled .
Eight months of contraction simply cannot stop innovative operators with wide market opportunities such as Apple and Amazon.com ( Nasdaq : AMZN ) .
An aside to all of this optimism
It should be noted that stocks dropped substantially in 2000 leading up to the recession -- just as they 've dropped of late .
Those examples , however , just go to show how the stock market does not move in lockstep with economic realties .
Instead , it 's an imperfect prediction machine with millions of analysts , institutions , and individuals trying to incorporate the information they know into daily trading decisions .
All that dynamism makes the market impossible to time , and if you 're only starting to worry about recession as we may or may not be entering one , you are way late to the game .
To get ahead of the curve , you should start thinking about buying and holding for the long term .
Do n't just take our word for it , though .
There 's also brand - new research from IESE Business School professor Javier Estrada .
Javier who ?
Mr. Estrada 's recent paper " Black Swans and Market Timing : How Not to Generate Alpha " is one of the most persuasive cases I 've read for a disciplined buy - to - hold investment philosophy .
Estrada studied 15 major global stock markets for periods ranging from 31 to 79 years , with the full data encompassing more than 160,000 trading days .
What he found is " less than 0.1 % of the days considered " actually matter to long - term returns , which means that " the odds against successful market timing are staggering . "
So ... do n't try to time the bottom
Now , this is a dangerous article to go on record with .
If the market does tank this year , I 'm going to get plenty of profanity - laced emails telling me that I'm " the real fool now " ( seriously , you 'd think people would be over that joke by now ) .
But even if we lose money this year ( yes , I 'm staying invested myself ) , we 're all going to make a lot more money down the line not by trying in vain to time the market but by adding new money to great companies on a regular basis .
That way , rather than run from the lows , we 'll double - down on them ... and supercharge our returns in the process .

Scientists here have found that mini-molecules called micro-RNA may play a critical role in the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) from its more treatable chronic phase to a life - threatening phase , called blast crisis .
Furthermore , they discovered an entirely new function for these molecules .
The researchers show that microRNAs can sometimes directly control a protein 's function -- not just whether or not the protein is made by the cell , as has been believed .
The study , using cells from CML patients in blast crisis , suggests that certain progenitor white blood cells are kept from maturing when levels of one microRNA , called miR -328 , fall abnormally low .
Immature white cells then build up in the blood and bone marrow , a telltale sign that the patient has entered the therapy - resistant blast - crisis phase .
" If verified , our study suggests that altering microRNA levels might represent a potentially new therapeutic strategy for CML patients who do not benefit from effective targeted agents such as imatinib ( Gleevec ) and dasatinib ( Sprycel ) , " says principal investigator Danilo Perrotti , assistant professor of molecular virology , immunology and medical genetics and a researcher with the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center .
" The findings also reveal a new function for microRNAs , which should further our understanding of their role in cancer development and progression , and in normal cells . "
Researchers have known for some time that microRNAs bind to molecules called messenger RNA , which are part of the cell 's protein - making machinery , and in this way help regulate the types and amount of proteins made by cells .
But this study shows for the first time that the microRNA molecules sometimes bind directly with proteins themselves and affect their function .
In this case , a microRNA called miR-328 binds with a protein that , in blast phase CML , prevents immature blood cells from maturing .
" We believe that miR -328 acts as a decoy molecule that normally ties up the protein , which enables the white blood cells to mature as they should , " Perrotti says .
During progression from chronic - phase to blast - crisis CML , however , the level of miR -328 falls , allowing the protein to be extremely active .
This keeps the progenitor white blood cells from maturing , thus favoring blast - crisis conditions .
" These findings are important because they help us understand the biology of blast - crisis CML , and they may help unravel novel pathways responsible for the initiation and progression of leukemia generally , " Perrotti says .
The findings were presented at the 2007 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology ( ASH ) , Dec. 8 - 11 in Atlanta .
Funding from the National Cancer Institute , the Department of Defense and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society supported this research .
Perrotti is a Scholar of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society .
De Burgh 's hits include A Spaceman Came A Travelling
Authorities in Tehran have approved a plan for the Irish singer to play with Iranian pop group Arian , the group 's manager told Reuters news agency .
De Burgh recently recorded a song , The Words I Love You , with the band .
Western pop songs with lyrics are banned in Iran , although state radio sometimes plays instrumental versions .
Iranians wanting to record an album or stage a concert need to get official permission .
Last month , the government announced a campaign against rap music , which it considers obscene .
But De Burgh , known for soft rock ballads like Don't Pay The Ferryman , seems unlikely to raise the ire of the ministry for culture and Islamic guidance - although he may want to leave Patricia The Stripper off his set list .
Arian 's manager , Mohsen Rajabpour , told Reuters that the ministry for culture had " officially announced that there is no problem with holding a joint performance " .
" We are trying to organise the concerts , scheduled for June and July , " he added , confirming a report carried by Iran 's Fars new agency .
The plan is to hold the concert at a 12,000 - seat stadium complex in Tehran .
De Burgh is expected to visit Iran early next year as a tourist for discussions on the project .

Sure , diamonds are shiny and sparkly , but their beauty may ultimately come from their unique crystal structure , one mathematician says .
Toshikazu Sunada , of Japan 's Meiji University , conducted a mathematical analysis of the crystal structure of diamond and found that it has certain special properties , especially in its symmetry .
In a crystal , atoms are packed in ordered , repeating patterns , with the bonds between them holding them tightly together .
Crystals can be represented in models by points ( representing the atoms ) connected by lines , or edges in particular patterns .
Two main patterns emerge in crystals : the pattern of edges connecting the points ( or of the bonds between atoms ) and the pattern of a network of connected edges and vertices that repeats throughout the crystal .
Diamonds have two key properties that distinguish them from other crystals .
One is called " maximal symmetry " — while other crystals can be deformed in models to make them more symmetric , diamond cannot .
Diamond also has a property similar to circles and spheres , which look the same no matter which way you rotate them .
Similarly , a diamond crystal looks the same when viewed from the direction of any edge .
Sunada discovered that out of an infinite universe of mathematical crystals , only one other shares these two properties with diamond , a theoretical model Sunada calls the " K_4 crystal . "
" The K_4 crystal looks no less beautiful than the diamond crystal , " Sunada said , adding that though it is only theoretical now , it could one day be found in nature or created .
Sunada 's work is detailed in the Jan. 3 issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society .
America 's competition regulator has given the green light to Google 's $ 3.1 bn ( £ 1.6 bn ) takeover of online advertising company DoubleClick in spite of opposition from industry rivals who fear that it will give the search firm unfair dominance .
The Federal Trade Commission said : " After carefully reviewing the evidence , we have concluded that Google 's proposed acquisition of DoubleClick is unlikely to substantially lessen competition . "
The decision was welcomed by Google , though the takeover is far from complete .
It is still being scrutinised by the European commission and an outcome is unlikely before April .
" The FTC 's strong support sends a clear message - this acquisition poses no risk to competition and will benefit consumers , " said Google 's chief executive , Eric Schmidt .
Microsoft is among the takeover 's fiercest critics .
It maintains that Google will be able to use a vast store of search data about customers ' habits to target advertising .
Addressing a senate committee in September , Microsoft 's general counsel , Brad Smith , said : " Google is already Amazon and is already Fed Ex and now they are trying to buy the post office . "
A telecoms analyst , Scott Cleland , backed the view by telling the senators that the deal was the equivalent of merging the top 15 Wall Street investment banks with the New York and London Stock Exchanges , while throwing in data providers such as Bloomberg , Experian and Equifax .
Google has said that competition clearly exists and points to the fact that Viacom this week abandoned DoubleClick and took a $ 500 m advertising deal to Microsoft 's Atlas platform .
A Google spokesman said : " Google has argued all along that the online advertising space is highly competitive . "
GENEVA  The Russian foreign minister , Sergey V. Lavrov , on Tuesday presented a Russian - Chinese draft treaty banning weapons in space to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament , an idea that was quickly rejected by the United States .
Russia and China have pushed for years for a treaty to prevent an arms race in space , a threat underlined by China last year after it shot down one of its own aging satellites .
Responding to previous American assertions that there is no arms race in space and therefore no need for a treaty , Mr. Lavrov instead submitted a draft on “ prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space , the threat or use of force against outer space objects . ”
“ Weapons deployment in space by one state will inevitably result in a chain reaction , ” Mr. Lavrov warned .
“ And this in turn is fraught with a new spiral in the arms race , both in space and on the earth . ”
A Criminal History of the U.S. Dollar : A Q&A on A Nation of Counterfeiters
The dollar has taken serious hits recently , not only continuing to fall against the euro but being caught even by the Canadian loonie .
From the long view , however , the dollar ’s current woes are simply another step in the long and tumultuous history of paper currency in the U.S .
Stephen Mihm , a professor of history at the University of Georgia and author of the new book A Nation of Counterfeiters : Capitalists , Con Men , and the Making of the United States , has researched the rise and development of national currency leading up to the Civil War , as well as the counterfeiters who profited from the lax policing and confusion that accompanied the transition to government - issued money .
He kindly agreed to answer our questions .
Q : How does the U.S. compare with other nations in its quest to create a common paper currency ?
A : Many countries at comparable stages of economic development embraced uniform , exclusive paper currencies earlier than the U.S. Some countries , like Norway and Denmark , completed the process by the 1820s ; others , like Britain and France , made decisive moves towards a paper currency in the 1840s .
The U.S. , by contrast , resisted moves in this direction until the 1860s .
Prior to that time , hundreds and eventually thousands of private banks , each chartered by the individual states , printed their own money ; over 10,000 different kinds of notes floated in circulation by 1860 , in a bewildering variety of denominations and designs .
Everything from three - dollar , four - dollar , and seven - dollar bills were in circulation , and notes depicted everything ( and everyone ) from Greek gods to Santa Claus to obscure politicos .
By contrast , the federal government did n’t print paper money , and did n’t even contribute many coins to the “ hard money ” supply ( most of the coins in circulation came from the mints of foreign governments , especially those of the former Spanish colonies ) .
If you could go back in time and look in the cash register of a corner store , for example , you would find a motley assortment of bills and coins .
Little wonder that by the 1830s , storekeepers were subscribing to things called “ counterfeit detectors ” and “ bank note reporters ” — thick pamphlets that gave descriptions of all the different notes in circulation , along with their presumed valuation and known counterfeits .
People exchanging money would turn to these booklets whenever a bill changed hands , poring over it to identify what , exactly , they were accepting as money .
Q : Prior to the general acceptance of paper money , coins made up the majority of hard currency in the colonies and in Britain .
Why the switch to paper ?
Did this change make counterfeiters ’ jobs significantly easier ?
A : In the colonial era , Americans had a problem : though the country was home to budding capitalists , it had very little in the way of capital , which in that era meant one thing — gold and silver coin .
Thanks to trade imbalances , most coins in the colonies ended up flowing back to Britain .
This loss left entrepreneurs struggling , as it did the colonial governments , which had their own bills to pay .
The solution ?
Have the individual colonial governments issue paper notes that claimed to be “ equal in money , ” meaning equal to coin .
Never mind that there were n’t enough coins in the colonial coffers to back up these bills .
Beginning with Massachusetts in 1690 , the colonists pioneered the first government - issued paper money to appear in the Western world .
The result was a boon to capitalists in need of a means of exchange , but it also marked the beginning of a home - grown counterfeiting industry .
Though many of these early bills were marked “ ‘ Tis Death to Counterfeit , ” convicted counterfeiters generally avoided the gallows , for the simple reason that the demand for money — real or counterfeit — outstripped the supply , and many juries saw counterfeiters as performing a public service .
Convictions were rare , and harsh punishments even rarer .
Q : What were other factors before the Civil War that allowed counterfeiting to flourish in the U.S. ?
A : Counterfeiting continued to be tolerated to a remarkable degree after the founding of the country .
Part of the issue was the fact that most of the paper money in circulation came from private banks , not public governments .
Counterfeiting was thus a crime aimed at a corporation , not the state .
That meant that punishment was even less of a deterrent : a few years in prison , tops .
Given that many of the banks issuing paper money were viewed as “ legal counterfeiters ” by people critical of unsavory banking practices ( subprime lending is just the latest chapter in this country ’s reliance on shaky credit ) , juries were n’t too willing to send someone to prison for imitating the notes of a bank whose own right to issue notes was far from accepted .
All of this together meant a corruption of commercial ethics .
Businessmen had a saying before the Civil War , which more or less went as follows : “ Better a good counterfeit on a solid bank than a genuine note on a shaky bank . ”
What was genuine and what was counterfeit mattered less at this time than whether or not a note could be palmed off on someone else .
Needless to say , this made prosecuting counterfeiters a difficult affair .
It also did n’t help that policing was a corrupt , understaffed , and sorry affair during this time .
Counterfeiters corresponded with one another across state and even national lines ; the cops , by contrast , hardly knew what was going on in their own backyard , much less in a neighboring city or state .
Extradition was almost nonexistent , so when a counterfeiter was arrested , he or she simply posted bail and fled to a more hospitable locale — and began doing business once again .
Q : Did the explosion of counterfeiting in the late 1800s hinder economic growth ?
Why or why not ?
A : Not at all .
If anything , counterfeiting contributed to economic growth , pumping much - needed ( or much - wanted ) credit into the economy , and helping to fuel the era ’s breakneck economic growth .
Such was especially the case in newly - settled regions of the country , where the demand for a medium of exchange was so great that people handling money were willing to overlook the fact that much of the paper in circulation was bogus .
That said , it ’s worth noting that counterfeiters were just the beginning : there were plenty of other dubious entities at this time , all printing money that was n’t , strictly speaking , counterfeit .
A favorite tactic of counterfeiters , for example , was to create a note on a bank that did n’t exist , but sounded plausible : the Metropolitan Bank of New York , for example .
Sounds good , right ?
But it did n’t exist .
Still , they would print off notes and put them into circulation as if the bank was legitimate .
Q : How did the Civil War affect the national currency ?
Did the war have any affect on the practice of counterfeiting ?
What about the public perception of it ?
A : Everyone knows that the Civil War destroyed slavery .
Less well known is the fact that it abolished the system of private currency creation that had served the country since its founding .
When the South seceded from the Union , the North faced a serious funding crisis .
Eventually , Lincoln ’s administration reached for one of the only options available to them : the printing press .
They issued paper money backed by the federal government ( though the notes were n’t redeemable in “ real money ” for several years ) .
These notes were the greenbacks , and for the first time , the nation had a uniform common currency .
In time , economic nationalists passed legislation taxing the old system of private bank notes out of existence .
But the raft of legislation passed during the war gave the old banks an option : they could trade in their state charters for new , federal charters so long as they bought some treasury bonds ( thus helping to pay for the war ) .
In exchange , they got the right to issue notes .
These were n’t like the old notes , where banks got to choose the designs .
Now , the federal government dictated the design ; the only thing that differed in a given denomination of these new “ national bank notes ” was the name of the bank ; everything else was standardized and chosen by the Treasury Department .
All this new money was national in appearance : national heroes like the founding fathers were now in vogue .
This surge of nationalism meant a change in the climate of counterfeiting .
What had formerly been a crime against often disreputable financiers was now a crime against the federal government .
Anyone foolish enough to knock off imitations of the new currency now faced long jail terms and heavy fines .
Would - be counterfeiters also faced a new , national police force that had emerged during the Civil War : the Secret Service .
Long before it was charged with protecting the president , the Secret Service was created to protect the new national currencies .
Founded by a corrupt but cunning former bodyguard , prison warden , and shadowy figure named William Wood , the Secret Service grew into a well - respected , professional police force within a decade of its founding .
And it proved remarkably successful : by the end of the century , counterfeiting ceased to be prevalent in the U.S .
Q : Tell us about some of the unintended consequences of striving for a single national currency .
A : Once the country began moving down the path of a common national currency , people started looking at money differently .
Money became a means of cementing people ’s allegiance to the United States : by handling it , you were tacitly putting faith in the fiscal rectitude of the nation .
At the same time , there ’s a kind of blind trust that affects how we handle the currency in our wallets nowadays .
Our money is so safe ( for the most part ) that we do n’t even inspect it , save for the rare occasion when we get a high - denomination bill .
Unlike people before the Civil War , who often spent several minutes inspecting every bill they received , we do n’t look at our money .
In fact , I suspect that many Americans can’t even remember the bills on which , say , Hamilton , Lincoln , Jackson , Grant , or Franklin appear , much less what shows up on the back of those bills .
We trust our money so much now that we ’re practically blind to it .
Q : How and why did New York become the center of capitalism ?
A : Until the 1830s , it was Chestnut Street , Philadelphia , that was the nation ’s financial center , not Wall Street .
Everything changed during that decade : New York City , which was already booming thanks to the opening of the Erie Canal , was the chief beneficiary of a bizarre but nonetheless cataclysmic political struggle called the Bank War .
Though the federal government did n’t issue paper currency at this time , it had chartered something called the Bank of the United States , which was a forerunner of modern central banks .
Based in Philadelphia , it issued bank notes ; it also regulated all of those smaller state - chartered banks , making sure that they did n’t extent too much credit .
In the 1830s , then - President Andrew Jackson decided to destroy the bank , vetoing attempts to recharter it for another twenty years .
Why he and his political followers did so is something that historians still argue about .
Some of his supporters , though , were New York bankers who had lots to gain if the field was cleared of the Bank of the United States .
They lent crucial support to the veto , and when Jackson triumphed , the nation ’s financial center moved north to Wall Street .
Q : Tell us about the state of counterfeiting today .
How has it evolved ?
Are counterfeiters neck - and - neck with new technology ?
Or have technological advances essentially made it a pointless crime , since perpetrators are sure to be caught ?
A : Counterfeiting fell into near - insignificance until the 1990s , when a new crop of digital technologies — color photocopiers and programs like Photoshop — suddenly made the greenback an easy mark for homegrown forgers .
The Treasury responded by launching a series of new bills which are filled with anti-counterfeiting devices .
These new bills have had the effect of frustrating most counterfeiters , save for more sophisticated rings .
The most infamous of these — if the evidence is to be believed — is the government of North Korea , which until recently was alleged to have been producing high - quality imitations of fifty and hundred dollar bills .
These “ supernotes ” are partly responsible for the recent redesign of the higher - denomination bills .
Still , most counterfeiters are trailing far behind these technological improvements .
While it ’s still a crime worth pursuing in the event a criminal gang can muster the necessary resources , it ’s much more difficult than it was a century and a half ago .
Nonetheless , the spirit of counterfeiting lives on in other forms .
People who once might have pursued counterfeiting now can make their living by identify theft , credit card fraud , or any number of the online con games that grow ever more sophisticated every year .
We may not be a nation of counterfeiters any longer , but the spirit of those earlier criminal entrepreneurs is alive and well .
Nature 's publishers are expanding the licence for reuse of genome papers .
Although Nature and the Nature journals are built on a business model funded by subscribers and other sources of revenue , various initiatives have been implemented to enhance the accessibility of the research papers published in these journals .
They have long been freely available to researchers in the 100 or so poorest countries through the World Health Organization 's Hinari initiative and others like it .
Machine access is being enhanced by the open text - mining initiative of the Nature Publishing Group ( NPG ) ( http://opentextmining.org).
Preprints of original versions of papers can be deposited in arXiv ( http://arxiv.org) and Nature Precedings ( http://precedings.nature.com) without compromising their acceptability for publication .
And final authors ' versions of papers can be deposited in PubMed Central and other public servers from six months after publication .
Authors retain copyright of their work , whereas NPG retains the licence to publish it .
For many years , a more generous arrangement has been made for papers reporting full genome sequences .
( The paper reporting the sequence and analysis of 12 species of Drosophila is the most recent example , see Nature 450 , 203 ; 2007 ) .
These papers are freely accessible on NPG 's website from the moment of publication .
This recognizes a consistent character of ' genome ' papers : they represent the completion of a key and fundamental research resource , describing and reflecting on what has been revealed but not usually providing insights into mechanism .
Although some papers in other disciplines might also be characterized in this way , the fundamental character of the genome has led NPG to make a systematic exception .
In the continuing drive to make papers as accessible as possible , NPG is now introducing a ' creative commons ' licence for the reuse of such genome papers .
The licence ( see http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/license.html) allows non-commercial publishers , however they might be defined , to reuse the pdf and html versions of the paper .
In particular , users are free to copy , distribute , transmit and adapt the contribution , provided this is for non-commercial purposes , subject to the same or similar licence conditions and due attribution .
In 1996 , as human genome sequencing was getting under way , leading players stated : “ It was agreed that all human genomic sequence information , generated by centres funded for large - scale human sequencing , should be freely available and in the public domain in order to encourage research and development and to maximise its benefit to society ” ( see http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/research/bermuda.shtml).
These principles have continued to guide the field , and NPG has consistently made genome papers freely available in keeping with them .
This new licence allows us to formalize the arrangement .

The Financial Times is discussing attitudes in Last year ’s model : stricken US homeowners confound predictions .
When Ray McDaniel , president of Moody ’s , addressed a debate in Davos last week , the mood was so hostile that some speakers joked that he was brave to appear “ without a bodyguard ” .
“ There has been a failure in some of the key assumptions which supported our analysis and modelling , ” Mr McDaniel admits .
“ The information quality deteriorated in a way that was not appreciated by Moody ’s or others . ”
Mortgage borrowers , in other words , did not behave as expected .
When American households have faced hard times in previous decades , they tended to default on unsecured loans such as credit cards and car loans first – and stopped paying their mortgage only as a last resort .
However , in the last couple of years households have become delinquent on their mortgages much faster than trends in the wider economy might suggest .
More­over , consumers have stopped paying mortgages before they halt payments on their credit cards or automotive loans – turning the traditional delinquency pattern on its head .
As a result , mortgage lenders have started to face losses at a much earlier stage than in the past .
In particular , it seems that mathematical models used to predict future default rates , based on past patterns of losses , have gone wrong because they did not adjust to reflect shifts in household behaviour .
Or , to put it another way , financiers have been tripped up because they ignored one of the most basic rules of investment , which is usually found in product literature : the past is not always a guide to the future .
“ There has been a failure in some of the key assumptions which supported our analysis and modelling , ” Mr McDaniel admits .
“ The information quality deteriorated in a way that was not appreciated by Moody ’s or others . ”
Mortgage borrowers , in other words , did not behave as expected .
Nevertheless , one thing is clear : the credit crunch will force many institutions to rethink their reliance on backward - looking models and perhaps put a greater emphasis on behavioural economics .
“ Simply extrapolating from the past into the future is not good enough , ” says one US policymaker .
Or as the beleaguered Mr McDaniel at Moody ’s adds : “ We [ in the ratings industry ] know we have got to retool our processes . ”
Failure at Moody's , Fitch , and S&P
Attitudes Continue To Evolve
Over the weekend we ran across an interesting article in the Financial Times discussing how it is the ratings agencies failed to accurately predict the wave of foreclosures and loan defaults now spreading across the credit spectrum .
The problem lies , as do nearly all financial problems , with the models .
It turns out the mathematical models used by the ratings agencies to predict future default rates simply failed to account for a profound shift in social attitudes .
As Bank of America ( BAC ) CEO Kenneth Lewis noted recently , " There 's been a change in social attitudes toward default . "
People are walking away from their homes but keeping their credit cards and auto loans .
This is not what the models predicted .
Part of the explanation for this is related to the continuing shift in social mood toward debt repudiation and the relative attractiveness of scaled down living .
And some of it is simply a rational response to deflation and negative home equity .
Why fight to save something that is going down in value ?
This , of course , is how a deflationary credit contraction feeds itself .
Financial institutions will be forced to update their models to account for shifting consumer behavior .
The net result : less credit available going forward .
Secular Trends In Consumption And Risk Taking Have Peaked
The ability and willingness of consumers to take on debt has reached a secular peak .
The ability and willingness of businesses to take on debt has reached a secular peak .
The ability and willingness for banks to lend has reached a secular peak .

If Heroin or Cocaine Were Legal , Would You Use Them ?
Zogby Poll Suggests Prohibition Doesn't Reduce Hard Drug Use
" Prohibition is sending hundreds of billions of dollars per year into the global criminal underground .
That money fuels violence and disorder on the streets of our cities , while simultaneously helping to finance international terrorist organizations .
Meanwhile , inflation - adjusted cocaine prices are a fifth of what they were 30 years ago , and any kid who wants to join the Mafia can sign up to deal it in his school .
Addicts are harmed by the prohibition policy worst of all .
It 's time to stop shooting ourselves in the feet , and to control and regulate drugs through legalization . "
Location :
EDITORIAL ADVISORY -- December 5 , 2007 Washington , DC -- Marking the 74th anniversary of the repeal of national Alcohol Prohibition , StoptheDrugWar.org today released polling results suggesting that drug prohibition 's main supporting argument may be simply wrong .
Drug policy reformers point to a wide range of demonstrated social harms created by the drug laws -- crime and violence , spread of infectious diseases , official corruption , easy funding for terrorist groups , to name a few -- while prohibitionists argue that use and addiction would explode if drugs were legalized .
But is the prohibitionist assumption well - founded ?
Zogby polling data released today asked 1,028 likely voters , " If hard drugs such as heroin or cocaine were legalized , would you be likely to use them ? "
Ninety - ninety percent of respondents answered , " No . " Only 0.6 percent said " Yes . "
The remaining 0.4 percent were n't sure .
While some of the " no " respondents may have been overoptimistic about their future self - discipline -- current use rates under prohibition are slightly higher than that -- the survey nevertheless demonstrates that almost all Americans consider the use of certain drugs to be inadvisable , for reasons other than their legal status .
It is therefore unclear that laws are needed to dissuade them from using " hard drugs " or that legalization would result in increased addiction rates .
The social implosion predicted by some drug warriors seems especially unlikely .
The results are similar to usage rates occurring under today 's " drug war , " as measured by the federal government 's National Survey on Drug Use and Health ( formerly the National Household Survey ) .
The 2006 NSDUH found 0.3 percent of the population had used heroin in the past month and 2.4 percent had used cocaine .
Even for cocaine , the numbers are compatible , because Zogby surveyed persons aged 18 years and up , while NSDUH begins with age 12 ; and because of the poll 's statistical margin of error of 3.1 percentage points .
A comparison of drug use rates in countries with criminal penalties for drug use with the drug use rates of countries that have decriminalized personal use also suggests that policy may play only a secondary role in determining use rates .
For example , in the Netherlands , where marijuana is sold openly in the famous " coffee shops , " 12 percent of young adults age 15 - 24 reported using marijuana during 2005 , as compared with 24 percent in neighboring France , where marijuana is an arrestable offense , according to data compiled by the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction .
In the United States , where police make nearly 800,000 marijuana arrests each year , young adults age 18 - 25 in the 2004 - 2005 survey year reported past - year marijuana use at the rate of 27.9 percent David Borden , StoptheDrugWar.org 's executive director , commented when releasing the Zogby data :

— END — prohibition - era beer raid , Washington , DC ( Library of Congress )
There are a lot of different things going on in libertarian reactions to Ron Paul in general and the quotes from the Ron Paul newsletters in particular .
One of them , I think , is a culture clash between different sorts of libertarians , signaled in part by Virginia Postrel 's use of " Cosmopolitan " and other people 's reaction to it , in part by the language used by people on both sides .
Loosely speaking , I think the clash can be described as between people who see non -PC speech as a positive virtue and those who see it as a fault -- or , if you prefer , between people who approve of offending liberal sensibilities ( " liberal " in the modern sense of the term ) and those who share enough of those sensibilities to prefer not to offend them .
The former group see the latter as wimps , the latter see the former as boors .
Let me offer , as a simple example , possible reactions to the following sentence : " According to FBI statistics , more than a third , perhaps more than half , of murderers are black , even though blacks make up only about 13 % of the U.S. population .
" As it happens , the statement is true ; the " perhaps " reflects the number of murderers whose race is unknown .
The question is how different people would react to it .
The answer , I think , is that one group of libertarians would prefer not to state it and , if stating it , would be inclined to qualify their statement in order to make it clear that they were not racially prejudiced .
A different group would state it with mild glee , in order to make it clear that they were not PC , not constrained by what they view as ideological commitments to shade the truth when it contradicts fashionable opinion .
I think this difference shows up in the strength of the condemnations of the newsletter quotes , a strength appropriate in terms of current conventions of what one does or does not say but exaggerated , I think , in terms of the literal content of the quotes .
In that respect it reminds me a little of the flap some years ago over H.L. Mencken 's diary , although that was a more extreme case — labeling an author racist for using currently unacceptable language despite evidence that he was less , not more , racially prejudiced than most of us .
In what sense were the quotes " racist ? "
While I may have missed something , I do not think any of them either asserted innate inferiority of blacks or hatred of blacks qua blacks .
What they did was express a derogatory opinion of particular blacks -- Watts rioters or muggers -- in a gleeful fashion .
They were thus likely both to appeal to racists and to offend liberals — more generally , to offend people who accepted current conventions of acceptable and unacceptable speech .
My guess is that both effects were intentionalI myself have somewhat mixed feelings on issue of being deliberately non-PC .
On the one hand , I find it disturbing that , in our society as it now exists , true statements about certain questions are likely to result in serious negative consequences for those who make them , with the forced resignation of the president of Harvard the most striking recent example .
On the other hand , I think offending other people for the fun of it is both rude and counterproductive .
Which gets me to what I suspect is another difference between the two groups — for simplicity I will label them " wimps " and " boors " — their attitude to those who disagree with them politically .
The wimps , I suspect , have friends they respect who not only are not libertarian but are well to the left on the political spectrum , hence wimps are likely to think of their opponents to the left as reasonable people who are mistaken .
The boors are likely to see opponents to their left as stupid or evil .
On the other hand , the boors are rather more likely to have friends who are conservatives , even kinds of conservatives , such as religious fundamentalists or neo-confederates , whom the wimps disapprove of .
So in that case the pattern may reverse , with the wimps seeing those they disagree with as evil or stupid , the boors seeing them as holding some mistaken views .
No doubt all of this is an oversimplification of a complicated situation , and no doubt exceptions to the pattern I describe could be found in both directions .
But I think it has a good deal of truth to it .
All of which reminds me of an old piece by Murray Rothbard , on crucial questions that divide libertarians , in which he accused me of failure to hate the state .
He was correct .
I do n't view the state as a diabolical plot by evil people to exploit innocent victims , merely as an understandable and unfortunate mistake .
In that regard , at least , I am a wimp , not a boor .
According to two geologists at the University of Oregon , Dr Douglas Kennett and Dr Jon Erlandson , there is reason to believe a large chunk of a comet exploded above or crashed directly into the Laurentide ice sheet , rupturing the ice dams on the easterly margin of Lake Agassiz and causing frigid water to flood into the North Atlantic .
The primary evidence consists of a carbon - rich layer of soil , dating to around 13,000 years ago , found at 50 Clovis - age sites across North America .
The Clovis people , the first wave of human colonists to reach North America from Siberia , had only recently colonised the Americas .
The carbon - rich layer contains microspherules of metal , including iridium , mixed with charcoal particles .
The composition and extent of the layer suggests a massive , continental - scale wildfire .
The Cretaceous - Tertiary boundary layer , deposited by the massive comet or asteroid strike in the Caribbean that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , is similar in composition - the iridium in the layer has an isotope composition that differs from iridium occurring naturally in the Earth 's crust .
The iridium from the sooty Clovis layer has yet to be " typed " to determine whether it is of extraterrestrial origin , but the spectrum of materials in the layer ( and the associated ecological upheaval ) have all the hallmarks of an extraterrestrial impact .
" The highest concentrations of extraterrestrial impact materials occur in the Great Lakes area and spread out from there , " Kennett says .
" It would have had major effects on humans .
Immediate effects would have been in the north and east , producing shockwaves , heat , flooding , wildfires , and a reduction and fragmentation of the human population . "
No crater has been found yet - it may be hidden at the bottom of one of the Great Lakes .
Alternatively , an explosion at high altitude might have shattered the ice sheet without leaving a crater .
According to Kennett , 35 animal genera ( groups of species ) became extinct in North America at the end of the Pleistocene epoch , and 15 of these were clearly wiped out close to 12,900 years ago , at the beginning of a 1500 - year mini-glacial period known as the Younger Dryas .
This mini-ice age was triggered by the Agassiz megaflood , which appears to have shut down the Gulf Stream , the tropical ocean current that circles the North Atlantic , warming the climates of eastern North America and north - western Europe .
The megaflood resulted from the collapse of natural ice dams confining two vast glacial lakes , Lake Agassiz and Lake Ojibway , on the southern margin of the retreating Laurentide ice sheet that covered the northern US and Canada during the last glacial period , which ended around 15,000 years ago .
As the ice melted , the lakes filled - at the time , Lake Agassiz contained more fresh water than all of the world 's modern lakes combined .
The collapse of the ice dams possibly sent frigid fresh water riding over the denser , salty waters of the northerly - flowing Gulf Stream , dramatically reducing evaporation and rainfall , and sending temperatures plunging by five to 10 degrees Celsius across North America and Northern Europe within just a few years .
The impact of the sudden cooling was felt worldwide , and caused the northern hemisphere ice sheets to advance southwards again .
In his book , First Farmers , Australian National University archaeologist Professor Peter Bellwood argues that this mini-glacial period , the Younger Dryas , was the catalyst for the development of the first permanent farming communities in the Middle East in an arc stretching from modern Israel and Jordan through Syria and Iraq , to southern Anatolia in Turkey .
Bellwood 's book draws together archaeological and environmental evidence indicating that the sudden return of cold , dry conditions to the Middle East during the Younger Dryas confronted the pre-agricultural Natufian culture with a momentous decision .
The Natufians , descendants of ice age hunter - gatherers , had begun to harvest the wild ancestors of rye , barley and , later , wheat , which flourished in the region as the climate became warmer and wetter after the last glacial period , between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago .
The warming oceans were releasing large amounts of dissolved carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , accelerating plant photosynthesis and causing the ancestors of modern cereals to produce much larger grain .
Bellwood estimates that human numbers in the region expanded about six - fold during this time , and the Natufians established small settlements of rounded , mud - brick huts in areas where cereals were most abundant .
They fashioned stone sickles to harvest grain and cut reeds to thatch their huts .
Bellwood says modern geneticists have estimated that intense selection pressure for large - grained varieties of crops that retained their seeds in the head late into the season could have shaped semi-domesticated versions in as few as 30 seasons .
Bellwood believes that when the Younger Dryas plunged the Middle East back into the cold , dry conditions of the most recent glacial period , the Natufians had to choose between abandoning their settlements and reverting to the harsh , nomadic life of hunter - gatherers , or staying put and becoming full - time farmers .
The sharply reduced productivity of wild food plants , dwindling numbers of game animals and the Natufians ' own burgeoning numbers left them with only one realistic choice : they went farming .
First Farmers records that the Natufians abandoned many of their pre-agricultural settlements in drier areas and retreated to sites with permanent water where they began cultivating primitive varieties of familiar crops such as rye , barley , wheat and lentils .
Bellwood says the Natufians also began to domesticate the wild ancestors of cattle , sheep , goats and pigs , which were native to the region and congregated in herds or flocks , making them easy to domesticate and manage , providing a permanent source of meat and milk .
According to Bellwood 's book , by around 8400 years ago , large , complex settlements such as the ancient , walled city of Jericho , with several thousand inhabitants and diverse , specialised labour forces , had developed at permanently watered sites .
Meanwhile , as the Earth warmed , the Mediterranean Sea , reduced to a huge hypersaline lake when low global sea levels cut it off from the Atlantic during the Younger Dryas , slowly refilled and around 8200 years ago swamped over a silt dam that had plugged the Bosphorus Strait between Europe and Asia .
The overflow became a raging torrent that , within a few days , cut a deep channel through silt plugging the strait .
With the weight of the newly filled Mediterranean behind it , the water cascaded 150 metres into the Black Sea .
The massive waterfall , estimated at 300 times the volume of Niagara Falls , would have created a deafening roar that could have been heard 500 kilometres away .
Submarine imaging surveys have revealed the geometric outlines of ancient settlements on the margins of the former lake shore that drowned as the lake 's rapidly rising waters advanced several kilometres a day across its gently sloping shores .
Historians suspect the Black Sea flood 8200 years ago was the source of the biblical tale of Noah's Ark .

The White House certainly has been guilty of mismanagement and lack of preparation on the big things , like the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina .
But it turns out that President Bush ’s encounters with ordinary Americans have been micromanaged and laboriously controlled for the past five years to weed out the merest whiff of protest .
Citizen volunteers are enlisted to vet cranky - looking sorts outside the event , and “ rally squads ” of zealots are prompted to pounce on anyone who manages to slip through with an outspoken thought or an unscripted word .
“ Do not fall into their trap ! ” warns the presidential manual in hypothesizing that protesters really want to be physically restrained and attract media notice , not merely exercise their right to complain .
Instead , the roaming squads ’ task is to use their own “ signs and banners as shields between the demonstrators and the main press platform . ”
Noisy protest ?
The rally squads ’ response must be immediate choruses of “ USA ! USA ! ” to muffle the moment with patriotic chaff .
These vigilante squads are out of place in a democracy .
The chamois - tight precautions of the White House ’s presidential visit manual surfaced in The Washington Post because of a First Amendment lawsuit involving two people who refused to cover up the message of their T - shirts at a Fourth of July presidential event .
“ Regime change begins at home , ” was the familiar shirt message of one protestor who was handcuffed and taken to jail .

Minnesota ’s 5th District member of Congress talks about his support for impeaching Vice President Dick Cheney .
First , competing box - set releases .
Now , a mysterious yanked advert .
The behind - the - scenes feud between the label and its former charges is bubbling to the surface
Tension between Radiohead and EMI was highlighted again today when the band 's former label removed a misleading ad for the group 's back catalogue from the internet .
Until the end of last week , anyone typing in Radiohead into Google would be met with a paid - for ad at the top of the search results reading : " Radiohead - New Album ' Rainbow ' now available as boxset " .
Despite appearances , the ad led not to the special " discbox " edition of In Rainbows but to a website where EMI subsidiary Parlophone is selling a box - set of the seven albums Radiohead recorded while they were still signed to the label .
That the two box - sets are coming out at the same time in December and at the same price had already led some fans to believe that EMI is trying to compete with its former charges ' independent release .
While EMI has denied this , the ad ( visible in a screengrab from Friday , above ) raises new questions about the label 's motives .
Attempts to ascertain the identity of the company behind the ad by Guardian Unlimited Music met with little success .
Phone calls and emails to EMI 's subsidiary Parlophone about the ad were not returned last week .
Finally , a cryptic , one - sentence email arrived from EMI publicist Chris Latham yesterday .
" Parlophone were aware of the data source glitch and removed the link immediately , " it read .
When asked to confirm that this meant that the label had indeed placed the Google Ad and then removed it , the company spokesman twice declined any further comment or clarification .
This afternoon , Radiohead responded to Parlophone 's removal of the ad .
" We accept that it was a genuine error and that it has been rectified , " the band 's spokesman wrote in an email to Guardian Unlimited Music .
This may draw a line under what seemed like an escalation of a behind - the - scenes feud between EMI and Radiohead .
Relations between the two have been frosty since the band , who fulfilled their contract with the label with 2003 's Hail to the Thief , decided to not to resign with them .
Days after the band decided to release the CD of their new album In Rainbows with independent label XL last month , EMI announced it was offering the rockers ' output from 1993 to 2003 for sale as a seven - CD box - set .
It soon became clear that the back catalogue release was put together without the involvement of the band , who have distanced themselves from it .
( " The band have n't released it , " band spokesman Murray Chalmers said .
" The band are n't in contract to EMI anymore . " )
The EMI box - set will be sent out at the same time as In Rainbows " discbox " box - set in December and at the same price , too .
While fans have accused EMI of releasing its Radiohead box - set as " retribution " for the band going elsewhere , the label has denied this .
Just to be clear : I 'm not advocating that steriods be legalized .
In fact , I think that 's probably a terrible idea .
I 'm simply puzzled .
The professional sports establishment is in the midst of a major witchhunt against alleged users of performance enhancing drugs .
But no one -- so far as I can tell -- has articulated a coherent explanation for what should be banned and why .
" James , " one of the commenters on the " Free Fernando Vina " post brought up the issue of Lasik eye surgery .
That 's a very good example .
It is perfectly legal for an athlete to undergo " performance enhancing " eye surgery , that moves him from , say , the 50th to the 95th percentile in sight .
It is not legal for that same athlete to take " performance enhancing " hormones that move his testosterone from the 50th to the 95th percentile -- even thought the additional advantage of the eye surgery may be greater than the additional advantage conferred by the exogenous testosterone .
Now , there may be a perfectly valid distinction between those two interventions .
But what is it ?
Should n't it be spelled out before we drum Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds out of the Hall of Fame ?
Similarly , it is perfectly legal for an athlete to get painkillers after an injury , so he can continue playing ( and , I would point out , risk further injury . )
It is not legal for that athlete to take Human Growth Hormone , in order to speed his recovery from that same injury .
Again , why ?
What is the distinction ?
Why is it okay to play hurt but not okay to try and not play hurt ?
There may be a perfectly valid reason here as well .
But do n't we need to spell out what it is ?
I realize that the people running major league baseball and the NFL are not philosophers .
But the intellectual sloppiness with which this current crusade has been conducted is appalling .

ALMOST half the youngsters treated at Alder Hey hospital suffer from ailments caused by their parents ’ smoking habits .
A top doctor today accused adults of ruining their children ’s health and development by lighting up around them .
Ear , nose and throat specialist Alison Flynn said “ irresponsible parents ” were also stunting their children ’s development in language and education .
Last year , she saw more than 1,000 children with conditions caused by passive smoking , such as asthma , glue ear , bronchitis , pneumonia and infections caused by weakened immune systems .
It meant more youngsters affected by second - hand smoke were treated at the West Derby hospital than ever before .
More than 550 operations alone were carried out to insert grommets for ear infections caused by secondary smoke .
Experts also warned that evidence found at least 90 % of cot deaths happened in families where the mother smoked .
Mrs Flynn today said she and other hospital staff were fed up with “ brazen ” parents continuing to smoke on site , close to wards where critically - ill children are cared for .
She said : “ Some of these parents have no shame and will just not take responsibility for the effect they have on their children ’s health .
“ In one case , I treated a child for more than a year for glue ear , an inflammation of the middle ear .
“ It is an acute infection and I kept telling the patient ’s father that his smoking was causing the problem .
“ He did not stop smoking until he felt his own ears becoming bunged up .
Within months of him stopping smoking , all his child ’s health problems had cleared up . ”
Mrs Flynn said some parents tried to protect their child by smoking outside , but did not realise they continued to breathe out carbon monoxide for hours after a cigarette , often directly over their children .
She added : “ You would think parents ’ awareness would get better and better .
But it is getting worse here in Liverpool .
“ Children are vulnerable because they are still developing and growing .
They breathe at a quicker rate , meaning the damage caused by second - hand smoke is far greater than that in an adult .
“ These parents are seriously affecting their child ’s development .
“ Children with glue ear or grommets withdraw into their own silent world , fall behind in class and do not reach their education milestones .
We are at our wit ’s end with the problems caused by smoking at Alder Hey .
“ These children are vulnerable and it is time parents considered their children first . ”

Riechers received $ 26,788 from a private contractor , Commonwealth Research , while he awaited his government appointment .
The Air Force says that he was " employed in a scientific and engineering technical assistance capacity to the Air Force and made recommendations that were instrumental in engineering our acquisition transformation and continuing the Air Force ’s modernization of our aging fleet . "
An amazing job description , considering that Reichers ' only interaction with the company , other than cashing their checks , was at a Christmas party :
Riechers said in an interview that his interactions with Commonwealth Research were limited largely to a Christmas party , where he said he met company officials for the first time .
" I really did n't do anything for CRI , " said Riechers , now principal deputy assistant secretary for acquisition .
" I got a paycheck from them . " ...
" We needed some way to kind of gap me , " Riechers said about the temporary job .
The Air Force defended the arrangement , saying Riechers was well qualified to perform the work .
Of course , anybody with a pulse is qualified for a job that consists of driving to the bank and cashing 5 - figure checks .
So let 's see : a man waiting for a high ranking position responsible for administering defense procurement contracts , takes free money from a defense contractor .
Exactly how is this different from a bribe ?
And now , the guy who took the bribe , a guy who ought to be tanned , well rested , and feeling good from his free vacation bought and paid for by a defense contractor , is found dead in his home of an apparent suicide .
Usually when I come back from a 2 month paid vacation , I 'm not feeling suicidal .
Oh wait ...
I 've never had a two month paid vacation from a company I never did any work for .
And who is Commonwealth Research , the contractor with free money to give away ?
For one thing , it is set up as a charity , so it does n't pay a dime in tax .
I 'm not sure if a subsidiary of a earmark incubator pursuing defense contracts and paying its executives hundreds of thousands of dollars squares with your conception of what a " charity " is ; I can assure you that it does not square with mine .
Also , it 's a subsidiary of Concurrent Technologies , an " earmark incubator " , a company which was created out of an earmark , gets its revenue from earmarks , and spends hundreds of thousands in lobbying fees to get earmarks .
It is headquartered in Johnstown , Pennsylvania -- Jack Murtha 's district , and Murtha 's history of arranging earmarks for Concurrent Technologies is well - documented , as are Cocurrent 's contributions back to Murtha 's campaigns .
Murtha's $ 10 million in earmarks to Concurrent Technologies were challenged by earmark hawk Rep. Jeff Flake on the House floor during debate over the FY2008 Defense Appropriations Bill , and you can read Murtha 's dissembling " defense " of earmarks to Concurrent Technologies in the Congressional Record .
I actually watched that debate and recall having been embarrassed for Murtha ; I even commented on it at the time .
Murtha -- and it hurts me to say this , because I 've appreciated his stand on the war -- ought to be immediately suspended from his chairmanship of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee while this is being investigated .
His dealings with these earmark incubators represents everything that is wrong with the appropriations process .
Republican or Democrat , lawmakers need to understand that the Treasury is not their own personal piggybank which they can use to dole out lucrative favors to their campaign - contributing friends .
Democratic leadership has a long way to go to prove to me that we were n't just sold a bill of goods on earmark reform , because Murtha 's earmarks to Concurrent Technologies do not seem to fit in at all with the earmark reform that we were promised by our Democratic Congress .
Oh -- one more thing that caught my eye : Riechers ' predecessor in the Air Force procurement office , Darleen Druyun , got prison time for steering billions in defense contracts to Boeing while she was actively negotiating for a job with Boeing .
So that ought to let you know that Riechers ' new position was very important to defense contractors .
UPDATE : blonde moment , in the comments , noted that a new Washington Post article has another Boeing angle , one that ties in with Concurrent Technologies :

There is some fuzz about our tracker in the recent days .
Some people claim that the Chaos Computer Club started a tracker which , in their terms , is the successor of denis.stalker.h3q.com .
And they all got it so wrong .
First of all , the Chaos Computer Club is running their own BitTorrent trackers for a really long time .
Sometimes they call it torrent.ccc.de , sometimes bittorrent.ccc.de .
They use them to distribute their congress recordings , the recordings of their Radioshows or Podcasts and maybe even for some Open Source stuff .
Why they created to many ?
Because its so easy with opentracker !
Now they created another one which is called tracker .ccc.de and somehow someone jumped to conclusion that this is the real deal and the official successor of denis.stalker.h3q.com !
Well its not .
Second of all , denis.stalker.h3q.com started as our tracker to develop the opentracker software , it was n’t intended to become one of the largest trackers in the world .
But it did and both the tracker and the software became a huge success , also because we could test the software with a huge amount of hashes and peers !
Some people got in really bad trouble for that , even if they did n’t have to do anything with this .
Partly because of that , but also because we do n’t have the resources and time to operate one of the largest trackers in the world anymore , denis.stalker.h3q.com is dead .
If you liked denis . stalker and want it back , feel free to register your own domain and / or create a denis.stalker.your.domain record in your domain and point it to tracker.openbittorrent.com !
Nevertheless , we like the fact that the CCC is using opentracker as their tracker software of choice and if you have any CC - licenced or open source stuff , feel free to use their tracker !

The beerware license – most famously used by Poul - Henning Kamp – originally was less about beer and more about politics .
It basically meant surrendering copyrights on your software to “ the kids ” , helping them to understand , learn and pirate good parts of your source ( in order not to reinvent it badly ) .
In exchange , if you were one of those kids and felt like some piece of software really inspired you , or if you could save some time and work by using this software , the license encourages you to grab the developer in question , invite h** for a beer or two and talk .
Give feedback , discuss ideas , point out rooms for improvement and reiterate the fact that the software actually is in good use .
IOW : flatter the developer by dedicating a short amount of your time .
While the beerware license was better known in the BSD scene only , the opentracker project can claim to have introduced it to the pirate scene .
There the basic concept shifted away from dedicating the user ’s time to dedicating a certain amount of beer to show appreciation .
Although we were not exactly sad about this development , it led to incidents where people sent us beer from overseas without ever intending to drink that beer with us .
Now – beer from the U.S. is an experience from the beginning and wo n’t turn out better once it arrived in europe (:
So , until now there was no appropriate way to show your support remotely .
Wiring money to pay for a beer means to waste a crate worth of beer just for the fees .
With the advent of the flattr service there is now hope on the horizon to be part of a crowd that shows up at a party with a keg of beer .
That does n’t mean that you should not try to engage in giving verbal feedback whenever possible , but it means that you can now actually fill up your favourite bittorrent tracker team from your couch .
Depending on the amount of money that accumulates on the opentracker flattr - thing , we will engage in a variety of drinking games ranging from silently getting a booze sharing one very cheap bottle of Sternburg er to throwing a barbecue party with several kegs of our favourite bavarian brew .
There will – of course – be video documentation of how we bring your flattrs to good use .
Find opentracker as a flattr thing here .

We are proud to announce that the Norwegian State TV Launches its own BitTorrent Tracker and they are using the opentracker software !
Maybe we will get a barrel of norwegian beer some day ?
Seems like the Norwegian State TV has understood what their viewers want , to quote Torrentfreak : “ NRK understands that the traditional distribution methods are changing , and that their viewers want to consume television shows wherever and whenever they want .
The way people consume music and video has changed , and NRK does n’t want to fall behind . ”
Hurray for Norwegian State TV !

The opentracker team wants to thank Berlin ’s pirate party ( Piratenpartei Berlin ) for their encouragement in the development of opentracker which they showed in form of a 50 Liter barrel of delicious bavarian beer .
With the heroic and sacrificially help of many Congress Angels we finally managed to spend all the beer and have – to our best knowledge – not introduced any bugs due to the consumption .
So hohoho to the pirates and a happy 2009 to everyone .

For those wondering what all the silence in this blog means .
Yes , we ’re still alive and kicking .
Currently discussing all our proposals with client developers , which is consuming more time and energy as we thought it would .
You can usually find us at IRC channel #transmission on freenode and join discussions .
We ’re also preparing to introduce some real crypto into our udp protocol and trying to enforce good behaviour towards trackers .
Also opentracker has been heavily refactored and will enjoy some more changes towards multi threading capabilities due in january 2009 .
So stay tuned .
And to all opentracker users : a happy 2009 !

In our last post we made the advise to use some sort of auto - UDP because it would also help to lower the trackertraffic for EVERY torrent even if they have an HTTP announce URL .
We can now ( a little late , but not without a little pride … ) announce that Azureus has support for auto - UDP since version 3.0.5.0 ( they revised it a little in 3.0.5.2 ) .
So it seems to work and we would like to suggest others to follow their steps .
Every big tracker admin loves that and will be grateful .

Keegan was in the stands to see his new side beat Cup opponents Stoke
Keegan , 56 , managed the Magpies from 1992 to 1997 and returns to St James ' Park as Sam Allardyce 's successor .
Gerard Houllier and Didier Deschamps were linked with the job in the last two days but the club turned to Keegan .
The former England , Manchester City and Fulham manager said : " It 's nice to be home .
I 'm delighted to be back . "
Magpies chairman Chris Mort added : " We did n't think we'd be able to get Kevin back to the club but he 's the right man and we 're absolutely delighted . "
Former Bolton boss Allardyce left Newcastle by " mutual consent " two weeks ago after just eight months in charge .
606 : DEBATE Keegan is the man , this is a great chance for him to finish what he started 15 years ago
SJ88
His departure followed a string of poor results and with the club languishing in 11th place in the Premier League table .
With Allardyce gone , there was daily speculation about his possible replacement , with Harry Redknapp quickly emerging as the favourite to take over .
The Portsmouth chief eventually turned down the chance to move to St James ' Park , leading to rumours that former Liverpool boss Houllier , ex-Juventus coach Deschamps and Blackburn boss Mark Hughes could all be tempted instead .
Magpies legend Alan Shearer was also thought to be in the frame , although the former England striker finally revealed on Wednesday he had been told by the club that he lacked experience to be their next manager .
In the end , Newcastle owner Mike Ashley plumped for Keegan , a man regarded with reverence on Tyneside .
It 's a great soap opera .
Locally they will be in raptures but outside it there may well be bewilderment
Mike Ingham
BBC Radio 5
Live football correspondent
Keegan was running his " Soccer Circus " football academy in Glasgow , quit his last job as a manager at Manchester City in March 2005 .
He also walked away from Newcastle in 1997 and left the England job suddenly after losing to Germany in October 2000 .
Since Keegan left 11 years ago , six permanent managers have come and gone at St James ' Park , while it has been 39 years since the club claimed a major trophy .
Keegan had been linked with a return to the club last summer as director of football following Ashley 's takeover .
However , Keegan told BBC Sport in October that he was unlikely to manage a team again .
He said : " I do n't think it will happen .
I think my life has gone in a different direction . "
But as speculation increased that he might be tempted back , he said on Monday : " I 'm not ruling myself out or in .
It 's a club I love , everyone knows that . "
BBC Radio 5
Live 's football correspondent Mike Ingham says Keegan can rejuvenate the club he played for with such distinction from 1982 - 84 .
He said : " Keegan 's memory has haunted all his successors , he galvanised them as a player and as a manager .
" It 's a great soap opera .
Locally they will be in raptures but outside it there may well be bewilderment . "
Keegan took Newcastle back into the top flight in 1993 and came close to winning the league title in 1996 .
They led Manchester United by 12 points before finishing as runners up .
Newcastle fans celebrate Keegan 's return during the replay with Stoke
Keegan went on to manage Fulham , England and Manchester City , whom he left in 2005 .
Now he is back at Newcastle , much to delight of the majority of the club 's fans .
A sign of how highly regarded Keegan is on Tyneside was reflected in a statement on the Newcastle website : " Geordie messiah to be unveiled as new United manager . "
Shearer , who is being tipped to become part of Keegan 's coaching team at Newcastle , is a also big fan of Keegan's .
" He is highly thought of in Newcastle and rightly so because of what he did for the club , " said Shearer , who was signed by Keegan for £ 15 m in 1996 .
" Kevin did something special , he 's a special person with special charisma . "
Newcastle defeated Stoke 4 - 1 in an FA Cup replay on Wednesday and afterwards caretaker manager Nigel Pearson said he did not know whether he would remain at the club .
" I could not tell you what will happen , " Pearson told BBC Sport .
" I am unclear on the situation . "
Of the task facing Keegan , he said : " It wo n't be easy , we have not got a huge squad . "
I wanted to blog something about Cuba last week , but frankly , I was too stunned .
" Castro - supporting leftist " is one of those stereotypes that I doubted could be found in the wild any more -- until Castro stepped down and the Castro apologists crawled out from under their rocks .
" Okay , dictatorship bad , but -- universal health care !
And he really stood up to Uncle Sam , which is , like , totally awesome ! "
Leave aside the extreme dubiousness of the proposition that Castro has , in fact , made his countrymen better off .
This is like listening to those conservatives one occasionally encounters in the darker corners of the movement who drop gems such as " Well , I do n't excuse Pinochet , but Chile would n't have a privatized social security system without him . "
I 've never managed a snappy comeback to this because my jaw is always too firmly glued to the floor .
Chile 's Social Security system is really pretty great .
But it 's not so fantastic that it 's worth purchasing via a reign of terror .
Neither is universal health care -- particularly when the free clinics are short of medicine and equipment , making them worth about what you pay for their services .
Even more bizarre were arguments along the lines of " Well , Cuba only has about a hundred political prisoners . . . " Only ?
That 's a lot of prisoners of conscience for a small island nation .
Moreover , it fundamentally misunderstands the problem with dictatorship .
The Cuban government does n't need to use force to punish any but the most glaring and vocal dissenters , because it has widespread powers of economic coercion .
As a Russian co-worker once told me , " Americans have a silly idea about communism .
It was n't that if you told a joke about Brezhnev , the secret police would arrest you -- it was that you 'd lose your job .
And in Russia , there were no other jobs . "
When the government controls your paycheck , your housing , and your ration card , it does n't need to put you in jail ; you are in jail .
I arrived at Sydney airport at 6 am , three and a half hours before the A380's scheduled departure time for Singapore .
But the check - in queue was already about 75 m long .
Perhaps we 'd all had the same idea of " getting here early " .
But despite the initial dread , queues moved quickly , with a larger number of check - in desks in operation than normal .
The ground staff were clearly accustomed by now to the maximum of 471 passengers they must shift through the terminal every morning and they knew today 's plane was almost full .
At the gate I was confused where all these passengers were .
But then I realised that we were only boarding part of the plane .
To make boarding quick and easy , three gates are used for the A380 : one for premium - paying passengers in business class and the suites ; one for economy main ( lower ) deck ; and one for economy upper deck .
On the main deck we boarded in no time .
But - a tip - upper deck economy passengers are likely to board even quicker , because half the deck is business class .
As we shuffled through the economy cabins , I noticed that this was the first plane I 'd ever been on where each economy cabin had its own colour scheme .
One was beige and blues , one was green and creams , and ours was creams and dusty pinks .
And rather than the normal garish white beams , our lighting looked slightly pinker , slightly warmer .
The windows are also 10 per cent larger than those on other jumbo jets .
The reports of slightly greater leg room and wider aisle space also rang true .
A few extra millimeters across eight hours can make all the difference .
And because this plane is designed to fly the " kangaroo route " from Australia to London , via Singapore , any extra space is a bonus .
Do n't get too excited though .
Cramps and fidgets still await you on the A380 and there are still continents between the A380's economy and its business and first classes , which sadly we were n't allowed access to .
The roll along the runway seemed to last longer than normal and I began to wonder how long it would take to get this beast off the ground .
But as soon as we took off , it was clear that the A380 is a cut above in terms of engineering .
We glided into the air with virtually no noise and with a distinct smoothness that I have never experienced on a plane .
Solong to thunderous engine roar .
The smoothness and relative quiet lasted the length of the flight , apart from one shocking heave somewhere just north of Australia .
But then no aircraft is immune to a few bumps here and there .
It is the Krisworld entertainment system though that makes the A380 a standout .
At long last economy can enjoy the same system as business and first class , with 100 movies , 181 TV shows , 700 cds and 22 radio channels on demand .
SIA has also become the first airline to offer 3D games .
And there are multiplayer games for you to play against fellow passengers , no matter where they are sitting .
The only difference in the entertainment system between the classes is the size of the screen .
But most passengers wo n't have a gripe with the economy class screen , which is as big as the business class screen on many airlines .
But this system is about more than just entertainment .
There is an inbuilt PC which allows you to create documents , presentations and even view digital photography , and then save it all back on to your USB flash drive .
You can also swat up on your destination thanks to access to world and regional news , Rough Guide information on 25 world cities and Berlitz learning applications for 23 different languages .
And the hi-resolution satellite imagery means flight information is more on a par with Google Earth than what I have seen on planes in the past .
Then there are the A380's small touches .
I found myself getting excited by the taps in the toilets , which can be digitally programmed depending on how warm you would like the water .
The water also runs for a few seconds on its own before turning itself off , which happily puts a stop to the awkward tap - holding - while - washing - face - with - one - hand routine that used to plague me on other long - haul flights .
The food and service was the standard you would normally expect on a SIA flight ( I had a lovely medium - rare steak ) .
Lunch did take longer than normal to arrive , but I think that was more the unfortunate position of my seat than the number of passengers .
And once in Singapore 's Changi Airport , I had no lost baggage to report .
In this age of frequent flying , it is about time economy class passengers were able to travel in greater comfort and style than planes have allowed until now .
And habitual business class passengers may even be tempted to save some bucks .
If you can coincide your departure time with an A380 flight , I would more than recommend it .
IF YOU GO :
In the 2008 two more A380s will be delivered to allow SIA to launch its Sydney - London service .
SIA is also keen to launch one of its A380s on the lucrative transatlantic route from London to the US .

Among other airlines , Qantas is due to receive its first A380 in late 2008 and Emirates has more than 45 on order .

A woman died during a night of " bizarre sex " in which her husband used an electrical cord to stimulate her , but ended up giving her a fatal shock , police said .
Kirsten Taylor , 29 , was found unconscious on Wednesday night at the couple 's Pennsylvania home .
She was taken to York Hospital , where she was pronounced dead .
Toby Taylor first said his wife was shocked by a hair dryer , according to a police affidavit .
But when burns were found on her body , Taylor told police that he had clipped an electrical cord to his wife and plugged it into a power strip , which he then turned on and off .
In my previous piece chastising the Iowa Republican Party concerning their non-inclusion of Congressman Ron Paul in an upcoming debate to be fair and balanced , I noticed that in last night ’s Democratic debate absent was former Senator Mike Gravel .
I do not care how he is polling and what funds he has raised , the public had a right to hear his views especially when it comes to the Iraq War and any possible war with Iran .
Many of the Democratic candidates spoke of how they would end the war and again , I will state , former Senator Gravel could have told each senator currently holding a senate seat how they could do so now .
As I have written of before all it takes is 41 senators to support a filibuster to end this war .
The former Senator single - handedly filibustered to end the draft when it came to the Viet Nam war and saved countless lives in the process .
He choked off the military personnel being offered up to the Nixon administration and all of which led to the end of that heinous war .
The same needs to be done in this war as well .
He could have stated to the front - runner , Senator Hillary Clinton :
Why are n’t you filibustering to end this war given the fact you have said power ?
I would have loved to have heard any response coming from the senator since she is my senator .
While she was back in her game last night having recovered from the driver ’s license issue that has dominated the news not only within my state but clear across the nation , he could have challenged her further thereby not allowing her to recover any lost ground .
Democrats especially the ones in power love to say they are the inclusive party , yet they excluded someone from this debate and I find that unfair to the American electorate .
As I was watching this feed where Mrs. Elizabeth Kucinich was speaking to a group at the Mercury Café in Denver , Colorado , she said something remarkable about her husband about having walked the walk .
Well the same could be said of Mike Gravel in walking the walk to end one war .
In this feed , Mrs. Kucinich says “ the only thing that makes Dennis un- electable is an electorate that does not believe in itself ” and quite frankly , I believe that as well .
She also states that this race is a “ call to courage ” and that too rang so true .
Yet , the Democrats showed anything but as they excluded Mike Gravel from that debate .
In past debates , Mike Gravel challenged the top - tier candidates and I feel they should have been challenged more to bring enlightenment to this campaign .
Which is another point brought out by Mrs. Kucinich .
If we are going to grow as a democracy we need the light to be shed in all areas that are important to our very survival as a republic .
To shed light of how Governor Eliot Spitzer came to his decision not to issue licenses to illegal immigrants I am going to be blunt in my belief that he came to this decision on the heels of this debate .
Senator Clinton could have been questioned further concerning her recent comments where on one hand she supported it and on the other hand tried to distance herself .
I noticed in last night ’s debate when asked by Wolf Blitzer who amongst the candidates supported this program , she gave an affirmative “ No ” .
Note to my senator , Senator Clinton , I do not believe you and quite frankly , I do not think that many within New York State believe you as well .
Why do I believe this ?
She voted in favor of the comprehensive package on immigration reform along with my other senator , Chuck Schumer .
While I was glad to see the second - tier candidates such as Senators Biden and Dodd as well as Governor Richardson given more time , still former Senator Mike Gravel should have taken part in this debate .
As an independent with no party affiliation , I have no dog in this race since I cannot vote for any of them in the upcoming primaries ; I would have liked to hear more coming from Cong.
Kucinich .
You could see through his facial expressions his annoyance at not being questioned as much as the others .
At least he brought up the fact that he brought to the floor an impeachment bill .
That resounded at cheers coming from the audience .
In watching Lou Dobbs each night concerning the goods coming from China and how dangerous many of them are since many of these products do not meet U.S. safety standards , I would have valued Kucinich ’s opinion on NAFTA , CAFTA and the WTO .
Those are important trade agreements that do affect each and every American .
In fact prior to NAFTA being signed by former President Bill Clinton , H. Ross Perot stated of this agreement you would “ hear a giant sucking sound ” should it come to pass and how correct he was .
Americans are losing their jobs and livelihoods due to outsourcing .
We are being bled dry by these trade agreements .
We have become a debtor nation .
What security do we have as a nation when we are beholden financially to countries such as Japan , China and Mexico ?
On the Republican side , Congressman Ron Paul has also been outspoken against these trade agreements .
When his wife spoke of courage , one must congratulate Kucinich in bringing impeachment to the floor since Speaker of the House ; Nancy Pelosi has continually stated that any impeachment of Bush was “ Off the table ” She might as well put it back on the table since many of the bills passed by the house have been vetoed by Bush .
Yes , I realize that this too will go no where ; at least it would result in investigations in which the American people can see for themselves the illegality of this war , the wiretaps and yes torture .
With the demise of the illegal immigration bills that came to the senate twice , it was stopped dead in its tracks by the American electorate as they phoned into their senators .
Maybe as a result of opening up investigative proceedings on the floor of the house and senate , the same ground swell can come forth by the American people to impeach this president .
It may bring pressure to bear on those Republican senators who would look to block any impeachment of President Bush , Vice President Cheney or both .
At least we the American people would see some productivity coming from congress .
Maybe their dismal polling numbers would rise .
I do think a disservice was done to the American electorate especially independents like me when a former Senator was excluded from this debate .
Democracy in my eyes is where we hear from all corners concerning the destiny of this republic .
Former Senator Mike Gravel should have been included in that debate period .
As an American I have every right to hear of his opinions as do all Americans .
At least he knew how to stop a war dead in its tracks and one must ask :
Where is the courage of these other senators when it counts most to the American people .
We are broke and we cannot continue to fund this war for years to come .
More importantly we cannot even think of waging war with Iran .
That is something that former Senator Mike Gravel has often warned us against as he spoke in prior debates challenging both Senators Clinton and Obama .
But , what did Senator Clinton do ?
She voted in favor of the Kyl / Lieberman resolution .
As Obama chided her , let it be known he did not even vote up or down concerning that resolution .
At least Senators Dodd and Biden showed the temerity in not voting in favor of it .
Hillary Clinton - Making Our Dreams Come True
The media has been fixated on all the creative youtube videos that fans have made about Obama .
But what about the youtube fan videos made for Clinton ?
Watch the video below to see the creative genius of her fanbase :
Dust - Devil Tracks in Southern Schiaparelli Basin
Dust - devils are vortices of wind that form when air rising from a warm surface encounters shear in the above atmosphere .
Martian dust devils can attain gargantuan proportions , reaching the size of terrestrial tornadoes with plumes that tower up to 9 kilometers above the surface .
Dust - devils play an important role in sustaining the aerosols that make up Mars ’ red sky and in cleaning the Martian surface after a dust storm .
This observation shows a region near the Martian equator that is a perfect tablet for the scribblings of dust - devils .
This region is made up of dark bedrock that is thinly blanketed by bright dust .
Dark tracks form when dust - devils scour the surface , exposing the darker substrate .
The tracks tend to cluster together , as dust - devils repeatedly form over terrain that has been previously scoured and is consequently darker and warmer than the surrounding surface .
Once lofted by a dust - devil , the fine dust can be transported great distances before it settles again onto the surface .

ABC , which was hit a couple of weeks ago with a $ 1.4 million fine by the FCC , has decided to fight back .
The fine was imposed because of a scene in a 2003 episode of NYPD Blue that showed a woman ’s buttocks and a bit of what the Celeb gossip sites all call “ side boob . ”
Just like NYPD Blue had been doing for 10 years .
This time , however , it was different .
I guess .
And five years after the actual episode was broadcast — three years after NYPD Blue went off the air — the FCC came down with their oh - so - timely fine .
And the children , once again , are saved from the gruesome horrors of the naked female human body !
Thank God .
Or thank Wholly His Official Representatives on Earth , the children - loving , naked - woman hating Parents Television Council , who , as usual , decided to be offended so that the rest of us did n’t have to .
Luckily , the PTC are trained professionals , and after watching the video over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over , they determined that it was a “ graphic display of female nudity . ”
And there is also this pre-emptive strike against anybody who dare push back against them :
Despite the TV networks ’ scurrilous lawsuits claiming a â€˜right ’ to air profanity , and that a striptease in the middle of the Super Bowl was somehow not indecent , this order should serve as a reminder to every broadcaster and every network that they must use the public airwaves responsibly and in a manner which serves the public interest .
That ’s right , they ’re still not over Janet Jackson ’s “ strip tease , ” which was obviously these people ’s 9/11 .
And who gets to determine the public interest ?
The Parents Television Council , who are just one example of what I call Cultural Correctness : that the Culture at large must adhere to the narrow standards that they set or families and the children will be irreparably harmed .
What this harm is , exactly , is never stated .
It ’s kinda like the “ Defense of Marriage ” acts .
What exactly are marriages being defended against by keeping gay people from participating ?
How exactly , will my marriage be harmed again ?
In any event , the FCC , knowing full well that the complaints did n’t represent anything but .0000001 % of the population , stalled and dithered and watched the video over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over , and eventually gave in to the pressure from the only people in the entire universe who actually still cared and fined ABC .
And ABC , bless them , is fighting back .
First , they are appealing on theoretical grounds :
“ The FCC ’s action was inconsistent with the Commission ’s own indecency standards , procedural requirements , and prior decisions ; with the indecency statute ; and with the First Amendment , ” ABC said .
Not only are the so - called “ standards ” of the FCC ill - defined at best , their decisions are arbitrary and capricious , and often exist only to kowtow to their political allies and own personal beliefs as opposed to any true public interest .
Or did I just read into that ?
As far as the First Amendment goes , who cares about that , when awful gross naked women can appear on TV !
And , ABC is appealing on practical grounds .
“ When the brief scene in question was telecast almost five years ago , ” ABC said in a statement , “ this critically acclaimed drama had been on the air for a decade and the realistic nature of its storylines were well known to the viewing public . ”
Bingo !
The irony here was that the entire point of the nudity here was show a situation where a young boy is confronted with an inadvertent naked female body .
Did it kill him , or did the evil vessel of Satan naked body turn him into a deaf , dumb and blind pinball champ ?
After watching the video over and over and over and over and over and over , I have determined that it did n’t .
Hang on , one more time . . . nope .
Looks like surprise and embarrassment and perhaps some questions about shaving were all that were going to come out of the incident .
I pointed out , NYPD Blue had always pushed the broadcast envelope — on its very first episode there was a controversy over the phrase “ pissy little bitch , ” — and while I stopped watching it after the first season , I seem to remember reading somewhere that there were entire episodes based around Dennis Franz ’ butt .
The point is , who tunes into NYPD Blue not knowing what to expect ?
Swear words and nudity have always been part of its nature .
And even though it was on the air for dozen years , not a single child was ever harmed by it .
Not a one .
Hmm , perhaps this fine is n’t for the particular incident , but rather a lifetime achievement award .
In any event , it would be nice , just once if — after the appeal is denied — ABC keep pushing this , just to see what happens .
What the hell , let it go all the way to the Supreme Court .
I ’d like to think that even the Roberts Court would have to side with the First Amendment as opposed to Cultural Correctness .
For some , living in a city is a loud , unpleasant babble of intrusive noise .
For others it is a soundscape of calming , tones that lift the spirits and brighten the day .
Now a £ 1 m , three - year research project is building a database of noises that people say improve their environment .
It will translate those findings into design principles to help architects create sweeter - sounding cities .
Among the urban sounds researchers have found to be surprisingly agreeable are car tyres on wet , bumpy asphalt , the distant roar of a motorway flyover , the rumble of an overground train and the thud of heavy bass heard on the street outside a nightclub .
Other sounds that are apparently kind to the ear include a baby laughing , skateboarders practising in underground car parks and orchestras tuning up .
' Sound in the environment , especially that made by other people , has overwhelmingly been considered purely as a matter of volume and generally in negative terms , as both intrusive and undesirable , ' said Dr Bill Davies of Salford University , who is leading the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council - funded project Positive Soundscapes .
' The strong focus of traditional engineering acoustics is on reducing noise level , ' added Davies .
' But not only is that failing , it is also ignoring the many possibilities for creating positive soundscapes in the environments in which we live . '
According to the latest National Noise Incidence Study , moves to bring in quieter transport and urban noise barriers are falling short .
Traffic noise is audible in 87 per cent of homes in England and Wales , and 54 per cent of the population is exposed to levels beyond the World Health Organisation guidelines for avoiding serious irritation .
Davies would like to see more water features and sound - generating sculptures next to busy roads .
Buildings and trees can also be used to scatter , deaden or reflect sound , to create peaceful , quieter spaces or vibrant , exciting - sounding areas .
Experts from five British universities have been bought together by Positive Soundscapes .
Ken Hume of the Noise Research Group at Manchester Metropolitan University , says the project is long overdue .
' Visual aesthetics are a major part of the planning system with strong guidelines determining what is acceptable or unacceptable .
A corresponding aesthetics of sound is missing . '
Davies is looking for members of the public to take part in mass ' sound walks ' through cities or in laboratory listening tests , where the team will use MRI scanners to measure participants ' brain activity as they are played a variety of urban noises .
' It is anticipated that pleasurable soundscapes will cause activation in brain areas associated with reward and the opposite will be true of aversive or stressful soundscapes , ' said Davies .
Early results have shown interesting anomalies in the public 's perceptions of sound .
' People can completely change their perception of a sound once they have identified it , ' he said .
' In the laboratory , many listeners prefer distant motorway noise to rushing water , until they are told what the sounds are .'
Sounds are not , the study found , judged solely on volume .
' The frequency [ pitch ] of a noise is a huge issue , ' said Davies .
' A high - pitched sound is unpleasant even if it is very quiet , like the whine of a wasp trapped in a room , while a sound like bass coming through the wall of a nightclub , which is loud but low , can be very soothing . '
HALF MOON BAY , Calif . 
The image of the quintessential American surfer  a bronzed slacker in board shorts  may be firmly entrenched .
But that surfer dude bears little resemblance to the athletes known as big - wave surfers , a small community composed of men and women who often become amateur oceanographers and experts in wave dynamics in order to ride waves that can be more than 50 feet high .
On Saturday , this community will gather here for the Super Bowl of big - wave surfing : the Mavericks Surf Contest , which pits 24 surfers against one another  and against some of the most treacherous surfing conditions in the world .
An underwater rock formation is partly responsible for the spectacular breaks that can result in towering walls of water , which can deliver harsh punishment to the surfers if they wipe out .
Mark Foo , a legendary big - wave surfer from Hawaii , died while trying to surf Mavericks in 1994 .
So big - wave surfers must do more than wax their boards and wait for waves .
In addition to maintaining a supreme level of physical fitness , they study weather patterns , listen to radio broadcasts by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and do whatever else it takes to understand the water ’s movements .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday requested that a federal grand jury be appointed to investigate whether a top White House official and former official should be prosecuted for contempt of Congress .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants a grand jury to investigate two aides who 've served President Bush .
In a letter sent to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and the U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia , Pelosi says White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers were unresponsive to Congress ' probe of the 2006 firings of U.S. attorneys .
Mukasey already has said he will not pursue charges against the two .
The White House has argued that contempt laws do n't apply to the president or any of his staffers who invoke executive privilege .
In a statement Thursday , Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said Mukasey had received the letter .
He repeated the attorney general 's belief that " long - standing Department precedent " prevents him from forwarding charges to a grand jury against White House staff if the president has told them to claim executive privilege .
" The attorney general is reviewing the referral and we anticipate that he will provide further guidance when that review is completed , " Roehrkasse said .
" There is no authority by which persons may wholly ignore a subpoena and fail to appear as directed because a president unilaterally instructs them to do so , " Pelosi wrote in her letters .
" Even if a subpoenaed witness intends to assert a privilege in response to questions , the witness is not at liberty to disregard the subpoena and fail to appear at the required time and place . "
" I strongly urge you to reconsider your position and to ensure that our nation is operating under the rule of law and not at presidential whim , " Pelosi wrote .
Earlier this month , the House voted to find Bolten and Miers in contempt of Congress and pursue charges against them .
The chamber 's Republican minority staged a walkout before the vote .
A spokesman for House Republican leader John Boehner issued a statement calling Pelosi 's request a " partisan political stunt " and " complete waste of time . "
" This sort of pandering to the left - wing fever swamps of loony liberal activists does nothing to make America safer , " spokesman Michael Steel said in the statement .
Miers refused to testify in the probe , which stemmed from the Justice Department 's dismissals of federal prosecutors in eight cities .
Bolten failed to produce documents in his possession , Pelosi 's letter says .
The White House has insisted the firings were legal .
But Democrats said the central questions behind the dismissals -- who decided the prosecutors should be ousted , and why -- remain unanswered .
Critics of the move have said prosecutors , including Republican appointees , who were not sufficiently supportive of Bush were targeted .
The House resolution authorizes the House Judiciary Committee to go to court to enforce the subpoenas issued to Miers and Bolten once the Justice Department , as expected , refuses .
The White House argues that forcing the aides to testify would violate the Constitution 's separation of powers .

At 68 , his hair and beard now almost completely silver - grey , Francis Ford Coppola looks like Fidel Castro 's jollier younger brother .
He is holding court in an expansive hotel suite in Rome which looks out over the Spanish Steps and the dome of St Peter 's beyond .
We are here to discuss his new film , Youth Without Youth , his first in 10 years , but the talk has turned almost immediately to the melancholy subject of growing old .
' At my age , ' he says , ' you start to think about stuff you did n't think about before .
One of the big questions that keeps coming up is " what if ? "
What if I 'd done this instead of that ?
What if I 'd become the experimental , avant garde film - maker I always really wanted to be ?'
Well , for a start , I say , you would n't have made The Godfather .
Or , for that matter , Apocalypse Now .
And you would n't now be regarded as one of the greatest directors of the 20th century .
' I guess not , ' he says , sounding not that worried one way or another .
' But , I would have made more personal films .
Films of ideas .
Like the guys who were making movies when I came of age - Godard and the New Wave .
Which is what I wanted to do in the first place . '
Why did n't he , then ?
A long sigh .
' I became successful in Hollywood , ' he says finally .
' I got sidetracked . '
He says this with wistfulness rather than deep regret , but it is still an astounding thing to hear from one of the great masters of 20th - century American film : the sense that he considers himself to be artistically inferior to a chancer like Godard .
Now , though , as if to assuage this long - held regret , Coppola has finally got to make an experimental film .
Youth Without Youth is based on the philosophical novel of the same name by Mercia Eliade .
It stars Tim Roth as Dominic Matei , an ageing Hungarian linguist who , having made preparations to commit suicide , is struck by lightning on a street in Bucharest on Easter Sunday , 1938 .
Like Christ , he rises again , and , while recovering from his ordeal in hospital , his body mysteriously begins to regenerate .
His youth returns , but he retains the memories and regrets of an old man , and is haunted by the long - lost love of his life , Laura , played by the wonderful Alexandra Maria Lara .
' I was on holiday on a beach when he rang me up , ' says the young actress , who has previously played Hitler 's secretary in Downfall and Ian Curtis 's mistress in Control .
' I was so shocked , I immediately cut him off just so I could compose myself .
But he was so generous in his way of working .
It 's a complex film in many ways but he was very patient with all my questions and talked me through the most demanding scenes .
I kept thinking , " This ca n't be happening to me , I 'm working with a legend . " '
Youth Without Youth is a film that forgoes thrills and spills for endless rumination .
Its pace is slow and stately , its tone regretful .
I put it to Coppola that today 's cinema audience may find it demanding .
' Well , it 's essentially a fairytale and , as such , it 's not that hard to understand , ' he replies , sounding slightly testy .
' I guess it may appear weird to people who want me to make The Godfather or Apocalypse Now over and over but , you know , when Apocalypse Now came out , everybody said , " Wow , this is so weird " .
That was the initial reaction almost across the board .
It took five years really before they stated saying , this is not so weird .
This is just different .'
Coppola has travelled to Rome for the city 's annual film festival , and it is clear that the Italian - American director is revered here .
The following day Youth Without Youth will receive its world premiere .
He has brought the entire Coppola clan along with him : his wife , Eleanor , a documentary film - maker who made the brilliant Heart of Darkness about the fraught filming of Apocalypse Now ; his daughter , Sofia , a celebrated director in her own right ( Lost in Translation , Marie Antoinette ) ; and his son , Roman , who co-scripted Wes Anderson 's The Darjeeling Limited .
( Another son , Gio , died in a boating accident in 1986 . )
' It 's a family affair , ' he says , smiling .
The celebratory atmosphere has been punctured , though , by a story that has just broken in the press in which Coppola seems to accuse Robert De Niro and Al Pacino , who both starred in the Godfather films , of growing old and lazy and ' living off the fat of the land ' .
One headline reads : ' Coppola launches blistering attack on three of the biggest stars in the film business . '
Another claims : ' Coppola mocks Godfather stars . '
On the page , the quotes look pretty damning .
Of the man who played Michael Corleone , Coppola is quoted as saying , ' Pacino is rich , maybe because he never spends any money ; he just puts it in his mattress . '
Even Jack Nicholson gets it in the neck for having a ' mean streak ' and being ' always wired in with the big boys , the big bosses of the studios ' .
Coppola shrugs .
' How outrageous , ' he says .
' And how funny .
I mean , it 's not so much what I said , which is what I would say to them , it 's that it 's been taken totally out of context .
It was wrapped up as if I was attacking them .
I did n't attack them .
I love and respect and admire them .
The headlines were , " Jack Nicholson is a waste of talent " .
I mean , what kind of schmuck would say that ?'
So , what happened , exactly ?
' Well , right at the end of a long interview , this guy from CQ [ sic ] magazine asked me what I thought of them .
And I said , well they 're not the same guys they were when they were young and hungry .
Now they are rich .
Deservedly so .
Thank God , you know .
Then it all gets twisted .
I mean , I 'm a friendly guy , right ?
You ask me this or that , I 'll tell you . '
So , for the record , what do you really think about them ?
' What do I think of Bobby De Niro and Al Pacino ?
Well , for a start , I do n't feel I made them , I feel they made me .
That 's how highly I regard them .
And Jack is a huge talent , one of the greats .
These are my friends , ' he says , sighing .
' And that kind of stuff can hurt friendships . '
As he approaches 70 , Coppola seems oddly vulnerable .
It is not just that the avuncular and effusive gentleman sitting on the sofa opposite me bears only the slightest resemblance , physically and temperamentally , to the driven , larger - than - life character who made those grandiose American films in the Seventies .
It is more that , even as his legend has grown , the movies he has made since then seem to have mattered less and less .
It is 10 years since his last film , The Rainmaker , a solid , well - crafted take on a John Grisham thriller .
It was not a commercial success .
Neither was Tucker : The Man and His Dream ( 1988 ) , nor Gardens of Stone ( 1987 ) nor the entertaining but oddly empty Fifties period piece , Peggy Sue Got Married ( 1986 ) .
They were all perfectly well - made films but lacking in greatness , devoid of the visionary scope and bravura direction of his great early masterpieces .
You have to go back to the early Eighties to the likes of One From the Heart and Rumble Fish to catch a glimpse of the greatness that was announced so dramatically a decade earlier with the first two Godfather films .
Of late , too , it has often seemed that Coppola was more content to tend the vineyards on his vast California estate than make movies .
( He has two wine companies situated in Napa Valley , one small and traditional , the other big and globally successful , as well as a thriving pasta company in Brooklyn . )
Having bought the legendary Inglenook Chateau in 1995 with the £ 4.5 m profits from Bram Stoker 's Dracula , he is now using some of the vast fortune he has made from his vineyards to make films .
' Everything is genre - driven these days , and that 's not what I 'm interested in .
Some of the greatest directors we have get sucked into returning to the same subject matter , and essentially making the same film over and over , ' he says , perhaps referring to his friend , Martin Scorsese .
' Whereas I'm in the fortunate position of having become wealthy though the wine business .
That is the reason I am able to make the films I want to make . '
How much did Youth Without Youth cost , then ?
He pauses .
' I can't tell you exactly but , let 's put it this way , I can make any film I want for around $ 20 m ( £ 10 m ) or less . '
The film was shot on location in Romania with a small crew .
Coppola insists this was because he wanted to make it the way his younger self would have made it had he not been ' side - tracked ' by Hollywood .
' I very consciously tried to make it the way a student film - maker would .
I put all the equipment in a truck and went to Romania .
I did n't have any of the great collaborators that I 've had the pleasure of working with in the past .
In fact , I worked with a 28 - year - old local cinematographer .
Which was kind of apt because I felt like I was a 28 - year - old director all over again . '
This , of course , could simply be Coppola putting a brave face on things .
Another way of reading it is that his commercial cachet in Hollywood is now so low that self - financing his projects is the only way to get them made .
Whatever , he seems remarkably calm about it all , even mellow .
This is after all a man who , while recreating the excesses of the Vietnam war in the jungles of the Philippines for Apocalypse Now , collapsed on the set just after his lead actor , the young Martin Sheen , had a near fatal heart attack .
' Oh man , all that stuff was exaggerated , greatly exaggerated , ' he says , not altogether convincingly .
' I read the other day that I had three nervous breakdowns .
I maybe had one little one .
And that was through smoking , not overwork .
But three breakdowns , I mean , come on !'
Nevertheless , his younger self seems close to meltdown more than once in Heart of Darkness , his wife Eleanor 's documentary , which I watched again recently .
I also reread her great book , Notes , on the making of the film .
In it she writes of her husband 's collapse : ' Francis said he was as near to death as he has ever experienced .
He said he could see reality coming down a dark tunnel and he was totally scared that he would n't get back . '
Was she exaggerating , too ?
' Well , Heart of Darkness is obviously accurate , ' he concedes ..
' I guess I was a little - what 's the word ?
- manic back then . '
He chuckles like a guilty child .
' Then again , ' he says , ' you have to be manic to get through something like that . '
One of the funniest and most revealing anecdotes in Eleanor Coppola 's book describes a row she had with her husband in the driveway of their San Francisco house when the making of Apocalypse Now had all but taken over his life .
They were shouting at each other across the roof of their car when their daughter , Sofia , who was just a toddler back then , wound down the window and yelled ' Cut ! '
Now Sofia is a successful director in her own right , as calm and laid - back on set as he was histrionic and overbearing .
' Sofia has a signature , ' he says , proudly , ' We call it terroir in the wine business .
You would know you were watching one of her movies even if you had n't seen the credits .
I hope it 's the same with me .'
I wonder , though .
For all his greatness , Coppola 's movies are not really united by a signature style .
It would be difficult without prior knowledge to guess that Youth Without Youth - or , indeed , Peggy Sue Got Married or Rumble Fish - was directed by the same man who made The Godfather .
He once described himself as ' a sloppy filmmaker ' .
What exactly did he mean by that ?
' Well , making a film is like cooking a dinner .
I guess I 'm a sloppy cook because I do it out of enthusiasm , essentially .
I do n't measure everything but I have a good feel for food .
Same with movies .
The bottom line is I 'm emotionally sloppy .
That 's why I need a great cinematographer .
They 're the opposite of emotional and sloppy , they 're precise .
You need both to make a good film . '
Does he still enjoy filmmaking as much as he did when he was younger and bolder ?
' Well , it takes longer these days .
I do other things now as well - it 's not just one film and then another . '
Someone - it may have been Werner Herzog - once said that making a film was governed by fear .
Does he agree ?
' Oh , yeah .
Every day you are in a total state of fear .
It 's one of those jobs where you go ahead in an attitude that would probably stop other people from going ahead .
That 's the nature of it . '
His next film is called Tetro and stars Javier Bardem .
' I want , ' he says , ' to make a great old - fashioned movie with Elia Kazan - style acting . '
He has written the screenplay himself and will soon be taking his truck of equipment to Argentina to begin shooting .
' It 's about fathers , sons and brothers , a bit Tennessee Williams , a bit Rocco and His Brothers . '
He pauses for a moment and looks out across the domes and spires and red-tiled rooftops of Rome .
' I guess the way it has turned out is that when people go to see a new Francis Ford Coppola movie , they hope it 's going to be another Godfather .
There is always that hope even in the face of the impossibility of that actually happening . '
That 's quite a weight to carry , but by acknowledging it you sense that Francis Ford Coppola has finally made it lighter .
The twinkle in his eye when he talks about Tetro makes me think that he may yet surprise us .
I really hope so .
As he has grown older , cinema has grown safer .
' For a movie to be great , ' he says just before we conclude , ' someone has had to have taken a risk .
If no one is willing to do that , the movies will not be good .
That much I do know . '
He seems ready to take that risk at least one more time .

America is awash in suspect and stolen elections .
Since January , 2001 , the nation has been saddled with an unelected chief executive .
The consequences have been predictably horrific .
Along the way , three US Senate contests in 2002 and numerous other Congressional and local elections have been subjected to partisan disenfranchisement of qualified voters , and vote counts that smack of theft and fraud .
Even now the primary in New Hampshire is rightly being challenged to do an expensive but necessary recount procedure that could and should have been avoided .
As has been shown in the Free Press and elsewhere through the stolen 2000 and 2004 presidential contests , there are scores of ways by which elections can and have been rigged and ripped off in this new century .
And there are scores of cures that can be put forth .
But we believe they can boil down to a basic three : 1. AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION , WITH SIGNATURE VERIFICATION :
Since the beginning of the American republic , more than 200 years ago , voters have signed their registration forms , then signed again when they came to vote .
Falsifying a signature is a felony .
All studies indicate that the number of people who vote fraudulently is miniscule .
In recent years , Republican operatives have attempted to hype so - called voter fraud into a major issue .
The Bush Administration has fired nine US Attorneys for their failure to find large numbers of people committing this crime .
Nonetheless , the GOP and its minions in the media have hyped this non-problem into a national crisis , whose " solution " is to demand photo ID at the polling stations .
It 's well - known that the impact of this demand would be to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of elderly , indigent , homeless and other citizens , most of whom happen to vote Democratic .
A lower court has rightly labeled this requirement to be a " poll tax " which is specifically barred by the 24th Amendment to the US Constitution .
But the US Supreme Court now has at least four members who will vote for anything that serves the partisan interests of the Republican Party .
There is a widespread feeling the Court will approve this requirement , with adoption in many states run by the GOP .
During Ohio 2004 , and in New Mexico and other swing states , the GOP also found ways to prevent many thousands of voters from registering at all .
The list of dirty tricks is too long and insidious to report here .
More are being unearthed every day .
The one most likely to surface in a big way in 2008 is the practice of disqualifying voters if the spelling of their name or their middle initial ( or lack thereof ) somehow varies from the one in the computer - generated registration books .
Since the voter rolls in some counties and states have already been privatized , and are being run by partisan for - profit vendors , we can expect widespread , systematic disenfranchisement if this system remains in tact .
Our " Ohio Plan " solution is simple : everyone in the United States should be automatically registered to vote upon turning 18 years old .
Forms addressed to election bureaus , with free postage , should be made available in high schools and colleges , at motor vehicle bureaus , social security offices , post offices , union halls , in military recruiting offices and barracks and numerous other locales throughout the nation .
All registration forms , and all polling places , can be festooned with signs warning that fraudulent voting is a felony .
No photo ID shall be required at any voting place , only a signature that matches the one on file , and a wide range of less intrusive ID .
Innumerable federal , state and government entities from school districts to the IRS know when US citizens turn 18 .
Ohio allows some 17 different documents to serve as suitable identification at the polls .
Voting is a basic American right .
It should be the affirmative duty of the state to promote universal registration and end the bizarre practice of purging voters in a computer age .
Short of a death certificate , the few questionable voters can easily be moved to an inactive status instead of purged from the computer database .
2. UNIVERSAL HAND - COUNTED PAPER BALLOTS
:
It is by now a public article of faith that electronic voting machines are perfectly designed to steal elections .
A recent $ 1.9 million study for the Ohio Secretary of State has confirmed that an electronic voting machine can be flipped with a magnet and a Blackberry .
After reports by the Carter - Baker Commission , the Brennan Center , Princeton University , the Government Accountability Office , the Conyers Committee and many more , even the come- lately New York Times has now deemed touch - screen machines to be eminently hackable .
The country owes a huge debt of gratitude to the grassroots uprising of independent researchers and bloggers that has campaigned so bravely and effectively in the face of a mainstream media intent on ignoring the issue .
Now the Times and others seem to want a " middle ground " with Optiscan machines that run paper ballots through a reader , and even worse , feed them into computerized central tabulators .
We oppose this hackable non-solution .
At least two Optiscan scams come quickly to mind .
In Toledo , Ohio , inner city wards , Optiscan ballots were improperly calibrated causing a higher rate than normal to be rejected by the reader .
Scores of them remain uncounted from the 2004 Ohio presidential election .
In fact , most of the 93,000 or so uncounted ballots in Ohio fell under the label “ machine rejected .
”
In Miami County , Ohio , an Optiscan machine produced phantom votes that could n't be explained in the final tabulation .
See the Free Press article : http://freepress.org/departments/display/19/2006/2209
Yet Ohio's Secretary of State is poised to order Cuyahoga County ( Cleveland ) --- which overrode citizen objections against spending $ 20 million on touchscreen voting machines --- to now spend an additional $ 11 million on Optiscan machines to replace them .
How long will it take before those Optiscan machines are , in turn , rejected ?
The real solution is obvious : use paper ballots , and count them by hand .
This is not , of course , fool proof .
But it works beautifully in places like Germany and Switzerland , where official vote counts regularly conform to within 0.1 % of exit polls .
Hand counted paper ballots could and should work here .
In particular , we should reach out to high school and college students in the tradition of democratic public service to facilitate the vote count process .
The " revolutionary concept " of all of us voting on ballots that have the actual name of the candidates on them , with the opportunity to put a visual , tangible " X " next to those we choose , has the merit of obvious simplicity .
These ballots can be counted and recounted , with high reliability and no dependence on source codes or incomprehensible computer glitches .
To be sure , ballots can be stolen and manipulated .
But there is every indicator the possibility of fraud is still far less than with electronic machines .
One can stuff ballots one at a time , so to speak , at the retail level .
But computerized voting and tabulation allow for the far more dangerous wholesale shifting of votes and the deadly pre-programming of election results .
It should also be noted that federal law now requires that all election records be retained for 22 months after a federal vote .
In Ohio , 56 of 88 county election boards ignored federal law --- and a court injunction --- and destroyed all or some of their records from the 2004 election , making a meaningful recount essentially impossible .
Thus far , no state or federal official has indicated any willingness to do anything about this blatant abuse of federal law .
So meaningful reform will require that federal election laws actually be enforced .
As part of the King - Lincoln civil rights lawsuit ( in which we are attorney and plaintiff ) extensive research into Ohio 2004 makes it clear that nearly all the electronic records were virtually worthless anyway , and could have been easily manipulated had they been retained .
That would not have been the case had the election been conducted entirely on paper ballots .
They are thus the worst alternative we have --- except for all the other ones .
3 ) A THREE - DAY NATIONAL VOTING HOLIDAY , WITH BALLOTS HAND - COUNTED BY STUDENTS :
The current practice of voting on Tuesday was adopted in the 1700s because that was when Americans came to market .
We are no longer a farm society , and we need not vote on the first Tuesday following a Monday after final harvest .
Today this practice discriminates against working people and is nothing more than an inappropriate , anti-democratic anachronism .
Ohio's Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner has proposed a two - week window for voting .
We think three days should suffice .
They should be the Friday , Saturday and Sunday nearest to November 11 , Veteran 's Day .
The polls should be staffed by high school and college students , who will then be given that Monday off to count the paper ballots .
The current demand for electronic tabulating has no basis other than the demand by the media for quick results and the demand for great profits ( at public expense ) by the companies who make these easily hackable machines .
We believe the American public can wait for election results to be accurate and reliable .
We also see in this a great civics lesson for our young people .
And a reliable way to get a true , democratic outcome from our most critical means of keeping the government accountable and under public control .
Universal voter registration , a ban on electronic voting machines and the requirement for hand - counting of paper ballots can all be done with simple legislation .
The three - day voting process is more complex .
The requirement that we vote the first Tuesday after November 's first Monday is embedded in the Constitution .
Changing that would require a Constitutional Amendment .
( Voting on Saturday through Tuesday , with vote counting on Wednesday - - - a five - day process --- would not ) .
Overall , simple as they are , these three simple , practical steps could revolutionize our democratic process and restore control of our government to the people .
Which is precisely why we expect the mainstream media , voting machine manufacturers and major parties to heap scorn on them .
We have not addressed the problem of money in politics , proportional voting , or of the corporate media 's undemocratic domination of the campaign process .
But this administration has certainly taught us the consequences of having an unelected executive .
We must start somewhere .
These three steps will help us at least regain control of the voting process .
From there , anything is possible .

Their WHAT HAPPENED IN OHIO ? , with Steve Rosenfeld , is from the New Press .
By NMA President , James Baxter
The State of Virginia is lamenting the fact that the state ’s highway fatalities are on track to reach one thousand traffic - related deaths .
Bringing this into sharper focus were the 16 fatalities that occurred over the Thanksgiving holiday period .
These fatalities occurred despite the deployment of 75 percent of the state police force and the issuance of 21,000 traffic tickets .
They just do n’t get it .
Clogging the highways with “ quota - charged ” state troopers intent on issuing tickets has n’t , and never will , reduce traffic accidents .
If Virginia , or any other state , wants to reduce holiday traffic accidents , here are four alternatives to the routine ticket frenzy that will actually serve the traveling public :
1 ) All active construction zones should be optimized to boost their vehicle carrying capacity .
Any construction activity that can be curtailed or reduced should be adjusted accordingly .
Wherever possible , construction zone speed limits should be returned to the normal speed limit for that section of highway .
2 ) Be visible , but resist the temptation to chase , stop , and ticket .
Instead , be ready to instantly respond to any emergency .
All remaining enforcement activity should be focused on persons that are interfering with the normal flow of traffic .
This includes drivers who are blocking traffic while lounging in the passing lane or driving recklessly .
3 ) Contract with towing companies charged with the responsibility to remove disabled and accident involved vehicles as quickly as possible .
The towing to the nearest exit or parking area should be without charge .
This can easily be accomplished by using the funds previously allocated to overtime pay for extra patrol officers focused on ticketing .
4 ) Publicize and , if necessary , subsidize “ safe ride home ” programs for persons who have over - celebrated the holiday .
Save the moralizing for another venue and focus on getting people home safely .
In other words change the emphasis from “ threaten , enforce , punish , and penalize ” to “ accommodate , assist , guide , and educate . ”
Then we ’ll see the holiday travel fatality numbers move in the right direction , downward .
EA made waves in October when the gaming giant purchased Pandemic and BioWare , and the company has pledged to release fewer sequels while expanding its new IP .
While there has n't been enough time to see if EA is sincere in that aim , the company remains acquisition - hungry , and has just made public its wish to purchase Take Two Interactive .
The move is bold : EA is willing to pay $ 26 per share for Take Two stock , a 63 percent premium over the stock 's 30 - day average selling price ; the deal would consist of approximately $ 2 billion in cash .
The offer was made on February 19 in a letter to Strauss Zelnick , executive chairman of the board of directors of Take Two , and , when taken public today , was promptly rejected .
" We believe EA 's unsolicited offer is highly opportunistic and is attempting to take advantage of our upcoming release of Grand Theft Auto IV , one of the most valuable and durable franchises in the industry , " Take Two 's own release states .
The offer comes at " absolutely the wrong time , " says Take Two ; the company wants to wait until after the release of the surefire hit Grand Theft Auto 4 before taking a harder look at its options .
While the board may have rejected the offer , ignoring the implied threat will be difficult .
" There can be no certainty that in the future EA or any other buyer would pay the same high premium we are offering today , " EA CEO John Riccitiello wrote to Take Two .
EA is willing to pay this premium to get the deal closed now , in order to use its distribution and retail power to capitalize on the release of Grand Theft Auto 4 .
The end of sports competition ?
While everyone seems to be focusing on Grand Theft Auto 4 , however , there is another important piece of this puzzle that cannot be ignored : Take Two , which owns 2 K Sports , is the only other power player in sports gaming on the market .
EA has just extended its exclusive deal with the NFL until 2013 , and an acquisition of Take Two would put EA in control of the only strong competitor left in sports gaming .
2K Sports releases the popular NBA 2K , College Hoops , Major League Baseball , and NHL 2 K series , among others .
This deal would make EA the only game in town for sports titles , with every pun very much intended .
While Grand Theft Auto is certainly a huge series , this deal would give EA a complete monopoly of sports gaming , and it 's impossible to put a value on cornering the sports market for the foreseeable future .
It 's unclear what would happen if Take Two came under the control of EA : the different 2 K Sports and EA Sports could continue to operate independently , but it's also very possible that EA would kill one or more of the competing series , leading to only one choice for yearly titles in each sport .
The lack of choice , combined with the an economic disincentive for EA to compete against itself , could lead to an overall weakening in quality in sports games .
While Take
Two may not want to admit it , the company has very few weapons with which to fight this takeover .
The offer is for cash , and EA is willing to pay more to have it happen as quickly as possible .
The big price premium may be difficult for Take Two shareholders to turn down , especially since the company worked out a deal to borrow $ 140 million , if needed to stay in business .
A cash infusion this immense , combined with the power of the EA brand , has to be tempting for the shareholders of the embattled Take Two , and if Take Two fights the takeover , it 's likely we 'll see a lawsuit from shareholders in favor of an EA acquisition .
EA may claim that it's not rattled by the power of the Activision / Vivendi merger , but this acquisition would give EA unprecedented power over sports gaming , and would allow the company to add BioShock , Bully , Midnight Club , and of course the Grand Theft Auto series to its already impressive stable of games .
While Take
Two may wish to remain independent , EA seems resolute in its aim to acquire the company .
If Take Two remains adamant in its refusal , EA could sweeten the offer a bit more , start a proxy fight like Microsoft is doing with Yahoo , or go for a full - on hostile takeover .
The only question is how much worth EA places on the IP that Take Two holds , and how long the company can continue to say no to EA 's advances .

This is not a " how - to " guide .
I am publishing this list because I believe that exposing these techniques will curb them ... and I think it is pretty funny .
As a young man , I realized I had a special attraction to crimes that were clever .
Mugging ?
No. Defeating software copy - protection ?
Yes .
Shoplifting ?
No. Photocopying UPCs and re-labeling boxes ?
Yes .
Of course , " clever " is relative .
Sometimes a clever scheme is one that is one that can be done without risk of detection , and sometimes it is one that is so ingenious that no criminal or shopkeeper has thought of it yet .
Those are the ones that I like seeing in movies , like the Grifters , Paper Moon or the Usual Suspects .
In fact , some schemes are so brilliant that the temptation must be terrific .
But be warned that the people who operate stores are n't flying blind .
The Home Depot on Folsom Blvd. has a bulletin board full of " recovery stories " about switched tags and UPC fraud .
It is great to think up schemes , but having a good imagination is no excuse for criminal behavior .
I 'd like to name the values above , perhaps as " Daytons " or " Waltons . "
Unfortunately , I do n't think anyone would want such behavior named after him or her .
Suggestions ?
Anyway , the more people know about them , the less clever they are , and ( I believe ) , the less people will be tempted to engage in them .
Drop me a line if you know of any really clever ones .
( I 'd love some international additions / cultural differences ) .
Brief prelude on how I got to this topic for flavor and context : earlier this week I was having discussion from an old friend from Berkeley about methodologies in scaling , set off by a discussion rooted in a set of Motorola slides [ 0 ] comparing an Erlang , C plus Erlang , and C ( ++ ) telecom equipment code that I had forwarded to him .
He was aware of Erlang and its general properties since I had been talking about Erlang some time back when I had been playing around with it as a way to coordinate and cluster nodes for KM [ 1 ] .
He then remarked that he was working on some stuff that needed to be parallelized and support high concurrency and referred me to the SEDA research project as a guiding influence on his budding architecture .
SEDA emphasized using event queues to send messages between parallel parts of the architecture with feedback loops for control and updates .
I took a look at this and felt there were a few problems :
SEDA is a mothballed research project , so there ’s no up to date code
No project I know of maintains a well proven , high quality implementation to abstract a comfortable amount of the mundane details away from me .
Sometimes the model you are working with calls for a thread and not events .
Qualms one and two are strictly at practical and not at a ideological level .
SEDA has some high level ideas that I have no strong crystallized negative reaction to and are probably good reading … but at a nuts and bolts level I am left unenthusiastic by the general prospect of not having powerful abstractions readily available to achieve these aims .
Qualm three is much more philosophical and meaty .
I have seen a paper that pretty much sums up some of my feelings on the matter : sometimes , you do n’t want an event - driven abstraction .
The paper even mentions SEDA by name as an example of an event - oriented tool used by the authors to set up high - concurrency servers .
Despite the fact that SEDA tried to make this easy ( or easier ) the authors felt that sometimes a thread was really what one wanted and the event - driven model was just not as clear or easy to write as the thread - oriented one .
Not being as clear or easy to write means more bugs .
However , not all is lost : the paper concludes that there ’s no fundamental reason why events should be the only way to achieve high concurrency .
There is some passing mention of Erlang , but nothing substantial .
But what have we gained here ?
Validation of threads ?
Are n’t threads the road to madness ?
We can probably do better than just threads and synchronization constructs which themselves pose a substantial risk to program reliability .
With this background information it ’s easy to imagine a relatively annoying scenario with a {C , Cpp , C# , Java , Python , Ruby , Lisp , Haskell , damn - near - anything} program :
What happens when you write part of your system in a threaded manner ( because it was natural feeling , and that ’s not a necessarily a dirty instinct , as supported by the paper in qualm three ) but then need to extract this threaded functionality because it needs to handle more concurrency or be made network - accessible to work over multiple machines ?
Generally you get to rewrite a lot of code to fit into the SEDA diagram , including re-writing threaded code to be event - driven and network - accessible , which also means having to take care of the network and protocol issues .
Do n’t forget to having to update your old code to use the event - driven version , a painful affair if you used synchronization constructs .
Your only alternative to these rewrites is to defensively program everything with the intention of being event - driven which will only waste a lot of time and make your program less efficient unless you provide even more code to do shared - memory interactions as a secondary mode ; otherwise , you will be stuck doing lots of serialization / serialization to interact with stuff on the same machine .
Let ’s not even mention that code that could have been handled more gracefully with context switches rather than event handling will end up being maddening to write and more opaque than one feels it should be .
Welcome to Tartarus , enjoy your stay .
So now we finally talk about Erlang .
Erlang attacks a lot of these problems on many fronts including in its implementation , syntax , and semantics .
Yet , people seem to be unfazed by the idea of re-inventing Erlang ’s wheels when it comes to Erlang ’s choice application domain , and I suspect a large part of the reason for this is that most people who are vaguely aware of Erlang and its reputation do n’t know what wheels have already been invented in Erlang .
Included in those are some wheels that they probably have n’t thought of yet when starting out and could use to assist implementation , others are wheels ( some quite elaborate ) that they ’d be forced to implement , test , and maintain on their own otherwise or suffer from something painful .
Here is a list of some of the more important things that came to my mind that you get “ for free ” for using Erlang :
A generally expressive syntax that reduces the amount of code from somewhere between one tenth and one forth of the roughly equivalent code in C/C + +[ 3 ] .
Error density was seen to be about the same , so that also means about a fourth to a tenth of the number of bugs .
A virtual machine that itself supports kernel event polling ( at least under Linux ) to allow you to easily handle tens of thousands of persistent connections ( such as TCP streams ) modeled with a simple one - context - per- connection abstraction [ 4 ] .
This is not the default and can be enabled with “ + K true ” when starting the “ erl ” interpreter .
The overhead of a process is 318 machine words .
A virtual machine that can efficiently automatically handle SMP ( at least under Linux ) and distribute processes between nodes
Semantically simple process - oriented concurrency ( which avoids a lot of bugs seen with shared - state threads ) with high - speed message passing and process scheduling ( how else could it handle 80,000 processes ? ) , thanks in large part to no-mutate language semantics
Extensive heap sharing between processes to avoid message copying , once again from no -mutate language semantics .
( used the “ - shared ” switch )
This is not the default behavior : otherwise , per-process heaps and full - copies are used to maintain short GC pauses for real - time applications
Network - transparency between processes , even when passing higher - order objects like closures ( !)
Some of the more “ leaky ” abstractions made for performance such as ETS or process tables that allow for mutation can have opaque continuation returns that cannot be serialized in this way .
In any case , it ’s in a very small minority .
Node and process monitoring and restart strategies to allow you to write robust , idiomatic , fault - tolerant programs
Automatic transitive closing of Erlang nodes for maximum reliablity / message passing speeds as well as ( when that full - connectivity is impossible ) message routing between intermediate nodes .
Pattern - matching of several data types .
Not only the obvious tuples , but also for binary streams , largely eliminating temptations to use inefficient ASCII - based wire protocols .
Distributed synchronization constructs
Safe local and global name registration
A powerful distributed database , MNesia
Code hot - swapping
Application versioning and packaging support
Metaprogramming using the AST , so Lispish - style macros exist .
NOTE : in Erlang parlance , this is called the “ parse_transform ” procedure .
“ Macros ” in Erlang lexicon refer to something more like the C preprocessor .
Generic constructs for common tasks : finite state machines , event - driven ( for when they are the most natural model ) , and the ever-useful and flexible “ generic server ” ( gen_server ) behavior .
A community that is focused on reliability , performance , and distributed applications
More community that is trying to give Erlang some more tools with “ general appeal ” such as a web application framework
Heavy documentation , both of the libraries and of methodology refined by twenty years of language development , research , and application
Let ’s revisit the scenario above , where you were stuck in Tartarus re-writing your threads into events and making them accessible via network , but now starting out with an Erlang code .
Once again , as before , some of your code which you had written using a process - oriented model has outgrown its britches and needs to be made scalable and concurrent .
The latter part of that is mostly taken care of for you : simply spawn a process for every work item , as you were before .
Thanks to the Erlang VM , your eight - processes turned eight - thousand are having no problem handling the flood of work and utilizing as many machine resources as as possible .
You do n’t need to coerce yourself into writing an event - based server , introducing bugs and obfuscating code as you go , a huge win already .
Now you get to worry about making things distributed , which is a little more complicated .
Your first attempt is to allocate some dedicated machines to running the code in question for more power .
Since message - passing is network - transparent , the changes to your code elsewhere in your application is minimal .
A send is still a send , whether across a network or on the same node .
You write some code to decide how to allocate those queries across these machine resources , which themselves may dynamically reallocate work , carrying along with it the process name to send the return message to to avoid centralized response multiplexing overhead [ 5 ] .
Ultimately some node in the cluster sends the response or the requester times out .
In many cases you are now done , you can just constantly add machines to this glob to get more power .
To spice up the story , let us suppose that you notice that there ’s a lot of state - passing going on to synchronize nodes that ’s just too network - intensive that was n’t a problem when this was a single - node solution , so you rewrite some of your code to pass a closure that contains instructions on how to update the node ’s state .
This means you just avoided having to write some sort of fancy differential state transfer procedure ; you ’ve simply told the node at the other end how to compute the new state from an old one by sending the procedure itself on the wire instead of the finished product .
Finally , if you had followed some of the OTP design principles [ 6 ] to begin with ( which is not uncommon , even when working in a single - node environment , they are exceedingly convenient abstractions ) and used the gen_server ( or likewise ) behavior you can get ( or might have already had ) a supervision tree going that ’ll make your application serving this stuff fight down till the last man .
And so ends our tale .
Do n’t make this glowing report make you think there are n’t difficulties here ; there definitely are real tangible downsides to Erlang , not the least of which is recruiting programmers , questionable string handling , and the somewhat - warty records .
It ’s also considerably slower than C when it comes to sequential computation .
However , consider that it is clearly not a toy , and that groups of programmers — not all of them Gods , I ’m sure — have employed it to process unfathomable quantities of our telephony data with nine nines of reliability [ 7 ] , all in two million lines of code [ 8 ] .
Erlang is an artifact designed with a purpose and a vision and will be difficult to best in technical merit in its chosen problem domain without embarking on a project of similar or greater scope .
Footnotes :
[ 0 ] : Gist : Erlang is more terse , has better degradation under high load conditions , better reliability .
You know , what you might expect against hand - rolled C++ that ’s significantly less complex and tested than Erlang ’s implementation itself .
( See Greenspun ’s Tenth Rule , except with the obvious reapplication )
[ 1 ] : Yet unfinished .
Actually , stalled for some other priorities .
The clustering part of it is done , the missing section is writing the appropriate bindings between the Erlang nodes and the Lisp process , as well as a job allocator to decide on how to allocate work to the nodes .
We also do n’t yet have a lot of machines to run this thing on , a circumstance that may change in coming months .
In the off chance that you are interested in contributing to a parallel , clustered knowledge base , let me know in the comments .

As opposed to full - blown Prolog style unification where everything is in terms of rules .
That is , you can say sum ( 3 , 4 , A ) and conclude A is 7 , but you can also ask Prolog sum( A , B , 7 ) , and constantly ask it for legitimate values of A and B , which it ’ll happily return for as long as you ’d like .
This is why a simplistic fixed - size Sodoku solvers in Prolog look just like articulating the rules instead of actually finding the answers .

An oft cited “ benchmark ” of sorts showing an Erlang web server , YAWS , vs. Apache , which uses pthreads .
Both of these servers are handing a trivial load — a slow “ GET ” request — so the main determination of who wins here is who is least choked by the massive number of requests .
Since Apache uses a pthreads based server it is largely limited by the operating system ’s threading implementation .
[ 5 ] : Notice the security problem here ?
Erlang by default will only communicate with other nodes with the same magic cookie , a simple and robust security mechanism to prevent “ messages from strangers . ”
In case you were wondering : message encryption in Erlang is supported in case you do n’t trust your link .
It ’s not as straightforward , but someone has written something about it .
[ 6 ] : See OTP Design Principles which discuss supervision trees , monitors , and links , among many other things .
Also see Joe Armstrong ’s Thesis ; it ’s easy to read and extremely informative as a perspective on writing reliable software , even if you are not writing Erlang .
[ 7 ] :
An article written by Armstrong .
He links to his thesis , but this is a little bit more conversational and brings out some highlights .
I have excerpted the relevant portion for lazy clickers :
Does it work ?
Yes .
Erlang is used all over the world in high - tech projects where reliability counts .
The Erlang flagship project ( built by Ericsson , the Swedish telecom company ) is the AXD301 .
This has over 2 million lines of Erlang .
The AXD301 has achieved a NINE nines reliability ( yes , you read that right , 99.9999999 % ) .
Let ’s put this in context : 5 nines is reckoned to be good ( 5.2 minutes of downtime / year ) .
7 nines almost unachievable … but we did 9 .
Why is this ?
No shared state , plus a sophisticated error recovery model .
You can read all the details in my PhD thesis .
[ 8 ] :
In case you thought this was a piddly amount of code , a paper pegs the equivalent amount of C/ C++ code at somewhere between four to ten times as much code to get the same stuff done .
This is not a extraordinary claim considering Erlang ’s advantages in automatic memory management and functional programming constructs such as the ever - useful map ( ) .
This is a huge win , despite what some people try to tell me …to be explored in a future blog post which I have tentatively named in my head “ Verbosity is a valid complaint ! , ” or something like that .
The father , from Nigeria , told the boys he inflicted the injuries because God had his tongue cut off in the Bible , a jury at Bradford Crown Court was told .
The Bradford man , who cannot be named , denies charges of unlawful wounding and cruelty between 2003 and 2005 .
The boys ' mother also denies charges of cruelty during the same period .
Caroline Wigin , prosecuting , said the mother would watch , or turn a blind eye , as the father carried out the injuries .
Foster carers
The boys ' injuries were discovered in February 2005 when a school friend of the older boy , now aged 13 , noticed bruises on his body during a PE lesson , the court heard .
Miss Wigin said the boy told a learning mentor that his father beat him five to six times a week .
The boy 's younger brother , now aged 11 , was questioned and told the school he had been assaulted the previous night when his father swung a pole at him , causing cuts to his fingers .
A medical examination revealed injuries consistent with the boys ' stories , Miss Wigin said .
The boys were subsequently placed with foster carers .
' Scalpel used '
Miss Wigin said : " [ The older boy ] told his foster carer how safety pins had been put through their top lips , tongue and bottom lip , then they had to sit still and not move .
" A scalpel had been used to slit their lips and inside their mouths .
Their father had then sewn them up with a medical kit that he had . "
Miss Wigin added that the boy said his father " spoke about God in the Bible having his tongue cut off " as an explanation for why he carried out the injuries .
When interviewed , both parents , who have two other children , denied the boys suffered any serious injuries .
The trial continues .

Patients seeking an appointment with a dermatologist to ask about a potentially cancerous mole have to wait substantially longer than those seeking Botox for wrinkles , says a study published online today by The Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology .
Researchers reported that dermatologists in 12 cities offered a typical wait of eight days for a cosmetic patient wanting Botox to smooth wrinkles , compared to a typical wait of 26 days for a patient requesting evaluation of a changing mole , a possible indicator of skin cancer .
“ The difference in wait times between medical dermatology and cosmetic dermatology patients is clearly real , ” said Dr. Jack S. Resneck Jr. , the lead author of the study and an assistant dermatology professor at the medical school of the University of California , San Francisco .
“ We need to look further and figure out what is leading to shorter wait times for cosmetic patients . ”
In Boston , the median Botox wait was 13 days , versus 68 days for a mole examination .
In Seattle , the median Botox wait was seven and a half days , compared to 35 days for a changing mole .

When Lawrence Summers suggested that biology might be partially responsible for the relative rarity of female mathematics professors , he was provoking an academic giant .
Powerful as the president of Harvard may be , his influence is as nothing compared with that of the behemoth that is the women ’s studies movement .
The field of women ’s studies originated in the heady sixties and grew exponentially through the seventies and eighties .
By the mid-nineties , when Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge published Professing Feminism , their searing critique of the field , more than 600 undergraduate and several dozen graduate women ’s studies programs were up and running at colleges and universities across the country .
The intellectual cornerstone of women ’s studies is “ gender , ” the notion that differences between men and women are not rooted in biology , as Summers had hypothesized some might be , but are cultural artifacts , inculcated by an oppressive patriarchal society .
Precisely because the gender idea builds a specific ( radical ) political orientation into the field , Patai and Koertge point out , women ’s studies proved intellectually suspect from the start .
You can read that radical politics right in the National Women ’s Studies Association constitution : “ Women ’s Studies . . . is equipping women to transform the world to one that will be free of all oppression . . . [ and is ] a force which furthers the realization of feminist aims . ”
True justice for these radical feminists means overcoming gender and establishing an androgynous society .
So when Summers asserted that something besides artificial cultural roles — something besides “ gender ” — might account for the distinct positions of men and women in society , he was undermining the intellectual and political foundation of the entire women ’s studies establishment .
The alternatives to feminist orthodoxy do n’t end with Summers - style invocations of biology as destiny .
Take psychiatrist Leonard Sax ’s new book , Why Gender Matters : What Parents and Teachers Need to Know About the Emerging Science of Sex Differences , for example .
Sax begins by arguing that variations in how boys and girls learn result from brain biology .
But , unlike many believers in hardwired sex differences , he goes on to argue that we can triumph over biology through single - sex education .
If we teach boys and girls separately and in sync with their biologically based learning styles , he claims , they will perform equally well in all academics , including math .
There ’s also a fourth possible view on the relations between sex and success — one that no one has systematically articulated to date .
If those who assert biological differences between the sexes disagree about whether we can overcome them , the same might apply to those who assert the power of cultural differences .
Even if we do provisionally hold that virtually all differences between men and women are cultural , might it not also be true that those differences are impossible to overcome ?
If so , it would n’t be “ gender ” but the feminist effort to eliminate it that is truly oppressive .
This fourth view suggests that the very same cultural forces that make feminists desire androgyny may actually prevent us from achieving it .
The cultural sources of “ gender ” difference , properly understood , would then inform us not that our gender identities are infinitely malleable but that they ’re effectively impossible to change .
Sociologists have thought long and hard about the cultural “ reproduction of society ” — the transmission of deeply held cultural attitudes across the generations .
Some social thinkers focus on the conscious transmission of cultural messages through religion and custom , while others highlight the influence of deeper social structures , such as economic organization or family forms .
The most sophisticated feminist theories of gender — those that offer the most plausible alternatives to biological explanations — take the latter view .
To explain the reproduction of gender differences , they zero in on family structure , especially during the first months and years of life , to a time when the way we care for children is far more important than the words we speak .
A case in point is the work of psychoanalytic sociologist Nancy Chodorow , a women ’s studies pioneer who gives flesh to a radically “ cultural constructivist ” idea of gender .
Nearly every feminist plan for engineering a new , androgynous society — from the “ egalitarian feminism ” of political theorist Susan Okin to the “ difference feminism ” of developmental psychologist Carol Gilligan — offers a variation on Chodorow ’s themes , so it ’s worth considering them closely .
Chodorow hypothesizes that the differences between the sexes simply derive from the contingent circumstance that women happen to be the primary caretakers of children .
The special , “ feminine ” empathy required for rearing children , she suggests , becomes indelibly associated in our minds with people who just physically happen to be female .
Identifying with their daughters , moreover , mothers tend to stay tightly connected with them for years , drawing them into a circle of mutual dependence and empathy that is the essence of femininity .
So it ’s not television ads or Barbie dolls that turn little girls into caring women , who themselves want to be mothers .
It ’s the emotional closeness of mothers and daughters that perpetuates the conventional female sexual role for generation after generation .
Boys learn their gender lessons early , too , Chodorow maintains .
Since traditional mothers assume that boys are different from girls , early on they tend to encourage their sons to be independent .
As mothers begin to push their sons out of the warm circle of empathy , boys get the message that people with Daddy ’s kind of body should act differently from the way Mommy acts .
If they want to be men , boys learn , they ’ve got to overcome the qualities of emotional empathy of people like Mom .
Masculinity thus finds its ground in a rejection of “ feminine ” qualities .
If we could just break the association between gender and child care , thinks Chodorow — if men as well as women could “ mother ” children — then we might vanquish gender .
Men and women would still have a few distinct body parts , of course , but “ masculine ” and “ feminine ” personality differences would no longer have anything to do with bodily equipment .
No one would assume that only people with a certain kind of body should be caring and empathic .
The speed with which a child became independent would no longer depend on whether it was male or female .
A new era would dawn .
Yet even if this understanding of gender as learned behavior is right , androgyny proponents quickly run into a problem .
As Chodorow herself underscores , mothering by women produces women who themselves want to be mothers .
The mechanism at work may be social and psychological , rather than biological , but it ’s no less real for that .
How , then , do you get women to mother less and men to mother more , especially when , according to Chodorow , everything in a typical male ’s early rearing makes him wrong for the job ?
Plato faced this dilemma when he drew up history ’s first great plan for a perfectly just society in the Republic — a society that required , among other things , androgyny .
His solution : send the members of the old , imperfect city into exile , so that the new , just city could be built from scratch .
Otherwise , their recalcitrant mental habits would sabotage the creation of the new order .
The fact is , attempts to force a society out of its most deeply held cultural values can be every bit as tyrannical as schemes to override our biological nature .
But what if a society actually existed — not just a theoretical utopia — whose inhabitants yearned for androgyny ?
What if a society existed whose citizens , motivated by a burning passion for perfect justice , committed themselves to a total reorganization of the traditional family system , with the express purpose of eliminating gender ?
Such a society has existed , of course : the early Israeli kibbutz movement .
The movement was n’t just a precursor to modern feminism , it ’s important to add .
The kibbutzniks were utopian socialists who wanted to construct a society where the ideal of “ from each according to his ability , to each according to his needs ” would govern the production and distribution of goods .
It was as part of this larger socialist vision that the kibbutzniks set out to wipe away gender .
Kibbutz parents agreed to see their own children only two hours a day , and for the remaining 22 hours to surrender them to the collective , which would raise them androgynously ( trying more to “ masculinize ” women than “ feminize ” men ) .
Boys and girls would henceforth do the same kind of work and wear the same kind of clothes .
Girls would learn to be soldiers , just like boys .
Signs of “ bourgeois ” femininity — makeup , say — would now be taboo .
As if they had stepped out of Plato ’s Republic , the children would dress and undress together and even use the same showers .
The experiment collapsed within a generation , and a traditional family and gender system reasserted itself .
Why ?
Those who believe in hardwired natural differences obviously would say that cultural conditioning could n’t remove the sexes ’ genetic programming .
Indeed , in his now - infamous conference remarks , Lawrence Summers invoked the history of the kibbutz movement to help make his case that biology might partially explain sex roles .
Feminists , though , say that the kibbutz experiment did n’t get a fair chance .
However committed to gender justice the kibbutzniks might have been , they were all traditional Europeans by upbringing .
Somehow they must have transmitted the old cultural messages about gender to the children .
Perhaps , too , those messages came from the larger Israeli society , from which it was impossible to shelter the boys and girls entirely .
What ’s more — and Chodorow would doubtless emphasize this fact — the kibbutz child - care nurses were all women .
A 50/50 male - female mix might have done the trick .
Yet American androgyny proponents rarely refer to the kibbutz experiment — for understandable reasons .
Its failure — even if you accept their own cultural explanation for it — puts a serious damper on the idea of androgynizing America .
In the U.S. , after all , there ’s nothing remotely approaching the level of commitment to surmounting gender found among the early kibbutzniks .
If androgyny proved unattainable in a small socialist society whose citizens self - selected for radical feminist convictions , how could one bring it about in contemporary America , where most people do n’t want it ?
It would take a massive amount of coercion — unacceptable in any democracy — to get us even to the point where the kibbutzniks were when they failed to build a post - gender society .
The best account of the experiment ’s breakdown , offered by anthropologist Melford Spiro in his books Gender and Culture and Children of the Kibbutz , points out an even bigger obstacle to androgyny .
Ultimately , Spiro argues , the kibbutzniks did n’t succeed because the mothers
wanted their kids back .
They wanted to take care of their young children in the old - fashioned
way , themselves .
Two hours a day with their kids was n’t enough .
Even among the kibbutz founders , Spiro notes , women often agonized over the sacrifice of maternal pleasure that their egalitarian ideology demanded .
He quotes from one mother ’s autobiography : “ Is it right to make the child return for the night to the children ’s home , to say goodnight to it and send it back to sleep among the fifteen or twenty others ?
This parting from the child before sleep is so unjust ! ”
Such feelings persisted and intensified , until collective pressure forced the kibbutz to let parents spend extra time with their kids .
Spiro holds that a pre-cultural form of
maternal instinct subverted the kibbutz ’s child - rearing approach .
But a plausible cultural
explanation is even more devastating to feminist hopes for a gender - free America .
What really defeated androgyny on the kibbutz , this interpretation posits , was the profound tension built in to the very culture of modern democratic individualism that the kibbutzniks embraced — the tension between liberty and equality .
As part of their insistence on their unique individuality , the kibbutzniks recognized the unabridgeable unique individuality of everyone else .
Hence , their insistence on radical equality .
Full equality meant that everyone had to treat everyone else the same way .
Even the differences between my children and the neighbors ’ kids would have to go .
They pretended that their children belonged to the collective — “ child of the kibbutz , ” they would say , not “ my child . ”
But the other side of democratic individualism is the idea that each of us is uniquely individual .
And inseparable from this individualism are certain aspirations — to express yourself personally , and to treat yourself , your possessions , and your family differently from how you treat everyone else .
Child rearing does n’t escape these aspirations .
In fact , in modern societies people pay far greater attention to the unique characters of their children than people do in traditional , group - oriented societies .
Lavishing intense , personal attention on their kids is a favorite way for modern individuals to exercise personal liberty .
Kibbutz mothers who hoped to treat everyone the same thus also wanted to express their individual characters by molding their own kids .
The two goals — reflecting the two sides of modern democratic individualism — were finally incommensurable .
Eventually , the desire for personal expression trumped the quest for radical equality .
The parents decided to raise their own kids in their own way .
No one ever got the chance to find out if further tinkering might have eliminated their children ’s gender differences .
The culture of democratic individualism characterizes contemporary America , too , of course , and it still cuts two ways .
Feminists insist on radical equality , and androgyny is the logical outcome of that drive for equality .
Yet at the same time , especially since the baby boomers came on the scene , many American women have treated the experience of motherhood as an exercise in self - expression — indeed , they do so more fervently than the kibbutzniks .
A modern , self - expressive , committed - to - full - equality American mother might know that her child is getting quality care from a relative , a nanny , or a nursery , but she ’ll often feel dissatisfied , since the care is n’t hers .
Part of the point of being a parent , she ’ll feel , is to express one ’s unique personality through how one cares for and shapes one ’s children .
In practical terms , she ’ll be reluctant to give up her kids long enough to break the cycle of “ gender reproduction . ”
True , the last 40 years have seen tremendous changes in the social roles of men and women — changes that could never have happened were there not significant flexibility in gender roles .
From the standpoint of feminism ’s ideal of androgyny , though , the shift is still very partial .
Until the link between women and child rearing completely breaks down , neither corporate boardrooms nor Harvard professorships of mathematics will see numerical parity between men and women .
In the meantime , in disproportionate numbers , at critical points in their careers , women will continue to choose mothering over professional work .
From either a biological or cultural point of view , then , the feminist project of androgyny is ultimately doomed .
But that does n’t mean that it ca n’t do harm in the meantime .
In America , many boys are slipping behind in school ; their sisters are significantly more likely to go on to college .
Yet thanks largely to the influence of academic feminists , legal and educational resources still flow disproportionately to supposedly victimized girls .
In the end , gender wo n’t disappear , whatever the mavens of women ’s studies hope , but the careers of some bright young men probably will .

Comet works , and it ’s easier than you think
I gave a talk this morning at the Yahoo !
Web Developer Summit on Comet , cometd and Bayeux .
I ’ve been trying to keep up with Comet ever since Alex coined the term last year , but it ’s only in the past few weeks that I ’ve actually found some time to play with it myself .
I was very impressed with what I found : the open source infrastructure for building and deploying Comet applications is surprisingly mature , and with just a few more improvements I can see Comet achieving much more widespread use .
Comet is an umbrella term for any technique that allows a web server to “ push ” events down to a browser .
You can think of it as an alternative to Ajax polling , with the benefit that events are relayed in almost real - time and “ wasted ” requests ( when nothing has changed ) are massively reduced .
The name does n’t stand for anything ; it ’s named after an American kitchen cleaner ( a joke on Ajax ) .
When you consider the hacks involved in getting Comet to work across the four major browsers it ’s miraculous that it works at all .
In the talk I tried to illustrate the insanity with examples of browser hacks , mainly to show how totally absurd it all was .
But while the solutions are mostly pretty terrifying , the fact that we ’re dealing with JavaScript ( rather than CSS ) means that we can abstract all of the nastiness away , ready to be replaced later on when browsers start introducing native support .
Abstracting away the nastiness until the browsers catch up is something of an unofficial mission statement for the Dojo project , so you wo n’t be surprised to hear that Dojo offers excellent support for Comet .
The Bayeux protocol
For me the most exciting Comet development is the invention of the Bayeux protocol .
Bayeux defines a standard protocol for Comet clients ( both browsers and others ) to communicate with a dedicated Comet server , using a simple but powerful publisher / subscriber architecture based around the concept of named channels .
Clients can connect to a Bayeux server , subscribe to one or more channels , and then publish messages targeted at a channel .
The server ’s job is to relay those messages to all clients subscribed to that channel .
There are a number of things to like about this setup .
Firstly , it means that all of the difficult parts of Comet ( relaying real - time messages , coping with huge numbers of simultaneous connections ) are kept separate from your regular architecture .
You can keep developing and deploying applications in your preferred framework ( Django , Rails , PHP on Apache or whatever ) while the Bayeux server sits there as essentially a black box — clients can subscribe to it and you can use it to publish messages all without needing to customise the Comet server at all .
If the Bayeux server implementation you chose does n’t work out for some reason you can swap it straight out for something else that supports the same protocol .
The one thing missing from Bayeux at the moment is authentication .
Out of the box , a Bayeux server will relay messages to a specific channel from any client to any other set of clients .
This is an obvious flaw : if you ’re running a site where events such as “ a new comment has been added ” are broadcast out via Comet , you do n’t want just anyone to be able to imitate such messages and have them sent to all of your subscribed clients .
Right now , Bayeux leaves it up to the individual servers to figure out how they will deal with this .
I ’d like to see the specification address this directly as without it a Bayeux server is n’t much use in a real - world environment .
Getting started with Comet
If I ’ve piqued your interest , the good news is that getting started with Comet is really , really easy .
All you need is a running server that supports the Bayeux protocol .
I tried out a number of options , but the first one that worked straight out of the box was Jetty 6.1 , a Java web server that uses continuations to achieve high concurrent performance .
Here ’s how to get Jetty up and running in a few easy steps :
Download Jetty 6.1 ( the first version to include a cometd implementation ) from www.mortbay.org.
Install Maven , a free build tool for Java ( the download page has installation instructions ) .
Unzip Jetty ( you can put it anywhere ) .
cd jetty - 6.1.6/ contrib / cometd / demo mvn jetty : run — the first time you run this it will download a bunch of dependencies and then start up a Jetty server on port 8080 .
Navigate to http://localhost:8080/
and you should see an index page linking to a number of Comet demo applications .
Once you ’ve played with the demos , building your own application is almost as easy .
The code for the bundled examples lives in jetty - 6.1.6/contrib/cometd/demo/src/main/webapp/examples
— I simply created a copy of the entire chat directory and started building my own experiments from there .
Using dojox.
cometd
If you look through the source of the chat application , it quickly becomes apparent that most of Comet boils down to just three methods :
dojox.cometd.init( comet_server_url ) initialises a connection to the given Comet server .
The Bayeux handshake protocol is used to establish the most appropriate Comet method for the connecting browser ; you do n’t have to worry about the details of the Comet connection at all .

dojox.cometd.subscribe(’/ channel’ , callback ) subscribes a callback function to a named channel .
Any time a message is sent to that channel the function will be called .

Any time a message is sent to that channel the function will be called .
dojox.cometd.publish(’/ channel ’ , json_object ) sends ( publishes ) a new message to a named channel .
The message can be any valid JSON data structure .
There are a few other methods relating to batching requests and disconnecting from the server , but the above three make up the bulk of any Comet application .
A Comet slideshow
In preparation for my talk I decided that I ’d try to present my slides using a small Comet application .
I ended up building a very simple slideshow tool — I exported my Keynote presentation as a sequence of images , then wrote a Comet client that listened for “ show this slide ” messages and another client ( a master , which acted as my presenter view ) that could publish those messages .
You can see a screenshot of the master client on Flickr ; in addition to “ next ” and “ previous ” buttons it also shows a small preview of the upcoming slide .
The code for the client application ( which I had running on the main projector screen , and also encouraged the audience to load on their laptops ) boiled down to just a few lines of code .
Here ’s the slideshow client in its entirety :
dojo.require ( " dojox.cometd " ) ; j Query ( function ( $ ) { dojox.cometd.init ( " http://example.com/cometd " ) ; dojox.cometd.subscribe(" /slideshow/change " , function ( comet ) { $ ( '#currentSlide ' ) .attr( ' src ' , comet.data.src ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
The master client was only a little more complicated , due to the need to keep track of the full list of slide URLs ( non-sequential , to discourage the audience from skipping ahead ) as well as display the preview .
That said , the core Comet functionality was wrapped up in a single function :
function publishSlide( src ) { dojox.cometd.publish( " / slideshow / change " , { ' src ' : src } ) ; }
The entire application took less than an hour to put together , which I think is a testament to the quality of the Bayeux implementation present in both Jetty and Dojo .
The future
Before taking a detailed look at Comet , my assumption was that the amount of complexity involved meant it was out of bounds to all but the most dedicated JavaScript hackers .
I ’m pleased to admit that I was wrong : Comet is probably about 90 % of the way to being usable for mainstream projects , and the few remaining barriers ( Bayeux authentication chief amongst them ) are likely to be solved before too long .
I expect to see many more sites start deploying Comet powered features over the next twelve months .

Could it signal the beginning of the end for globalization ?

This development shows a couple of things :
First , from lower enlisted soldiers to three - star generals , the Army is clearly no longer interested in Mr. Bush ’s war .
Second , unlike the mercenaries of Blackwater , this shows that the Army officer corps cannot be bought off by Mr. Bush ’s cronies .
Now , if I ’m a Republican , this latest op - ed piece really freaks me out .
Because if I ’m a Republican ( especially one in the Senate ) , I ’ve been arguing since Friday that General Sanchez ’s criticisms of the Bush administration are irrelevant because he did n’t " resign " in protest to tell us how he felt .
For instance , two days after Sanchez verbally savaged the Bush administration , Senator John McCain
said Sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but " unfortunately , that does n't happen very often . "
And this is very funny that McCain would say such a thing on Sunday , especially considering that on Tuesday , 12 Army officers who had resigned their positions after serving in Iraq would speak out along similar lines to those of General Sanchez .
I wonder what Senator McCain will say now .
In fact , I really wish him , McConnell , Graham , and the rest of them the best of luck in spinning this .
Because they ’re going to need it .
This is the best way to sum it up : The Department of Defense is saying to its officers , " We will pay you $ 35,000 bonuses if you keep fighting in Iraq . "
And in return , the officer corps is saying , " We are not mercenaries .
We do not want your blood money .
And we no longer wish to be involved in your insane war . "

WASHINGTON , Nov. 6 — The Senate Judiciary Committee this morning endorsed the nomination of Michael B. Mukasey to be attorney general , virtually assuring his confirmation by the full Senate .
The vote was 11 to 8 , with two Democrats , Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York and Dianne Feinstein of California , joining all nine Republicans on the panel in backing the nominee .
The close vote in Mr. Mukasey ’s favor , with 8 of 10 Democrats voting against Mr. Mukasey , had been expected , given public statements by committee members leading up to today ’s meeting .
Senator Herb Kohl , Democrat of Wisconsin , had been the one Democrat not to announce his decision before today , and he voted “ no . ”
Mr. Kohl said he was troubled by the nominee ’s statements on the interrogation technique known as “ waterboarding , ” or simulated drowning .
“ As Judge Mukasey ’s answers mirror the president ’s on this issue , and defy common sense , we are forced to question his independence as well , ” Mr. Kohl said .
“ The attorney general ’s loyalties must be to the Constitution , to the American people , and to the law .
Too much doubt on this point is disqualifying . ”
Although I 've taken the rest of the year off , I wanted to share a few fun classics this week .
The Abstract Candidate was originally published on 2006 - 08 - 24 , and seems to fit so well with today 's earlier article ...
When I first shared the story of Paula and her Brillant Java Bean , there was a bit of a mixed reaction .
Many readers simply could n't believe it : there 's no way that someone like that would ever get hired in the first place .
Some of the female readers ( 3 out of the 7 total , I believe ) , felt it was a bit sexist : come on , one of the worst programmers ever , and she just happens to be a girl ?
Well , let me assure you that , yes , people like that do get hired and , no , only a small percentage of them are women .
In fact , not only do people like that get hired , but they 're often hired by the best of us .
Like Shawn Edwards , for example .
Early on , Shawn 's company decided to use the Expresso web framework to develop applications .
It seemed like a great idea at the time : the framework was solid and had a name that fit in really well with Java 's whole coffee theme .
The only problem was that , being one of the lesser - known frameworks , most developers had no experience with it .
That meant that when they needed to expand their programming team , they would have to extrapolate a bit .
They figured that , if a candidate had experience using some of the 6,221 similar web frameworks , then he could learn the one that they used .
Plus , they had a backlog of simple web applications that a new employee could do as on - the - job training .
After going through several candidates , they came across Mark , who seemed to be as perfect a fit as they could hope for .
Not only was he familiar with several different frameworks , including ( I believe ) Barrista and CaMaLE ( Cappa - Mocha - Latteccuino Enterprise ) , but with his fifteen years of programming experience , he whizzed right through their technical interviews .
Mark was hired .
They gave him a one - page web form to implement and three weeks to do it .
They figured that he could use the time to learn the environment , learn the framework , and to ask a lot of questions .
And ask questions he did .
All the time .
Now , asking a lot of questions is n’t so bad in and of itself , but Mark kept asking the same questions , over and over and over again .
And they were fairly basic questions , too :
How do I connect to source control ?
( 5 times )
How do I access email ?
( 3 times )
What does " abstract " mean in the Expresso framework ?
( 4 times )
It was starting to seem that Mark was n't making a whole lot of progress .
Of course , this was apparent to Shawn after hour five or so , but their manager insisted that Shawn was jumping the gun and needed to give Mark a few weeks .
And they did ; at the end of those weeks , they asked him to commit to source control what he had .
Shawn took a look at the code and noticed that it was almost entirely stuff that he dictated to Mark or had typed as a demonstration of what he should be doing .
He went right back to the manager .
Concerned that he was being somewhat emotional about the situation , the manager suggested that they wait another week or so and revisit .
The following week , Mark came into Shawn 's cubicle looking exasperated .
He had been trying to compile some new code and just could n't figure out why neither Eclipse nor the Java compiler liked it .
Shawn followed him to his workstation and found the following .
public abstract class HomePage extends BasePage { try { public abstract Integer getCount ( ) ; public abstract void setCount ( Integer int ) ; } catch ( Exception e ) { // catch ( Exception e ) } }
Shawn immediately reported this to his manager and his manager finally agreed that this would be a problem .
He vowed to take immediate action .
And that he did : Mark was let go by the end of the following week .
The governor blamed arsonists trying to damage his reputation
The General Hospital in Maiduguri was built in 2006 but the state government refused to open it until the president came to cut the ribbon .
Several surgical theatres , the intensive care ward , and the clinical section which held millions of dollars of equipment were all destroyed .
The president was due to visit the hospital next month to open it .
Borno State Governor Ali Modu Sheriff blamed the fire on arsonists who wanted to damage his political reputation .
The governor had refused to open the hospital , which was ready for patients in June 2006 , until former President Olusegun Obasanjo came to the state .
There is not one hospital owned by a state government that has the type of world class equipment we had in there
Ali Modu Sheriff ,
Governor of Borno state
His visit was postponed several times , the last being just two months before the election in 2007 .
His successor Umaru Yar 'adua was due to visit later next month .
Borno was recently hit by a measles outbreak that killed hundreds of children across three states .
Existing hospitals in Borno are poorly equipped and overcrowded .
Angry residents of Bulunkutu , where the hospital was situated , gathered around the burned hospital and shouted abuse at the alleged arsonists , local papers reported .
The governor addressed the arsonists through the media .
" There is not one hospital in the country owned by a state government that has the type of world class equipment we had in there .
It is their people that would have benefitted , " he told reporters at the scene .
There are so many major , seismic shifts in the computing industry happening at the 32nm process node that it 's hard for me to get my mind around it all .
I 've been covering the story of x86's journey into the ultramobile and embedded space , a journey that starts at 45nm and really gets interesting at 32nm , but that tale is only one thread in a much larger epic that 's emerging bit by bit in one press release and news story after another .
For instance , take this week 's announcement that Toshiba is now joining the parade of semiconductor companies who 've looked at the $ 4 billion or higher cost of a 32nm fab and decided against going it alone .
The Japanese semiconductor giant will be joining IBM 's fab alliance at the 32nm node , bumping the number of alliance members ( excluding IBM ) up to six .
IBM and Toshiba had previously been cooperating ( along with Sony ) on research for the 32nm node , so the pair 's newly announced agreement to join forces on 32nm bulk CMOS fabrication is really just an extension of their previous research partnership .
Nonetheless , it 's an agreement that takes one more major party out of the running at 32nm .
For the real scoop on this IBM - Toshiba announcement and what it means for the semiconductor industry , there 's no way that I can top Dave Manners 's blog entry on the topic , so I wo n't even try .
I do , however , want to zoom in on one fascinating part of the post , which explains quite a bit of what 's driving Intel and others into commercial competition with the OLPC Project .
Finally , for everyone with a 32nm fab there 's going to be a new problem .
If 450 mm wafers are adopted , and the companies which buy most of the world 's manufacturing equipment are pushing hard for 450 mm manufacturing equipment to be developed , then there 's the problem that only seven fabs will be needed to make the world 's total demand for transistors .
Manners develops this point in terms of its implications for fab equipment buyers , but I want to take it in a different direction and dwell for a moment on what it means for an Intel or an IBM if only seven fabs can meet the world 's ( presumably current ) demand for transistors .
( I 'm not sure where Manners got this number , but it sounds feasible and I trust that it 's legit . )
If the combination of a 32nm feature size and a 450 mm wafer size increases fab output to the point that only seven fabs are needed to meet the total world demand for transistors , there 's only one way for the semi industry to see growth in such a scenario : increase demand .
This is why Intel would like to see every school - age child , farmer , factory worker , day laborer , and so on from San Francisco to Siberia suddenly discover a pressing need for lots and lots of transistors .
The vast bulk of the history of computing up until the present day has been about moving semiconductors from the server room to the business desktop , then from the business desktop to the first class cabin , and then from first class into coach .
At this point , everyone who can afford a cheap plane ticket or a pair of Nikes is already wired to the gills with transistors , and the major bottlenecks in getting those folks to buy even more of them are mostly out of Intel 's control ( i.e. , screen size / quality , battery life , connectivity , usability ) .
To see real growth in the coming decades , Intel , AMD , and the rest of the semi industry must focus on markets where an iPhone would cost a month 's income , and then on markets where it would cost a year 's income .
This is the reality behind Intel 's and AMD 's interest in the device category that OLPC represents .
It 's the reason why Intel has teams of anthropologists running around rural China , and why AMD launched its 50x15 plan .
So when you 're trying to imagine how the computing industry will look in ten to fifteen years , you have to forget about the BlackBerry set almost entirely .
The bulk of the market will shift from those people , who will remain a very profitable niche , to consist of people who are n't currently all that wired .
Or , to put it another way , when I was out in rural San Salvador two years ago , every cinderblock home had a transistor radio and a color TV .
If I make that trip again in 10 years , I 'll find that that color TV has been replaced by a device that has at least the horsepower , connectivity , and functionality of the MacBook Pro from which I 'm filing this report .
And depending on how " green " that ubiquitous , post - 32nm computer is , we 're either headed for a networked Nirvana or an ecological nightmare .
Hence the focus from semi companies on " green technology , " a focus that goes hand in hand with selling transistors to the great , unwired masses .

Petey is ... flatulent .
To an extreme degree .
Now , I know a lot of you out there are saying , " Hey , my dog ( husband / boyfriend ) farts all the time , so what 's the problem ? "
I do n't know how to explain it , but the best way to describe Petey 's gaseous expulsions is with this word : " heavy " .
Like a dense fog settling on the mountains , Petey 's farts will settle in the lower 3 ' of the room -- about the altitude I inhabit while asleep .
Thus , I fear that he may kill me ( accidentally , I hope ) in my sleep .
Let me explain how the routine ( when you go through this about 100 times a day , you make a routine ) works : - I'm in bed , innocently typing on the computer when I hear it : " FFFWWWWWPPPPPP " - I look over at Petey , who was asleep next to my bed , and he is now fixated on his butt , with a look of confusion and wonder ( " What was that !?
Where did it go ? " ) .
- Petey looks up at me ( no doubt wondering if I saw the little creature that he thinks ran out of his butt while he was n't looking ) , and , after taking in my terrified gaze , thinks that he has done something HORRIFYING and he must move away from me before I yell at him .
- Petey jumps to his feet as I throw my comforter over my head to prevent my eyes from watering due to the noxious gas .
In his attempt to slink out of the room unnoticed , he has shaken his intestines , which , in response , proceed to expel gas with his every step .
In his mind , lots of little butt - dwelling critters are escaping , foiling his stealthy exit .
I have yet to break it to him that he is n't stealthy at all , with or without the butt - dwelling critters .
-Hearing him exit the room , I crack the window behind my bed and shove my head out .
3 minutes later , I am in the clear .
I shut the window and continue on with my work -- shaken , but alive .
( At times I will get up to find him in another room , intently staring at his butt in hopes of catching one of those pesky critters . ) I live in fear .
These are SO BAD that I actually wake up in the middle of the night .
Please , does anyone have any sort of home remedy ?
I 've changed his food , stopped giving him rawhide , tried to eliminate tasty treats that I know cause gas in humans ( cheese , anyone ? ) -- everything I can think of , but my life is still on the line !
I am a student , so money is tight , please keep this in mind !
Thanks !
The lighting industry says that the latest bulbs do not flicker
The Migraine Action Association says members have told them how fluorescent bulbs have led to attacks .
The government is set to prevent the sale of conventional light bulbs within the next four years in a bid to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
Concerns have already been raised by epilepsy charities about an increased risk of seizures from energy - saving bulbs .
We would ask the government to avoid banning them completely , and still leave some opportunity for conventional bulbs to be purchased
Karen Manning
Migraine Action Association
Some bulbs use similar technology to fluorescent strip lights , and some users have complained that there can be a " flickering " effect .
They use approximately a quarter of the energy of conventional bulbs , and in September , Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said that a voluntary agreement with retailers would remove all conventional bulbs from the shops by December 2011 .
However , Karen Manning , from the Migraine Action Association , said this could be damaging to some sufferers .
She said that up to six million people in the UK suffer from some sort of migraine attack .
" These bulbs do trigger migraines for some of our members - it 's either the flickering , or the low intensity of the light , causing eye strain .
" We would ask the government to avoid banning them completely , and still leave some opportunity for conventional bulbs to be purchased . "
Old technology
However , the Lighting Association , which represents bulb manufacturers , said that the latest energy - saving bulbs did not produce a flicker .
A spokesman said : " A small number of cases have been reported by people who suffer from reactions to certain types of linear fluorescent lamps .
" These were almost certainly triggered by old technology . "
Last year the charity Epilepsy Action reported that a small number of people with the illness could have seizures triggered by low - energy bulbs .
Journalist John
Hand revisits his alma mater
It 's easy to be flippant about flipping burgers at the world 's biggest fast food chain .
Health aficionados dismiss the food you prepare , conditions in the industry are far from glamorous and the uniform is guaranteed to deter anyone with an ounce of sartorial sense .
But as a teenager trying to scrape my way through sixth - form and then journalism college , my three years as a part - timer at McDonald 's in Luton taught me many valuable lessons about life .
YOU GET OUT WHAT YOU PUT IN
If you see a job as meaningless , it will become meaningless .
Plenty of my colleagues did just that , making it much easier for me to shine .
Within weeks I had the full complement of stars on my badge and was gradually given more managerial responsibilities - training colleagues , stock - taking , cashing - up , even leading shifts with 20 - 30 colleagues .
That 's a fair bit of responsibility for a 16 - year - old who 'd previously done nothing more challenging than a paper round .
FAMOUS EX - WORKERS

McDonald 's serves up ' diplomas '
It is notable that those who have positive things to say about the McDonald 's working experience are those who threw themselves into it , without any cynicism .
That means caring deeply about the company 's four central tenets - quality , service , cleanliness and value .
I understood the sound business principles behind asking " Is that a large ? " or " Do you want fries with that ? " , so did n't feel at all self - conscious about chanting the then - obligatory mantras at every customer .
I 've since learned I was in good company .
Andrew H Card , otherwise known as President Bush 's chief of staff between 2001 and 2006 , has spoken glowingly of his time at the Golden Arches .
" I enjoyed the challenge of adding up the bill before it could be punched on the cash - register buttons , " he wrote in an article for the Wall Street Journal .
" It was n't long before I became a shift leader and then the night manager .
Boy , did I learn how to manage ! "
EVERY SECOND COUNTS
The comfortably - salaried may sneer but I found there was always something very honest about a job with an hourly rate where you had to clock in and out , even for ( unpaid ) breaks .
Timing was everything .
There was a premium rate on offer for working beyond 2300 but under - 18s had to stop at midnight , so there was an acquired art to getting that all - important " 00:00 " stamp on your timecard .
As the hours clocked up , they brought a very useful part - time wage .
When the time came to leave for a " proper job " in journalism , it actually brought with it a cut in pay .
THERE ARE ALWAYS OPPORTUNITIES
HISTORY OF ACCUSATIONS
Paid low wages Discouraged trade union membership Sent employees home during quiet periods Attempts to control minutiae of workers ' actions
Certainly , its ceaseless global expansion gives adventurous employees a chance to see the world .
Shortly before my A - levels , I was given the chance to temporarily decamp to Russia to help train staff at the company 's first store in Moscow .
The catch was that I would have had to take intensive Russian lessons .
I managed to learn a shameful three words before realising my ambitions lay this side of the Baltic sea .
CHECK YOUR TRAINING IS SOUND
Another key lesson I 've taken with me from those teenage years at the hot grill is to ensure you take your lead from more than one person .
I had an ever - enthusiastic trainer who just told me to " follow what I do " .
The fact that she was left - handed and I was impressionable enough to heed her words exactly was a deadly combination .
It was only after a fortnight of agonisingly slow burger - flipping and bun-dressing that I worked alongside another colleague who put me right , in more ways than one .
Since then , I 've always had the nous when trained how to do something to check whether there is a better or quicker way of completing the job .
RESPECT THE WORLD AROUND YOU
Our store in Luton was in an area with a very large Muslim population , and was one of the first McDonald 's outlets to experiment ( albeit briefly ) with offering halal meat .
I was also on a workforce made up of colleagues of various races , religions and ages .
I first learned about the observance of Ramadan through colleagues who had to time their meal breaks accordingly .
And as a 16 - year - old occasionally managing the work of people sometimes two generations older , I learned that mutual respect is the most important tactic to get the best work from any colleague .
IF THERE'S TIME TO LEAN , THERE'S TIME TO CLEAN
Every spare minute was spent wiping down another surface or mopping a floor , all with the aim of ensuring there was less of a cleaning slog to get through once the final customer had departed .
I also learned quickly that " Ajax is a verb " , in the endless pursuit of shiny , never streaky , stainless steel surfaces armed only with a cloth and the eponymous cleaning substance .
PLAN AHEAD ... BUT ONLY BY 10 MINUTES
MCDONALD'S EDUCATION 67,000 UK staff 75 % proud to work at company Spends £ 15 m a year on training in UK 80 % of managers started as hourly - paid crew members 20 % of franchisees started as crew Average tenure for manager is 10 years Source : McDonald's
Food which then went unsold for more than 10 minutes had to be thrown away so anyone who panicked and overestimated how many Big Macs the post - football crowd would consume risked the wrath of a target - aware manager .
A salutary lesson in household management if ever there was one .
YOU'LL NEVER BE THE NEW GUY FOR LONG
Some things never change and McDonald 's , like many employers of a similar nature , has always had to contend with high staff turnover .
At least that always meant we had a newly - gullible victim who could be instructed to polish the traffic lights outside the store or count the ice cubes in the ice machine .
The high staff turnover is often used by critics as an indication of low staff morale at McDonald 's but the feeling among many of my colleagues was that we were on our way to other careers - I can count a tax inspector and a detective among my former co-workers .
ALWAYS WEAR THE RIGHT SHOES
Health and Safety might frown on such behaviour in these more enlightened times , but I kept a pair of shoes with especially slippery soles for my shifts behind the McDonald 's counter .
With them , I could glide at speed around the restaurant floor and deliver orders at ( near ) breakneck speed .
They became my secret weapon as I whizzed into the final of Till Person of the Year ( held at the country 's busiest store on the busiest Saturday before Christmas ) .
I did n't win but I 'm sure those shoes are still around somewhere any time I need to react to some fast - breaking news .
No matter what you think of McDonalds , surely coming out of the job with some form of qualification that can be used to get another ( better ) job must be a plus .
John Fielder , Workington
My 2 weeks at McDonalds when I was 16 , were probably the worst 2 working weeks of my life , however I do now respect the fact that it's an extremely hard job to do , day in day out .
I do n't think the general public realise how much work actually goes into getting their burger from the grill to their stomach !
Jay , Northampton , England
This is so true !
I am always saddened when I meet people complaining about ' pointless ' jobs - I never worked in McDonalds but I have done every lowly office role you can think of when temping as a student and I learnt so much that has stood me in good stead in my career , mostly about the way offices work , about office politics and how to treat people .
Zoe , Bristol , UK
I agree with the respect point wholeheartedly .
I remember going into a McDonald 's just before closing having had a hungry day , and asking what was ready , and specifically if they had any fries left .
They did n't , but because I 'd made a point of being aware that they all wanted to close up and go home , they made me some fresh .
Emily , Loughborough
My first real job was with MacDonald's , as a shy retiring teen , it forced me out of my shell and gave me the social and life skills that schools do n't really get the opportunity to teach .
Laura , Horsham
McDs was my first real job where i worked my way up to a Area Manager ( floor manager )
The skills i learnt i have taken with me to my other jobs and i will always remember how to ajax and deploy CAYG !
Katie , Leamington Spa
I could have written that article myself - it was like a trip down memory lane .
Who can forget Ajax ?
As I am about to move on my career , I glance back at those heady student days earning £ 2.70 / hour at Maccie D's .
Those days were great life learning days , you deal with all walks of life and learn so many different jobs and the real value of proper hard work .
I particuarly enjoyed the kids parties , what a great way to get paid , having a jolly good laugh of a Sunday afternoon ! - and no , nobody dresses up as Ronald McDonald .
The best thing :
You meet friends for life and experience a camaraderie like nowhere else ... happy times !

Working for McDonalds does so much good for young people .
Perhaps everyone should have the experience and then maybe they would see the job more respectfully .
Like National Service , McDonalds teaches young people plenty about the real world , something everyone needs to learn .
Mark Ladson , Hull , England
I agree wholeheartedly with all the comments .
As a starting ground for youngsters , this gives them an insight into a good and dedicated working environment and teachers and all round , muck in and get on with it mentatility .
jeanette thompson , Surrey
I only lasted half a day at MCDonalds , so I admire anyone who can stick it out !
It 's a harder job than it looks .
It 's physically challenging and the tills and menus can be quite complicated .
Emily , London
Most people who work at McD 's do n't want a career in fast food restaurant management but it is a good stepping stone to other things .
It is the modern equivelant of the paper round .
Any job can be seen as meaningless , and where would all those who sneer get their burgers from anyway ?
jacquie , yorkshire
There will always be lower waged jobs , which are taxing in many respects , but there is a difference between those with value ( e.g. working in a care home , caring for those that need it ) , and those that are valueless ( e.g. working in McDonald 's , feeding those that do n't need it ) .
Nick , Brighton , UK
I agree whole heartedly and have often mentioned my time at McDonalds as a great grounding .
I have gone on to have a successful management career in another business , but the lessons I learnt as a teenager have remained useful to this very day .
Scott , Aberdeen
Been a restaurant owner for over 20yrs , do n't under value such " so call " pointless jobs , for a 15 - 17yrs old , this is their first taste of learning a real social and communication skills , learn to deal with customers and colleagues , those skills they learnt at this early age will help them as they work in thier later life .
Tony Chan , Darwen , Lancs , UK
I quite agree .
All jobs are boring sometimes , doing them as well as you can , and putting 100 % effort in makes the day go quicker , gives you a better relationship with colleagues and customers and will always lead to better things .
Linda
Linda O'Connor , London England
I worked in McDonalds as a teenager and learnt a lot about teamwork , working under pressure and above all that I wanted to get some qualifications and not have to do that for the rest of my life .
That said , they were a fair employer and I was grateful to have a flexible part time job whilst I studied !
I am fed up with people slagging off " Mcjobs " - at least people who work there are n't sponging off the state !
GOOD ON THEM .
Emily , London
This highlights to me that anyone evev if they start working McD 's at 16 can carve a career for themselves .
Mc 'D 's undoubtly provide a spring board into employment / career which can be siezed upon if the individual wants to grab it .
It 's all a question of the work ethic and the application thereof .
The problem is what percentage of todays 15 - 18 year olds have this ethic ?
I 'm not going to even try and predict this figure .
I 'll leave it to the individual to make their own judgement .
Simon Marsden , Manchester
The fact that training in the workplaces can lead to qualifications is a good thing , as it will help people who , for whatever reason , do not want to study at college or university to get their skills accredited .
Karl Chads , London , UK
I work at pizza hut and i find that you get out what you put in , you have to work for anything in life i just wished that pizza hut offered the same A - Level qualifications .
Jay , Leeds
I cant understand why people would critisise working in McDonalds - it is one of the biggest and most successful companies in the world .
You can learn loads about business and the working environment and one of the most valuable things for young people is to learn how to work with people from all walks of life .
What is important is that we dont confuse vocational education , which is about learning a skill , with academic education , which is about broadening our horizons and leaning to apply oneself as much as it is about gaining knowledge .
Justin , London
I worked in a store for 4 and a half years , wWorking my way up from Crew Member to Manager whilst putting myself through University and am always proud to say I did it .
Is it the most glamorous job ?
No , but it 's decent hard work and so many young people could benefit from that nowadays .
Like every job it had it 's ups and down but the crew were one of the hardest working I 've ever known and also one of the happiest .
David , Northampton
I 'm sixteen and do currently have a part - time job at McDonalds , combined with my Sixth Form education .
I 've been there roughly 8 months now , and am loving every minuite of it .
I hate it when my peers look down upon McDonalds , they fail to realise how valued the " McJob " is .
I can name a few people who 've moved onto bigger and better things from McDonalds , a philosiphy teacher at a university to name but one .
Anyway , McDonalds should n't be looked down upon , it gives young people vaulable lessons in life , and the world of work , something that schools simply can't offer .
I 'd reccomend it to any sixteen year - old looking for a job .
Tom G , Carmarthenshire
I spent 3 miserable years in McDonalds .
The Misery was caused by jumped up idiots who thought they were gods gift to management forcing horrible tasks on you with impossible timescales to do them in .
I will never set foot in one again , not even if I was about to soil myself !
Tom King , Sheffield
I worked in McDs during 6th form , moved branches while doing my degree then was welcomed back to my old branch while looking for a ' proper ' job .
And I had a great time !
It was really hard work & the hours were rubbish but was definitely character building .
I agree with Laura - you came across people you never would in your everyday life & were the better for it .
Jackie , Cheshire
started at 89p / hour , back in late 70s and moved on to a successful career in management , on my recent visit to India gave some advise to failing restaurant manager , spoke to him about QSC p.s. still remember the temparature of the filet o fish fryer .
( sad i know )
theguj , London
I worked whilst I was at College , and when I saw the accusations list it immediatally reminded me of when I worked the , pay was 20 p above minimum wage at the time , but when the NMW went up , wages did n't .
I 'll always remember management when I was talking about trade unions and joining one , only to be told " you 're not allowed , it 's written in your contract . "
Granted it was a franchise store , which from my experience lets the standards slip .
Jamie Smith , Great Yarmouth
I whole - heartedly agree !
I never worked at McDonalds but had equally ' lowly ' jobs as a teen - ager and throught Uni .
I fully recoginze that these jobs were some of the most important and formative experiences of my youth .
These days I see younger people coming to work without ever having had a job before and really lacking in a good attitude and work ethic .
Sol , New York
Well said , John .
A very demanding place to work , but excellent experience .
' Do n't relax when you can ajax ' and the clarion call of ' Cheese on till 6 ' when a pretty girl in the queue was spotted - great memories !
Paul , Glasgow
Spot on !
Just because these are jobs that people snobbishly dismiss as beneath them , it does n't mean that McDonalds can't be a rich learning environment .
I learnt a lot when I spent part of my Gap year working in a KFC restaurant , some of which I refer to 12 years later in my current marketing career .
If we can develop customer service to something approaching the standards of countries like the US then Britain will be a much better place .
Andrew , Surrey , England
I agree with Mark of Hull , McD's is like National Service .
It 's dangerous , pointless , it 's an oppotuinity for those with money to get those without to do cruddy work they do n't want to and you get the chance to be shouted at .
Working for a company such as Mc D's teaches you nothing about the real world as it exsists purely in its own bubble , even employing its own lexicon of terms " Hamburger Univesity " ?
ah yes that well known redbrick institution , that bastion of academia .
If you ignore Mc D's it will go away .
J Leigh , Brighton
We may all snigger at the idea of a qualification from McDonalds but at least they are trying to give their employees some form of reward and a way to better themselves .
Similarly we should applaud those who want to take on the responsibility of a job and achieve more than one star on their badge , rather than going out and causing mayhem or being unemployed !!
Jo , Barnet
I currently work at Mcdonalds and have done for the past year and a half .
And it has to be said that the experience you get from working at Mcdonalds depends on how your store is run .
If the people your work with then the job is enjoyable but if you do n't get the training you want and see no real promotion prospects , your managers do n't enforce the rules and lead by bad examples then your job becomes chaos and unloveable .
Im not lovein it :(
David Collett , Blackpool
I echo the author 's sentiments , I had three years part - time , albeit in KFC , and learnt a lot about customer skills , time management and stock management .
Mel Gibson started out at KFC too , I 'll have you know .
Jonny Bung , London
There are no perfect jobs .
A job is what you make it .
If you choose to have a good attitude and do your best whether mopping floors , flipping burgers , or answering phones , you will be satisfied .
Satisfaction comes from a job well done .
jenni , Basingstoke
I 've been a part - timer at McDonald 's for 5 years now whilst doing my own A - levels and first 3 years at university , and it has to be said that McDonald 's training is very good , they use various learning techniques and the training courses for the managers , which I followed too 4 3 years ago , are pretty rewarding .
It 's unfair to discriminate against these valid forms of education just because of the company 's name .
Mark P , Cambridgeshire
Am a little bit older now and would like to think doing pretty well , travel the world , have an excelletn job that I enjoy .
But my first job was at McDonalds and it saw me through the 6th form and uni .
I have to say I enjoyed it , I met some great people all in a similar position to me trying to scrape our way through college .
But one thing for sure it made me respect hard work and business values .
I will always respect anyone who works in the ' fast food industry ' as who knows that person could be a doctor of the future .
Infact at my store there was a number of students from med school !!
Alistair , London , UK
When I worked in recruitment , I hired a lot of 18 - 22 year olds .
The difference in the ones who'd worked in McDonald 's was striking .
They were keen , polite , enthusiastic , customer - focussed and wanted to learn .
I would n't fancy it myself - or any kitchen job , to be honest - but it clearly gives a good grounding .
David , Glasgow
None of the above " lessons " make McDonalds special .
You can get all of that from any honest work .
Often without having to peddle greasy rubbish .
Personally , I only enter their premesis to use the loo .
Pete Nightingale , Reading
Agree with every point made .
I spent 3 years from 16 - 19 , and followed the similar path of crew member - trainee manager , however opting out for opportunities elsewhere .
Its fantastic grounding for a massive range of different careers .
I still find time to defend the place to this day , usually when talking to people who did n't have to get a part - time job , and base all their opinions on the negative press .
David , Leicester
I 'd rather work in any other place than a fast food joint .
I do n't want to be providing the poor with even more rubbish food .
You can learn these skills in any part - time first job .
Rebecca , London
I 'm 18 and I work part - time in McDonalds .
I have an unbelievably busy life and McDonalds give me the flexibility I need .
They also give me time off when I need it and extra shifts in holidays .
It 's hard work and customers can be horrible but it's an experience everyone should have .
I 've made some really good friends at work and learnt some skills I 'll always need .
And I 'll never forget CAYG and how to Ajax correctly !
Chloe , Northumberland
In Romania in the 90s McD 's recruited graduates who could speak English and fast - tracked a lot of them to management .
This was a great stepping stone for many - a fast way to learn western business management .
One of them , a close friend of mine went on to work in several western banks as they opened in Romania , and now manages a large city branch of one of Romania 's largest banks !
So there can be great value in using this sort of work in gaining experience - and now hopefully recognisable qualifications
Mark , northumberland
WOW !!
What a well researhed writing , very impressed !
Totally understand the slippery shoes , and till person of the year !!
I left 9 years ago , and feel that McDonalds should be part of the curriculum , fantastic training , fantastic lesson in life , loved every bit of it , every hoodie should have to do it , ( and do it with meaning )
Loved the article , long live McDonalds ( although have to admit , have banned the kids from eating it !!!!)

I work at McDonalds in Burgess Hill and I really do agree with everything that has been written here .
Working there is such a laugh and it prepares you for working with loads of different ethnicity groups .
Which not only has helped with my Sociology A level so far it's also going to help when I do Theology and Religious Studies at University .
I think that because of the way that we 're trained and how atriculate everything is , most other leaders of a company would hire us simply because we 've been trained so well .
Our managers at Burgess Hill are excellent , and all of them but ( apart from 1 ) have risen up through being at Burgess Hill .
Sometimes you can come across rubbish managers , but our managers have always got the know how and they are managers for the right reasons .
The other day a new employee tried to outsmart one of them about it being " fast food " ... cutting a long story short , the manager knew his stuff and just made sure that he won the " argument " in an encouraging way .
Edward Graham - Hyde , Burgess Hill
I 've had some unglamourous ' dead end ' jobs in my time - cleaning public toilets , scrubbing pots etc - but none worse than McDonalds .
Maybe I had a bad branch but I found the ' values ' a total sham , along with any concept of hygiene and quite frankly knowing what goes into the food means I have not touched any of it since !
I fully agree with the comments above about jumped up idiot managers .
( eg - burn from fry , I was told to ' put a pickle on it ' )
A horrible , horrible place to be !
Nicki , Edinburgh
I worked in McDs as a student .
I made the mistake of being the best burger flipper in the store so I spent pretty much every shift getting covered from head to toe in grease down one side of me .
So I never got those stars but it was a decent enough place to work .
Steve , London
" IF THERE'S TIME TO LEAN , THERE'S TIME TO CLEAN " Found out that 's not quite true when it 's 7:30 am , you 've only had to serve 2 customers and there 's absolutely no cleaning needing to be done .
The only thing of any value I learnt from my time at McD 's is that management types do n't always automatically qualify for your respect .
They still have to earn it .
William Forbes , Middlesbrough , Britian
I worked for McDonalds when I was 16 for four weeks .
I was so exhausted working long shifts that I needed 2 weeks recovery .
The job is extremley stressful and the pressure is so high in serving as many customers as you can .
Big resepct for those BIG MAC providors !
Abigail , Bangor
I spent 2 years while at 6th form working at mcdona ;ds before going on to train to be a nurse .
before my time there i was a shy retiring would n't say boo to a goose kinda girl and it gave me confidence to mix in other circles and with people .
i enjoyed wortking there as i made lots of friends and had a good social life .
i also progresed up the ladder and had a respect for the work ethic they employed at the time .
( this was late 80's ) there were a lot of students there as well so i think that helped .
i was asked to stay on a go to hmaburger uni but declined as did n't want a career in fast food and i do n't regret that .
although i now do not eat in Mcdonalds due to ethical reasons , i do think that i learnt alot from them .
so if they are offering ' A ' level type qualifaications is only a good thing as like the articel said if you think something is meanigless it willbecome so .
pauline , bristol
I used to be rather flippant myself , until my girlfriend told me what she had got out of her experiences at McDonalds .
Her story is almost identical to that in the article .
Of course , they tried to retain her but she chose years of studying , a PhD and medical research instead .
Perhaps though it is a sad indictment of the public policy towards medical research in the UK that only now , nearly a decade and a half on , have her earnings are finally catching up with what she would have earned had she chosen a career in fast food .
Is it any surprise that there are n't enough people working in science , looking for those breakthrough medical treatments we are demanding .
That said , knowing what I know now , I would n't knock a career with McDonalds !
Richard , London
I worked in McDonalds when back when I was 16 and in sixth form .
My training was rubbish .
I had some polish guy who barely spoke english training me .
He did n't know what he was doing himself .
Half the other employees that were there were idiots who were in the bottom of the class or were expelled .
Within a week of working there , I was immediately promotod to a Team Leader .
After about another couple of weeks I was eventually promoted to manager with the promise that I had a brilliant career in the fast food industry .
McDonalds was rubbish .
My experiance proves that any idiot can qualify as manager in McDonalds .
I Highly doubt that any self respecting company would take seriously a diploma from McDonalds .
Ed Jenkins , Exeter
I worked at McDs for about 3 weeks when I was 18 during a student vacation .
Truly dreadful .
My local store was managed by small - minded people with enormous egos and no management talent .
I switched to catering in Pontins and that was probably the most enjoyable job of my life despite having a professional , well - paid career now .
Happy days .
DJ , Southport
I lasted 2 days at McDonalds before deciding to quit ; it 's a demeaning job where the staff are regarded as nothing more than meat to the grinder .
Kudos to anyone who can survive in that madhouse , but there 's no real lesson ( working there ) which can't be learnt in any other part time job .
alan , Glasgow , Scotland
I worked for Mcdonlands when i was sixteen .
Previously homeless and having gone through some forms of social accomodation and with a very low outlook on life .
The job was , to this day , harder than any job including tree surgery i have had since .
The respect it taught me for myself , pride in my work and belief in others reaching their abilities can never be in question .
All the lessons i learnt at Maccy ' Ds i have carried with me and now i own my own company .
These grades can only be a good thing .
Regardless of your feelings of the brand this is positive for youths of today and for business and ultimately the country .

View from Iran has always been a very attractive blog for me .
An American blogger based in Iran writes about her daily experiences in the land of “ down with America ” .
Tori Egherman , the American blogger , has now left Iran .
She and her husband have just published a book of photos and essays about their four year experience living in there .
I spoke to her about her blog , book and real and virtual life in Iran .
Q : Would you introduce yourself , your blog and your book ?
For the past four years , I lived in Iran where I found myself in need of creating new identities for myself .
Online , I became Esther Herman , the American who wrote the blog View from Iran and for Mideast Youth .
To others , I remained Tori Egherman .
My husband and I spent almost four years living in Tehran where we struggled with day - to - day issues , the problems of running a small business , and got to know his family better ( he had spent his entire adult life in the Netherlands and in the US and had not seen the bulk of his family for almost 22 years before we went to Tehran ) .
Our blog started as a way for us to communicate with family and friends and soon became a more public forum .

Here is a book of essays and photographs that Kamran and I took while we were in Iran .
The photos tell the story of our experiences there and present an Iran that can be hard to imagine .
Kamran and I were interested in the public aspects of daily life in Iran .
Many books deal with historical Iran , beautiful Iran , and ethnic Iran .
Ours is a look at day - to - day Iran .
( Click here for a Flash presentation of the book )
“ A stranger in Tehran ”
Q : How was it to be American and live in Iran where “ down with America ” is almost it 's state slogan ?
I can count the times I was made to feel uncomfortable about being an American on one hand .
The Iranians I met were just so unfailingly polite and kind .
Everywhere I went , people were genuinely excited to meet an American .
During my stay in Iran , I met Iranians from all walks of life : from the religious to the secular to the revolutionary and everything in between .
During that whole time , I met one person who scared me .
When I told Kamran that the guy scared me , he said , “ That guy ?
That guy scares everyone , so do n't worry .
It 's not because you are American . ”
One time my husband , a British friend , and I travelled to Bandar Abbas : an ethnically Arab part of Iran near the Persian Gulf .
“ I am not going to tell anyone that I am American , ” I told Kamran and our friend Kate .
The chaos that ensued after the US attack on Iraq made me nervous about revealing my nationality to Arabs .
At the airport , we got a taxi .
The driver , quite predictably , asked Kamran where we were from and Kamran answered , “ Our friend is British and my wife is American but she wants me to tell everyone that she is from Canada . ”
The driver laughed , explained that we were all brothers and sisters , and then launched into an anti-regime complaint .
So the only time I decided to be Canadian instead of American my talkative husband foiled my plans .
There are many people in Iran with anti-American sentiments , and my husband Kamran met quite a few of them .
The thing you have to understand is that in Iran hospitality almost always trumps ideology and belief .
I always say that hospitality is Iran 's first religion .
If I did meet people with anti-American sentiments , they would have repressed those feelings rather than insult me .
That said , I hate the “ Down with America ” chanting .
I remember watching Iranian pilgrims at Mecca raising their fists and chanting “ Down with America ! ”
When I would complain , my Iranian friends would say , “ It means nothing , why does it bother you ? ” I told them , “ When I go to religious services , we do n't chant “ Down with Iran ! ” .
We do n't go into the streets to chant against your country . ”
It 's a different world .
In Iran , these kinds of slogans have very little weight .
In America , they mean a lot .
Taxi Talk
Q : In view from Iran you have a category called “ taxi talk . ”
Can you explain it a little bit ?
We , like many people in Iran , did not have a car ( or a driver ) .
Everyday , Kamran and I took at least two taxis .
Sometimes more .
Sometimes we took private taxis and sometimes the public taxis .
Public taxis have a set route and pick up passengers along that route .
In both cases , you could find yourself involved in conversations on a myriad of issues : politics , society , culture , sports , health …
A friend of ours speculated that Iran 's taxis were a kind of informal polling system .
Drivers will tell you that one in three of them works for intelligence .
Most people I met in Iran would confirm this figure .
While one in three might be high , there is no doubt that many drivers do report to intelligence services .
The taxis are an informal network that is , in many ways , Iran 's most effective communication net .
Rumors and news are discussed , jokes are passed around , juicy bits of gossip come out .
During the recent crackdown on women 's dress , for instance , the taxi drivers were the ones with the most information .
They knew where women were being spoken to gently ( but firmly ) and they knew where women were being physically harassed .
Blogs humanize Iran
Q : How do you evaluate blogs influence in Iran ?
The main influence of blogs is to allow people to have a forum for ideas and experiences that cannot be discussed in public .
In Iran , there are few opportunities for public discussion or and for meeting strangers and making new friends .
The blogoshpere has offered this opportunity to many Iranians .
I think that their influence on the political sphere in Iran itself is limited .
On the other hand , I think the blogs offer a valuable insight into Iranian life for people living outside of Iran .
They humanize Iran .
Image vs. Reality
Q : Do you think in the West , do we have an accurate image of Iran ?
Do you think blogs can play a role to make a bridge between west and Iran ?
No I do not think that we have an accurate image of Iran .
I do think that blogs can play a role in linking the two .
I would caution that Iran is an extremely class - based society .
The Iranians I met seemed to use their own experiences of Iran to extrapolate about the whole of Iran .
Here is a story that exemplifies this :
It is common for travelers to meet Iranians who say something like : “ In the West you think we are a country of deserts and camels .
We are not .
You wo n’t see camels in Iran or very much desert . ”
Well the fact is , much of Iran is desert and there are wild camels living all over that desert .
I 've seen them !
Iranians tend to travel in Iran to see family … they rarely break out of their own social class or social circle , and they believe that everyone else in Iran shares their views .
Q : Do you see any similarity between Iranian blogs and American ones ?
Yes !
Iranian blogs are amazingly diverse , just like American ones .
You have political blogs like Kamangir‘s , Abtahi‘s , even Ahamadinejad ‘s … our nieces and nephews in Iran read blogs about Harry Potter and David Beckham .
There are blogs from people of all walks of life .
Think , when Iraq had one blog ( Salaam Pax now blogging at Raed in the middle ) Iran reportedly had 70,000 !
Filtering Hurts
Q : Can you tell me the names of some English sites that get filtered in Iran ?
Many English sites get blocked in Iran .
My favorite , The Onion , is blocked .
I think that is so that Iranian reporters do not unwittingly use it as a source the way The Beijing Evening News once did .
A design site called Boxes and Arrows is also blocked .
I sent in protests every day for about a year , but the site was never unblocked .
Women 's health sites are blocked .
This , I am certain , is the accidental side effect of the regime 's over - protective filtering policy .
And even though most women 's health sites are blocked , you can still read Savage Love .
( do n't tell anyone though ;-) )
At our site , I have a list of a few of a few of the sites that were blocked when I tried to access them .
Just scroll down the to “ Filtered ” on the sidebar of the site .
Having heard this , I think it seems somewhat obvious in retrospect , but I met a smart conservative thinker last night who explained to me the conservative base 's fear about John McCain in understandable terms for the first time .
Basically , McCain or no McCain this still looks like a bad year for the GOP .
If he wins , it 's likely to be a personal win based on his persona and tarnishing Obama 's persona , in which the Democrats still pick up some House and Senate seats .
Next up , it 's governing time .
McCain 's not someone who enjoys a strong personal or professional relationship with John Boehner or Mitch McConnell , and he does n't owe any great debt to the GOP activist base .
Under the circumstances , it 's plausible to imagine him striking a bunch of compromises with Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi on domestic issue in order to get a freer hand with which to conduct foreign policy .
That does seem plausible to me .
On the other hand , it strikes me as an equally plausible story about Mitt Romney who had a much more substantial record of reaching compromises with a Democratic legislature .
But if you put a lot of weight on purely personality - driven factors , I can see the particular fear of McCain since by all accounts he just does n't like the Republican congressional leaders .
That said , a plausible story is just that , a plausible one .
Campaign promises are a very imperfect guide to governing , but they 're still one of the best guides we 've got .
The safest thing seems to me to assume that McCain more - or - less means what he says , and that if he wins he 'll govern on the platform he just ran and won on .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Gold was near an all - time high on Friday and platinum hit another record on dollar weakness , supply concerns , firm oil and expectations of more interest rate cuts in the United States .
Gold bars are displayed at the headquarters of Mitsubishi Materials Corporation in Tokyo January 9 , 2008 .
Gold surged 2 percent to trade above $ 900 on Thursday and platinum hit a historic high , as investors snapped up the metals on dollar weakness and firmer oil prices , analysts said .
REUTERS / Toru Hanai
Spot gold hit an intraday high of $ 913 an ounce , within sight of last week ’s record high of $ 914 an ounce , before dipping to $ 909.55/910.50 an ounce , still higher than $ 907.00/907.70 an ounce late in New York on Thursday .
Platinum hit another record high of $ 1,618.50 ounce on investment demand , gains in gold and after Lonmin Plc slashed its sales outlook for the year .
The metal was last quoted at $ 1,606 /1,611 an ounce in New York .
“ Platinum is confronted by a big supply and demand problem .
The price will be very strong in the future .
Within a month , the next price target is $ 1,650 , ” said Yukuji Sonoda , precious metals analyst at Daiichi Commodities in Tokyo .
Miners in South Africa , the world ’s largest platinum producer , have had to deal with electricity outages as power utilities struggled to keep up with rising demand .
Lonmin Plc , the world ’s No.3 platinum producer , cut its sales outlook for the year after first - quarter refined platinum output slid by nearly a fifth due to safety shutdowns and persistent processing problems .
Sonoda said expectations of further U.S. interest rates cuts , which have underpinned a recovery in stocks markets after a rout at the start of the week , have encouraged investors to buy commodities .
“ That ’s a very good environment .
By the end of June , gold will reach $ 1,000 , ” said Sonoda , who also expected more investors to shift to gold from government bonds .
Gold had tumbled to a three - week low of $ 849.50 on Tuesday as falling energy and equity prices forced investors to sell the metal to cover margin calls , but the Dow Jones Industrial Average has since recorded two consecutive days of gains on hopes for interest rate cuts and a fiscal stimulus package .
Fed policy makers are scheduled to meet on January 29 - 30 .
A hefty emergency rate cut this week boosted sentiment in precious metals .
“ Gold still has a chance to break a new high .
But if it ’s rising too fast , we may look for a correction .
After breaking the high , we may look at $ 950 , ” said Ronald Leung , director of Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong .
Gold could find solid support at around $ 908 an ounce on Friday and resistance was seen at $ 915 -- just above last week ’s historic highs , said Leung .
The benchmark platinum futures contract for December delivery on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange rose by its daily 120 yen limit to 5,350 yen a gram .
COMEX gold futures extended gains , with the most active February contract rising $ 4.6 an ounce to $ 910.4 .
Silver gained to $ 16.36/16.41 an ounce from $ 16.35/16.40 .
Palladium rose to $ 372.00/377.00 an ounce from $ 370.50/375.50 .
Screencast de Restful Rails Fácil !
2008 January 25 , 20:31 h
Eu queria explorar conceitos de Restful Rails no screencast .
Antes de mais nada , continuo recomendando o excelente tutorial do Geoffrey Grosenbach no Peepcode .
Meu screencast não tem perto do nível de qualidade dele .
Mas por outro lado como eu sei que muita gente não entende inglês suficiente bem para isso , resolvi gravar dois vídeos : uma versão em inglês e outra diferente em português com uma introdução maior aos conceitos do Restul do Rails .
Explicação
E eu enfatizo “ Restful do Rails ” porque muita gente torce o nariz quando se fala em Rails e REST na mesma frase .
A isso eu respondo : favor me indicar uma implementação melhor no Rails .
Enquanto só disserem “ não é tão bom quanto poderia ” e cruzar os braços , para mim , isso e nada é a mesma coisa .
A implementação do Rails é boa o suficiente para qualquer projeto .
O objetivo do Rails nunca foi 100 % , sempre foi 80 % , essa é a filosofia .
Vivam com isso .
Este screencast na verdade foca no plugin resource_controller do James Golick , um dos plugins mais interessantes que já vi .
É uma dessas grandes idéia que – quem sabe – talvez encontre lugar no Rails Core um dia , da mesma forma como as idéias do Sexy Migrations foram incorporadas no Rails 2.0 .
O conceito é que agora tratamos as ações de um controller de uma maneira mais ou menos padronizada ( pela abstração dos verbos HTTP ) , e isso poderia perfeitamente se refatorada para longe do dia - a - dia de desenvolvimento .
Então , em vez de ter o scaffold criando um monte de código repetido em cada controller , por que não ter um controller vazio – e ainda assim totalmente funcional - , para começar ?
Outra idéia esperta foi criar helpers dinâmicos para rotas nomeadas nas views .
Assim você pode mover suas views pelo projeto , e até reusá - los em diferentes seções sem ter que ficar copiando e colando diferentes rotas nomeadas entre elas .
Isso é particularmente útil em controller polimórficos e rotas com namespace como mostro nesse vídeo

By pledging his support of Kosovo ’s declaration of independence from Serbia , President George W. Bush has sanctioned the genocide of thousands of Serbian Christians in the Balkans and the creation , thanks to al Qaeda , of a radical Muslim state at the doorway to Europe .
After announcing their independence from Serbia on February 16 , thousands of ethnic Albanians ( Muslims ) took to the streets waving American flags and singing patriotic songs .
While the national press provided glowing coverage of these demonstrations as proof that the “ Kosovars ” were adamantly pro-America , few media outlets took notice that the demonstrations were preceded by the sacking of Christian churches and the burning of thousands of Serbian books .
But book - burning is the least of the sins of our new friend and ally .
The Kosovars have also sacked churches , raped nuns , and mass - murdered approximately 4,000 Christian Serbs in and around the town of Srebrenica and its adjoining towns and villages ( Bratunac , Skelani , Milici , et al ) as well as the town of Gorazde .
In a letter to Fatmir Sejdui , the president of the new “ republic , ” Bush wrote : “ On behalf of the American people , I hereby recognize Kosovo as an independent and sovereign state .
I congratulate you and Kosovo ’s citizens for having taken this important step in your democratic and national development . ”
He also pledged to increase the amount of foreign aid to the Balkan state from $ 77 million in 2007 to $ 335 million in 2008 .
Kosovo had formally remained a part of Serbia even though it has been administered by the United Nations and NATO since 1999 , when strategic NATO bombings ended the Serbian crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists .
Ninety percent of Kosovo ’s two million people are ethnic Albanian and Muslim — and they see no reason to stay joined to Christian Orthodox Serbia .
Despite calls for restraint in the wake of the announcement of Kosovo ’s independence , tensions flared on February 19 in northern Kosovo , home to most of the territory ’s 100,000 minority Serbs .
An explosion damaged a U.N. vehicle outside the ethnically divided town of Kosovska Mitrovica , where thousands of Serbs chanted , “ This is Serbia ! ”
The crowds in Kosovska marched to a bridge spanning a river dividing the town between the ethnic Albanian and Serbian sides .
They were confronted by NATO peacekeepers guarding the bridge , but there were no outbursts of violence .
Another 800 Serbs staged a noisy but peaceful demonstration in the Serb - dominated enclave of Gracanica outside Pristina .
The Serbs were not alone in their protests .
Former UN Ambassador John Bolton maintains that the creation of an independent Kosovo “ will give a boost to Islam extremism . ”
Bolton voices his agreement with Alekandr Botsan - Kharcenko , Russia ’s ambassador to the Balkans , who said : “ Any unilateral declaration of independence by Pristina [ capital of the new nation ] would not be legal and could trigger separatist movements in the world and could undermine international order and the structure of international relations . ”
A PRIMER TO THE PROBLEM
The turmoil in Kosovo began in 1989 when Slovodan Milosevic , president of Serbia and the Free Republic of Yugoslavia , set out to create a greater Serbia by annexing Kosovo .
When the Kosovo assembly approved this measure , ethnic Albanians ( the sanitized way of saying native Muslims ) rebelled .
In 1990 , Milosevic dispatched troops into Kosovo to squelch the rebellion and restore order .
In 1992 , the ethnic Albanians responded to this military measure by establishing their own government in Kosovo - - the Republic of Kosovo - - with self proclaimed pacifist Ibrahim Rugova as its president .
With two governments in one tiny country , the situation quickly became downright ugly .
In 1993 , Milosevic ordered the arrest of thirty ethnic Albanians for planning an armed uprising .
In 1995 , a Serbian court sentenced sixty - eight members of Rugova ’s government to prison for setting up a parallel police force .
BIN LADEN IN THE BALKANS
To aid in the struggle for independence , the ethnic Albanians turned to Osama bin Laden and the mujahadeen .
Muslim warriors from Chechnya , Egypt , and Saudi Arabia traveled in droves to Kosovo .
By 1995 , more than sixty thousand holy warriors , including members of al Qaeda , had made their way to the Balkans to prepare for the struggle against Milosevic and the Christian Serbs .
Bin Laden visited the area three times between 1994 and 1996 .
In the wake of these visits , al Qaeda training camps popped up in Zenica in Bosnia and Malisevo and Mitrovica in Kosovo ; elaborate command and control centers were set up in Croatia , Macedonia , and Bulgaria ; and a central headquarters for the mujahadeen was established in Tropje , Albania , on the property of Sali Betisha , the former Albanian premier .
In addition , Bin Laden provided seven hundred million dollars to establish the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) .
The purpose of the KLA was to drive Christian Serbs from Kosovo , to topple the government of Milosevic , to undermine the peace initiatives of Ibrahim Rugova , and to unite the Muslims of Kosovo , Macedonia , and Albania into the Islamic Republic of Greater Albania .
BILL CLINTON’S MUSLIM BRIGADE
By 1997 , President Bill Clinton , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , and Secretary of Defense William Cohen came to view the KLA as “ freedom fighters . ”
Millions in U.S. aid began to flow to the Muslim rebels .
America , unbeknown to its citizens , was now in league with the terrorists who were intent upon the destruction of western civilization .
Human history , going back to the tree - swinging apes , does not get much crazier than this .
By 1998 , the KLA became a formidable army of 30,000 highly trained troops with sophisticated weaponry that included shoulder - launched antitank rocket launchers , mortars , recoilless rifles , and antiaircraft machine guns .
From Tropje , the KLA began to conduct hit and run terror attacks throughout Kosovo .
They bombed police stations , killed scores of police officers and government workers , and desecrated Christian cemeteries .
Milosevic , in outrage , responded by burning homes and killing dozens of KLA foot soldiers in the Drenica region .
A full - scale conflict erupted , culminating in the infamous massacre of January 15 , 1999 , when the bodies of forty - five ethnic Albanians were discovered in a gully near the small village of Racak .
Confronted with the crime of genocide , Milosevic insisted that the bodies had been planted by the KLA to implicate the Serbs and to justify Western involvement in the conflict .
Milosevic ’s claims were supported by investigative journalists from Le Figaro and Le Monde , who discovered that the bodies had been placed in un-natural positions ; that the site of the so - called “ massacre ” was devoid of cartridge shells ; and that the villagers were unable to identify a single victim .
PUTTING THE SCREWS TO SLOBODAN
Convinced that Milosevic was engaging in ethnic cleansing , President Clinton summoned his NATO allies and began a bombing campaign that reduced Kosovo to a heap of rubble .
At the start of the campaign , Secretary of Defense Cohen said that 100,000 ethnic Albanians of military age were missing and may have been deported by the Serbs to Albania and Macedonia .
“ They may have been murdered , ” Cohen added .
Between March 24 and June 10 , 1999 , 37,465 bombing missions took place , destroying 400 Serbian artillery weapons and 270 armored personnel carriers , and causing 1.4 ethnic Albanians to flee for their lives - - the greatest mass migration of refugees since World War II .
Milosevic and the Serbs were forced to toss in the towel .
The accord of June 21 , 1999 ended the air strikes , eliminated the presence of a Serbian government in Kosovo , and authorized a NATO force of 1,700 police officers to establish law and order until democratic elections could be held .
But the situation in Kosovo was far beyond the capability of 1,700 police officers .
The ethnic Albanians who had fled for safety from the Serbs now returned with a vengeance .
A pogrom got underway in the Balkans , and neither Bill Clinton nor the United Nations uttered a word of protest .
THE REAL ETHNIC CLEANSING
The Muslims wasted no time in exacting their pounds of flesh .
More than two hundred Christian churches and monasteries were destroyed before the NATO peace - keeping force .
Some of these Christian shrines , including the Devic Monastery , the Cathedral of St. George , and the Monastery of the Holy Archangels , had been built in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries .
Reports surfaced of mass executions of Serbian farmers , the murders of scores of priests , the rape of nuns , and “ granny killings ” - - the drowning of old Christian women in bathtubs .
Of the two hundred thousand Serbs who lived in Kosovo before the conflict , only four hundred remained after Kosovo became a NATO protectorate .
The vast majority of the Christians had gathered their belongings and fled for their lives .
The 400 Serbs who remained in Kosovo were sequestered in three gloomy apartment buildings , where the international police stood guard day and night .
In the aftermath of the war , hundreds of Wahhabi mosques and schools , thanks to the contributions of wealthy Saudis , now appeared in every town and hamlet throughout the country .
The back - door to Europe had been pried open by bin Laden and the mujahadeen for the drug trade and the movement of weapons of mass destruction .
MILOSEVIC WAS THE MUSLIM’S PATSY
In 2000 , NATO dispatched forensic teams from fifteen countries and eight human - rights organizations into Kosovo to find the killing fields and evidence of Milosevic ’s crimes against the ethnic Albanians .
Mass murder is difficult to hide .
One need only recall the entry of war - crime inspectors into Nazi Germany , Cambodia , and Rwanda to understand that the execution of thousands of people leaves behind massive and undeniable evidence for the world to see .
But the bodies of the ten thousand victims of Milosevic ’s “ reign of terror ” were nowhere to be found .
The claims of the Clinton administration were based on flawed intelligence from the CIA .
Despite the failure to uncover mass graves , Milosevic was accused of crimes against humanity and placed on trial in February 2002 before an international criminal tribunal in The Hague .
There was scant chance that he would receive a favorable verdict .
The United States , in an unprecedented move , demanded and received the right to censor all evidence .
Slobodan ’s goose was cooked .
He was found dead in his cell on March 11 , 2006 , after court officials denied his request to seek medical treatment at a cardiology clinic .
AND SO IT GOES
The real genocide in Kosovo , i. e. , the killing of Christian Serbs , continued under the collective noses of the George W. Bush Administration .
In March 2004 , the ethnic Albanians , in a last ditch effort to eradicate the remaining Serbs , torched Serbian homes and destroyed almost all of the remaining Serbian Orthodox Church sites , and even the UN facilities .
But no protest came from the White House .
Instead , President Bush visited Albania on June 11 , 2007 and declared : “ At some point , sooner rather than later , you ’ve got to say , ‘ Enough is enough - - Kosovo is independent . ’ ”
On February 17 , 2008 , enough became enough .
Kosovo declared its independence and the mujahadeen dream of the Islamic Republic of Greater Albania began to crystallize into a reality .
Small wonder .
George W. Bush has always been a staunch defender of the faith .
“ Islam is a religion of peace , ” he assures us .
Peering into the murky depths , Jane Lubchenco searched for sea life , but all she saw were signs of death .
Video images scanned from the seafloor revealed a boneyard of crab skeletons , dead fish and other marine life smothered under a white mat of bacteria .
At times , the camera ’s unblinking eye revealed nothing at all -- a barren undersea desert in waters renowned for their bounty of Dungeness crabs and fat rockfish .
“ We could n’t believe our eyes , ” Lubchenco said , recalling her initial impression of the carnage brought about by oxygen - starved waters .
“ It was so overwhelming and depressing .
It appeared that everything that could n’t swim or scuttle away had died . ”
Upon further study , Lubchenco and other marine ecologists at Oregon State University concluded that that the undersea plague appears to be a symptom of global warming .
In a study released today in the journal Science , the researchers note how these low - oxygen waters have expanded north into Washington and crept south as far as the California state line .
And , they appear to be as regular as the tides , a lethal cycle that has repeated itself every summer and fall since 2002 .
“ We seem to have crossed a tipping point , ” Lubchenco said .
“ Low - oxygen zones off the Northwest coast appear to be the new normal . ”
Although scientists continue to amass data and tease out the details , all signs in the search for a cause point to stronger winds associated with a warming planet .
If this theory holds up , it means that global warming and the build - up of heat - trapping gases are bringing about oceanic changes beyond those previously documented : a rise in sea level , more acidic ocean water and the bleaching of coral reefs .
Low - oxygen dead zones , which have doubled in number every decade and exist around the world , have a variety of causes .
A massive dead zone off Louisiana is created each spring by a slurry of nutrient - rich farm runoff and sewage that flows out the Mississippi River , causing algae to bloom riotously , die and drift to the bottom to decompose .
Bacteria then take over .
In the process of breaking down the plant matter , they suck the oxygen out of the seawater , making it unable to support most forms of sea life .
Off Oregon , the dead zone appears to form because of changes in atmospheric conditions that create the oceanic river of nutrient - rich waters known as the California Current .
The California Current along the West Coast and the similar Humboldt Current off Peru and Benguela Current off South Africa are rarities .
These powerful currents account for only about 1 % of the world ’s oceans but produce 20 % of the world ’s fisheries .
Their productivity comes from wind - driven upwelling of nutrient - rich waters from the deep .
When those waters reach the surface and hit sunlight , tiny ocean plants known as phytoplankton bloom , creating food for small fish and shellfish that in turn feed larger marine animals up the food chain .
What ’s happening off Oregon , scientists believe , is that as land heats up , winds grow stronger and more persistent .
Because the winds do n’t go slack as they used to do , the upwelling is prolonged , producing a surplus of phytoplankton that is n’t consumed and ultimately dies , drifts down to the seafloor and rots .
“ It fits a pattern that we ’re seeing in the Benguela Current , ” said Andrew Bakun , a professor at the University of Miami ’s Pew Institute for Ocean Science who was n’t part of the Oregon study .
“ It ’s reasonable to think these hypoxic and anoxic zones will increase as more greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere . ”
The Benguela Current has seen sporadic dead zones .
There , rotting clumps of algae have also released clouds of hydrogen sulfide gas that smell like rotten eggs and poison sea life .
Residents along the coast of South Africa and Namibia have witnessed waves of rock lobsters crawl onto shore to escape the noxious gases .
Bakun considers the Benguela , the world ’s most powerful current , to be a harbinger of changes in other currents .
His theory is that warm , rising air over the land makes upwelling more frequent and more intense .
The phenomenon , he said , is complicated by decades of heavy fishing that has reduced schools of sardines to a tiny fraction of their former abundance .
Not enough fish remain to consume phytoplankton before it dies and settles on the bottom , creating an anoxic dead zone .
Crab fisherman were the first to take note of Oregon ’s dead zone .
Al Pazar recalls his alarm in 2002 when he pulled up his traps and found something seriously amiss .
“ It was a good amount of crabs , ” Pazar said .
“ But they were dead , or dying or very , very weak .
Those that we managed to keep alive did n’t survive for long . ”
The fishermen called Oregon State , which dispatched a boat of researchers to investigate .
“ It was a big mystery , ” Lubchenco said .
“ We did n’t know what was killing them . ”
Fishermen found other oddities .
As they pulled up their crab traps , they found baby octopuses , about the size of silver dollars , inching their way up the lines toward the buoys floating on the surface .
“ I ’d tell my crewmen , be careful with these cute little things , ” said Dennis Krulich , a longtime fishermen in Newport .
“ Peel them off the rope , and we ’ll put them back . ”
Only later did he realize that these babies were coming up from oxygen - depleted waters that hover near the seafloor , climbing to save their lives .
“ In 30 years of crabbing , I ’d never seen anything like it before , Krulich said .
“ It ’s spooky , this dead - zone thing . ”
The size of the zone has fluctuated over the years .
In 2006 , it was the largest ever measured , covering an expanse slightly larger than Rhode Island .
Last year , it was smaller but detected over a longer stretch of coastline .
To make sure the phenomenon was actually new , Oregon State marine ecologist Francis Chan reconstructed data from water sampling at 3,100 stations dating to 1950 .
He found that low - oxygen areas have long existed in deeper waters , but there was virtually no evidence until recently of hypoxic waters in prime fishing waters , which extend down to 165 feet .
“ It ’s pretty clear this is unprecedented , ” Chan said .
“ It ’s never been detected since we began to measure oxygen levels . ”
So far , the seasonal dead zones , which begin as early as June and wrap up in September , have not hurt the crab fishery , which mostly operates in the winter .
Many crabs and fish manage to flee the low - oxygen area .
And fishermen have learned to set their traps in the wasteland of the previous year ’s dead zones , to catch crabs that return to feed on the detritus of all the suffocated animals .
Scientists say seafood caught in low - oxygen zones is not harmful to eat .

I ’m not a big fan of employment .
I have n’t had a “ job ” in three and a half years .
But I also realize that entrepreneurship does n’t make sense for everyone .
Even for those pursuing the dream of starting a business , You Gotta Start Somewhere ( TM ) and that usually means working for someone else .
Some people even like their jobs .
They enjoy being part of something that is way beyond what they could accomplish on their own and their job might give them the chance to work with “ rock stars ” in their field .
I know because I ’ve had one gig after another like that .
When I started out as a Plone consultant , for example , my first client was Plone guru and author Andy McKay .
I went on to work with other high - profile companies and ended up spending two years with Canonical , the company which funds Ubuntu Linux , arguably the most popular free desktop operating system today .
A year ago I changed disciplines and began working with a web development framework called Ruby on Rails .
My first Rails project ?
The AT&T Williams F1 website .
Why am I telling you this ?
Because I ’m an average , not - university - educated skateboarder who consistently finds “ dream jobs ” ( contracts , in my case ) that pay me exceedingly well to work with world - class geeks , and I believe that you are at least as capable as I am of getting paid well to do what you love .
I was so confident about this that I wrote the first 20 pages of a book called “ How to Make $ 100,000 / year as a Consultant ” and submitted it as a proposal to an awesome online publisher and he loved it .
But now that this blog is gaining mindshare I ’d rather offer what I ’ve learned about dream job hunting , piece - by - piece , for free .
I apply the advice that follows as a software consultant , but everything in this article should apply as much to consultants as employees , whether your specialty is technology , science , PR , marketing , or stealing priceless artwork .
Know Your Worth
The foundation of gainful employment is self - respect .
In your career this means realizing that you deserve to be doing work you love , to work with amazing people , to be treated with respect by your colleagues , and to get paid extremely well for the time you spend furthering other people ’s business objectives .
If you ’re having trouble figuring out what kind of work you love , I wrote an article called Finding Your Passion which may offer some inspiration .
If you ’re wondering what getting paid “ extremely well ” means , check out How to Set Your Hourly Consulting Rate .
The latter article applies as much to consulting rates as salaries .
I also think it ’s important at the outset to think of your ideal job as a profile of characteristics rather than a specific post in a specific company .
I ’ve never been a “ company man ” as I think this mindset boxes you in and gives foolish priority to corporate loyalty over happiness and self - respect .
Bankroll Management
Parallel to the other suggestions , being a picky employee / consultant means practicing good bankroll management .
Ideally you want at least one year ’s savings in the bank at all times .
The point of this article is not to give financial advice , but suffice to say , for many people this could take some time , perhaps even a couple of years .
Some of you will read this and think , “ What ?
A whole year of savings ?
Is this guy crazy ? ”
But being debt - driven is a choice .
Saving money is as “ impossible ” as losing weight and I ’ve done a great deal of both .
Even on a salary of $ 30,000 / year a few years ago , I built my bankroll up in about six months by , among other things , choosing to live in a shared house for $ 280 / month .
Living below your means greatly increases how picky you can be when looking for a job .
If you insist on living paycheque - to - paycheque , do n’t worry .
I appreciate that it can be hard to get out of that bind once you ’ve gotten into it .
You can still greatly improve your job situation by applying the other ideas in this article and that could easily result in significant improvements to your financial situation .
Overwhelming Force
90 % of my secret to repeatedly finding really cool , good paying gigs can be summed up in one sentence : Send out 10 CVs every day .
This is the job hunting equivalent of social skydiving .
If you ’re willing to apply overwhelming force to the task of finding a great job or contract , the world truly is your oyster .
All those questions about how much you should charge , whether your CV is fit for the real world , and if there are any jobs in your field just disappear .
You ’ll find the answers to all these questions by simply measuring the response you get .
Whatever you do , do not listen to industry trendsters .
All that secondhand smoke about how the job market in your field is drying up is bullshit when you ’re prepared to contact every man , woman , and child on earth if that ’s what it takes to get paid to have fun .
I also find that “ résumé bombing ” completely changes the job interview dynamic .
I tend to interview a prospective client at least as much as they interview me .
With extremely high standards , a decent life bankroll , and an almost insane capacity for lead generation and followup , you deserve to be picky in choosing who you ’re going to work with .
Keeping Your Dream Job
A discussion of finding your dream job would be incomplete without some discussion of keeping a good thing going after you get it .
How do you make yourself hard to replace ?
How do you stay happy even after working there for a while ?
Here are some things that work for me :
Carve your own niche in the company .
Take ownership of a project as soon as you can .
At Canonical , for example , I almost immediately became the Lead Developer of the bug tracking system used by Ubuntu .
I was n’t hired for any role in particular but I saw the obvious value of having expert knowledge on a particular system .
Not only is being proactive a key ingredient to being fully engaged at work , it also gives you a lot of leverage in the company .

Treat your colleagues as friends .
I apply the same basic rules to all my relationships , business and personal .
I interact with my bosses and other colleagues exactly the same way I interact with friends .
I ’m sociable and laid back , I joke around , I ’m honest , and if you ’re being stupid I ’ll let you know .
This is n’t just some clever trick I use to make people like me .
I just have a lot more fun without the smoke and mirrors that “ professionalism ” brings .
And as a lot of bosses will tell you , it ’s a lot harder to fire someone you like .

Love thy users .
In my view , software development is all about making people happy .
I think most businesses should try to create a loveocracy .
By developing a strong connection to your userbase you will do much better work , feel much happier doing it , and be much less replaceable than someone who hides behind the curtain .

Be willing to walk away .
Staying happy in your job requires being willing to walk away when things go sour .
This includes speaking the truth even when you risk getting fired .
I ’m an expert at walking away from unfavourable situations , but I ’ve made some big mistakes too and stayed around when I should n’t have .
And when I did , it made me terribly unhappy and I ended up leaving later on anyway .
A lot of people treat their jobs like they treat the rest of their life :
It ’s supposed to suck … right ?
But being a corporate inmate is n’t a life sentence .
If you ’re unhappy with your job situation , now is a great time to raise your standards and start looking for something better .
The most important job hunting skill is “ résumé bombing ” .
An animal - like devotion to finding your dream job allows you to shift from suffering through your workday to doing what you love for a price that ’s right .

A big thanks to Anita Miller and Gopal Rao at the Materials Research Society for making this possible .
The former Information Minister for President George W. Bush , “ Comical Ari ” Fleischer , is appearing on CNN now as a political expert for Election ’08 coverage because , as you know , he ’s a master b.s. artist and we can’t have objective analysis sullying our airwaves .
But tonight on Super Tuesday , in a rare moment of candor and honesty , he said with a straight face ( because he was n’t kidding ) the following on behalf of Republicans :
There is no doubt … we hope and pray every night to run against Hillary Clinton .
And now you know exactly why Fleischer , Ann Coulter , James Dobson , Michelle Malkin , Glenn Beck , Rush Limbaugh , and myriad other foul hatebeasts of the far right are curiously pulling for Hillary and / or bashing McCain .
They do n’t care who the GOP nominee is .
They want Americans to think the Republican Party is fractured and terrified of Clinton .
It has everything to do with ensuring she is the Democratic nominee so they can beat her in November or sink her presidency before the next election .
They will achieve one of those goals , guaranteed .
They will devote every ounce of energy they have to it .
You all who vote for Clinton are making a mistake .
Obama is the only Democrat that the GOP can’t defeat , no matter who they put up against him or how many e-voting machines they tamper with .
My only fear is that as Obama is headed for a landslide victory on November 4 , we ’ll hear from our old pal Osama bin Laden , or another more heinous dog will be wagged .
UPDATE 06 FEB 2008 : Pat Buchanan has joined the “ Flush John Down the John ” Club .
Keep taking the bait , Dems .
Do n’t let the right down .
UPDATE 2.0 06 FEB 2008 : Obama knows what ’s up .
This is the continuation of my previous post about the Popes recent encyclical , covering sections 6 - 10 , and maybe more .
More below the fold .
Section 6 :
You talk about how philosophers before Jesus were “ Charlatans . ”
That Jesus was the “ true philosopher . ”
Can you prove this ?
Where is the evidence that the arguments of the other philosophers are somehow untrue , while your particular philosopher is somehow better ?
It ’s special pleading , it ’s a fallacy .
Section 7 :
Ahh , my favorite verse in the Bible .
Hebrews 11:1 , “ Faith is the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen . ”
Yes , I said evidence , not proof .
You note the Latin translation , I wo n’t quote it , but since you assume infallibility of the text , I ’ll note the following , the word argumentum can be translated in two ways , according to this dictionary : “ evidence , proof . ”
Now , I only studied Linguistics as a hobby , but I do remember that it was considered best when translating to choose the lesser connotation .
I think your translation of argumentum as “ proof ” is misleading , you cannot prove the existence of anything in science , and since science is the study of the real world , proof is a bad term .
We do not “ prove ” in science , we construct theories — collections of facts — and make predictions which are supported by material evidence .
Faith has no place in science , and in science , there are plenty of things we ca n’t see , but can show — by evidence — to exist .
Dark Matter , Dark Energy , Subatomic Particles , Singularities ( Black Holes ) , and many others .
Hey , we ca n’t even “ see ” air , but we know that when the wind blows that that is evidence of its existence .
Even Jesus said that ( John 3 , KJV , “ The wind bloweth where it listeth … etc ” )
We do not need to invoke faith , or God , to show the existence of anything .
So then - what good is faith ?
What does it give you that science can’t ?
Does it somehow make the future “ no longer a ‘ not yet ' ” ?
By which I think you mean that it makes the future tenable , real , somehow more apparent .
I argue no , I am an atheist , I do not have faith in any divine being .
I do not have faith in anything , I have evidence .
What does this mean for me ?
It means I live in the moment , the real , the now .
I know that the future is uncertain , as it is for everyone , Christian or no .
” Boast not thyself of tomorrow ; for thou knowest not what tomorrow may bring forth . ”
Proverbs 27:1 , Since you and I are both in a state of unknowing about the future , by your own dogma ’s admission , what difference does it make what I believe about what happens when I die ?
Faith is meaningless , you do not need it .
Occam ’s Razor helps us trim the fat , as atheists , and as scientists , faith is just that , unneeded fat to be cut away from the meat of truth .
Section 8 : “ In their case , it has been demonstrated that this new life truly possesses and is “ substance ” that calls forth life for others .
For us who contemplate these figures , their way of acting and living is de facto a “ proof ” that the things to come , the promise of Christ , are not only a reality that we await , but a real presence : he is truly the “ philosopher ” and the “ shepherd ” who shows us what life is and where it is to be found . ”
No ones actions , no ones anecdotes , and noone unsubstantiated stories can ever constitute any kind of proof , besides a fallacious one .
The plural of anecdote is anecdotes , not evidence .
I appreciate what you are trying to do in this treatise , really ; the problem , sir , is this — you do it at the expense of others .
You try to encourage your followers by insulting others .
I have hope , I do not need any faith — much less yours — to have it .
Do not insult the concepts of proof and science by saying anything involving your dogma and superstition constitute proof .
That makes me sick .
Section 9 is short , and I do n’t see much in it I have n’t already addressed .
Section 10
Here you discuss “ eternal life . ”
I have only one question , how do we know that eternal life exists ?
How do we know Heaven , Hell , or any of this exists as fact ?
Is it testable ?
Can I touch it , smell it , feel it , measure it ?
You are , in simple terms , telling me to believe in a boogey man .
To use my “ blind faith . ”
Well sir , I know you are n’t fallible , but I certainly am , and I wo n’t trust myself with anything less than material evidence , repeatable experiments , and scientific observations .
I do n’t know what it takes to be infallible , how pompous you have to be , how prideful to say , “ I am never wrong . ”
It is a doctrine of the church , is it not ?
I have found no evidence that your organization has ever rejected it .
Funny though - that the Bible says the following : “ As it is written , there is none righteous , no not one . ” and “ For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God ” ( Romans 3:10 and 3:23 resp ) .
So how did you get to be so special that you ’re held above the Bible , the very thing you ’re telling me to believe unconditionally , without evidence ?
Oh ?
Whats that ?
Some Cardinals elected you ?
So I ’m supposed to trust religious politicians ?
Yah , I do n’t even trust the secular ones .
Skipping sections 11 and 12 , nothing particularly interesting , section 13 :
“ In the course of their history , Christians have tried to express this “ knowing without knowing ” by means of figures that can be represented , and they have developed images of “ Heaven ” which remain far removed from what , after all , can only be known negatively , via unknowing … ”
What ?
Knowing without Knowing is not “ Unknowning ” we are n’t “ forgetting ” anything .
Are you honestly trying to say that the only way we can possible understand heaving is by forgetting about it ?
Oh !
I get it , its not heaven we should forget about , it ’s common god damn sense .
Thomas Paine — who was a Diest , no less — said this , one of my favorite quotes , “ Knowledge is the forbidden tree of the preistcraft . ”
It ’s true , is n’t it , Benedict , Benny– can I call you Benny ?
If your followers were to start really critically thinking about what was going on .
About things like– gee , I do n’t know – how you can be infallible , the blatant mathematical , logical , physical , and self contradictions in the Bible , the fact that you ’re elected pope , but you are divinely chosen at the same time , or the laundry list of other problems with your faith .
If they started thinking about the heinous acts that were committed in the name of the Catholic Church , the Crusades , the Inquisition , or St. Bartholomew ’s Day Massacre of the Hugeonots .
That they would realize just how stupid the dogma they ’ve been spoon - fed , likely since birth , as you point out in section 11 , is pointless and cruel .
Do you honestly believe this stuff you preach ?
I wonder sometimes if you are n’t just playing along - if this is just a game to you .
If you just want to string these poor people along into giving you there money .
I often wonder if the Catholic Church is really just the worlds longest running confidence trick , with the Pope as the lead conman .
Do you realize , Benny , that you ’re messing with peoples lives ?
Section 14 , then I ’m done for this post .
Let ’s talk about omnibenevolence .
You mention in this section the following : “ Psalm 144 [ 143 ] :15 : ‘ Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord . ’ ” Now , I have a question , does this mean that people whose God is not “ the Lord ” are not blessed ?
Who ’s doing the blessing ?
Are there suddenly many Gods to choose from ?
Why would n’t any of those Gods bless me ?
Lets assume that this YHVH God Fella , the one you seem to have proclivity to , ( I always preferred Ra , myself , or Thor , I can never choose … ) is the one doing the blessing , and that there are no other Gods .
So , if the people of God ( Christians ) are Blessed , then it stands to reason that the people who are not God ’s are not Blessed .
To be not blessed is to be cursed , or to be treated benignly ( thats a proper negation , correct ? ) .
If this God person is omnibenevolent , as you claim , then he obviously cannot curse me , as an atheist ( and therefore non-christian , by default ) .
However , your bible o’ dogma states quite clearly that the nonrighteous will go to hell , which I ’m fairly sure is not a benign treatment .
So we have a problem , either your God is not omnibenevolent , or I ’m not going to hell .
If the former is true , you ’ve got some doctrine issues .
If the latter is true , not only do you have some doctrine issues , but you have some purpose issues , and I do n’t have to worry about all this silly “ going to hell ” stuff ( not that I did in the first place ) .
Since for me to be treated benignly , I ’ll just have to be ignored for eternity , left to my own devices .
That oughta be fun , I ’ll go find Richard Dawkins , PZ Myers , Thomas Paine , Christopher Hitchens , and all my other atheist / nonchristian buddies and reminisce about the good times back on the late great planet earth - I ’d be okay with not having to worship some pompous ass for eternity , just like I ’m okay with dying and having nothing happen .
We ’ll be coming back to this topic later , so keep it in mind .
Back next time with a fresh installment of “ The Pope and Me ” Hopefully I ’ll get to something more interesting .

“ THE Google brand has taken on a life of its own , ” concedes Jim Lanzone , the boss of Ask.com , the fourth - largest but fastest - growing search engine , and this simultaneously frustrates and delights him .
It frustrates him because people say they “ google ” things even when they go to Ask or other engines to search the web ; because Google is considered , for no good reason ( in his opinion ) , “ the safe choice under pressure ” ; and because many people “ do n't seem to want choice ” and stick to Google out of mere inertia .
But it delights him , because Google , having made many enemies , must now fight many battles ; and because Google , perhaps out of hubris , appears to be getting distracted .
This month , for instance , Google unveiled a free online spreadsheet program , which , like many Google products , has little to do with web search and is meant to needle Microsoft , the world 's largest software company , which has a near - monopoly on spreadsheets through Excel .
Google , in other words , has impressive momentum , says Mr Lanzone , but a good martial - artist can use his opponent 's momentum to overcome him , so “ we 're using search aikido . ”
In terms of momentum — mass times velocity — Google 's lead indeed looks daunting .
It has by far the most mass , with an American market share of 43 % as of April , which reaches 50 % counting AOL , an internet property that uses Google 's search technology .
This compares with 28 % for Yahoo ! ; 13 % for MSN , which belongs to Microsoft ; and 6 % for Ask , which is owned by IAC / Interactive Corp , a conglomerate of about 60 online media brands .
Google also has velocity : its market share grew by 17 % in the four quarters to this spring , whereas Yahoo ! and MSN both lost share .
Only
Ask has more velocity — its share grew by 35 % — but then again it has little mass .
There are also other , even smaller search engines , such as Clusty.com , a service that displays results in thematic bundles , and SNAP.com , an engine founded by Bill Gross , a pioneer in the industry .
But because barriers to entry in the search business are high — the engineering talent is limited and data centres that can simultaneously support millions of searches are expensive — most analysts think that the four big search engines will stay ahead of the tiny ones .
The industry is young and switching - costs for users are low ( a click , in effect ) , so there is still the potential for a change in leadership among these four .
The contest is fierce , because search results , which display highly targeted advertisements , are the most lucrative pages on the internet .
Comparing the quality — that is , the relevance — of search results is highly subjective , but for the past six years or so Google has probably proved the best at the job .
The stroke of genius of its two founders , Sergey Brin and Larry Page , was the PageRank algorithm , which treated the links to web pages as votes conferring authority , just as the best academic papers tend to get the most citations in other research .
Google 's problem today , says Chris Sherman , the executive editor of SearchEngineWatch , an online industry newsletter , is that “ they regard themselves as the best , and yet they do n't really seem to have a clear strategy , ” which seems to make them dabble aimlessly .
Yahoo ! , the largest internet portal with about 400 m users ( of its e-mail , instant - messaging , music and other products ) , has spotted this weakness and come up with a strategy to differentiate its own search engine .
Yahoo !
has been at this game for only two years — it used to use Google for its search technology , until it realised that this was the most profitable part of the business — but now has hundreds of engineers working on it .
In contrast to the quasi-religious faith that Google places in its mathematical algorithms , says Eckart Walther , one of Yahoo ! 's search bosses , Yahoo ! is “ about combining the best of people with the best of technology ” .
The idea , Mr Walther says , is to “ look not only at links between websites but also links between people ” and thus to use “ social search ” to solve “ subjective ” queries .
Caterina Fake , who came to Yahoo !
as the co-founder of FlickR , a popular photo - sharing site it bought last year , gives the example of her own search for a lamp shade .
A Google search returned lots of lamp stores , but all in generic styles .
A search on Yahoo !'s “ MyWeb ” , by contrast , took into account the eclectic tastes of her friends and came up with the more fashionable , unconventional lamp shade that she was after .
This approach has potential , but also limits .
The user has to be known to Yahoo ! ( ie , logged in ) and the results are best when users do a lot of work — by , for instance , “ tagging ” things they see on the web with descriptions ( “ cool lamp shade ” ) so that online friends can benefit from these trails of “ metadata ” .
But most people do n't want surfing the web to feel like work , so the metadata is limited .
To Mr Lanzone at Ask , the Yahoo ! approach sounds like “ a long walk for a short beer . ”
So Ask — which used to be called Ask Jeeves but dropped Jeeves , a knowing butler , from its logo in February — is taking a different tack .
It has come up with ExpertRank , an algorithm that also ranks web pages by incoming links , but is different from Google 's PageRank in that it first groups , or “ clusters ” , pages and links by theme .
So instead of using a web page 's overall popularity to calculate its ranking , it finds the pages that are most popular among experts on a particular subject , a method that often returns better results than Google's .
Ask also uses these thematic clusters to suggest the best ways to narrow or expand a search , a feature called “ zoom ” that is very popular .
Chris Sherman of SearchEngineWatch thinks that Ask is as good as Google for general web search — but better than Google for finding online maps and images .
Ask , he thinks , is therefore starting to resemble Apple in the computer industry , which has a small but dedicated following of fans who consider the Macintosh operating system superior to the dominant Windows system by Microsoft ( a comparison that is sure to make Messrs Brin and Page at Google cringe ) .
As for Microsoft , it has identified Google as a mortal threat to its business and has launched an all - out effort to catch up in online services in general , and in search in particular .
Last winter , it tried to buy itself market share by negotiating with AOL for a merger — or at least an agreement under which AOL would switch from Google 's search technology to MSN's ; but Google pre-empted Microsoft and itself took a defensive stake in AOL .
Microsoft has also hired former rivals who are well respected in the industry , such as Ray Ozzie , an innovator best known for inventing Lotus Notes , a collaboration programme , and Steve Berkowitz , Mr Lanzone 's predecessor at Ask , who now oversees the MSN portal .
Mr Sherman at SearchEngineWatch says the quality of search results on MSN so far “ seems to be all over the map ” .
But , as he points out , Microsoft has a history of coming late to a market with a mediocre copy - cat product that gradually gets better until it prevails .
The search - engine battle is not over yet .
