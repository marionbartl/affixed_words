Secret government discussions about the Iraq war are to be disclosed after an information tribunal today ordered the release of cabinet minutes from 2003 .
The decision follows a lengthy battle by campaigners , who have argued that the public interest in learning what was said about the planned invasion outweighs the public interest in cabinet discussions being kept secret .
Ministers have strongly opposed the request , arguing that the Freedom of Information Act was never intended to allow for the publication of information of this kind .
The tribunal upheld a decision by the information commissioner that details of the sessions on 13 and 17 March should be disclosed .
The meetings considered the highly controversial issue of whether the invasion was allowed under international law .
Lord Goldsmith , who was attorney general at the time , initially suggested that the legality of the invasion was legally questionable before subsequently issuing legal advice saying that it would be compatible with international law .
This has given rise to persistent claims that ministers were not fully briefed on the possible legal pitfalls of an invasion .
Today 's ruling does not necessarily mean the minutes will be published because the government has 28 days to appeal .
The tribunal said that the exceptional circumstances relating to the two cabinet meetings meant that publication was justified and that it would not set a precedent for the publication of all cabinet minutes .
Last year Richard Thomas , the information commissioner , ordered the government to publish the minutes .
The government appealed to the information tribunal , which adjudicates when official bodies are unwilling to comply with rulings from the commissioner .
Ministers will now have to decide whether to publish the minutes , to appeal to the high court , or to issue a ministerial veto banning publication .
Under the Freedom of Information
Act the government has the right to refuse publication as a last resort , but this veto power has not been used since the act came into force in 2005 .
Thomas said today : " I welcome the careful consideration that the information tribunal has given to this important issue .
I am pleased that the tribunal has upheld my decision that the public interest in disclosing the official cabinet minutes in this particular case outweighs the public interest in withholding the information .
Disclosing the minutes will allow the public to more fully understand this particular decision .
I am also pleased that the tribunal reached the same conclusion as I did in relation to the publication of the handwritten notes of the meetings . "
In its ruling the tribunal said : " We have decided that the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the formal minutes of two cabinet meetings at which ministers decided to commit forces to military action in Iraq did not , at the time when the Cabinet Office refused a request for disclosure in April 2007 , outweigh the public interest in disclosure .
We have reached that decision by a majority and not without difficulty .
" We concluded that there was a strong public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of information relating to the formulation of government policy or ministerial communications ( including , in particular , the maintenance of the long - standing convention of cabinet collective responsibility ) .
" However , this is an exceptional case , the circumstances of which brought together a combination of factors that were so important that , in combination , they created very powerful public interest reasons why disclosure was in the public interest . "
Although the tribunal said that the minutes ought to be published , it also accepted that some sections should be redacted , or edited , " to avoid unnecessary risk to the UK's international relations " .
The tribunal also ruled that " certain informal notes " taken alongside the formal cabinet minutes did not need to be published .
In its ruling , the tribunal said that the controversy about Goldsmith 's legal advice was a factor in persuading it to come down in favour of publication .
" The decision to commit the nation 's armed forces to the invasion of another country is momentous in its own right , and ... its seriousness is increased by the criticisms that have been made ( particularly in the Butler report ) of the general decision - making processes in the cabinet at the time , " the tribunal said .
" There has also been criticism of the attorney general 's legal advice and of the particular way in which the March 17 opinion was made available to the cabinet only at the last moment and the March 7 opinion was not disclosed to it at all . "
The Cabinet Office now has 28 days to decide whether to appeal to the high court against the ruling .
A Downing Street spokesman said : " The information commissioner has just made an announcement on this and we are considering our response . "
William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , said : " Rather than have items of evidence dragged into the public domain piece by piece the government should set up a full - scale privy council inquiry into the origins and conduct of the Iraq war .
" The sooner we can learn the lessons of the war the sooner we can apply them .
It is imperative to begin an inquiry before memories have faded , emails have been deleted and documents have disappeared . "
Edward Davey , the Liberal Democrats ' foreign affairs spokesman , said : " This is a very welcome and long overdue decision .
The public clearly has the right to see the minutes .
Their publication may help answer some critical questions , and certain people may find themselves in an even more difficult position .
" The government must now accept this decision , and publish the minutes without delay . "
I know many web designers and developers blog .
But for those who do n’t , here are couple reasons why you should .
1. Marketing
Ask most internet marketers and they ’ll tell you that blogs are great for driving traffic .
If you ’re a freelance worker , getting more traffic to your site can increase your leads and sales .
Even if you ’re working for a company , your blog can send more traffic to your company ’s site .
In this economy , you probably want your firm to have more business so that you can stay employed .
Blogs can get a lot of traffic for a couple of reasons .
First , they often do well on the search engines .
Blog have lots of pages for the search engines to rank as opposed to static brochure - like sites that only have a few pages .
Second , blogs usually get more repeat visitors .
Internet users are much more likely to bookmark a blog since they expect blogs to get updated and they want to check back for new content .
Third , blogs are usually better than other types of sites at attracting links .
There seems to be a culture of “ linking out ” between bloggers that ’s missing with other sites .
Most bloggers are open to sharing their traffic by linking to other bloggers .
Of course , if you want to share in this traffic , you ’ll be expected to link out too .
It ’s a win - win for you , since you can point your readers to interesting blogs while receiving traffic back .
2. Learning
Blogs can be great learning tools .
You can create helpful posts for your industry .
This is a great way to solidify in your mind the things you ’ve learned .
You can use your blog as a reference guide .
Think of it as your old school notebook where you kept important notes to help you do your homework and pass your tests .
Your blog has an advantage over the notebook because it ’s online .
This means you can save useful links with ease .
Also , other people give you useful information by leaving blog comments .
You can also use your blog as a work diary or journal .
By keeping track of your work activities , you can look back at your posts and be encouraged by your progress .
You might uncover unproductive trends that you need deal with and productive patterns that you need to focus on .
Again , other web designers and developers can interact with you through the comment section .
They may leave helpful information or just a general encouraging word .
As your blog grows in traffic , you can start using your blog to get valuable feedback .
You can ask your readers to answer questions that you have about your industry .
You ’ll need a good amount of traffic to make this work since most readers do n’t leave feedback .
3. Networking
I ’ve hinted about this already , but it deserves its own section .
Simply put , blogs are an effective and efficient way to build relationships with other web workers .
You ’ll still need to make the direct contact possibly with email or a face - to - face meeting , but your blog showcases your personality to anyone who has an internet connection .
Over time , your readers will know you pretty well .
If you want to network with someone , you can contact them and point them to your blog to learn more about you .
You wo n’t have to keep telling your story to each person you network with .
Instead , you can just link to the relevant posts on your blog .
If you ’re looking for a job , new clients , a business partner , or even online friends in your industry , your blog functions as a “ living ” updated real - time resume .
Over to You
If you ’re a blogger , why do you blog ?

Dolphin stays for three days with mate wounded in shark attack - before escorting it to humans for help
A dolphin badly injured in a shark attack has been escorted by a mate into the care of human hands .
Nari sustained a hideous wound across his head and back , and when he went missing , wildlife experts feared he had died .
The 12 - year - old dolphin failed to turn up for his ritual feeding off the coast of Queensland - but so did his older companion Echo .
Chunks of Nari 's neck were literally bitten off as his flesh was torn right down to the muscle by the shark in these horrific injuries
Nari the dolphin suffered horrific injuries to his head and back and is being cared for by wildlife staff in Queensland
But after three days the pair turned up with the rest of the group .
Mr Trevor Long , a dolphin expert from Sea World on the Gold Coast , said : ' We did n't see Nari again until the third day , when he turned up with Echo at his side .
' Dolphins are highly social animals and they have an extremely strong bond .
There is no reason to think other than that Echo stayed with Nari for a few days , waiting until Nari was well enough to make it back to the feeding area .
' The fact that Echo failed to show up when the injured Nari was also absent suggests they remained together further out to sea for a few days . '
Nari was looked after and helped to safety by his friend Echo , above
It has now also emerged that Echo 's sympathy for Nari may stem from an incident in 1996 when Echo was himself attacked by a shark .
What has thrilled wildlife experts even more is the trust that Nari has appeared to put in the humans who were able to lift him without a struggle into a boat and take him to the mainland to be treated by vets .
' It was a pretty bumpy ride back to the shore , but Nari remained calm all the way , ' said Mr Long .
' It was as if he was putting his trust in us .
' We were very concerned about him when he failed to turn up last week but he 's in good hands now .
' The injury is quite severe - the bite went right through the skin , flesh and blubber down to the muscle and Nari 's pretty sore .
Trainers work with Nari in the water
' We 're going to cut out the large piece of flesh that has been ripped by the shark and treat him in a special quarantine pool at Sea World .
' Then it will be a case of the wound healing from the inside out .
We 're got high hopes he 'll recover and then we 'll release him back into the wild where we 're sure his friend Echo will be waiting for him . '
The pod of 13 wild dolphins come for a nightly hand - feeding ritual by wildlife officers and tourists who greet them each evening on the coast of Moreton Island , near Brisbane .
Nari 's terrible injury was first noticed on Friday when he showed up for the feed .
Wildlife officials who were with tourists tossing small fish to them were horrified to see the wound , which bore all the marks of a ferocious shark attack .
It is unclear what species of shark was responsible but the nature of the wound suggested that after taking an initial bite into Nari 's head , the shark then gnawed at the wound to try and tear off the flesh .
CHICAGO — A landmark Energy Department project to bury carbon dioxide produced by humans has begun as workers sunk a huge drill bit into Illinois ground this week , signaling continued support for a climate change mitigation strategy that has fallen out of favor in many circles .
The start of drilling marks the launch a geological sequestration project that will deposit a million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the ground by 2012 .
While that 's nothing compared to the several billion tons of CO2 that humans emit yearly , it 's the geology of the site that makes the development exciting .
The CO2 will be piped into a geological formation that underlies parts of Illinois , Indiana and Kentucky that could eventually hold more than 100 billion tons of CO2 .
" This is going to be a large - scale injection of 1 million metric tons , one of the largest injections to date in the U.S. " project manager Robert Finley said here at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting Sunday .
While the Department of Energy and private industry have been pushing to create cheaper renewable energy and investigating increased nuclear - power options to reduce carbon emissions , carbon capture and sequestration remains an attractive idea .
It would allow regions of the country like the southeast , which do n't have Texas or California - level wind or solar resources , to continue burning coal without contributing to climate change .
To do that , many technological issues will need to be solved .
Last year , the Bush administration canceled the DOE 's most expensive carbon capture and sequestration project , FutureGen , and some utility executives have questioned whether storing CO2 will actually make sense .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that as much as 30 percent of the energy created by a coal plant would have to be spent on just pulling the CO2 out of its flue gas .
But new materials for more selectively capturing CO2 from gas mixes continue to be created in labs like Omar Yaghi's at UCLA
and at Georgia Tech under Chris Jones .
Those innovations could make the capture part of " carbon capture and sequestration " easier than it currently is .
Add in a carbon tax of some form and fossil - fuel power plant operators would have the incentive to start capturing a lot of carbon dioxide .
Then , they 'll just need somewhere to put it .
The DOE thinks the United States has more than enough underground closet space .
" What we found in the U.S. with the research that we 've done over the last 10 years is that there is a significant potential to store CO2 ...
in these very large reservoirs that are underground , " said John
Litynski , who works in the fossil - fuel - centered National Energy Technology Laboratory 's Sequestration
Division .
But most current sequestration projects use the carbon dioxide to squeeze more oil and gas out of depleted fields .
Those fields probably wo n't cut it for much larger amounts of CO2 .
For that , we 'll have to turn to huge reservoirs deeper underground .
That 's why the Illinois demonstration project is so important .
It will test a formation called the Mt. Simon sandstone , allowing scientists to track in near real - time what happens when they start putting large amounts of compressed carbon dioxide 6,500 feet below the surface .
" We have numbers for what we think the capacity is in the U.S. , but the only way to prove that is to actually drill a well , " said Litynski .
Drilling a 6,500 - foot well does n't come cheap — the Illinois Basin project has an $ 84 million price tag .
It 's a collaboration between the
DOE and industrial partners including Archer Daniels
Midland , which is providing the land for the test site and will serve up CO2 from its ethanol fermenters .
A group of scientists centered at the Illinois State Geological Survey known as the Midwest Geological Carbon
Sequestration Consortium are leading the research .
They 'll collect enormous amounts of data about how the CO2 plume moves through the pores in the sandstone .
The
Mt. Simon formation is particularly attractive because of a series of fortuitous events that have placed three layers of impermeable rock —
known as " cap rock " — between the sandstone and the surface .
Finley thinks that makes the project a very good bet to succeed in keeping CO2
buried away for what amounts to forever in human timescales .
But the audience at the AAAS meeting who watched the researchers present their sequestration evidence were n't wholly convinced .
They gave the presenters a rougher time than one normally sees at this meeting , where most questions are softballs .
One audience member noted that the
Mt. Simon project was sequestering 10,000 times less CO2 than we'd have to put into the ground each year to offset human emissions .
It 's the expense and time needed to scale up the tech that leads renewable energy advocates to complain that money used to make coal cleaner should instead be spent scaling up wind power or installing efficiency measures to reduce electricity demand .
The Department of Energy 's sequestration division has received
$ 481 million in Federal funding to date , with a request for $ 160
million for next year , up from $ 1 million in 1995 .
Finley defended his project , taking the stance that the problems inherent in producing clean energy will require a wide variety of technologies , not one single solution .
" From my point of view as someone working in this field ... the political rhetoric gets to the point where it's all supposed to be solar or wind or coal or natural gas , " Finley said .
" The reality for the situation is that we need all of these technologies . "

The Episcopal Café has gotten word that the Rt. Rev. Gene Robinson , the first openly gay man to be ordained a bishop in the Episcopal Church — provoking a national rift in the church — has been invited by Barack Obama to give the invocation to kick off at inauguration week .
The symbolism here is obvious : Obama 's invitation to Rick Warren to give the invocation on Inauguration Day triggered a firestorm of criticism in the gay community because of Warren 's disapproval of homosexuality and his advocacy against gay rights measures .
The question is whether the gay community will accept this gesture as ample recompense .
Robinson , for his part , sounds like he does :
It is also an indication of the new president 's commitment to being the President of ALL the people .
I am humbled and overjoyed at this invitation , and it will be my great honor to be there representing the Episcopal Church , the people of New Hampshire , and all of us in the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender community .
I 'll be checking in with gay rights groups today to gauge whether other leaders are as ebullient .
Picking Warren and Robinson , Obama is trying to satisfy two constituencies that are often diametrically opposed to one another .
Rick Warren has gone so far as to invite conservative Episcopal parishes that have left the mother church over their objections to Robinson 's ordination to meet on the grounds of his Southern California church , Saddleback .
But because the inaugural events are purely ceremonial — which is not to say unimportant — why would n't he be able to pull it off ?
Oh tiny independent record store , now you have even more competition .
The good people at Apple have apparently decided that it is n’t enough that independent artists seem to get a pretty decent share of the normal iTunes Store homepage , so they ’ve gone and created this " Indie Spotlight " feature , which only features independent artists .
The feature is currently only in its soft launch phase , so there ’s a possibility that we ’re going to get some new features out of this , but currently there ’s a list of indie podcasts , indie artist playlists , and not much else .
The homepage prominently features Vetiver , bloghouse / New York Times golden boy Wavves , Neko Case , Fever Ray , Lemonade , Cut Copy , and Animal Collective .
The artist playlists include Bon Iver , Hercules and Love Affair , Diplo , Switch and Digitalism .
What does this all mean , since it ’s not like these are things that are n’t avaiable through the normal iTunes store ?
Well , it could mean that the people at iTunes are genuine lovers of independent music who just wanted to show some love for " the most innovative aspects of music … coming out on indie labels all over the world , " like it says on the page of the store dedicated to Wavves .
It could also mean that Apple has got a bunch of cool dads sitting around in the office , who ’ve recently become aware of the money to be made in marketing independent artists to an increasingly " hip " demographic of music consumers , and the importance of looking cool .
Whatever the reason , if this results in independent artists and labels getting a little more cash funneled their way , or the Indie Spotlight feature being used to break new artists , then Apple deserves a pat on the back .
He said : " I am , however , extremely disappointed that the force and our officers have come in for such criticism when I believe they have acted proportionately and with the greater interests of the community we serve at heart throughout . "

The Truth about U.S. Banking
PUBLIC CENTRAL BANK
- On Reclaiming Our Central Bank And Monetary Policy -
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
“ Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is
the master of all its legislation and commerce . ”
President James A. Garfield
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
The “ Federal Reserve ” is not a government institution but a private central bank owned by a handful of major banks and bond dealers .
As such , it is a cartel owned , controlled , and essentially for - profit driven , not by the people of the United States but , instead , by the banking industry ’s ruling elite .
This oligarchic setup generates the most costly , debt - based , money system and greatest conflicts of interest in the history of the world .
It is a system clearly at odds with the intent of the founders of the United States of America .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
- Zero Per Cent Home Loans -
“ Capital must protect itself in every possible way , both by combination and legislation .
Debts must be collected , mortgages foreclosed as rapidly as possible .
When , through the process of law , the common people lose their homes , they will become more docile and more easily governed through the strong arm of government applied by a central power of wealth under leading financiers .
These truths are well known among our principal men who are now engaged in forming an imperialism to govern the world .
By dividing the voter through the political party system , we can get them to expend their energies in fighting for questions of no importance .
It is thus by discreet action we can secure for ourselves that which has been so well planned and so successfully accomplished . ”
American ’s Banker Association , 1924
Ask yourself why the people of the United States would agree to charge interest on one another ’s home loans – the very building blocks of society ?
The answer is we did not , have not , and likely would not .
Most importantly , we cannot implement any such salutary “ barnraising ” monetary policy because we no longer have ownership or control over our money creation process and this most vital of state institutions .
In short , we have lost control over money creation and purse powers as bequeathed to us by the founding fathers in the Constitution of the United States .
Instead , with a private central bank , we are required to pay for our homes , as well as all our infrastructure and defense , three or four times over due to the interest costs imposed by private central bankers and their affiliated bond dealers .
Interest costs alone represent the greatest of taxes paid , and the greatest of burdens passed to future generations .
Imagine , in an economy nearly seventy per-cent driven by consumers , what this tax cut , in home interest savings alone , could do to stimulate the “ ownership ” economy – not to mention freeing the vast majority from nearly endless house debt ?
In addition , to avoid early foreclosures , family breakups , and financial devastation due to job loss and “ free trade ” job export new , more democratically - oriented , policies might allow for longer emergency mortgage relief periods to avoid exactly such no - fault crisis and debilitating chaos .
At the same time , penalties for loan and appraisal fraud could be greatly strengthened .
Otherwise home loan programs could very well continue thru existing mortgage , banking , and escrow institutions with the only difference being direct treasury funding as opposed to debt - based bonds serving the interests of the few .
For the great majority of people there is no greater tax cut possible than eliminating interest on our home loans .
If we truly controlled our own government and economy such a change , and related offsetting tax code changes regarding interest deductions , would be simple and easy .
First , however , to accomplish this salutary objective , and other necessary monetary system reforms , we have to end , or radically re-control , an oligarchic and undemocratic banking institution misleadingly known as the “ Fed . ”
- Hurricanes , Disasters & Infrastructure -
Aside from the loss of life , the sickest thing about the recent Katrina - Rita - Wilma hurricane events – as well as virtually every other natural disaster , war or infrastructure need – is that we are forced to borrow from a private central bank to pay for all the destruction , reconstruction and related interest costs .
A private central bank profiting from Mother Nature ’s wrath ( due to global warming induced climate change ) and the wipe out of entire cities and families is surely the mother of all scandals , the crime of the ages , and the epitomy of financial sociopathy .
The private cabal “ Fed ” central bank setup we labor under means the cartel profits from every natural disaster via our borrowing requirements .
Clearly , nothing could be more brutal , immoral or just plain wrong .
As a result we can be driven into bankruptcy by Mother Nature and the Fed alone , as government insurance program premiums cover only a fraction of the costs , and any and all deficits require debt - money borrowing .
In short , we must regain control of our monetary powers or we will be bankrupted by Mother Nature alone , courtesy of the “ Federal ” Reserve .
- The “ Independent ” Scam -
“ If government becomes ‘ independent of politics ’ it can only mean that that sphere of government becomes an absolute self - perpetuating oligarchy . ”
Murray Rothbard , The Case Against The Fed
Oligarchy and neo -fascism are what we , the people , are fighting today .
A top -down , undemocratic , globalization process is effectively removing all local controls and cultural freedoms … and in the process installing private central banks everywhere .
Corporate power and rule by the few ( via control of our central bank , media , trade policy , and a corrupted Congress ) has now reduced much of mankind to neo -slavery upon a global plantation – all within a “ free market ” from which , for most , their is neither escape nor dissent .
The primary instrument of this modern neo-slavery and rule by the few is interest - bearing debt , and control of our money creation process by a ruling elite .
As a result of this regime , Nations , states , and families around the world are virtual prisoners of a monopoly private central bank system , and its debt money instruments and policies .
The original Constitution of the United States stated that Congress , the most representative body , was to have the sole power to mint our money and set the value of currency in the United States .
However , in 1913 , the Federal Reserve Act was passed , in a secretive and deceptive legislative process similar to the coup d’etat accomplished with the corporate - controlled GATT - NAFTA regime .
This constitution - crushing “ Fed ” act passed the authority to create money from the people , via Congress , over to a private consortium of big banks now collectively known as the Federal Reserve Bank – in an historic theft of societal right and power .
In short , before the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 congress could print it ’s own treasury notes and use the money to pay for the cost of government .
After the passage of this act Congress was forced to borrow money from a privately owned Federal Reserve Bank at interest – obviously , an immense sea-change in the nature of government finance and the structure of society .
Clearly , the “ independent ” central bank scam is one of history ’s great ruses and a device used to pry the most vital of society ’s institutions from the hands of the people and their elected representatives – over whom we have some control .
As Murray Rothbard , the Libertarian economist , noted in his last book the Fed is simply an oligarchic institution which does not belong in any Democracy or Republic ostensibly shaped and ruled by a majority of its people .
In order to both accomplish and maintain such a ruling - elite feat , first , you inform the people and their elected representatives they are not capable of handling their own affairs – despite the provision in our Constitution placing the “ purse power ” squarely in the hands of the Congress .
Yet the very reason for the people ’s purse power clause is simply that , by 1776 , the founders were well aware of what private central banks , and the “ Bank of England ” had done to the people of the European continent .
Second , you must denigrate “ democracy ” in every way possible , and attempt to make a convincing case that a slave society , like the Roman Empire , could possibly give us some lessons in the running of a democracy .
In this “ mobocracy ” strategy no attention is ever paid to the on - going idiocy and historic criminality of Monarchy , Oligarchy and Fascism thru the years .
Clearly , the ruling elite ’s basic plan of “ independent ” institutions is to place them out of the control of the very people who must bear , as in the case of our central bank , the extremely taxing and unnecessary debt and interest burdens which last for generations .
Given their distorted educations and fears for their own job security , the public ( maybe not private ) opinion of many economists and bankers today remains that the “ independence ” of a central bank is a kind of given , an institution necessary to achieve stability and progress .
Obviously , the question here is independent of whom ?
The simple answer is independent of you and I , the vast wage - laboring majority , our elected representatives , and the Constitution itself .
For decades , exactly this anti-democratic , anti-labor , mindset has been a given for any who value their continued employment in banking and consulting industries , and for media moguls whose pro-business , anti-labor , propaganda must continue on a daily basis .
Regardless , the very opposite of monetary stability and unburdened progress is the historic case given private central banks and fractional - reserve , debt - money , systems .
Therein , the very incentive for stockholders of private central banks is to generate as much money , debt , and borrowing as possible .
This secures the greatest interest and bond market profits and commissions , controls access to money and credit , escapes restrictions on the “ masters of the universe ” powers , and keeps the vast majority from having any influence over their own central banks and monetary policies .
“ A private central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army …
We must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt . ”
– Thomas Jefferson
“ Central banks were supposedly the guardians of money .
Yet , they have created the biggest liquidity bubble in history . ”
– The Economist
“ Regarding the Great Depression , you ’re right , we did it . ”
– Ben Bernanke , Federal Reserve Chairman
In practice , a private , profit - seeking , ownership of the “ Fed ” means the real owners are interested in creating as much private and government debt , with interest due , as possible .
If this were not the case then why seek ownership of the central bank stock , if not to exploit its incredible potential for profit and power over governments and leaders the world over ?
Further , it is all debt money created , with interest attached , and for which money is not simultaneously created to pay the interest over time .
Instead , money to pay interest comes out of created capital and savings .
In effect , this means that , over time , all assets head toward ownership by big bankers – an elite group with the incredible power to create busts and booms at will , and who grow ever richer amidst the impoverishment of the people .
The process therein involves The Federal Reserve Bank ordering the U.S. Treasury to print a certain amount of Federal Reserve Notes and then have the U.S.
Mint deliver them for the mere cost of printing – i.e. , money for nothing !
These Federal Reserve Notes are then lent into circulation by lending them either to congress or to the Federal Reserve Member banks .
As some economists have noted , money lent into existence would be impossible to totally repay because only the principal was lent into circulation but the principal plus interest has to be paid back .
Essentially , this privatized money creation system is what is meant by debt slavery , and is the very reason why endless wars , and both cultural and religious strife , have been manufactured over the centuries due to this debt - money creation process and its inevitable implosions and ruin .
Time and again , it has proved to be the bane of our existence .
As for prudence and responsibility , at one time , it was believed that bank reserve requirements would put a lid on lending , debt creation , and inflation .
However , with the advent of “ securitization ” – i.e. , the packaging and reselling of debt to pension funds , etc – the money - debt - interest creation process has effectively become limitless .
Today ’s dangerous mountain of personal and governmental debt , and both actual and incipient inflation , is testimony to that fact .
As ex-fed chairman , Paul Volker , once admitted : “ it is a sobering fact the prominence of central banks in this century has coincided with a general tendency toward more inflation , not less . ”
Is it any wonder why ?
- The Creature From Jekyll Island -
“ When the Federal Reserve Act was passed , the people of these United States did not perceive that a world banking system was being set up here .
A super state controlled by international bankers and international industrialists acting together to enslave the world for their own pleasure .
Every effort has been made to conceal its power but the truth is the Fed has usurped the government . ”
– Rep. Louis Mcfadden
“ To cover the fact that a central bank is merely a cartel which has been legalized , its proponents had to lay down a thick smoke screen of technical jargon focusing always on how it would supposedly benefit commerce , the public , and the nation … there was not the slightest glimmer that underneath it all , was a master plan which was designed from top to bottom to serve private interests at the expense of the public … the system is merely a cartel with a government facade . ”
– G. Edward Griffin
In practice , a private central bank cartel means the self - interest of the few pitted against the vast majority .
The “ independent ” ruse is simply one of the oldest imperialist tricks and one necessary to disarm and distract the populace .
If this oligarchic setup is so benign an arrangement , however , why then have an elected Congress ?
Why any democracy ?
More to the point , if there is no advantage or profit why then do not the owners of the “ Fed ” simply relinquish their central bank stock to the people ?
Indeed , as Thomas Jefferson noted centuries ago , a private central bank is akin to a standing foreign army on your soil .
In practice , any such central bank “ insulated ” from the people means a largely private ability to expand money supplies without any ties to production levels – as suggested by economist Milton Freidman .
Thus , this for - profit money - creation process generates inflation as well as privatizing loan choice and distribution , while eliminating any significant public imput on lending policies , and promoting central bank largesse in the form of bail - outs for member banks at taxpayer expense – often after they have wreaked currency havoc and reaped usurious interest rates .
Yesterday and today , “ purse ” powers in private hands means that money - center banks ( owners of central banks ) prefer guaranteed lending to governments in large amounts – i.e. , to the very governments and people prevented from any non-interest - bearing money creation and municipal credit due to the loss of their rightful central banking ownership and money and credit powers .
At the same time , central bank stockholders may be speculating against these same borrowers in currency markets – undermining their own client governments , generating instability , currency chaos , and need for evermore interest - bearing debt , not to mention financing both sides in costly wars and arms races .
Exactly this grossest of conflicts of interest , maximizing of debt - indenture , and insider exploitation of money and credit powers arises due to the usurpation of the people ’s powers .
In the case of the U.S. , it was a result of the successful coup represented by the “ Federal Reserve ” act of 1913 .
Inflation , corruption , and IMF - generated ruin emerge where the banking powers rest in the hands of the unelected few , and public oversight is either missing , perfunctory , or reduced to a “ Humphrey - Hawkins ” dog and pony show .
In the American case , this private money creation system scourge comes complete with taxpayer guarantees and liabilities for all Fed insider , member - bank , mischief benefiting the few while taxing the many .
In short , instability , usury , and insider loan thievery occur because the people are no longer in control of their central banks and are now prisoners of banking oligarchies both domestic and foreign .
“ The power of financial capitalism had another far - reaching aim , nothing less that to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole .
This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert , by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conference . ”
– Carroll Quigley , 1966
“ Government debt paves the way for government control .
Consider : Debt leads to taxation to pay interest .
Taxation leads to more economic control over the people by the same government that ran up the debt in the first place .
It ’s hardly extreme to conclude that escalating debt is part of a plan , such as a plan to establish a new world order . ”
– John F. McManus
“ Ruling elites are deadly serious about seeing that any renovation of the international system is in their interest .
They use a variety of carrot and stick tactics to maintain political and economic control – domestically and internationally .
Control techniques will be more vicious or less , depending on a combination of factors involving the state of the economy and , more importantly , the state of popular opposition .
The more threatening and persistent the moves to counter their plans and build alternative models , the violent will be their tactics of repression . ”
– Holly Sklar , Trilateralism
It is the mega - merchant banks and their “ bond market ” cartel which owns our central banks and gains private powers to rule mere governments via control of money and credit .
As both history and contemporary affairs reveal , the greatest threat to the peace and stability of the world is a banking system , and central banks , removed from the people ’s ownership , control , and vigilant oversight .
Inflation and currency ruin are the ultimate prices paid and , today , these twin taxes are gathering steam .
A long history of predation , panics , planned booms and busts – all precipitated by bankers gorging on the people ’s money and credit powers – is exactly why the founders vested “ purse ” powers in the people and their elected representatives .
Indeed , they were well aware of what had transpired on the European continent and how American colonies had been at the mercy of an “ independent ” Bank of England .

“ There is no reason why the banks should be in control of the Federal Reserve system . ”
– Sen . Robert Owen , 1913
If the people do not own their central bank either federally or via stock held by the several states , the so - called “ Federal ” Reserve system is simply a sham .
Indeed , the real nature of this beast is revealed in the Federal Reserve Act – i.e. , a law dictated by a robber - baron “ community of interest ” stipulating the privately - held stock of the Federal Reserve cannot be bought or sold on any stock exchange , or ever purchased by the public .
As Eustace Mullins revealed , the “ fed ” stock is passed by inheritance amongst a few , mega - wealthy , banking families via powerful banking firms which , in 1913 , made a private “ Federal ” system the law of the land .
Today , without good cause or reason , an exemption from the Freedom of Information Act prevents Americans from knowing who the real personages are behind their central bank and corporate fronts .
For his opening up an arcane and purposely obscured world to greater public understanding , and shedding new light upon the Bank of England and Federal Reserve , Eustace Mullin ’s Secrets of The Federal Reserve remains a classic .
Aside from revealing the forces behind central banks , the saga of Mullin ’s attempt to publish his book validates his thesis of a corrupt “ money power ” system .
In 1952 , Mullins was told by eighteen major publishers his material was too hot to handle and that no one in New York ( where banking interests reign ) would dare put it to print .
They candidly told him it would never be printed anywhere .
Later , Mullins was abruptly fired from his Library of Congress post after he self - published his expose of the Fed ’s history and ownership in 1952 – and became the only person ever discharged from the Library of Congress for political reasons .
As if this were not enough , in 1954 , the entire German edition of his book was seized and burned by government agents .
As Mullins relates , “ the burning of the book was upheld April 21 , 1961 by judge Israel Katz of the Bavarian Supreme Court .
The U.S. Government refused to intervene , because U.S. High Commissioner to Germany James B. Conant ( president of Harvard ) had approved the initial book burning order .
This is the only book which has been burned in Germany since World War II . ”
Alarming as any book - burning may be , it is surely not the only case of the suppression of the truth about the secretive oligarchies ruling our lives .
A pattern of interference with literary freedom appears whenever the subject of ownership of the “ Fed ” emerges .
For example , congressman Charles Lindbergh Sr. ’s
“ Why is your country at war , ” was published in 1917 and dealt with the money power and origins of war .
According to Mullins , “ Woodrow Wilson ordered government agents to seize and destroy the printing plates and copies of this book in the spring of 1918 . ”
Also , William Carr ’s study of the Rothschild dynasty had to be privately printed and , in 1915 , Baron Nathan Mayer De Rothschild went to court to keep Ignatius Balla ’s “ The Romance of the Rothschild ’s ” from being printed on the grounds portions were untrue and libelous .
The court , however , ruled in favor of Balla ’s truths .
Historically , a series of similar incidents reveals the nature of the problem .
The closer one gets to revealing the essence of enclosure , factor - imbalance , and identities of a ruling class , the more obscurity and worse is brought upon offending writers or reformers .
In a society where capital owns the media , major publishing houses , and controls appointments in government , major universities , and foundations then unemployment , defamation , and worse is easily brought upon dissidents and any set of facts some wish buried .
The experience of writers like Ezra Pound , and circumstances surrounding the assassinations of President ’s Lincoln , Garfield , and Kennedy ( all of whom were no friends of banking powers ) are enough to give anyone pause … nevertheless , information must be free and truthful .
Invariably , the critics of oligarchy , globalization , GATT - NAFTA , and a banking elite ’s “ independent ” interests are characterized as “ irrational ” , “ deranged ” , “ nationalistic ” , “ racist ” , “ anti- semitic ” and bent on seeing conspiracy .
This occurs in spite of both Adam Smith ’s and Karl Marx ’s trenchant and timeless observations , the sordid history of the “ Federal ” Reserve , and the complete lack of effective democracy in our monetary policy .
Obviously , ruling oligarchies have no reason for being nor any argument for suppressing democracy .
To survive they must rely on propaganda , repression , defamation , state terrorism , and assassination in hopes of avoiding their fate .
To better understand this on - going tyranny of capital we also need to know how , from near - absolute power over the people ’s finances , the House of Rothschild and others moved on to control , and enclose , our media and information supply .
As Kent Cooper , a former head of Associated Press , noted “ international bankers under the House of Rothschild acquired an interest in the three leading European [ news ] agencies . ”
The Rothschild group purchased Reuters in London , Havas in France , and Wolf in Germany to monopolize the news creation nexus and information - dissemination business in Europe and around the world .
Today ’s global corporate media empire is simply an extension of this trend to control information and assure capital ’s propaganda remains both dominant and ubiquitous .
Thus , in addition to land enclosures , factor imbalance , private central banks , and corruption of political systems the power of capital was immensely amplified with its ownership and control of media , and news and information sources .
A privatized media realm includes the power to control the public mind , distract and direct debate , demonize dissidents , bring a halt to reform , and disappear the entire question of a public central bank .
- Private Central Banks , Kondratieff Waves
& Anti-Semitism -
“ When ” The bankers ’ Satanic Conspiracy is the source of anti Semitism .
The sooner Jews rise up to oppose it ; the sooner anti-Semitism will end ..
Obviously , many Christians are involved .
When I criticize Rockefeller , no one says anything about ‘ anti-Christianism . ’ ”
– Henry Makow
“ Due to the hard times … the ugly side of human nature becomes apparent .
Religious fundamentalism and political extremism ( both right and left ) resurge in a clamber for radical solutions .
Racism increases as scapegoats are sought to vent frustrations ( Previous waves : anti Semitism in Europe during the 1870 ’s / 80 ’s & 1930 ’s / 40’s .
Current wave : Ethnic cleansing of the 1990’s )
There is less tolerance of unconventional sexuality ( Previous waves : Victorian morality of the 1870 ’s / 90 ’s and Hitler sent homosexuals to the gas chambers in the 1930 ’s / 40’s ) .
The current down wave has seen the rise of the religious right in US politics , with moves against abortion and less tolerance towards racial minorities and homosexuals .
Lastly , socialism becomes more popular with the masses as there is a reaction against free market economics , which is widely blamed for the adverse conditions . ”
– David McMinn
It is this writer ’s contention that Kondratieff ’s business - cycle wave theory may well be little more than a private central bank , debt - interest , bubble phenomena – in other words , a long cycle wave of debt build - up and interest accrued which eventually collapses business and society , and brings in its wake either new ruling - elite fascisms of one variety or another , or a re-capture of monetary powers by the public .
Thus , while this revolution of Kondratieff cycles may well represent simple and normal business cycle waves , in fact , they may also be generated and driven by private central bank debt bubbles and the eventual repudiations which follow .
Such traumatic cycles might well not exist nor be as wrenching were it not for the private central bank institutions feeding member bank mischief .
We are not then speaking of ordinary and more benign , supply - demand , commodity price inflations and deflations .
Again , with securitization making reserve requirement ’s relation to loans nearly meaningless today , fiat money creation has become effectively limitless , and this amidst no gold or commodity backing for the “ Fed ” currency .
In this for - profit debt creation business the sky is the limit .
Adding insult to injury , the taxpayers ( via the income tax ) are also the hapless guarantors of the bankster ’s , ruling - class , machinations ….
at interest , of course .
As things stand , few mega - banks have any public interest seats or participation on their boards , and so no non-profit or public - interest oriented impacts emerge on who gets loans and on what terms .
In short , “ our ” money is created in their interests … and until such time as the interest bubble leads to implosion , new debt replaces old , and devastation results for families and nations alike .
Despite this dismal dynamic , nations that attempt to buck the oligarchic system will likely face reprisals from powerful “ free market ” forces at odds with the interests of the vast majority .
So much for democracy … that is until ruin or revolution emerge .
After usury , predation , and ruin arise from oligarchic , undemocratic , economies controlled by ruling - elite bankers , when the inevitable crisis or depression hits then some group or other must be blamed .
Enter the Jews , Chinese , or Indians – depending on the country and continent .
Regardless of locale , due precisely to a lack of public ownership of central banks , and due to all the dismal effects flowing from oligarchic banking and economy , it is these ethnic groups whichm historically , emerge as targets … and eventually pay the price of undemocratic banking structures .
In other words , short of reform , what has happened in the past will most certainly happen in the future given that anti-semitism and worse is born and bred by “ independent ” central banks and their captive institutions – i.e. , the International Monetary Fund , World Bank , and any government controlled by the few in order to make possible the exploitation of the many .
For example , few remain aware today that after World War I , the infamous Dawes Plan for war reparations was drawn and dictated by international bankers – i.e. , the owners of central banks .
Aside from funding both sides of the conflict , it was their post - war , counterproductive , “ shock therapy ” which produced a Hitler and a virulent anti-semitism on the European continent … with devastating consequences .
Given the oligarchic structure , it is not that any one particular elite or ethnic group happens to own or control a central bank , or predominate in the banking field .
Instead , it is the institution of private central banks per se which proves a scourge upon mankind with its invitation to misfeasance , inflation , and powers of the few to dissemble democracy , social justice , and progressive economy in general .
In short , it is the structure , stupid .
Despite capital ’s media propaganda , many more people around the world today are awakening to the nature of banking tyranny , to a reality of oligarchy everywhere , and the pervasive lack of effective democratic structure in “ free market ” institutions and “ free trade ” regimes which control our lives .
We do not elect our trade representatives , our Federal Reserve board members , our United Nations representative , and we have no National Initiative with which to defeat the many corruptions of the ruling class .
In this sick milieu , as surely as night follows day , oligarchy and the predation which follows from imperialism breed backlash and movements of the people to regain their rightful powers and interests .
Today , many more “ money trust ” victims from around the world seek to overthrow both local and international oligarchies in order to come out from under the tyranny of latter - day Dawes plans and undemocratic , GATT - NAFTA , trade schemes .
The latter being an uncompensated , effectively forced , trade regime fast - tracked by capital past wage - laboring majorities .
Unsuited for a still disparate and largely undemocratic world , this sorry regime not only rewards the greater - slave and induces global oligopoly but , due to a lack of compensating and incentivizing tariffs , induces a race to the bottom in standards , and generates costly environmental ruin by greatly increasing the fossil - fuel transport of “ goods ” around the globe .
With the ruling elite ’s program of “ interdependency and “ harmonization ” not approved by the people via National Initiatives , they lack any real democratic impetus or approval of their terms .
Yet these schemes abide due to our increasing impotence and the capture of “ our ” representatives by capital ’s money machine and global media empire .
Despite the people ’s rights , wants , and needs reform still remains problematic today due to the fact that oligarchy , enclosure , and capital ’s political corruption have proceeded to the point where government itself has been disarmed by money - dependent politicians who have become captives of capital .
As a result of this sick setup , legislatures filled with capital - dependent , re-electable , politicians , and capital ’s “ free press ” all fail to represent the vast , wage - earning , majority .
Wherever society is so corrupt it can only fail as vital , balancing , reform and economic democracy cannot emerge … without getting to the endgame point of maximum ruin and exploitation .
Thus , as in the past , ruling elite predation and oligarchy will likely proceed to the point where debt bubbles and currency ruin mean that new pogroms of Jews , Chinese , or Indians become inevitable – all due to gross factor imbalance in society and ruling oligarchies fed and bred by private central banks .
Having seen this sorry dynamic emerge many times throughout history , one would think the very people in the forefront of movements to re-establish constitutional purse powers and democratic banking would be those of Jewish , Chinese , and Indian extraction .
Count one such figure in Murray Rothbard , the libertarian economist , who noted that “ if government becomes `independent of politics ’ it can only mean that that sphere of government becomes an absolute self - perpetuating oligarchy . ”
Indeed , exactly this is what the “ Federal ” Reserve , Euro - Land , and all capital - controlled institutions have become – self - perpetuating oligarchies .
Wherever such “ factor ” imbalance prevails , real reform must emerge or turmoil , terror , and revolution are assured .

“ Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist system was to debauch the currency .
By a continuing process of inflation , governments can confiscate , secretly and unobserved , an important part of the wealth of their citizens … while the process impoverishes many , it actually enriches some … who are ( then ) the object of hatred . ”

“ [ There must be ] some dilution of sovereignty , to the immediate disadvantage of those nations which now possess the preponderance of power … the establishment of a common money , might be invested in a body created by and responsible to the principal trading and investing peoples .

– John Foster Dulles , CFR Founder
“ The Fed is exactly what Karl Marx called for in the fifth plank of his Communist Manifesto …
The founders of the United States certainly had no intention of allowing the federal or state governments to issue paper money .
Never in their wildest dreams did they envisage creating a privately run central bank with vast powers to inflate and manipulate our nation ’s currency and credit …
Inflation sets the stage for the rise of a tyrant …
Older Americans have seen our nation ’s currency deteriorate from the most honest fiduciary money the world has ever known to fiat money redeemable in nothing … its value is being continually eroded by the monetary policies set by the privately run Federal Reserve …
It is not by chance that our nation ’s money degenerated from the most honest paper money in history to completely irredeemable paper money .
Nor was it by chance that the Federal Reserve replaced the U.S. Treasury as the issuer of our money .
Determined individuals planned and accomplished this change as a major step in their conspiratorial plan to steer our nation into totalitarian control and world government …
The Fed is an unconstitutionally established entity that is independent of government .
But its leaders do not operate independently of the conspiratorial force that brought it into existence .
That force , working over several generations to bring about the tyrannical `new world order ’ can be found in the membership of the Council On Foreign Relations , the Trilateral Commission , the Rhodes Scholar program , the Bilderberg movement , and numerous other organs of the `Establishment . ’
It is a force that dominates government as well as the Fed . ”

“ The powers of financial capital had another far - reaching aim , nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole .

The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basle , Switzerland , a private bank owned and controlled by the world ’s central banks which were themselves private corporations .
Each central bank , in the hands of men like Montagu Norman of the Bank of England , Benjamin Strong of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , Charles Rist of the Bank of France , and Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank , sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans , to manipulate foreign exchanges , to influence the level of economic activity in the country , and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world . ”

“ The counterfeit option is available only if a country happens to be in the unique position of having its currency accepted as the medium of international trade , as has been the case for the United States .
In that event it is possible to create money out of nothing , and other nations have no choice but to accept it …
The result is that America has continued to finance its trade deficit with fiat money – counterfeit , if you will – a feat which no other nation in the world could hope to accomplish . ”
– G. Edward Griffin
“ The infamous `conditionalities ’ policy for procuring emergency IMF loans … remains in force to this day …
The prospective recipient of money must convince inspectors it is implementing a “ realistic rate of exchange … as defined by the IMF .
The focus on the exchange rate allows the IMF to control a country ’s fiscal policy , government expenditure , tax policy , and public enterprise policy – in short , every aspect of national economic life …
The formula is invariably the same .
The debtor country is forced to slash imports , severely devalue its domestic currency ( ensuring that relative dollar - denominated debt increases by multiples ) , and impose draconian cuts in government subsidies for food and other necessaries , while opening vital areas of the national economy to foreign takeovers on the cheap , justified as `free market reforms ’ by the IMF . ”

In 1930 , the Bank For International Settlements – BIS – was created by a coterie of international bankers for the purpose of handling collection of German war debt .
Today , it functions as a central bank for central bankers .
The BIS remains a nearly invisible affair despite wielding immense powers without being subject to any democratic office , imput , or influence .
In short , not only is the BIS self - created and without political legitimacy but it wields great , behind - the - scenes , powers .
This institution emerged as a way to implement war reparation policies devised by international bankers – i.e the infamous Dawes Plan .
As mentioned , these “ shock therapy ” burdens devastated Germany after the First World War and led directly to the rise of Adolph Hitler .
Today , these same policies are plunging the rest of the world into crisis by increasing indebtedness and servitude to international bankers .
In Europe , the objective of the BIS is to remove whatever control any national central banks retain and move toward a private , European , central bank with the BIS as supranational power above and beyond any control by the people .
As for the World Bank and International Monetary fund , after the chaos of World War II , the WB and IMF were formed in 1945 at the Bretton Woods conference .
Capitalized with currency and gold from developed nations they provided credit for post - war reconstruction .
Early borrowers were the devastated nations of Europe as reconstruction took priority over new development , until the late 1950 ’s when lending to lesser - developed countries proceeded in the wake of de-colonization .
This conference gave birth to The World Bank , The International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs ( GATT ) .
In effect , the Bretton Woods did for the world what the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 did for the United States .
It provided a framework for the International Bankers to place the World into economic bondage through debt and set up the IMF to force austerity measures – in order to service debt and restructure economies , societies , and cultures according to the Banker ’s specification .
The hardships generated as a result have been legion .
Another primary reason for Bretton Woods was to stabilize currency values and prevent competitive devaluations from ruining economies and rewarding speculators – something now under way big time due to our lack of tariff freedom and absence of compensating tariffs – which would obviate having to ruin the value of one ’s own currency “ in order to compete . ”
Originally , the IMF was to be a currency stabilization fund , enabling governments to intervene to maintain currency values by protecting them from speculators and “ market forces . ”
After wreckage and war emerged from the Dawes Plan and Great Depression , Bretton Woods was then ostensibly intended to limit the influence which private , unelected , bankers exerted in international finance .
Several decades later , President Nixon removed the dollar from a gold peg in 1971 , and Bretton Woods , in effect , ended .
As a result , currencies could then fluctuate freely and be driven by the whims of speculators , allowing destruction of stable economies by speculators in a “ casino ” environment .
Given their structure , the IMF and World Bank function as instruments of a global financial oligarchy – i.e. , one demanding private central banks and power to implement shock therapies serving bank interests by destroying the wealth , freedom , economic diversity and independence of people everywhere .
In practice , the World Bank , IMF , and BIS impose conditions determined by private capital – i.e. , the unelected .
While giving lip service to “ public ” objectives , a capital - controlled World Bank - IMF continues to prop up despotic regimes while undermining democracy and domestic freedom and economy .
As a result , democratic trade processes are denied and “ free market ” enclosures , privatizations , foreign - debt , and import - export regimes enriching multinationals are imposed .
Working together , WB - IMF - BIS policies and GATT remove decision - making powers from the people and give capital a veto power in international , unelected , tribunals and private central banks removed from the people ’s influence .
With World Bank loans come debt burdens and explicit conditions on capital use – which translate into implicit ones on allowable forms of politics , culture , and economy .
This means western - style cultural domination .
Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers revealed the intent when he stated “ countries that do the right things will be rewarded with rapid capital inflows .
Those that do things wrong are punished . ”
Given the IMF ’s makeup , any democratic freedom and wage - labor power is seen as “ wrong . ”
Another former Treasury Secretary , Robert Rubin , stated the real goal : “ ending the Link between human rights and trade is a very good objective to shoot for . ”
Very Good ?
Capital ’s agenda here means we must sever economy from morality and from any assessment of human rights , democratic prerogative , and environmental condition .
Given this amoral “ engagement ” ethic , with the people ’s own money and loan guarantees banking elites proceed to reward the “ efficient ” and punish more democratic , wage - labor oriented , systems as well as ecologically conservative and communal styles of life and economy .
A “ World Bank ” controlled by capital enriches mega-contractors , multinationals , and dictators as long as they do the “ right ” thing .
What “ doing the right thing ” means is capitalist code for destroying labor unions , persecuting dissenters , defeating native land rights , perfecting enclosure , and crushing institutions threatening to capital ’s hegemony .
Not only is the “ right ” thing determined by the few but those working to preserve natural liberty , sovereignty , cooperative organization , and seeking labor and land reforms are often abused , imprisoned , or exterminated for their resistance to capital ’s forced interdependency .
Once nations have significant foreign debt burdens ( often undertaken by desperate rulers without the approval of the people ) they find they have little alternative or freedom of dissent without incurring the wrath of institutions able to dictate the terms of “ their ” culture , economy , and trade .
This neo -slavery emerges as a result of our lack of public ownership of central banks and a media now dominated by capital – see www.editorfreedom.com.
Aide from the debilitating and disastrous mountain of public and private , interest - bearing , debt since the advent of the Fed our currency has shrunk in value by over 4 % per year .
As a result of imprudent , profit - seeking , management of “ our ” currency by bankers and “ deficits do n’t matter ” politicians alike , the value of the dollar has fallen over 95 % in value since the inception of the Fed , and some 30 % in the past year or so against other major currencies – the latter decline due largely to the lack of compensating tariff arrangements appropriate for a still very disparate and undemocratic world , and a deliberate , beggar - thy - neighbor , policy of currency ruin .
With the removal of tariff freedom and rational trade policies due to GATT - NAFTA ( another ruling class coup similar to the Fed scheme ) monetary officials are now purposely driving down the value of our dollar today to try to eliminate horrendous trade imbalances .
By attempting to substitute monetary policy for trade policy , the value of all our assets and savings , national and personal , are driven downward .
In effect , currency ruin is the greatest of tariffs , and everything we must now import to live ( because “ free trade ” has nearly wiped out domestic producers ) costs more … and then more again due to deliberate currency decline .
So much for the benefits of forced free trade , for “ universal gain ” trade ideology and monetary stability .

“ All money is created in the form of debt to the privately owned banking cartel .
Imagine if you could create money out of thin air .
Imagine you have the credit cards of all the nations in your pocket .
Your first impulse is to lend money to your nominees so they can buy most of the world ’s real wealth for you .
Your second impulse is to establish a totalitarian system ( “ world government ” globalization ) to prevent any nation from challenging this system or defaulting on their “ debt ” to you .
To make them accept “ world government , ” you need to weaken them by having them fight among themselves , run up huge debts for armaments ( which you will sell them ) , kill off the cream of their manhood , and become demoralized and decadent .
You accomplish this through your ownership of politicians and the press and your control of MI - 6 , CIA who will carry out assassinations and acts of terror .

“ In the United States , in particular , the ability of the upper and upper - middle classes to dominate the marketplace of ideas has generally allowed these strata to shape the entire society ’s perception of political reality and the range of realistic political and social possibilities .

– Benjamin Ginsberg , The Captive Public
The “ free press ” envisioned by our forefathers is now owned and corporate - controlled by the same few hands who control our central bank .
With capital controlling both money and media it results in a nearly insurmountable oligarchy , and removes the people from effective power over their lives .
Only the internet remains today to allow people to find out the truth of their captivity , and work together to emerge from neo-slavery and corporate - state propaganda .
Despite the people ’s rights , wants , and needs , real banking reform remains problematic due to the fact that oligarchy , enclosure , and capital ’s political corruption have proceeded to the point where not only banking and key governmental posts but money - dependent politicians and major media sources have become organs of capital – with balance and fairness a thing of the past .
As a result , legislatures filled with capital - dependent , re-electable , politicians , now cower before capital ’s media and fail to represent the vast , wage - earning , majority .
In short , the Fourth Estate has become the First .

Wherever democracy is so eviscerated and fraudulent it can only fail and necessary reforms cannot emerge .
As a result , both predation and oligarchy proceed to the point where ruin and revolution occur , and with it new pogroms of Jews , Chinese , or Indians ( depending upon the country ) become inevitable .
All such ruin , terrorism , and “ kill the rich ” retribution are due to the maintenance of what I term a gross “ factor ” imbalance in society – i.e. , an imbalance of power between labor and capital ( see this writer ’s Cap - Com , The Economics of Balance ) .
It is the primary reason ruling oligarchies emerge and lead to monetary excesses fed and bred by their private central banks .
Having seen this sorry dynamic emerge so many times throughout history , one would think the very people in the forefront of movements to re-establish constitutional purse powers and democratic banking would be those of Jewish , Chinese , and Indian extraction .
Count one such figure in Murray Rothbard , who noted the obvious fact in his last book ( The Case Against The Fed ) that “ if government becomes `independent of politics ’ it can only mean that that sphere of government becomes an absolute self - perpetuating oligarchy . ”
Indeed , exactly this is what the “ Federal ” Reserve , Euro - Land , and all capital - controlled institutions have become – self - perpetuating oligarchies .
Wherever such rude imbalance prevails , real reform must either emerge or turmoil , terror , and revolution are assured .
In sum , for those interested in central bank history and reform the following books are critical : The Case Against the Fed by Murray Rothbard , The Creature From Jekyl Island by G. Edward Griffin , The Secrets Of The Federal Reserve by Eustace Mullins , The Legalized Crime Of Banking by Silas Walter Adams , Confessions of an Economic Hit Man by John Perkins , and The Coming Battle by M.W. Walbert – a book lost , or rather buried , for over one hundred years which contains valuable insight and the hidden history about the battle over banking from the very founding of the Republic .
Together , these essential books reveal the largely unknown history of central banks , explain their machinations , and serve to counter the pervasive “ independent ” central bank propaganda .
It is our politicians who must re-educate themselves on this matter and gather the courage to change a destructive , undemocratic , and unconstitutional banking system , as well as a corrupt campaign - finance and media regime .
These ideas , debates , and reforms must come into being for us to emerge from a ruthless and counterproductive global oligarchy .
Without new knowledge for the electorate and new courage from our representatives we cannot stop predation and ruin , prevent future pogroms , or ever hope to render a dismal and undemocratic banking structure a part of history and not of our future .
K.W .

- How to Bring Economic Democracy to the U.S.A. -
A Proposal that Would Require the Following Amendment to the Federal Constitution :
AMENDMENT XXVIII
Money and Credit – Congress Asserts Power To Coin Money , and Emit Bills of Credit
[ SECTION 1 . ]
The Congress hereby asserts the power , granted in this Constitution , to coin money , and to regulate the value thereof .
–
And further , to emit non-interest - bearing bills of credit directly through the Treasury Department ( on the Credit , and in the Name of the People ) .
[ SECTION 2 . ]
The Congress hereby authorizes the Treasury to issue a sufficient quantity of “ dollars ” to purchase back the capital stock of the Federal Reserve Bank from the private owners , by eminent domain .
[ SECTION 3 . ]
The Federal Reserve Bank shall henceforth be subsumed into the Treasury , and function as a Sub - Treasury Central Bank of issue .
Henceforth they shall be one institution , and be called , formally , the Treasury of the Common - wealth of the United States of America , or commonly , “ The Treasury of Common - wealth . ”
[ SECTION 4 . ]
The Treasury of Common - wealth , as the fountainhead of Credit - Creation in the nation shall henceforth issue as Money only non-interest - bearing Notes , and Mint coins of pure Specie , stamped with their weight and fineness .
The books , accounts and records of the Treasury shall continually be open to public scrutiny .
[ SECTION 5 . ]
The Treasury of Common - wealth shall honor , and continue to pay ( by means of non-interest - bearing notes , and checks ) the interest on all out - standing U. S. Treasury Securities , as they come due .
There shall be no further issues of Treasury Securities , or Bonds .
[ SECTION 6 . ]
The State Treasury departments , of each of the fifty States , are also hereby empowered , by the same creative principle [ formerly given by charter to banks ] to create Credit within their own jurisdictions , in the form of checks , signed by the State comptrollers , in accordance with appropriations made by the State legislatures , for the purpose of maintaining State institutions , infrastructure , and salaries .
[ SECTION 7 . ]
In accordance with the provisions of this Article , all banks and financial institutions in America shall receive new charters from the Treasury .
The Treasury shall henceforth have the unique and sole power within the nation to create Credit – a function formerly granted by the government ( and thus erroneously delegated ) only to Banks .
Henceforth private banks may charge interest , to service accounts .
[ SECTION 8 . ]
In Sum , this Article defines , and enhances the powers granted to Congress and the Treasury , under Article I , Section 8 , Clause 5 , of this Constitution .
Furthermore , it amends and modifies Article II , Section 10 , Clause 1 , to empower State Treasuries to create ( a limited amount of ) non-inflationary Credit , in the form of check book money in order to meet the pressing needs of the states .

I know we all love Ruby , and does n’t care that much about not having auto completion / IntelliSense available .
I do n’t care that much about auto completion , when coding in Ruby , myself .
What I really like in Java IDEs is their refactoring support .
Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA are simply awesome in this space for Java .
We still have ReSharper for Visual Studio and others , targeting other languages .
Ruby has NetBeans , Aptana RadRails , RubyMine and TurboRuby / 3rdRail doing a great job in this area .
But , I have this feeling that most of Ruby developers do not use IDEs ( including myself ) .
We are using good text editors , such as TextMate , Vim , Emacs and GEdit .
They are good enough .
Why would I need something else ?
I have to admit .
I really miss some refactorings while programming in Ruby .
Particularly , the lack of “ Extract Method ” and “ Extract Variable ” bothers me .
They are n’t even complicated , why has n’t someone already implemented them ?
So , I would like to introduce Rfactor .
It is a Ruby gem , which aims to provide common and simple refactorings for Ruby code .
RubyParser from Ryan Davis is being used to analyze and manipulate the source code AST , in the form of Sexps .
In theory , we should be able to use Rfactor to power any editor , adding refactoring capabilities to it .
I ’m targeting TextMate , but I would love to see contributions for others .
The TextMate Bundle is hosted on github :
Rfactor TextMate Bundle , with installation instructions
This very first release has support only for basic “ Extract Method ” : inside methods and without trying to guess the method parameters and return .
Stay in touch , there is much more coming !
( CNN ) -- Sonic booms and at least one fireball in the sky were reported in Texas on Sunday , less than a week after two satellites collided in space and a day after the Federal Aviation Administration asked U.S. pilots to watch for " falling space debris , " authorities said .
Video captured in Austin , Texas , shows a meteor - like object in the sky Sunday morning .
There were no reports of ground strikes or interference with aircraft in flight , FAA spokesman Roland Herwig said .
Herwig told CNN the FAA received no reports from pilots in the air of any sightings but the agency recieved " numerous " calls from people on the ground from Dallas , Texas , south to Austin , Texas .
Video shot by a photographer from News 8 TV in Austin showed what appeared to be a meteor - like white fireball blazing across a clear blue sky Sunday morning .
The photographer caught the incident while covering a marathon in Austin .
On Saturday , the FAA told pilots through its routine notification system that " a potential hazard may occur due to re-entry of satellite debris into the earth 's atmosphere . "
The notice did not specify a time or location .
Watch video of meteor - like fireball »
Herwig said most of the reports the FAA received came in about midday Sunday in an area of Texas from Dallas south to Austin .
iReport.com : Did you see the fireball ?
Send photos , video
He said he was not certain where the information that sparked the FAA notification came from , but it was " probably from NORAD , " or the North American Aerospace Defense Command , which tracks man-made objects in space .
Calls to NORAD headquarters in Colorado were not immediately returned .
Lisa Block , spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety , said her agency had received calls from residents surprised by sonic booms about 11 a.m .
She said calls came from an area from Dallas to Houston .
Last week , the Russian and U.S. space agencies said two satellites , one Russian and one American , collided about 496 miles ( 800 kilometers ) above Siberia , Russia .
The collision on Tuesday produced two large debris clouds , NASA said .
The satellites collided at 6.2 miles ( 10 kilometers ) per second , producing 500 to 600 pieces of space debris , the U.S. Strategic Command said .
CNN 's Monte Plott contributed to this report .

OpenLisp by Eligis A full and efficient ISO / IEC 13816:2007 ( E ) ISLISP Implementation ( The latest stable version is 10.9.0 - Release date : 2020 -05-08 )
Home site is always :
http://www.eligis.com
OpenLisp is a KISS ( Keep It Stupid Simple ) full conforming implementation of ISO / IEC 13816:2007 ISLISP Language , the International Standard version of Lisp .
Entirely written in C , OpenLisp has been ported on more than 90 different architectures ( compiler / OS / processor ) from small 16 bits MS - DOS systems to 64 bits systems such as DEC Alpha processor .
All major processors ( Intel 16/32 bits , Intel IA64 , AMD / Intel EM64T , Sparc 32 bits and UltraSparc 64 bits , Motorola 68 k and 88 k , RS6000 , PowerPC , MIPS R3000/ R4x00/R8000/R10000 , HP PA 32 and 64 bits mode , Alpha 32 and 64 bits mode , IBM s390 , StrongARM , VAX ) are supported .
It even runs on Pocket PC .
OpenLisp is essentially a very fast interpreter ( see benchmarks ) that competes in speed with some CLtL compilers .
It also has a compiler that produce LAP to be interpreted by a native virtual machine .
You can even make standalone applications using the C code backend that also will make your code run from 10 to 20 times faster .
OpenLisp is written in ISO C for the kernel and using POSIX like interface for the operating System when available .
In the usual case , a new UNIX port is as simple as : $ ./ configure ; make ; make install
The goal of OpenLisp is to provide an efficient , modern and complete Lisp System for those whom want embedded Lisp processing in more conventional applications written in C , C++ , Java or Visual Basic .
Even if OpenLisp can be used with a toplevel loop and with all goodies that an old - timer lisp user enjoy , it is more tailored to be transparently integrated in native C or C++ applications .
For this purpose , OpenLisp is distributed mainly as a Lisp library ( or DLL on Microsoft world ) that you can integrate into your main application .
It can also be compiled as a COM or CORBA server .
The memory footprint is very small with less than 200 Kbytes for the complete kernel and less than 400 Kbytes for a usable Lisp System data .
There is no limit on the maximum memory that the System can use .
With little efforts , you can exchange data between C and Lisp .
OpenLisp extends the ISLISP standard to ease port from other Lisp Language , mainly Common Lisp .
The kernel can be compiled to support the UNICODE IS0 / IEC 10646 - 1:1993 ( 16 bits ) character sets with UTF - 16 encoding instead of the IS0 8859 - 1 ( 8 bits ) character sets .
It also provides a consistent interface to communicate using Lisp streams with BSD , POSIX sockets and / or WinSocks sockets .
Main features : Conforming implementation of ISO / IEC 13816:2007 ( E ) ISLISP Language .
Library extensions : defstructs , hash - tables , profiler , editors , sequence , regular expressions ...
High level of portability (> 90 systems from 16 to 64 bits processors - list here ) .

Monkeys that can fit in a teacup , chameleons the size of your thumbnail and hummingbirds that are easily mistaken for insects are just a few examples of the amazingly small creatures found in nature .
Many of the world ’s tiniest animals are found in what used to be relatively untouched , secluded areas like the island of Madagascar off the southeast coast of Africa , but are now threatened due to human activity .
Others are simply aberrations of nature , like Thumbelina , the 17 - inch - tall horse .
One thing that all of these creatures have in common other than small stature , however , is the fact that they ’re insanely cute .
Pygmy Marmoset
The tree - dwelling pygmy marmoset is the world ’s smallest monkey , with adults only reaching up to 5 inches in length and 6 ounces in weight .
And when they ’re babies , like these albino twins born at the Frösö Zoo in Ostersund , Sweden in 2006 , they ’re exceedingly tiny and unbelievably cute .
Pygmy marmosets , whose natural habitat is the western Amazon rainforest of South America , make a lot of loud noises for their tiny size – their whistles and squeals travel far throughout the jungle .
Kitti’s Hog-nosed Bat
The kitti’s hog - nosed bat – otherwise known as the bumblebee bat – is the smallest mammal known to man .
These little creatures weigh roughly the same as a dime ( about 2 grams ) and measure a miniscule 30 to 40 millimeters as adults .
They have large ears , reddish - brown fur and noses that resemble that of a pig , hence the name .
They were thought to be living only in a small area of Thailand but have recently been found in the adjacent country of Myanmar .
Brookesia Minima Chameleon
The Brookesia Minima chameleon is among the smallest reptiles in the world , measuring under an inch long .
Barely discernible among the bark and leaves of Madagascar , the Brookesia Minima ( also called the Minute leaf chameleon ) looks just like a full - sized chameleon , shrunk down to the size of your thumbnail .
Paedocypris Carp
The Paedocypris carp is the smallest known fish in the world , found in the peat swamps of Sumatra in 2006 .
Adults grow only to about 7.9 millimeters .
This unusual species has a rudimentary skull which leaves the brain exposed , and it feeds primarily on plankton .
Scientists warn that the species is at great risk of extinction due to the destruction of Indonesian peat swamps for palm oil plantations .
Philippine Tarsier
The bug-eyed , furry little Philippine Tarsier has been called “ the world ’s smallest monkey ” , but it ’s not actually a monkey at all .
Scientists have loosely classified them as primates for lack of anywhere else to put them , since they ’re extremely unique .
They spend all day sleeping in cavities and hollows formed in tree trunks and emerge at night to hunt insects .
They average 3 to 6 inches in length with another 5 to 11 inches in their tail .
Fun fact about the tarsier : its eyes are literally bigger than its stomach .
Bee Hummingbird
The diminutive bee hummingbird is the smallest bird in the world – or at least , the male is ; females are slightly larger .
Native to Cuba , the bird weighs in at a mere 1.8 grams and reaches a length of about 2 inches .
The human retina ca n’t even detect the rapid 80 - beats - per - second movement of this extremely small creature ’s wings , and it ’s easy to mistake it for an insect if you ’re not looking carefully at it .
Its nest is smaller than a doll ’s teacup and its eggs are smaller than coffee beans .
Leptotyphlops Carlae Snake
The world ’s smallest snake was discovered in Barbados in August of 2008 .
Named Leptotyphlops carlae , the snake is as thin as a spaghetti noodle and an adult can curl up comfortably on a quarter .
The species is believed to be rare , since its habitat is being replaced by buildings and farms .
Scientists believe that this Barbados snake is either at or near the smallest possible size that a snake can be .
It likely feeds primarily on the larvae of ants and other insects .
Hippocampus Denise Seahorse
The Hippocampus denise seahorse is no bigger than most human fingernails at about 16 millimeters from the its snout to the tip of its tail .
It ’s so small that experts had previously believed it to be the young of the next smallest seahorse species , the Hippocampus bargibanti .
It ’s hard to even discern most Hippocampus denise seahorses from the coral they live in off the coast of Indonesia .
Mouse Lemur
It resembles the Philippine Tarsier , but the Mouse Lemur of Madagascar is officially the smallest primate in the world at 2.25 to 4.75 inches .
They rarely leave the trees they live in and are nocturnal , so it ’s not too surprising that of the eight Mouse Lemur species , several were just recently identified .
They ’re endangered due to the loss of their limited forest habitat .
Pink Fairy Armadillo
Okay , so maybe this one is n’t adorable at all .
When you hear the words “ pink fairy ” , you probably do n’t immediately think of a burrowing mammal with rough pink armor and creepy long nails .
The pink fairy armadillo is a rather strange creature , and is n’t seen very often .
It ’s the smallest armadillo and the only one with a dorsal shell that ’s almost completely separate from its body .
It lives in the dry grasslands and sandy plains of central Argentina and measures 3.3 to 4.6 inches .
Monte Iberia Eleuth Frog
Another tiny creature that was only recently discovered is the Monte Iberia Eleuth Frog , which was discovered on a mountain in Cuba .
Specimens that measure just 8.5 millimeters have been found , putting it in the running for the title of world ’s smallest frog .
The current record holder , the Brazilian gold frog , measures about 9 millimeters .
Very little is known about the Monte Iberia Eleuth other than the fact that it ’s critically endangered .
Mr. Peebles , World ’s Smallest Cat
In addition to incredibly small species , there are also the occasional tiny specimens of species that are generally much larger .
Among them is Mr. Peebles , deemed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the smallest living cat .
When this photo was taken Mr. Peebles was two years old , weighed just over two pounds , measured about 5 inches long and fit perfectly into a pint glass .
Mr. Peebles has a genetic defect and must be fed at least four times a day to sustain his weight .
Ducky , World ’s Smallest Dog
At just 1.4 pounds and 4.9 inches tall , Ducky the Chihuahua is the world ’s tiniest dog .
Ducky is three years old and easily beat the previous record holder , another Chihuahua who stood at 5.4 inches tall , but is by no means the smallest adult dog ever recorded .
That honor belongs to a dwarf Yorkshire terrier who reached just 2.8 inches .
Peewee , World ’s Smallest Hamster
Peewee is an adult hamster that measures less than an inch in length and weighs less than an ounce .
Compared to a normal - sized hamster , Peewee practically looks like a newborn .
His owner believes he just stopped growing around three weeks old and says he has a massive appetite , squeezing in between his brothers and sisters to get his fill .
Thumbelina , World ’s Smallest Horse
The world ’s smallest horse is just 17 inches tall , barely larger than a house cat .
Born on a farm owned by a couple who breeds miniature horses , Thumbelina was tiny even compared to the rest of the couple ’s horses , who typically reach about 34 inches in height when fully grown .
She weights just 60 pounds and her size has been attributed to dwarfism , making her “ a miniature of a miniature ” .

C# covariance and contravariance by example
One of the new features of C# 4.0 is generic covariance and contravariance .
Admit it : your heart rate just went up .
This is about the most intimidating - sounding , beardy - academic feature to come into C# since they stopped calling it " C Octothorpe . "
( Which Windows Live Writer wants me to change to " C Clodhopper . "
Unusual dictionary you have there , chaps . )
You feel that at any moment Philip Wadler is going to spring out of a bush and explain to you that it refers to contravariant functors on the poset category of types .
And then he 'll make you sit an exam on it .
And then you 'll realise that you came out without any trousers on and you 're being hunted for sport by a jar of marmalade .
In fact , covariance and contravariance are scary terms for a very simple and familiar concept .
Imagine you have the following function :
Apply ( Transform t) { ... }
When you call this function , you do n't have to pass a Transform .
You can also pass a reference of any type derived from Transform -- say , RotateTransform or ScaleTransform :
Transform t = new Transform ( ) ;
Apply(t ) ; // okay
RotateTransform rt = new RotateTransform ( ) ;
Apply ( rt ) ; // also okay
Why is this okay ?
To the C# compiler , it 's okay because RotateTransform derives from Transform .
But conceptually , the reason it 's okay is that if Apply can deal with any arbitrary Transform , it can certainly deal with a RotateTransform .
But now suppose Apply looks like this :
Apply ( IEnumerable < Transform > ts ) { ... }
By the same logic , when you call this function , you do n't have to pass something typed as IEnumerable < Transform > .
The C# compiler knows it 's okay to pass anything that derives from ( implements ) IEnumerable < Transform > -- say , List < Transform > or ReadOnlyCollection < Transform >.
But after this point , what you should conceptually be able to do diverges from what the C# compiler will let you do .
Conceptually , you should also be able to pass an IEnumerable < RotateTransform > :
IEnumerable < RotateTransform > rts = new List < RotateTransform >( ) ;
Apply ( rts ) ;
After all , if Apply can deal with a sequence of arbitrary Transforms , it can surely deal with a sequence of RotateTransforms , right ?
Right .
But the C# compiler , in C# 3 and earlier , does n't see it that way .
Although you and I can work out that IEnumerable < RotateTransform > is compatible with IEnumerable < Transform > , it does n't derive from IEnumerable < Transform > .
So the C# compiler goes into fits of CS1503 errors and flounces off in a huff .
In summary , the C# compiler understands that it 's okay to vary the type of an argument , but does n't understand that it 's okay to vary the type of a generic type parameter .
And generic variance just means fixing that : teaching the compiler that it is okay to pass an IEnumerable < RotateTransform > to a function that expects an IEnumerable < Transform > .
Hang on , though .
The feature is called covariance and contravariance .
Why do we need two names for this stuff ?
Is n't it just inheritance ?
Let 's look in more detail .
When you vary the type of an argument , you can only vary it in the direction of more derived .
Passing a RotateTransform to a function that expects a Transform is okay .
Passing an Object to a function that expects a Transform is not okay .
This is probably so ingrained you do n't even have to think about it .
When you vary the type of the generic type parameter to IEnumerable < Transform > , the same rule applies .
A function that can deal with a sequence of Transforms can deal with a sequence of RotateTransforms , but not with a sequence of arbitrary objects .
Same rule , right ?
Right .
But only because of a specific characteristic of IEnumerable <T > .
In other cases , it turns out that the rule has to be the other way round : you can only vary the type parameter in the direction of less derived .
For example , suppose we have a function that takes an IComparer <T > :
Compare ( IComparer < Transform > c ) { ... }
If we use the IEnumerable rule and call this function with an IComparer < RotateTransform > , we have a problem .
The function expects to be able to use the IComparer to compare arbitrary Transform objects .
If it decides to compare a ScaleTransform and a TranslateTransform , our IComparer < RotateTransform > will be dreadfully embarrassed .
We can't use derived types after all .
On the other hand , suppose we call this function with an IComparer < object > .
How will it cope ?
Very nicely , thank you .
IComparer < object > can compare arbitrary objects , so it can easily cope with the specific requirement of comparing Transforms .
So we can pass a base type in place of the expected type .
So sometimes the rule is that we can only vary in the direction of more derived , and sometimes the rule is that we can only vary in the direction of less derived ( more base ) .
How do we -- and the C# compiler -- know which rule applies in any given case ?
The answer -- simplifying somewhat -- is that it depends on whether the generic type parameter appears in output or input positions .
In IEnumerable < Transform > , Transform appears in an output position .
( It appears in the return value of GetEnumerator . )
Now if Transform appears in an output position , then any user of the generic type -- such as the Apply method -- expects to be receiving Transforms , and knows how to deal with them .
So it can certainly deal with derived types such as RotateTransform .
Moreover , Transform appears only in an output position .
So the Apply method can't bust out a ScaleTransform and try to get our RotateTransform - specific implementation to accept it : there 's no in - parameter through which Apply can try to feed us the ScaleTransform .
In IComparer < Transform > , Transform appears in input positions .
( It appears as the inputs to the Compare method . )
Now if Transform appears in an input position , then a user of the generic type -- such as the Compare method -- is going to give us Transforms , and expect us to deal with them .
So we need to be able to deal with Transforms at least , but if we can deal with more things -- i.e. a base type -- then that 's not going to do any harm .
Moreover , Transform appears only in an input position .
So the IComparer implementation can't return a base type instance to its user : there 's no out - parameter or return value through which we could sneak out an Object which the Compare method would n't be expecting .
So the rule is : if a type parameter appears only in an output position , you can vary it in the more derived direction , and if a type parameter appears only in an input position , you can vary it in the less derived ( base type ) direction .
And in fact this is the terminology that gets used in the C# 4 language .
The interfaces we 've been discussing would now have the following signatures :
IEnumerable < out T> { ... }
IComparer < in T > { ... }
The annotations tell the compiler that the annotated parameter appears only in output or input positions , as appropriate .
When defining the generic type , the compiler verifies that this is indeed the case .
When performing type checking , the compiler allows variance of the type parameter up or down the class hierarchy according to how the parameter is annotated .
Note , incidentally , that these annotations are per type parameter , and different parameters can have different annotations .
For example , in Converter < TInput , TOutput > , TInput appears only in input positions , and TOutput -- well , you can guess where TOutput appears .
So suppose we have a method like this :
Parse ( Converter < string , Transform > c ) { ... }
We could give it a Converter < object , Transform > because a converter that can cope with arbitrary objects will eat strings for breakfast .
We could give it a Converter < string , RotateTransform > because if the Parse method is braced to get an arbitrary Transform back then it will be perfectly happy to get a RotateTransform .
And of course we can vary both type parameters and give it a Converter < object , RotateTransform > .
Note also that if a type parameter appears in both input and output positions , it can't be varied in either direction .
Consider a method that takes an IList < Transform > :
MysteryFunc( IList < Transform > ts ) { ... }
Can we safely pass it an IList < object >?
No , because its implementation might look like this :
MysteryFunc( IList < Transform > ts )
{
Transform t = ts [ 0 ] ;
}
If ts is a List < object > and ts [ 0 ] happens to be a Llama , then MysteryFunc will rapidly get a lot more mysterious .
So how about the other direction ?
Can we safely pass it an IList < RotateTransform >?
Once again the answer is no :
MysteryFunc( IList < Transform > ts )
{
ts.Add(new ScaleTransform ( ) ) ;
}
For what it 's worth , if you use arrays , C# does allow you to vary the array type in the " more derived " direction , for example passing a string [ ] where an object [ ] is expected .
As you now know , this would be okay if the array element type appeared only in output positions , but this is not the case with arrays , which leads to trouble :
PimpMyArray ( object [ ] objs )
{
objs [ 0 ] = new Llama ( ) ;
}
PimpMyArray ( new string [ 1 ] ) ;
The compiler is happy .
The program , and the Llama , experience the ignominious fate of an ArrayTypeMismatchException .
Very well , one last detail .
I remarked that Transform appeared only in an output position of IEnumerable < Transform > .
Conceptually , that 's true : if you have an IEnumerable < Transform > , you can only get Transforms out , you can't put them in .
Syntactically , it 's a complete lie .
What appears in an output position is actually IEnumerator < Transform > .
The reason I was able to get away with this cheat is that , in IEnumerator < Transform > , Transform also appears only in output positions .
( It 's the type of the Current property , and Current is read - only . )
An output of an output is going to be an output .
If we had an IComparerFactory < T> interface where an IComparer < T > appeared as an output , bearing in mind that in IComparer T appears as an input , things would get messier .
At this point my head for one starts spinning and I enter a bizarre world where I briefly think I understand Haskell monads , and then that damn jar of marmalade comes after me again .
See Eric Lippert 's helpfully named article Higher Order Functions Hurt My Brain if you want to know what happens in this kind of situation .
The scary terms ?
If you care , covariance refers to the output case , and contravariance to the input case .
My mnemonic for these is that covariance goes in the same direction as normal instance argument type variance , and contravariance goes in the opposite ( " contra " ) direction .
Eric Lippert explains the formal terminology and the type - theoretical underpinnings in part one of his eleven - part ( so far ) series .
But from the strictly pragmatic point of view , all you need to know is that " covariance and contravariance " means that you can now pass inexact generic types when it 's safe to do so , just as you can pass inexact argument types when it 's safe to do so .
And that 's not too scary at all .

Nice post !
And thanks for the links .
The only clarifying point I would add to your excellent post is that generic variance only works if there are reference type conversions on the varying type arguments .
That is , you can convert from IE to IE only if Foo goes to Bar via a built - in reference type conversion .
User - defined conversions , boxing conversions , unboxing conversions , and so on , cannot be used in variance , so IE does not go to IE even though int goes to object via a boxing conversion .
The reason for this is that a variant conversion is nothing more than a " reinterpretation " of the bits that are in memory .
All those other kinds of conversions actually transform the bit pattern in memory , from a 32 bit int to possibly a 64 bit handle to a boxed int , say .
Variance only works because we can enforce the condition that we are merely telling the CLR to reinterpret existing memory , not creating new data .

I was reading into C# generics variance since hours and somehow could n't get into my brain why contravariance is needed ( sometimes you just " stand on the pipe " as germans say ) - after reading your article I 've finally got it .

More from this Author I know that I can be crucified for this article .
But I do n’t really care .
It is my opinion , I have been thinking like that ( and about that ) for a long time .
I think we should all consider it seriously and try to develop serious efforts in this sense .
This is really about our balance as societies and individuals , and the prevalence of constructive and positive bonds over deception and global destruction .
We human beings know instinctively and through our life experiences that there are human beings among us who have moral holes , a moral vacuum , lack of empathy , extreme and destructive hate inside them , very cunning manipulative skills – all these characteristics harm both other individuals and the society , mining its long - term goals , destroying solidarity , spreading unseen or not witnessed crime and persecution , destroying bonds , potentials , dreams and lives .
We cannot live deluded in wonderland saying to ourselves that such humans do n’t exist .
On the other hand , once we admit that such humans do exist , our knowledge brings responsibility with it : we have to recognize how harmful are the consequences of their actions and take serious measures to prevent those from happening .
Anybody who studied a bit of psychology or the functioning of the human mind knows that we can differentiate clearly several types of human personalities , and while many are constructive or innocuous , a few of them are extremely toxic , destructive by nature , cruel , unchangeable , extremely manipulative and harming to others .
We know this is true , and the harm and pain that these personalities provoke in others , the destruction they leave behind them as well as their impunity , cannot be collectively ignored .
It would be extremely irresponsible to do so .
Most people commit mistakes , are occasionally selfish , have flaws , have feelings , have guilt , have reparation needs , have dreams , have doubts , have occasional conflicts ( and not extremely unsurpassable ones , as they also have a sense of negotiation , flexibility and empathy ) , mostly try to build positive relationships and bonds , they can lie occasionally about minor things with no greatly harming consequences , above all they love truth and its priceless outcomes for their lives , they have empathy , have feelings , have a sense of the right and wrong , have affective resonance and sensibility , have problems and dilemmas , suffer , have sense of humor , have creativity , have a sense of fidelity , a sense of community and a sense of responsibility , and a need to trust and bond in spite of anything .
We do know that the level of negative impact of the most harming personalities is profoundly and qualitatively different : they do n’t feel guilt ( but are experts in taking advantage of guilty feelings of others ) , they do n’t have a sense of right and wrong ( which allows any behaviour to be “ legitimate ” ) , they do n’t feel or hardly feel anything ( but can mimic human emotions masterfully ) , do n’t have empathy and can’t feel true sadness , are unscrupulous , they hurt compulsively , emotionally blood - suck others , and have a deep love for lies and deception , a fatal attraction to power , they attack other humans ’ self - esteem , self - confidence and reality perception in several ways , are sadistic , manipulate and cheat , and are driven by destruction impulses and death desires .
They represent the dark side of humanity , where we do n’t want to look in .
And we know all those things about them also scientifically – it is not hard to understand , as it is part of everyone ’s common experience .
Most people are in fact qualitatively different from psychopaths , sociopaths and narcissists - and that is what allows the latter to so drastically harm , manipulate and influence others , because they know it too ( and are masters of using it for their own purposes , which logics often escapes most humans ) .
We know scientifically that common people have relatively few defences against this .
This is proven and felt by many .
And this is something we can’t ignore once we know it .
It is extremely urgent that we develop clear diagnosis methods for such personalities .
We have personality tests but we know that such individuals usually lie / deceive during both interviews and tests .
We have polygraphs ( which are expensive , not easily accessible instruments and not 100 % reliable ) based on merely physiological signs , but we know that especially these harming individuals can cheat the polygraphs .
We know that we just have to try a little bit harder , and such instruments can be available … if we want to !
The answer will probably come from both genetics and neurosciences ’ research .
We have detected the structures in our brain responsible for empathy and morality that took us a little bit closer .
We also know the typical brain patterns of common people when they are depressed , and we know that the most harmful personalities can’t get depressed ( although they can mimic cry at times , specially to manipulate others into doing , feeling or thinking something “ useful ” for them ) .
We know that we will be able to find at least specific brain functioning patterns ( areas of brain activation , electrical patterns ) in given situations , specific of these individuals , and the genetic characteristics of these personalities ( genetic proof would probably be found faster and more unmistakably ) .
We ’re just this close , and we just need a push !
Above all , we need will !
Once we can do it , it will have profound effects on the way we see ourselves and the ones surrounding us .
Once we can do it , there ’s no return – thank God – to the illusory innocence of perverse masks and deceiving realities , but there will be abundant space and protection for the kind at heart , and for goodness and solidarity and constructive goals to grow both socially and inside our homes .
The key seems to be not in “ perfecting ” human races ’ phenotype through genetics , like the Nazis wanted to , but in identifying the genotype of the most harmful human beings .
We have to have objective ways of identifying the most harming and deceiving personalities .
It is a matter of protecting citizens , but also a matter of survival of our societies at large .
These individuals can commit personal crimes , social crimes and crimes against humanity .
More than that : it would lead to deep social changes .
That is why it demands political courage and determination , not only research , to do this .
We would n’t have paradise on earth , but we would surely have more pleasant and safe societies .
States would save billions in expenses .
Nonetheless , some State members would n’t feel safe , as they could be subjected to such instruments too .
This can be one of the obstacles to the development of these instruments .
Let ’s be clear .
I am not talking here about many teenager delinquents who act out .
I ’m not even referring to people who live in extremely poor social conditions and are forced to steal food or do something which is not completely legal because otherwise they wo n’t survive .
I am not talking about them simply because many of these people do n’t have such personalities .
I am talking about deeply democratic and truthful instruments .
These instruments do not serve law and political control ; they serve humans and the goals and dreams of our collective societies ( making them more liveable ) and our individuals .
Because I am talking about the most harming , dangerous and deceiving personalities among us - the ones justice cannot prove or does not find enough evidence of their crimes , and personality tests cannot clarify while interviews do n’t work because of manipulation and incredible acting skills by these individuals .
Because they are qualitatively different and unchangeable , I truly believe there is a genetic basis for these personalities .
Brain patterns and functioning ( especially when asked certain questions ) would prove the activity of such genetic traits , its characteristics and answers to the surrounding environment .
Human justice is based on facts .
Facts always demand a more or less high level of concreteness or scientific certainty .
There ’s no way around it .
Of course we could always turn to God ’s mercy and justice .
But this not only is n’t satisfactory , as it allows fellow humans to keep suffering at the hands of other humans .
Giving a recent example : I ’m sure that many people asked God to have mercy ( and apply divine justice ) of all the Nazis , including Mengele .
Human justice was not applied .
The results we are starting to uncover reveal that Mengele , for example , continued to harm other human beings at least 20 - 35 years after the Holocaust – this included medical and genetic crimes against others , with consequences at all human levels , at least for the inhabitants of an entire city , the city of Cândido Godoi , in Brazil .
And certainly his actions included more details we do n’t even know about yet .
Mengele was one of these personalities , as was Hitler , but we can find them in everyday bastards who harm and lie compulsively , serial killers , domestic abusers , white - collar criminals , paedophiles , rapists , extremely manipulative personalities , harmful narcissists and many people who… did not commit their crimes yet .
We should think about it and demand something – something fair which we can achieve scientifically , which can avoid a great slice of human suffering , spiritual hindering and the jeopardizing of social well - being at all levels .
If we can identify such individuals , our justice can be much more effective , our prevention capabilities can be much more efficient , first of all .
The priority should be identifying the ones who seem healthy but are extremely poisonous .
Many traditionally considered “ mentally hill ” people hardly represent any serious danger for others or the society – we keep them away because we do n’t want to see them .
But the most harmful personalities are often among us and apparently “ over - adapted ” , while surreptitiously or progressively provoking depression , anger , anxiety , pain , devastation , grief and desperation in others .
And only after identifying them should we start thinking if science can bring empathy to individuals who do n’t have empathy and remorse to someone who has no remorse .
I have no doubts that this is much more pressing than finding a cure for schizophrenia .

Get it off your chest Name : Comment : ( comments policy ) Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-14 14:51:17
Some musings on the cover image : in his The Painter of Modern Life and Other Essays , ( where he introduced the very term “ modernity ” to the world ) the famous poet and modern art theorist Charles Baudelaire describes the ideal artist as being essentially a narcissist .
He does not seem to consider it a psychological disorder ; rather , he adopts a Shakespearean - Freudian approach .
It was Shakespeare that pointed out that without the mirror of art ( or a pond , as the case may be ) we would be the poorer in self - knowledge because we would not be able to see our own faces ; and it was Freud , much later than Baudelaire , who had the insight that artists are better able than most people to bring to the surface the sub-conscious with its socially forbidden desires , thus sublimating them via art .
The example he gives is that of Delacroix whom he eulogizes as a great hero of art .
Indeed , a narcissist will do absolutely anything for narcissistic supply ( attention , admiration , etc. ) , even benefit mankind , even create great works of art which surely beats sadism and masochism .
Be that as it may , Dostoyevsky , another great artist , had a slightly different but equally intriguing viewpoint on creativity , crime , punishment , vis a vis freedom thus expressed : place man in a wholly deterministic universe and he will blow it up simply to prove that he remains free .
Moreover , there is another side to the coin of the myth of Narcisus , and it is that of the myth of Echo .
The former points to extreme loneliness , the latter to co-dependence .
Food for thought !
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-14 15:12:03 P.S.
The above musings lead one back to Aristotle and that great narcissist Nero .
Rather than sublimating his repressed desires and achieve a catharsis via art as Aristotle suggests in his The Poetics , the pseudo - artist Nero , Mengele and Nazi like , preferred to have people murdered for real on the stage and thus achieve more of a sadistic satisfaction .
Here too it is Dostoyevsky who via his novels gives us the insight that to deny love and go for manipulative power is to become a sado - masochist .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-14 17:03:32 P.S.S .
It is also misguided to blame God for creating us free and refusing to stop the sado - masochist , for without that freedom no love is possible either , no repentance and no redemption either , there is only deterministic sado - masochism .
That too can be gathered in any of Dostoyevsky 's novels .
AP 2009-02-14 17:05:40 Mr. Paparella :
There is another very clinical distinction between " good " and " bad " Narcisssism .
The Narcissist as we describe it in Psychopathology is not simply someone who needs narcissistic supply ( everyone does , one way or another ) nor what is often described as Narcissist in the common sense , it is actually someone very close to the Psychopath ( DSM authors have thought about abolishing the distinction altogether ) .
Other times they call one or the other " Anti-Social " ( precisely because they hardly " benefit mankind " , when we talk about being socially desirable or constructive ) .
Let 's say the point is not needing narcissistic supply or not - it is the way you get it , and a few other variables .
To answer the cover question : all specialists agree that they are qualitatively different , and many people know that intuitively .
Others can't accept it because of " entire humankind goodness " delusions .
As long as that does n't change ... hard luck will we have .
AP 2009-02-14 17:10:50 errata - Narcissism
Works such as the one by the Polish psychologist Andrzej Lobaczewski go straight to the point .
Otherwise , who really cares about pointing and knowing the reason for the most harming evil among us ?
As long as we do n't face the beast , I am sorry for our destiny .
AP 2009-02-14 17:23:10
Another last and very important note :
Only a small percentage of these individuals ( narcissists , psychopaths , sociopaths ) commit crimes or murders , but that DOESN'T MEAN IN ANY WAY that their daily actions are less harmful .
That 's why their clear identification is so urgent .
AP 2009-02-14 17:42:49
Also , these harmful personalities exist across all cultures , races and language groups .
We know that there are non-humane fellows among us humans - and that 's the only real distinction we should make .
AP 2009-02-14 18:18:37
I should also add , Mr. Paparella , that I do n't know if it is God 's blame or not , the fact is that such people do exist and need to be clearly identified .
And no , love does n't need sadism to exist , actually such personalities can destroy love with a blink .
I am sorry to say .
But you should know it already .
They are predators among us - and this is quite probably genetic .
They harm families , colleagues and social groups .
They have a group of faithful followers ( estimated in 12 - 16 % of a population ) which sometimes are not pure psychopaths , but defend them because they have other characteropathies or are just too afraid of them .
Although a minority , the social consequences are devastating .
Even because these people are many times found in leading and managing positions .
If we leave hate free and unsupervised , it will feed on love in no instant .
That 's actually what has been happening for a long time .
And that 's also why all well - intentioned speeches about peace and love and redemption have n't worked in practical terms .
Sorry .
It 's the truth .
AP 2009-02-14 18:31:58
What is sado - masochist is to have the instruments to make our societies really democratic and prevent a lot of human suffering in the first place , still decide not to use them .
This does n't mean denying love , no , it means protecting it and giving it space to grow .
Love is fragile when faced with hate , hate is strong and deceiving as hell .
Or maybe it is the opposite - or we would n't be on the brink of having such instruments .
Mr. Paparella , there are evil humans among us : I mean truly evil , qualitatively different ( quite probably genetically different , and different in terms of the brain functioning which allows guilt and empathy a AP 2009 - 02 - 14 18:36:55 and true feeling to happen ) .
If we do n't solve this and identify them clearly , our societies will continue to be hypocritical and full of lies , and these personalities will continue to rule over most of us ( and sadly harm most of us , one way or another ) .
AP 2009-02-14 18:47:43
I do n't know if you understood me fully and the complete extent of the implications of this problem : these people " look " perfectly normal , sometimes even hyper - adapted .
They never seek help , they never feel mentally sick ( others around them are affected and sometimes seek help ) , but they somehow deep down feel that they are different from most of us ( and try to hide it ) .
They have two sides and hide their dark side very well .
They cheat , manipulate , hurt and feed on the emotions of most of us .
Literally .
So if we found the genetic problem with trisomy 21 , why not the genetic problem of evilness with no remorse ?
We think we can and we will .
And that is tremendly urgent .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-14 19:21:46 Ms. Pereira , I ’m not sure you got Dostoyevsky ’s point which is that to manipulate the genes in order to eliminate the evil ones , is ultimately not so different from the goal of the Nazi : to create the super - race or the perfect race , a race that being perfect could not make mistakes and had therefore a right to exterminate the inferior races .
Talking of socio- pathologogy !
What Dostoyevsky is saying is that without freedom you do n’t have a human being but a robot parading as one .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-14 19:28:15
As for Baudelaire ’s judgment that Delacroix was the touchstone of artistic greatness , here are a few excerpts from the above mentioned book by Baudelaire : “ One of our painter ?s [ i.e. , Delacroix ?s ] greatest concerns during his last years was the judgment of posterity and the uncertain durability of his works .
One moment his ever - sensitive imagination would take fire at the idea of an immortal glory , and then he would speak with bitterness at the fragility of canvases and colors .
At other times he would enviously cite the old masters who almost all of them had the good fortune to be translated by skilful engravers whose needle or burin had learnt to adapt itself to the nature of their talent , and he keenly regretted that he had not found his own translator …( continued below ) Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-14 19:28:42
His works contain nothing but devastation , massacres , conflagrations ; everything bears witness against the eternal and incorrigible barbarity of man .
Burnt and smoking cities , slaughtered victims , ravished women , the very children cast beneath the hooves of horses or menaced by the dagger of a distracted mother ?
the whole body of this painter ?s works , I say , is like a terrible hymn composed in honour of destiny and irremediable anguish …
Delacroix was passionately in love with passion , and coldly determined to seek the means of expressing it in the most visible way …
A hater of the masses , he really only thought of them as iconoclasts , and the acts of violence perpetrated upon several of his works in 1848 were ill - suited to convert him to the political sentimentalism of our times …
For finally it must be said ? since to me this seems but one more reason for praise ?
that Eugene Delacroix , for all that he was a man of genius , or because he was a man of complete genius , had much of the dandy about him .
He himself used to admit that in his youth he had thrown himself with delight into the most material vanities of dandyism , and he used to tell with a smile , but not without a touch of conceit , how , with the collaboration of his friend Bonington , he had laboured energetically to introduce a taste for English cut in clothes and shoes among the youth of fashion .
I take it that this will not seem to you an idle detail …
Delacroix once sent for me to come and see him on purpose to rap me sharply over the knuckles about a disrespectful article that I had perpetrated on the subject of that spoiled child of chauvinism [ the artist Charlet , who Delacroix enjoyed . ]
I vain did I try to explain to him that it was not the Charlet of the early days that I was censuring , but the Charlet of the decadence .
But I never managed to win my pardon . ”
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-14 19:30:02 ( continued from above )
What Baudelaire is doing here is describing the characteristic traits of the narcissist .
Baudelaire would have been horrified at any suggestion that Delacroix ’s feelings of artistic self - importance were n’t backed up by his actual performance with paint and canvas .
Furthermore , Baudelaire never suggests in any way that Delacroix was a pathological exaggerator ; in fact , he repeatedly emphasizes the artist ’s aristocratic reserve in company .
Nevertheless the essay in question is quite explicit about Delacroix ’s feelings of grandiosity and self - importance .
Which are the traits of a narcissist ?
Modern psychologists identify at least 9 ; possessing at least five makes one a narcissist but as Baudelaire , Shakespeare and Freud would suggest there is a positive kind of narcissism when it is sublimated via art .
However , sublimation can only be accomplished by a free creature with free will ; free to the point of even rejecting God and preferring to be a monster and a master in hell than a creature in Paradise , to paraphrase Milton .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-14 19:33:21
Delacroix clearly was obsessed with fantasies of a fearsome power or omnipotence .
In fact , what Baudelaire gently steps around is that a number of Delacroix 's most famous canvases ( including Sardanapalus , The Entry of the Crusaders into Constantinople , and the Massacre of Chios ) are explicit fantasies of sadism .
Each shows a group of victims juxtaposed with an all - powerful male authority figure that looks on their sufferings with an arrogant contempt , calm indifference , or savage hostility .
AP 2009-02-14 19:46:57
No one mentioned manipulating genes , first of all we would need to identify them .
That identification alone would be a tremendous help for justice , but for our societies as well .
" Dostoyevsky is saying is that without freedom you do n’t have a human being but a robot parading as one . "
Well Mr. Paparella , first of all this only has to do with freedom in the sense that truly humane human beings are still not free from the chains of exploitation .
They have natural predators .
Second , yes : we can say that psychopaths , sociopaths and harmful narcissists are human robots , but much more intelligent than the robots we presently have .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-14 19:48:34 P.S. Modern psychologists identify nine traits of narcissists :
Narcissistic Trait # 1 : Feels grandiose and self - important ( e.g. , exaggerates achievements and talents to the point of lying , demands to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements ) ?
Narcissistic Trait # 2 : Is obsessed with fantasies of unlimited success , fame , fearsome power or omnipotence , unequalled brilliance ( the cerebral narcissist ) , bodily beauty or sexual performance ( the somatic narcissist ) , or ideal , everlasting , all - conquering love or passion
Narcissistic Trait # 3 : Firmly convinced that he or she is unique and , being special , can only be understood by , should only be treated by , or associate with , other special or unique , or high - status people ( or institutions ) ?
Narcissistic Trait # 4 : Requires excessive admiration , adulation , attention and affirmation - or , failing that , wishes to be feared and to be notorious ( narcissistic supply ) .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-14 19:49:06 Narcissistic Trait # 5 : Feels entitled .
Expects unreasonable or special and favorable priority treatment .
Demands automatic and full compliance with his or her expectations .
Narcissistic Trait # 6 : Is interpersonally exploitative ? , i.e. , uses others to achieve his or her own ends
Narcissistic Trait # 7 : Devoid of empathy .
Is unable or unwilling to identify with or acknowledge the feelings and needs of others .
Narcissistic Trait # 8 : Constantly envious of others or believes that they feel the same about him or her
Narcissistic Trait # 9 : Arrogant , haughty behaviors or attitudes coupled with rage when frustrated , contradicted , or confronted "
A careful reading of Baudelaire would suggest that Delacroix possessed at least five of those nine traits and that certifies him as a narcissist .
No narcissism , no Delacroix either .
Delacroix freely chose to sublimate his narcissism into art .
Only a human being with free will can do that .
AP 2009-02-14 19:50:58
And leave Baudelaire and Delacroix alone .
Psychopaths , sociopaths and narcissists specially , they hardly ever even refer to their inner world ( hopes , dreams , fears , etc. ) or to memories ( " you know , this reminded of something that happened to me a long time ago ... " is a sentence you 'll never hear from a narcissist 's mouth ) .
AP 2009-02-14 19:56:19
But Baudelaire was no psychologist , Mr. P .
And if you read , for example , the link describing Narcissist mothers above , you 'll have a much more correct picture of how they act on a daily basis .
There are much more nuances to this than the ones described in DSM .
Identifying ( Delacroix or whoever ) as a narcissist or a psychopath would not extinguish him , it would only protect others from him .
But I have my deep doubts that he was a malignant Narcissist anyway .
Still this is not about art nor Delacroix , it is about profound social concerns .
AP 2009-02-14 20:01:25 Mr. Paparella , Psychopaths and Narcissists do n't waste time fantasizing about sadism , they are sadistic full stop .
Actually , they have a very poor inner life .
Also , it was more than banal for painters to portrait battles in those days ...
AP 2009-02-14 20:12:18
What actually worries me is : the deep social implications of all this and all the lives destroyed ( up until today ) by malignant and harmful personalities .
You undertand the implications of someone having no guilt and using the guilt and emotions of others to feed from those ?
Or having no sense of shame , no conscience ?
The consequences are totally devastating .
AP 2009-02-14 20:16:49 errata - understand
Actually , they are so centered in immediate gains and benefits ( with no morality involved whatsoever ) that they hardly think about the past or the long - term future .
Sometimes they can ... invent dreams that they actually did n't have during the night , but they prove to be very poor in content , always related with immediate selfish satisfaction .
AP 2009-02-14 20:24:48
Furthermore , I am fully convinced that sooner or later we will have to face this question - as a matter of collective survival .
Do we identify them or not ?
And to use your expressions , if God gave us genetics and brain scans it was n't certainly for Mengele 's experiments , but for something far more helpful , ethic and necessary .
AP 2009-02-14 20:31:55
I mean , we can close our eyes and say " let them be anonymous , it 's all part of the wonderful human diversity ! " , but :
1. well it is n't wonderful , it is totally scary and awful , and devastating for millions of us
2. that tactic of closing our eyes has n't worked well up until now , has it ?
3. it is even doubtful that it represents actual " human diversity " ( as they do n't feel guilt , remorse and many other qualities that we find typical of a human being ) , it is more like a genetic distortion , a very harmful one .
AP 2009-02-14 21:31:57
" Remember , most of them do n't psychically hurt people , so this is about mental and emotional domination .
To accomplish these objectives , they will use their mask of sanity to place themselves in positions within your community .
These positions may include school boards , charitable organizations , churches , politics , law enforcement , or any position which they believe will offer them power over others .
These are the places where most psychopaths end up , not jail .
Some researchers agree that the traits exhibited by these people produce a division stronger than age , race , and religion , which places them in a new category of people .
In other words , these people are almost not human as we know it .
The word antisocial does not describe someone who prefers to sit at home rather than attend gatherings .
More accurately it means antihuman .
Most people can't bring themselves to understand the mind - set of a psychopath .
Dr. Hare explained , " Imagining the world as the psychopath experiences it is close to impossible . "

But
I find interesting your own interest in Narcissist personalities , Mr. Paparella :) Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-14 21:47:21
Indeed , my interest began since I read Dostoyevsky 's The Possessed .
All the sociopathic negative characteristics you mention are superbly described there and their root cause too : nihilism parading as a fanatical ideology , supposedly the cure for everything that hails the world .
That Dostoyevsky could have been so accurate before the actual advent of Bolshevism and Communism in Russia makes him a prophet .
That 's what prophets do : they do n't predict the future as some surmise ; rather , they warn of what 's to come unless we change our misguided ways .
The point of Delacroix is simple : he could have gone either way but decided to sublimate his tendencies into art .
He could do that because he was a human being and had free will and was pre-determined by his genes .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-14 21:50:44 Errata : was not pre-determined by his genes .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-14 22:01:54
" But I find interesting your own interest in Narcissist personalities , Mr. Paparella : ) "
Whatever the insinuation may be in such a statement let 's remember that you brought up the subject which indeed seems to be of great interest to you , not I , and despite the fact that you predicted in the title that nobody would wish to read it , it was read and reflected upon by at least one person , probably many nore who do n't wish to dare an opinion .
That 's too bad because that 's what makes a magazine like Ovi interesting and even exciting : the free and civil exchange of opinions on various cultural phenomena .
Again , what I attempted to do in my comments was simply to show the other side of the coin you showed the readers : narcissism too can be sublimated and in then it becomes a positive drive .
It that was no understood , then I failed to explain myself well , and so be it .
AP 2009-02-14 22:14:39 Mr. Paparella : malignant Narcissism is never sublimated , other humans are made targets of it .
The title comes from the fact that many humans do n't want to face the reality of irreversibly evil humans among us - simple as that .
They do n't even want to think about it , some of us can't even conceive evil in our minds , coming from someone pretty much similar to us ( we think ) .
That 's human .
But we should get over it .
If we do n't think about it , we wo n't help to solve many problems in our world .
Sure it is of interest to me , I think people who have studied and had to deal with these personalities have an important educative role , and it should be of interest to anyone deeply concerned with solving irreversible evilness in our world , the digression on Delacroix and Narcissism was yours ( trying to prove how it can " benefit " us - I do n't agree at all ! ) .
Actually , I find your position very darkly ironic .
Anyway , no , evil does not benefit anyone .
Pretty obvious for most of us ...
AP 2009-02-14 22:19:01
And it is because it does not benefit anyone ( these personalities can be well adapted , the fact that they do n't murder does n't mean that they are n't toxic and damage others on a daily basis - that 's actually the way they relate to others ... ) that such highly deceiving personalities should be identified .
You do n't agree ?
Well I expected that .
AP 2009-02-14 22:23:26
I think it 's beyond necessary , it is urgent .
I am not alone .
You think it 's okay " leave those interesting people anonymous and free " .
I think that 's highly irresponsible , and can border the criminal too .
Alexander Mikhaylov 2009-02-14 23:27:20 To Mrs. Pereira : I cannot imagine why you should be crucified for expressing such thoughts – in my humble opinion ; some of them sound perfectly legitimate .
I also believe there are plenty of individuals among us who masquerade themselves as humans , when in reality they are not .
Of course , ‘ genetic cleansing of psychopaths ’ sounds like Nazi idea par excellence ( I believe it was one of their aims , among others , to freed humanity from mentally unstable characters ) on the other hand there are dangerous individuals who are roaming the Earth freely and … what can be done about them ?
Alexander Mikhaylov 2009-02-14 23:37:56
A weak point of your argumentation is however this : you sound rather vague when you outline good and bad ( I know , you place great faith in psychology , for from that point of view everything seems quite clear ) , on the other hand , it sounds as if you wish to leave your statement open to wide interpretations .
In the other words , - who is to decide what is good and what is bad , what is moral and what is not ?
Psychopath , or an army of psychopaths , or the whole state , ruled by psychopaths , armed with genetic technology and having sufficient power ( military , religious etc ) , might just as well take an exception to certain norms and morals , proclaiming them as ‘ outdated ones ’ .
Alexander Mikhaylov 2009-02-14 23:44:21
I believe modern psychology is not sufficient tool in defining moral norms and outlining consequent actions .
For one thing , modern psychology ( as well as the whole modern psychiatry at that ) strives to become ( or it has already become ) a religion in itself , religion , that disregards spiritual , moral and cultural aspects altogether , a sort of religion without God… Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-15 00:50:03
" There are things which a man is afraid to tell even to himself , and every decent man has a number of such things stored away in his mind . "
Ms. Pereira , that quote of Dostoyevsky means that either I failed in explaining the other side of the coin of narcissism which indeed in its negative aspects and by itself is an abomination , no one disputes that , or that Dostoyevsky is on target ; there are things that one cannot possibly agree with because it would mean to reveal things that one will not reveal even to oneself .
In Dostoyevsky 's Notes from Underground the underground man from St. Petersburgh is indeed corageous and honest enough to reveal terrible things about himself to himself .
I highly reccomend reading those notes .
After reading them one begins to have an inkling about free will vis a vis sado - masochism , and how and why the ability to make a u turn remains a potential of every human being , even alienated monsters such as the underground man and the ideological fanatics of The Possessed .
I first read Notes from Underground in 1962 and have never stopped reading Dostoyevsky time and again .
This is not a digression , far from it .
Alexander Mikhaylov 2009-02-15 03:49:42 To Dr. Paparella : Just a foot note .
The funny thing is that I was born in St. Petersburg ( back then Leningrad ) but in any case , to understand Dostoevsky fully one must see and feel an aura of that city AP 2009-02- 15 05:09:45 Mr. Mikhaylov , I thought I had made it clear that psychology can't help much in this from now on , it could provide the first frames of understanding ( it helped understanding what was wrong with psychopaths , in what way were they different and how that has disastrous consequences ... so it actually helped a lot ! ) but it really can't solve the problem ( do n't agree that it is a religion either - and I do n't think it 's psychology that defines what 's good and bad around the world , but much more common sense and the normal functioning of a human being with the whole palette of feelings inside him ) .
It 's more a problem of neurosciences and genetics now .
Actually , for example you can already spot a psychopath pretty accurately with a brain scan - everyone else has particular brain scan patterns when given emotionally charged words to read ... everyone except psychopaths , but you can't force them to undergo such tests .
Anyway , many researchers now agree that the condition must be genetic in origin ( as all the conditions which imply that one does n't have common feelings ) , and if we can already know who are the sex offenders living in our neighbourhood , I think it would be pretty advisable to know for sure who are the psychopaths and narcissists among us too .
Believe me .
AP 2009-02-15 05:21:43 " why the ability to make a u turn remains a potential of every human being "
Mr. Paparella , I appreciate your optimism , but trust me , if you can make a psychopath or a narcissist make that u turn and know more than all the specialists who have tried it before , I wish you very good luck and I suppose you deserve a Nobel then ...
You want to know why there is no u turn with these personalities ?
It 's quite simple actually .
To make u turns you need emotions .
There 's no repairment nor regret nor guilt nor self - responsibility with them .
Actually , there 's no conscience in the way we understand it .
All constructive things are born from our deep need to repair and our ability to feel .
If one does n't feel , there 's no u turn Mr. Paparella .
Not that we know of .
What 's incredible is that we did n't even manage to protect ourselves from them yet , I mean collectively , even less find the u turn .
And believe me - we should first protect ourselves , only after that try to discover if there 's any u turn for that .
AP 2009-02-15 05:34:14
And protecting ourselves does n't mean genetic cleansing of psychopaths , not even genetic manipulation ( though it would be highly advisable , if we try to prevent other much harmless genetic conditions too , to prevent psychopathy if we could ... sorry to say that not all of God 's creation is good or useful in any way ! ) .
Protecting ourselves means identifying clearly such individuals - it would not only help courts in many cases , but also most of us daily , as we would be prepared to deal with them and protect ourselves better - still I must be honest and say that I 'm not sure if a healthy human can ever be prepared to deal with such personalities .
Not even professionals are .
AP 2009-02-15 05:42:43
First of all , they Never ask for help ( often their victims do ) .
Second , most professionals run away from having to deal with them because they end up ... harmed by them !
One contradictory thing about them is that while they do n't have feelings ( or precisely because of that ) , they 're incredibly aware of the feelings of others - most often they will end up miming issues of the professional himself , or then " pretending to feel something positive / feel better " just to please him .
There 's no one about whom this sentence is more true than these personalities :
" They always know more about yourself than you do , they know things about you that you 're not even aware of "
Summing up : they are natural predators inside our species , and always ( I mean always ) behave as such .
AP 2009-02-15 05:49:52
And we have to solve this issue , as it is connected with many problems we face on our globe .
If we keep thinking that " all humans are essentially good " and can recover by magical means , I 'm afraid that can be our collective death sentence .
AP 2009-02-15 05:57:41
We have this deep need to trust and bond , but that 's different from being totally irresponsible towards our species and our societies .
Since we have the knowledge about these conditions , their mechanisms and devastating consequences , we can't close our eyes .
Only if we are totally irresponsible .
That 's what I think .
AP 2009-02-15 06:03:59
Love and faith can't solve anything of this , I 'm sorry to say - except love for humane humans .
Otherwise , we 'll sacrifice generations after generations , and such personalities quite likely will lead us collectively to destruction - if not to complete destruction , to much avoidable suffering and millions of destroyed lives and potentials , that 's for sure .
AP 2009-02-15 06:10:12
Some reports indicate that the number of these personalities has been growing consistently .
If the problem is genetic , it can be out of our hands by now .
Something we should think seriously about .
N. L. Wilbur 2009-02-15 11:04:01 Hmmmm .
Use genetics to figure out who is a psycho ...
Great idea .
But really , I totally thought , with all the build - up , that you were about to launch into an analysis about genocidal dictators or rapists or Wall Street CEOs .
Instead , you included all of these -- pretty much anyone who fits that general category " bad . "
I 'm disappointed .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-15 15:55:13
In 1970 , Otto Kernberg coined the term , " malignant narcissism " to distinguish it from the sublimated narcisism of artists ; he pointed out that the antisocial personality was fundamentally narcissistic and without morality .
Malignant narcissism includes a sadistic element , creating , in essence , a sadistic psychopath .
Enter Freud who believed that without sublimation of this inherent deviant narcissism civilization as we know it is done for .
Enter Michelangelo who has the origin of it all on the Sistine Chapel .
Enter Dostoyevsky who in his Crime and Punishment has the same analysis of the sado - masochistic sociopath fully described but he remains a human being despite it all because created in the image of God .
The principal anomaly consists in losing that image or having no mirror to compare it with what ought to be normal .
Enter Voltaire who avers that even if there were no God we'd have to invent one or sooner or later we'd be treating human beings as nothing else but complicated machines whose negative featured can be manipulated and fixed in a deterministic universe .
Enter Descartes and his rationalism .
Enough material here for a narcissistic little article in which we can discuss the narcisism of everybody else but the author of the article .
Jung called it projection .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-15 20:00:22 P.S.
Enter professor of psychology John Teske who in his lecture on Neuromythology : Brains and Stories has this insight to share : " Ultimately it is our engagement with the metanarratives
of religious imagination by which we address a set of existentially necessary but
ontologically unanswerable metaphysical questions that ultimately form the basis of
religious belief .
How might we form a more integrated sense of how a multi- leveled understanding of evolutionary biology , history , neuroscience , psychology , narrative , and mythology might actually form a coherent picture of the human spirit ?
Neuropsychological functions involved in constructing and responding to the narratives by which we form our identities and build meaningful lives include memory , attention ,
emotional marking , and temporal sequencing .
It is the neural substrate , the emotional shaping , and the narrative structuring of higher cognitive function that provide the sine
qua non for the construction of meaning , relationship , morality , and purpose that extend beyond our personal boundaries , both spatial and temporal .
These provide a contingent solution to disunities of mind , the construction of self and identity , and the alienation and fragmentation of personhood , relationship and community , but a solution that is likely only accomplished with widely varying degrees of success , and may include a range of
fictionalization and self - deception in all of us . "
AP 2009-02-15 20:59:30
I 'm afraid , Mr. Paparella , that the fact that someone has morality and feelings ( or not ) can be genetically determined , not determined by " narratives " ( pretty much like how many toes you 're born with or the colour of your hair ) .
More and more clues point that way .
Mr. Wilbur :
Of course those you mentioned are included in the category , but there are many more .
The more powerful their position in a society , the more harmful they can be ( affecting more people ) , but they can be equally harmful inside families and smaller groups .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-15 22:30:00
And that is why Charles Manson does not understand why he has been in jail for forty years or so .
To those who come to interview him he says that he was born a monster , it is in his genes and if there is any responsibility it belongs to society who failed to fix those bad genes .
What he is presenting is the other side of Rousseau 's " we are all born innocent and then society corrupts us . "
Misguided but logical !
AP 2009-02-16 00:34:10
Misguided only in the sense that it serves his purposes : defend that he should be released .
The fact that it can be in his genes does n't directly mean that he should be released , because he commited crimes anyway .
But we find more and more plausible that it can in fact be in his genes , it can result from a sort of mutation .
In brain scans for instance there 's no electrical connection between the part of the brain which processes words and the one which should be responsible for affection and feelings .
And they are probably born that way .
But they are aware of it , they know that they can easily hurt other people .
If they can control it or not ?
To say the truth , evil in these personalities seems to be compulsive .
AP 2009-02-16 00:37:19
Evil , manipulation , distortion and projection in others ( in this case he projected his inadequacy in the society at large ) are their " normal " modus operandi .
There 's no news in such reaction , it 's their expected answer .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-16 00:53:13
But the point , Ms. Pereira , is that the only rational and legitimate reason for keeping Charles Manson in jail is that there is an operating assumption : that he committed those crimes with a free will and he therefore ought to be held accountable for them .
So the question turns out ultimately to be this : if , in what some call a trans - human world science should discover that we are all determined by our genes and our brains , will we keep Charles Manson in jail ?
Perhaps a recent book that everybody should want to read is this :
Mario Beauregard and Denyse O’Leary , The Spiritual Brain : A neuroscientist ’s case for the existence of the soul .
New York : Harper One , 2007 . 384 pages .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-16 01:01:05 P.S.
http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/ArticleDetail/tabid/68/id/10605/Default.aspx
The link above will take the interested reader to a perceptive review of the book .
AP 2009-02-16 04:47:58 Yes , Mr. Paparella , because it's too dangerous to release him until we can solve it .
Only a small percentage of psychopaths kill , but they 're all predators .
Killing or not might be their choice , or then it might just be the ultimate expression of their whole nature ( which I really think it is - if they do n't kill you physically , they kill you in other perverse ways , full stop ) .
You cannot face people like this by using the same premises you use for people with feelings , and free choice is pretty much a concept coined by the latter .
Someone with this kind of personality will smash not only the free choice of others , but their lives , ego and rights entirely .
That 's where the limits to free choice come in .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-16 09:00:30
The question is still unanswered and it is this : if , in what some call a trans - human world , science should discover that we are all determined by our genes and our brains , will we keep Charles Manson in jail ?
We do not punish predators such as lions and tigers since we assume that they are determined by their genes and instincts , albeit we place them in zoo 's cages , which reveals more about us as human beings than about the predators we place in cages ; neverthless we do not impute moral choices to them .
Another question which I suspect will also go unanswered : does that term " trans - human " sends trouble you in any way or do you think that there too we are preditermined ; that becoming robot or humbots as some say , is the only way we will survive as a species .
And if so , is survival worth the candle ?
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-16 09:15:04 P.S.
To be more specific and to the point , should you wish to answer the question , if nothing else to yourself , you may wish to read Mark Walker 's article titled : Sheep of Fools : Transhumanism as the best hope of preventing the exctinction of civilization .
One of its sections is titled : Transhumanism as the most dangerous experiment possible , except all the others .
Here is the link to the article .
http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/tabid/68/id/10682/Default.aspx
I tell my colleagues with whom I discuss those kinds of ideas that if they are not troubled by them , perhaps they ought to consider that they also are a bit of a sociopath ; which is to say , sociopathology as a spiritual illness affects and infects us all ; nobody saves himself by winning the lotto as a mere individual .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-16 09:19:53 Errata : Ship of fools .
AP 2009-02-16 19:11:21
Or then they might not be interested simply because they do n't consider such questions relevant to the point they 're discussing .
A few mistakes you commited , which seem to derive from an impaired sensitivity for these issues .
1 . No , we are not " all affected and infected " sociopaths .
And answering or not to your questions certainly does not constitute an admeasurement for that .
2 . To compare jailing Manson with jailing lions and tigers is ridiculous .
First two reasons why : 1 . lions and tigers are not often jailed for safety reasons anymore 2 . we know how / can protect ourselves from lions and tigers , not the case with personalities like Manson AP 2009-02-16 19:13:59 3 .
if anyone wins the lotto with the way things are presently , the lotto winners are certainly these personalities .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-16 21:18:51
The question is not that complicated but the answer may indicate a mind - set of sort , as Dostoyevsky surely knew when he wrote Crime and Punishment .
To repeat , the question is this : is the moral reprobate Charles Manson in jail to be punished for his crimes or is he there to protect society from his predatory habits ?
If the former is the case , then he is not determined but has a free will and as a free agent he deserves his just desserts ; if the latter is the case then he may be determined by his genes and his brain and in that case his argument that he does not understand why he is in jail has some compelling validity .
The way one answers says something of one ’s view of human nature in general , for the monsters among us do not have the nature of a lion or a tiger but that of a human being .
We know how Dostoyevsky would have answered the question because in Crime and Punishment he never takes away the possibility , as remote as it might be for certain people , of repentance and redemption , beyond mere revenge and punishment .
After all is n’t that why some of us refuse to accept capital punishment , even for moral reprobates and in the process feel so smugly superior to those who condone it ?
NS 2009-02-16 23:48:13
Any particular reason you are dissatisfied with the logic of " if you commit a crime , then you suffer the consequences " , and are instead jumping two steps to punishing people not even for thought crimes but " crimes " of * personality * ?
AP 2009-02-17 00:07:16 " is the moral reprobate Charles Manson in jail to be punished for his crimes or is he there to protect society from his predatory habits ? "
both things , as they are not mutually exclusive .
NS :
Identifying people is not punishing them , it is just identifying people .
And we have pretty good reasons for that .
Actually , we would even have pretty good reasons to do genetic selection and prevent sociopaths , psychopaths and narcissists from being born .
wow !!!
shocking ?
ask their victims .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-17 05:39:52
So it is genetic selection , after all .
I fail to understand how that is different from what the Nazis attempted to do .
So , we start with the sociopath , and then on suh slippery moral slopte we may prpceed to the mentally defective , or the physically defective , and then proceed to gender or color of eyes and hair or skin till se have the " transhuman " species , the super race which decides God - like who lives and who dies as per its utilitarian or even epicurian criteria .
It is indeed a brave new world !
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-17 05:42:28 Errata : such , proceed .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-17 05:54:31
Since you would not allow a Charles Manson from being born based on the genes he exhibits , it logically means that Charles Manson has no free will .
So the question he raises persists : why is he in jail since he had nothing to do with the genes he was born with ?
Moreover , since you would not allow him to be born , would you execute him should he be born ?
What about the alleged moral superiority of those countries which do not execute any human being no matter how despicable they may be ?
Or are sociopaths only two thirds humans .
Is n't that the excuse given for the retention of slaves in pre-civil war US ?
Plenty of food for thought here .

The best protection against psychopaths amoung us is empowered collective wisdom .
What I mean by that is : more dangerous than the individual psychopath is the persistance of bad dis-empowering ideas .
Think about it : we live in societies where a large percentage of the population abdigates true social responsibility to a " high power " be that in transcendant or immanent form .
This makes them ripe for manipulation .
There have always been and will always be " demons " amoung us - meaning humans with access to power and a deep disconnection from what makes us truly human .
In a way , their existance tells us more about our own freedom to choose connection than is does about our impotence .
For one example of the kind of critique of dangerous ideas see Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad 's " The Guru Papers " .
Peter Francis Cerrato 2009-02-17 12:22:42
Another thought : the best instrument we will ever have for detecting psychopaths will always be self - empowered individuals and responsive communities .
When humans lived in small collections the answer was emphatically ostracism .
In todays world we are faced with two problems : the isolation of the individual one the one hand and the diffusion of responsibility on the other hand .
Our social structures are at once too loose and too broad .
This layered with the previously mentioned problem of the " submission " model rather than a " deference " model is a recipe for small ( friendly serial killers ) and large scale ( genocide , ethnic cleansing ) disasters .
Empowerment in education is the answer .

Mr. Cerrato , the link above will take you to an article exploring your proposals and arriving at misguided conclusions as the comment to it hints at .
I would also suggest reading Roger Penrose 's The Emperor 's New Mind .

I think empowerment through education is very needed , but there are two problems : 1 . it will take dozens and dozens of years , and thousands / millions of victims more 2 . it does n't prevent psychopathic and narcissistic actions from happening anyway AP 2009-02-18 00:13:14 " Moreover , since you would not allow him to be born , would you execute him should he be born ?

I would say no food for thought and nothing new under the sun regarding your speculative questions , very morally concerned but in the end making suggestions where no one else made them .
I do n't know what to say about your imagined executions ... you deal with them .
AP 2009 -02-18 00:16:05 ps - and the slaves ' comment is even funnier , after I wrote 3 articles against slavery .
give me a break , Mr. Paparella .
you are either able to discuss things seriously , or then you 're just able to speculate and defame .
sadly , this seems to be the case .
Emanuel Paparella 2009-02-18 07:15:52
Sadly indeed , rather than forthrightly answer some simple questions which beg for an answer , you have returned to the argument of last resort , the argumentum ad hominem , which is counter - productive in the search for the honest truth and which I will therefore not dignify with a response , as previously pointed out .

Very intense personal experience with this one .
Again and again and again and again .
Please tell me when the cure becomes known .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Marcia Hofmann has a report card on transparent government measures undertaken by the Obama administration on its first day in office .
The news is pretty damned good : they 've reversed Ashcroft 's restrictions on Freedom of Information
Act requests as well as changes to the Presidential Records Act , and have adopted general principles on transparency and open government .
According to Obama 's memo : " All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure , in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA , and to usher in a new era of open Government .
The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA . "
This statement is almost certainly meant to address a controversial memo issued by John Ashcroft in the wake of 9/11 , which ordered agencies to disclose information only after considering all possible reasons to withhold it , and assured them that government lawyers would defend their decisions in court unless they had no " sound legal basis . "
Many open government advocates believe Ashcroft 's policy effectively gutted the FOIA over the past several years .
Today 's memo does n't explicitly reverse that policy , but directs the incoming attorney general to issue new FOIA guidelines to agencies " reaffirming the commitment to accountability and transparency . "
This is a big step in the right direction .
The memo does n't stop there .
It goes on to say : " The presumption of disclosure also means that agencies should take affirmative steps to make information public .
They should not wait for specific requests from the public .
All agencies should use modern technology to inform citizens about what is known and down by their Government .
Disclosure should be timely . "
Brain trainers evaluated included those for the PC People who spend money on brain trainers to keep their mind sharp may well get the same benefit from simply doing a crossword , experts conclude .
Consumer group
Which ?
asked three experts to check claims made about several devices , including the Nintendo DS , on memory and staving off dementia .
They found the evidence behind such claims was non-existent or " weak " .
But there is evidence that exercise , a healthy diet and an active social life help keep an agile mind , Which ? said .
Brain trainers , often promoted by celebrity endorsement , have been increasing in popularity .
If people are under the illusion that these devices are scientifically proven to keep their minds in shape , they need to think again
Martyn Hocking , Which ?

They are marketed as helping to improve memory , keep the mind fit and active and in some cases to prevent dementia .
Manufacturers behind the products were asked what the benefits of their products were and what evidence they had to back up the claims .
The panel of scientists then gave their view on the research provided .
None of the claims was supported by peer - reviewed research in a recognised scientific journal and much of it was flawed , they concluded .
Memory decline According to the Which ?
report , Dr Kawashima 's Brain Training for the Nintendo DS , which costs £ 110 with the console , says that use " can help consolidate memory and creativity and may hopefully help develop a resistance against decline in later life " .
The exercises are chosen because they increase blood flow to the frontal cortex region of the brain .
But the experts said surfing the internet or chatting to friends would produce the same effects on blood flow .
Dr Chris Bird , a clinical neuroscientist at University College London added : " There is no evidence that using this product will have any functional impact on your life whatsoever " .
Another product looked at was the £ 88 Mindfit for the PC , which the company says " exercises important abilities that are known to decline in later life , such as short - term memory " .
However , results did not show that it was any better than standard computer games such as Tetris , said Dr Adrian Owen , a senior scientist at the Medical Research Council 's Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit .
The team also looked at Lumosity online training system , which costs £ 4.99 a month , MindSpa , a £ 175 system which uses audiovisual stimulation to promote relaxation and increase focus , and the £ 9.99 Test and Improve Your Memory computer programme .
None of the manufacturers ' claims on improved cognition are supported by evidence that meets the minimum standard by which scientific research is judged , the panel said .
Martyn Hocking , editor at Which ? , said : " If people enjoy using these games , then they should continue to do so - that 's a no-brainer .
" But if people are under the illusion that these devices are scientifically proven to keep their minds in shape , they need to think again . "
A spokesman for Nintendo said they did not claim that Brain Training is scientifically proven to improve cognitive function .
" What we claim is the Brain Training series of games , like playing sudoku , are enjoyable and fun .
These exercises can also help keep the brain sharp . "
Bruce Robinson , chief executive of MindWeavers , which sells MindFit , said they were not claiming that it would stop Alzheimer's .
" Serious brain stimulation software is an emerging field .
" Others who have reviewed the wider evidence , notably New Scientist and the British Medical Journal , have drawn the conclusion it is difficult not to conclude brain training works , under some circumstances . "
He added : " Properly designed cognitively challenging products clearly have a role to play alongside other things including exercise , diet and social interaction , and it is up to the individual to choose what they want to do . "

Recently I found some pretty libevent benchmarks .
For me they show terrifying results .
The blood freezing fact is that the more connections you have , the bigger is the cost of adding new connections to asynchronous loop .
It means that if you have 1 connection registered to asynchronous loop , the cost of registering callback would be small ; while when you have million of idle connections the cost of registering is big .
It would be horrible if a similar situation would appear on the kernel level .
It wo n’t be as bad as in this benchmark , but still , as a programmer I ’d expect that creating and destroying connections is always constant time .
How asynchronous libraries work ?
The single chunk of data passed to the async lib is a tuple of three items :
event = ( socket_descriptor , callback_function , timeout )
This structure is often referred as an event .
When programmer registers such a structure to the asynchronous loop , he expects that his callback will be executed when something happens on a descriptor , or when a timeout occurs .
That ’s what ’s asynchronous programming is all about .
Asynchronous library offers a way of adding and removing such events to and from its main data structure – a priority queue .
This queue is sorted by timeouts , so async library always knows which events would be timed out first .
Asynchronous loop is waiting for something happening on descriptors or for timeouts .
When something happens , it executes necessary callbacks .
See this pseudocode :
the_main_loop : nearest_event = find_event_with_smallest_timeout ( ) events_triggered = select ( < fds ...> , nearest_event.timeout ) if events_triggered : # has anything happened on the wire ?
for event in events_triggered : remove_from_datastructure( event ) execute_callback ( event , timeouted =False ) else : # nothing happened , event timeouted remove_from_datastructure ( nearest_event ) execute_callback ( nearest_event , timeouted =True )
In 95 % of cases the body of programmers callback function , looks like this :
def my_callback ( fd ) : < read response from descriptor > < write new request to descriptor > add_to_event_loop( fd , my_callback ) return
When a timeout occurs , in most cases the callback just cleans up the memory .
But usually timeouts do n’t happen often .
This pseudocode means that :
when anything happens on a socket , event structure is always removed from priority queue
if socket becomes readable there ’s a high probability that next event would be registered for that socket
Putting this conclusions back into the pseudocode :
the_main_loop : # less often nearest_event = find_event_with_smallest_timeout ( ) events_triggered = select ( < fds ...> , nearest_event.timeout ) if events_triggered : for event in events_triggered : # very often , we have data on the socket ! remove_from_datastructure( event ) execute_callback ( event , timeouted =False ) else : # timeout happens rather rarely remove_from_datastructure ( nearest_event ) execute_callback ( nearest_event , timeouted =True )
The problem
The problem is that currently asynchronous libraries often use binary heap as a representation of internal priority queue .
It means that the cost of registering and removing item ( event ) from this structure is logarithmic to the number of already registered events .
binary heap cost frequency in my use case add item O ( log ( N ) ) very often remove item O ( log ( N ) ) very often event loop iteration O ( 1 ) less often
We can clearly see that the data structure was optimized to have smallest possible time per every event loop iteration .
While I think that it should be optimized to reduce the cost of adding and removing events .
I can put the same in different words .
In the real world , in most cases something happens on a socket before a timeout occurs .
Connections very rarely expire because of a timeout .
Considering this , it ’s reasonable to use a data structure that would have O ( 1 ) as a time of adding and removing items , and it ’s not so bad to have a bit higher cost inside the loop .
As you can imagine others faced that problem before me .
The data structure that could be used to manage timers with better average cost is called Timer Wheels .
It is used inside Linux kernel to manage operating system timers .
It ’s described in this paper from 1996 .
The timer wheels algorithm assumes that events occur every fixed period of time .
For the kernel it was obvious that timeouts were checked every kernel tick , usually 10 ms .
On the other hand waking up asynchronous library every 10 ms would be bad .
I believe it ’s possible to avoid waking up every tick .
To achieve this , when we seek for a smallest timeout we should look through all the buckets and try to find the first one that ’s not empty .
The cost of that is constant and depends on the number of buckets .
I suggest to use buckets of 1 ms .
If you need granularity better than this , no asynchronous library can help you anyway .
Other issue is how to handle events very far in the future , that do n’t fit into time wheel buckets .
The reasonable compromise is to use a binary tree ( or heap ) .
In such case , the cost of manipulating that timers would be logarithmic .
timer wheels limited time scale unlimited time scale timeouts fit in timer wheels ( optimistic ) timeouts far in the future
( pessimistic ) add item O( 1 ) O( 1 ) O( log ( N ) ) remove item O ( 1 ) O( 1 ) O( log ( N ) ) event loop iteration O ( K ) O ( K ) O(K )
( K is the number of buckets in all time wheels .
This is a constant factor . )
This diagram shows the structure I ’m suggesting .
There are few disadvantages of this approach :
The library must be woken up regularly to check if there are n’t any new events on the long - term heap .
In case of my diagram it would be every 33.8 sec , but of course you can add another level timer wheel to expand this time .
If there ’s a single event third timer wheel , the library would need to be woken up three times to dispatch it .
The granularity is fixed to 1ms .
The method I ’m suggesting is quite complicated but in my opinion having a constant O ( 1 ) cost of managing events is worth it .
Unfortunately , for events far in the future the cost would always need to be logarithmic , in the end we must sort the timers somewhere .
You can ask who needs such improvements , not everybody has thousands connections .
I agree that that most users does n’t care .
But there are some companies that could save money on this improvement , like Facebook which apparently uses libevent a lot …
The most recent broadcast , of Donizetti’s “ Lucia di Lammermoor , ” starring Anna Netrebko , was seen in 31 countries in roughly 850 theaters .
The Met is even negotiating to send an opera feed to an Argentine base in Antarctica .
“ Seen by an audience of penguins , ” Mr. Gelb joked .
The phenomenon has its technological handmaidens : DVDs , online streaming , downloading and satellite radio broadcasts , all part of the digital forces that have come to shape the classical music world in the last five years .
The HD transmissions are one of the few bright spots for the Met , which is facing an economic crisis on just about all fronts because of the recession .
The program has brought the company attention and a modest income stream : about $ 1 million netted this season , not much for a $ 271 million budget , but something .
Much of that money comes from ancillary sales based on the transmissions .
The HD program forms the core of a strategy devised by Mr. Gelb , when he assumed control three seasons ago , to boost the Met ’s profile in popular culture and build new audiences .
“ I do n’t think anyone , including myself , expected it to be quite as successful as it is , ” he said .
But even in this area there are signs of cutting back .
The Met said last week that after three years of increased transmissions , it would transmit only nine operas next season , although it declined to call this a cutback because a 10th transmission could be added ; an 11th was added at the last minute this season .
Mr. Gelb said the program ’s success has made the Met more attractive to opera stars craving larger audiences , the international spotlight and maybe the applause of penguins .
The transmissions , he added , are also largely responsible for a 12 percent growth in ticket sales at the opera house since he took over , although he acknowledged there was no hard evidence for this .
There are so many factors that influence a false positive ( or as muchas you do n't want to believe it , sexual abuse or stuff going on when you are n't around ) .
I just saw a special on TV that went into false positives .
The urine tests are not always accuate , but if your house has any type of chemicals in it , rat droppings or something out of the ordinary , it is possible .
A cyst could also make show a false positive .... here 's more
1. Improper testing
Improper testing can lead to false positive results .
When taking a home pregnancy test , it is very important to read the directions before testing .
Your home pregnancy test instructions will specify when test results should be interpreted and when test results are no longer valid .
Some tests will produce a faint positive test result if read after the instructed time .
You should use a clock or a watch and record the time you perform the test and read results at the instructed time .
Guessing how long it has been since performing the test can lead to false results .
Three minutes can seem like twenty minutes and vice versa when you are anxiously waiting to find out if you are expecting .
Another problem that commonly occurs when it come to testing is going back to " double check " your results .
Disappointed with a negative result at the 3 minute ( or 5 minute interval depending on the test ) , a woman may go back to look again to see if maybe she did n't see that positive the first time .
Some women will go as far as digging that test out of the trash " just to be sure " .
This is probably one of the biggest causes of false positive results .
Home pregnancy tests should always be read at the instructed time for accurate results .
2. Evaporation lines
Some home pregnancy tests have been described by women as having an evaporation line .
If you stare at and inspect a home pregnancy test closely , it is possible with some tests to see where the testing line is .
When urine runs across the test strip it may briefly change color as part of the testing process thereby helping the woman locate the test are even further .
In order for the test to be positive it should change color and have a colored line at the determined testing time .
With some tests , you will be able to see what can best be described as a watermark , much the same as you see on a US dollar bill when turned to the light .
If there is no color to it or you have to grossly manipulate it to the light in order to observe a line , it could be an evaporation line .
Retesting in a few days or using a digital test is recommended .
3 . Home pregnancy test interference
Certain medications such as phenothiazine can interfere with test results .
Women receiving hCG therapy to treat a luteal phase defect or other fertility problem should consult their doctor as to accuracy of home pregnancy tests and when testing should be performed .
Occasionally urine can be contaminated with blood or gross amounts of protein leading to inaccurate results .
4. Certain medical conditions can lead to false positive results .
If you receive a positive result from a home pregnancy test it is important to follow up with your doctor for medical care .
Although it is not common , certain rare medical conditions can cause positive results on a home pregnancy test .
Certain forms of cancer , such as choriocarcinoma ( an extremely rare type of cancer usually found in the uterus ) can cause an elevation in hCG levels as well as certain types of breast , ovarian or testicular cancer leading to a false positive result .
5. Defective pregnancy test
Expired tests or faulty home pregnancy tests can also lead to false positive results .
Always check the expiration date before testing to assure accurate results .
Keep in mind , even with the highest quality control , an occasional defective test may occur .
The best places to watch a college game are those that have enough space for everyone who wants to attend , yet at the same time are crowded enough to provide all the jostling , cheering elbow - to - elbow excitement fans expect .
They should also have a surplus of mouth - watering , cholesterol - spiking edibles like hotdogs , nachos , popcorn , pretzels , etc .
And do n’t forget the drinks .
Beer on tap is the best way to go , especially if the venue lets you double - fist it .
Sports bars are a great place to go if you ca n’t attend the college game in person .
Choose one with comfortable booths that give you full range of all of its televisions ( and it should have plenty ) .
Make sure the game of your choice is playing on at least one of those TVs , or request it beforehand .
Invite your friends , order some burgers and fries , and prepare to cheer for your favorites .
Another great place to watch a college game is on your living room couch , surrounded by friends , with the barbeque grill working overtime on the patio .
Make sure you get the right channels for the games you want to watch , double - check the times , arrange for enough seating for everyone , and divide up the grocery list among everyone who ’s coming .
If you are close enough to a sports arena to attend the college game in person and you ’ve already scored some tickets , make sure to arrive early enough to find a good parking spot or consider taking public transportation .
Here ’s a list in USA Today on January 18 , 2008 , from author and sports commentator John Feinstein , about the best places to watch college games :
10 . Cassell Coliseum ( Virginia Tech )
9. O’Connell Center ( University of Florida )
8. Mackey Arena ( Purdue University )
7. Hart Recreation Center ( Holy Cross )
6. University Arena ( University of New Mexico )
5. Rose Hill Gym ( Fordham University )
4. Pauley Pavilion ( UCLA )
3. Allen Fieldhouse ( University of Kansas )
2. Cameron Indoor Stadium ( Duke University )
1. The Palestra ( University of Pennsylvania )
What are your top picks for places to watch a college game ?

I . When was Jesus born ?
A. Popular myth puts his birth on December 25th in the year 1 C.E. B. The New Testament gives no date or year for Jesus ’ birth .
The earliest gospel – St. Mark ’s , written about 65 CE – begins with the baptism of an adult Jesus .
This suggests that the earliest Christians lacked interest in or knowledge of Jesus ’ birthdate .
C. The year of Jesus birth was determined by Dionysius Exiguus , a Scythian monk , “ abbot of a Roman monastery .
His calculation went as follows : a .
In the Roman , pre-Christian era , years were counted from ab urbe condita ( “ the founding of the City ” [ Rome ] ) .
Thus 1 AUC signifies the year Rome was founded , 5 AUC signifies the 5th year of Rome ’s reign , etc. b. Dionysius received a tradition that the Roman emperor Augustus reigned 43 years , and was followed by the emperor Tiberius .
c. Luke 3:1,23 indicates that when Jesus turned 30 years old , it was the 15th year of Tiberius reign .
d. If Jesus was 30 years old in Tiberius ’ reign , then he lived 15 years under Augustus ( placing Jesus birth in Augustus ’ 28th year of reign ) .
e. Augustus took power in 727 AUC .
Therefore , Dionysius put Jesus birth in 754 AUC .
f. However , Luke 1:5 places Jesus ’ birth in the days of Herod , and Herod died in 750 AUC – four years before the year in which Dionysius places Jesus birth .
D. Joseph A. Fitzmyer – Professor Emeritus of Biblical Studies at the Catholic University of America , member of the Pontifical Biblical Commission , and former president of the Catholic Biblical Association – writing in the Catholic Church ’s official commentary on the New Testament , writes about the date of Jesus ’ birth , “ Though the year [ of Jesus birth is not reckoned with certainty , the birth did not occur in AD 1 .
The Christian era , supposed to have its starting point in the year of Jesus birth , is based on a miscalculation introduced ca. 533 by Dionysius Exiguus . ”
E. The DePascha Computus , an anonymous document believed to have been written in North Africa around 243 CE , placed Jesus birth on March 28 .
Clement , a bishop of Alexandria ( d. ca. 215 CE ) , thought Jesus was born on November 18 .
Based on historical records , Fitzmyer guesses that Jesus birth occurred on September 11 , 3 BCE .
II .
How Did Christmas Come to Be Celebrated on December 25 ?
A. Roman pagans first introduced the holiday of Saturnalia , a week long period of lawlessness celebrated between December 17 - 25 .
During this period , Roman courts were closed , and Roman law dictated that no one could be punished for damaging property or injuring people during the weeklong celebration .
The festival began when Roman authorities chose “ an enemy of the Roman people ” to represent the “ Lord of Misrule . ”
Each Roman community selected a victim whom they forced to indulge in food and other physical pleasures throughout the week .
At the festival ’s conclusion , December 25th , Roman authorities believed they were destroying the forces of darkness by brutally murdering this innocent man or woman .
B . The ancient Greek writer poet and historian Lucian ( in his dialogue entitled Saturnalia ) describes the festival ’s observance in his time .
In addition to human sacrifice , he mentions these customs : widespread intoxication ; going from house to house while singing naked ; rape and other sexual license ; and consuming human - shaped biscuits ( still produced in some English and most German bakeries during the Christmas season ) .
C. In the 4th century CE , Christianity imported the Saturnalia festival hoping to take the pagan masses in with it .
Christian leaders succeeded in converting to Christianity large numbers of pagans by promising them that they could continue to celebrate the Saturnalia as Christians .
D. The problem was that there was nothing intrinsically Christian about Saturnalia .
To remedy this , these Christian leaders named Saturnalia ’s concluding day , December 25th , to be Jesus ’ birthday .
E. Christians had little success , however , refining the practices of Saturnalia .
As Stephen Nissenbaum , professor history at the University of Massachussetts , Amherst , writes , “ In return for ensuring massive observance of the anniversary of the Savior ’s birth by assigning it to this resonant date , the Church for its part tacitly agreed to allow the holiday to be celebrated more or less the way it had always been . ”
The earliest Christmas holidays were celebrated by drinking , sexual indulgence , singing naked in the streets ( a precursor of modern caroling ) , etc. F . The Reverend Increase Mather of Boston observed in 1687 that “ the early Christians who first observed the Nativity on December 25 did not do so thinking that Christ was born in that Month , but because the Heathens ’ Saturnalia was at that time kept in Rome , and they were willing to have those Pagan Holidays metamorphosed into Christian ones . ”
Because of its known pagan origin , Christmas was banned by the Puritans and its observance was illegal in Massachusetts between 1659 and 1681 .
However , Christmas was and still is celebrated by most Christians .
G. Some of the most depraved customs of the Saturnalia carnival were intentionally revived by the Catholic Church in 1466 when Pope Paul II , for the amusement of his Roman citizens , forced Jews to race naked through the streets of the city .
An eyewitness account reports , “ Before they were to run , the Jews were richly fed , so as to make the race more difficult for them and at the same time more amusing for spectators .
They ran… amid Rome ’s taunting shrieks and peals of laughter , while the Holy Father stood upon a richly ornamented balcony and laughed heartily . ”
H. As part of the Saturnalia carnival throughout the 18th and 19th centuries CE , rabbis of the ghetto in Rome were forced to wear clownish outfits and march through the city streets to the jeers of the crowd , pelted by a variety of missiles .
When the Jewish community of Rome sent a petition in1836 to Pope Gregory XVI begging him to stop the annual Saturnalia abuse of the Jewish community , he responded , “ It is not opportune to make any innovation . ”
On December 25 , 1881 , Christian leaders whipped the Polish masses into Antisemitic frenzies that led to riots across the country .
In Warsaw 12 Jews were brutally murdered , huge numbers maimed , and many Jewish women were raped .
Two million rubles worth of property was destroyed .
III .
The Origins of Christmas Customs A. The Origin of Christmas Tree
Just as early Christians recruited Roman pagans by associating Christmas with the Saturnalia , so too worshippers of the Asheira cult and its offshoots were recruited by the Church sanctioning “ Christmas Trees ” .
Pagans had long worshipped trees in the forest , or brought them into their homes and decorated them , and this observance was adopted and painted with a Christian veneer by the Church .
B. The Origin of Mistletoe
Norse mythology recounts how the god Balder was killed using a mistletoe arrow by his rival god Hoder while fighting for the female Nanna .
Druid rituals use mistletoe to poison their human sacrificial victim .
The Christian custom of “ kissing under the mistletoe ” is a later synthesis of the sexual license of Saturnalia with the Druidic sacrificial cult .
C. The Origin of Christmas Presents
In pre-Christian Rome , the emperors compelled their most despised citizens to bring offerings and gifts during the Saturnalia ( in December ) and Kalends ( in January ) .
Later , this ritual expanded to include gift - giving among the general populace .
The Catholic Church gave this custom a Christian flavor by re-rooting it in the supposed gift - giving of Saint Nicholas ( see below ) .
D. The Origin of Santa Claus a . Nicholas was born in Parara , Turkey in 270 CE and later became Bishop of Myra .
He died in 345 CE on December 6th .
He was only named a saint in the 19th century .
b. Nicholas was among the most senior bishops who convened the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE and created the New Testament .
The text they produced portrayed Jews as “ the children of the devil ” who sentenced Jesus to death .
c.
In 1087 , a group of sailors who idolized Nicholas moved his bones from Turkey to a sanctuary in Bari , Italy .
There Nicholas supplanted a female boon - giving deity called The Grandmother , or Pasqua Epiphania , who used to fill the children 's stockings with her gifts .
The Grandmother was ousted from her shrine at Bari , which became the center of the Nicholas cult .
Members of this group gave each other gifts during a pageant they conducted annually on the anniversary of Nicholas ’ death , December 6 . d. The Nicholas cult spread north until it was adopted by German and Celtic pagans .
These groups worshipped a pantheon led by Woden – their chief god and the father of Thor , Balder , and Tiw .
Woden had a long , white beard and rode a horse through the heavens one evening each Autumn .
When Nicholas merged with Woden , he shed his Mediterranean appearance , grew a beard , mounted a flying horse , rescheduled his flight for December , and donned heavy winter clothing .
e.
In a bid for pagan adherents in Northern Europe , the Catholic Church adopted the Nicholas cult and taught that he did ( and they should ) distribute gifts on December 25th instead of December 6th .
f.
In 1809 , the novelist Washington Irving ( most famous his The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and Rip Van Winkle ) wrote a satire of Dutch culture entitled Knickerbocker History .
The satire refers several times to the white bearded , flying - horse riding Saint Nicholas using his Dutch name , Santa Claus .
g. Dr. Clement Moore , a professor at Union Seminary , read Knickerbocker History , and in 1822 he published a poem based on the character Santa Claus : “ Twas the night before Christmas , when all through the house , not a creature was stirring , not even a mouse .
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care , in the hope that Saint Nicholas soon would be there … ”
Moore innovated by portraying a Santa with eight reindeer who descended through chimneys .
h.
The Bavarian illustrator Thomas Nast almost completed the modern picture of Santa Claus .
From 1862 through 1886 , based on Moore ’s poem , Nast drew more than 2,200 cartoon images of Santa for Harper ’s Weekly .
Before Nast , Saint Nicholas had been pictured as everything from a stern looking bishop to a gnome - like figure in a frock .
Nast also gave Santa a home at the North Pole , his workshop filled with elves , and his list of the good and bad children of the world .
All Santa was missing was his red outfit .

In 1931 , the Coca Cola Corporation contracted the Swedish commercial artist Haddon Sundblom to create a coke - drinking Santa .
Sundblom modeled his Santa on his friend Lou Prentice , chosen for his cheerful , chubby face .
The corporation insisted that Santa ’s fur - trimmed suit be bright , Coca Cola red .
And Santa was born – a blend of Christian crusader , pagan god , and commercial idol .

The Christmas Challenge · Christmas has always been a holiday celebrated carelessly .
For millennia , pagans , Christians , and even Jews have been swept away in the season ’s festivities , and very few people ever pause to consider the celebration ’s intrinsic meaning , history , or origins .
· Christmas celebrates the birth of the Christian god who came to rescue mankind from the “ curse of the Torah . ”
It is a 24 - hour declaration that Judaism is no longer valid .
· Christmas is a lie .
There is no Christian church with a tradition that Jesus was really born on December 25th .
· December 25 is a day on which Jews have been shamed , tortured , and murdered .
· Many of the most popular Christmas customs – including Christmas trees , mistletoe , Christmas presents , and Santa Claus – are modern incarnations of the most depraved pagan rituals ever practiced on earth .
Many who are excitedly preparing for their Christmas celebrations would prefer not knowing about the holiday ’s real significance .
If they do know the history , they often object that their celebration has nothing to do with the holiday ’s monstrous history and meaning .
“ We are just having fun . ” Imagine that between 1933 - 45 , the Nazi regime celebrated Adolf Hitler ’s birthday – April 20 – as a holiday .
Imagine that they named the day , “ Hitlerday , ” and observed the day with feasting , drunkenness , gift - giving , and various pagan practices .
Imagine that on that day , Jews were historically subject to perverse tortures and abuse , and that this continued for centuries .
Now , imagine that your great - great - great - grandchildren were about to celebrate Hitlerday .
April 20th arrived .
They had long forgotten about Auschwitz and Bergen Belsen .
They had never heard of gas chambers or death marches .
They had purchased champagne and caviar , and were about to begin the party , when someone reminded them of the day ’s real history and their ancestors ’ agony .
Imagine that they initially objected , “ We are n’t celebrating the Holocaust ; we ’re just having a little Hitlerday party . ”
If you could travel forward in time and meet them ; if you could say a few words to them , what would you advise them to do on Hitlerday ?
On December 25 , 1941 , Julius Streicher , one of the most vicious of Hitler ’s assistants , celebrated Christmas by penning the following editorial in his rabidly Antisemitic newspaper , Der Stuermer :
If one really wants to put an end to the continued prospering of this curse from heaven that is the Jewish blood , there is only one way to do it : to eradicate this people , this Satan ’s son , root and branch .
It was an appropriate thought for the day .
This Christmas , how will we celebrate ?

UPDATE : We ’re pleased to report that satellite provider Dish Network , the only major television carrier to not offer Logo , has added the 24/7 LGBT network to its HD line - up .
Dish HD customers can now get Logo on channel 373 .
Dish Network remains the sole national carrier of Free Speech TV , the somewhat radical , left - wing alternative network that airs Gay USA , a weekly hard - news show , and other gay - friendly programs .
The HD package that offers Logo costs $ 20 per month , and includes MGM HD and HD Movie Net , both of which air many classic films , all shown uncut ( Truth Wins Out ) .
2/6/09 : Dish Network which bills itself as the leader in satellite home entertainment , and offers virtually all channels available , seems to be having an issue getting LGBT channels .
It seems suspicious , especially in light of the company voting down an anti-discrimination bill a few months ago .
The 24/7 LGBT channel LOGO which is part of the Viacom Network is not included , even though they renewed their contract with DISH Network and now offer channels such as MTV , MTV 2 , BET , Comedy Central , and Nickelodeon .
Here !
TV another gay channel is supposed to be offered , but a reader has tipped me off to the fact that they say it is not available even though the here !
website says it is only available through a special online subscription , it is nowehere to be found on the Dish Network website .
So if they do n't want to have an anti-discrimination bill for their gay employees , and they do n't want to offer gay tv , do they want gay customers ?

Ambers and I discuss the Gregg pull - out , under partisan Republican pressure not to cooperate with the president :
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
The bankers ’ comments , while representing only a random sampling of the more than 200 financial institutions that have received TARP money so far , underscore a growing gulf between public expectations for how the $ 700 billion should be used and the decisions being made by many of the institutions that have taken part .
The program does not dictate what banks should do with the money .
The loose requirements in the original plan have contributed to confusion over what the Treasury intended when it abruptly shelved its first proposal — to buy up bad mortgages — in favor of making direct investments in individual banks in return for preferred shares of stock .
The Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , said in October that banks should “ deploy , not hoard ” the money to build confidence and increase lending .
He added : “ We expect all participating banks to continue to strengthen their efforts to help struggling homeowners who can afford their homes avoid foreclosure . ”
But a Congressional oversight panel reported on Jan. 9 that it found no evidence the bailout program had been used to prevent foreclosures , raising questions about whether the Treasury has complied with the law ’s requirement that it develop a “ plan that seeks to maximize assistance for homeowners . ”
The report concluded that the Treasury ’s top priority seemed to be to “ stabilize financial markets ” by simply giving healthy banks more money and letting them decide how best to use it .
The report also said it was not clear how giving billions to banks “ advances both the goal of financial stability and the well - being of taxpayers , including homeowners threatened by foreclosure , people losing their jobs , and families unable to pay their credit cards . ”
For the banks , fearful that the economic downturn could deepen and wary of risking additional losses , the question of what to do with the bailout money comes down to self - preservation .
Mark Fitzgibbon , research director at Sandler O’Neill & Partners , which sponsored the Palm Beach conference , said banks seemed to be allocating the bailout money for four general purposes : increased lending , absorbing losses , bolstering capital and “ opportunistic acquisitions . ”
He said those approaches made sense from a business perspective , even though they might not conform to popular expectations that the money would be immediately lent to consumers .
I called it an ugly looking reference machine .
So NVIDIA came back and painted it white .
It worked for Apple after all , right ?
Perhaps eight years ago .
As much as I can appreciate beauty , what truly matters here is what ’s on the inside and that ’s what NVIDIA gave me the opportunity to do over this past week .
If you have n’t already seen it , what I ’m talking about is NVIDIA ’s Ion reference platform .
In a nutshell it ’s Intel ’s Atom processor paired with NVIDIA ’s GeForce 9400 M chipset .
I first brought you news of Ion in the middle of December 2008 .
It was delivered in the ugly box mentioned above .
It seemed cool , it worked , but I only spent a few hours with it and was n’t able to benchmark it .
Our next encounter was at CES .
NVIDIA called me up to its hotel room and offered the opportunity to benchmark an overly spec’d Ion box against a standard netbook boasting a much lighter config .
That did n’t work out so well .
This time NVIDIA shipped me a system , now in white .
And I could do whatever I wanted with it .
It does n’t take a visionary to see why Ion would be great .
Take a standard Atom system and give it a modern chipset with better graphics and you ’ve got Ion .
Performance goes up , everyone ’s happy .
Of course it ’s nice to be able to quantify the performance advantage which is what I ’ll be doing today , but for all intents and purposes we ’ve known that Ion is a good thing .
The Need for Ion
Currently most Atom based desktops and notebooks use Intel ’s 945G chipset .
That ’s the chipset before G45 and G35 - heck , even before G965 - released back in 2005 .
It features Intel ’s GMA 950 graphics core , hardly high performance even by Intel ’s standards .
It ’s a two chip solution built on a 130nm process and uses ICH7 for all south bridge / IO functions .
The problem with 945G is that it ’s old , it ’s slow , and it takes up a lot of space .
The aging 945G only supports DDR2 - 667 and generally only gets a single channel of memory on most netbooks / notebooks / desktops .
The chipset ’s performance is n’t terrible but it ’s a bit bandwidth constrained .
The combination of the Atom CPU , 945 GMCH , and ICH7 chips takes up quite a bit of motherboard real estate .
While that ’s acceptable on a desktop motherboard , it is a bit cramped in a netbook .
Standard ATX motherboard ( left ) vs. Ion pico -ITX motherboard ( right )
Intel offers a more compact alternative in the form of the US15 chipset , but that does n’t really address the graphics performance issue .
The Ion motherboard
NVIDIA ’s Ion comes in as an alternative two - chip solution .
The GeForce 9400 M is a single chip , the other chip is the Atom , and the two make up Ion .
You get a modern memory controller as well , supporting both DDR2 and DDR3 memory ( up to DDR3 - 1066 ) .
Graphics performance is better than Intel and you get full HD video decode support .
The Cost of Ion
I point - blank asked NVIDIA what is required for an OEM to develop an Ion based system .
NVIDIA responded by saying that the only thing necessary is that the OEM purchase a GeForce 9400 M chipset ; there are no required platforms or anything like that .
The Ion reference PC is nothing more than a reference , and it does n’t need to be followed .
There are a few dozen
Ion reference platforms out in the hands of OEMs and decision makers in the industry .
NVIDIA expects
Ion to add between $ 50 and $ 100 to the cost of a typical Atom machine .
Availability is still slated for sometime in 2009 , with some systems slated to arrive this summer .
The Test
Unlike the CES Ion comparison , I leveled the playing field .
NVIDIA sent a fully configured Ion reference box with 2GB of DDR3 - 1066 and a dual - core Intel Atom 330 running at 1.6GHz .
I purchased an Intel 945GCLF2 from Newegg for less than $ 60 ( open box ) .
This is a mini-ITX 945G motherboard with a single DDR2 slot and an on - board Atom 330 .
I installed a 2GB DIMM in the board and created a comparable machine to the Ion reference platform .
I used an Intel X25 - M SSD so you can compare the non-gaming numbers from this review to other CPUs in our benchmark database .
In the gaming tests I used a GeForce 9300 motherboard and paired it up with a Celeron 430 to show what a faster CPU could get you with the same graphics used on an Ion platform .
I tested with both single and dual channel DDR2 - 800 memory configurations here , and overclocked the 9300 to the 9400's GPU speeds .
For several years , Israelis and Palestinians played the land - for - peace game .
Each side engaged in a series of elaborate maneuvers designed to get the best possible deal when it came time to negotiate a final status agreement .
But when Hamas , Hezbollah and Iran became leading players in the Middle East struggle , that land - for - peace game was suspended .
A different game with different rules was begun .
This new game is not oriented toward a final agreement .
The extremist groups believe in the eventual extermination of Israel .
They ’re not interested in a handshake on the White House lawn .
In this new game , both sides seek the destruction of the other , but neither has the power to achieve it .
They are engaged in a struggle that has no near - term practical end .
The extremists ’ goal is to kill as many Jews as possible and wait for God ( or Iran ) to kill the rest .
Israel ’s goal is to restrain the brazenness of the extremists until their movement somehow burns itself out or is destroyed from within Arab society .
Israel ’s realistic immediate goal is not to achieve some permanent resolution , but to merely suppress terrorism week by week and month by month .
The writer Michael Oakeshott captured Israel ’s quandary in this game in a famous passage : “ In political activity , then , men sail a boundless and bottomless sea ; there is neither harbor for shelter nor floor for anchorage , neither starting place nor appointed destination .
The enterprise is to keep afloat on an even keel . ”
Jailbreaking an iPhone constitutes copyright infringement and a DMCA violation , says Apple in comments filed with the Copyright Office as part of the 2009 DMCA triennial rulemaking .
This marks the first formal public statement by Apple about its legal stance on iPhone jailbreaking .
Apple 's iPhone , now the best - selling cellular phone in the U.S. , has been designed with restrictions that prevent owners from running applications obtained from sources other than Apple 's own iTunes App Store .
" Jailbreaking " is the term used for removing these restrictions , thereby liberating your phone from Apple 's software " jail . "
Estimates put the number of iPhone owners who have jailbroken their phones in the hundreds of thousands .
As part of the 2009 DMCA rulemaking , EFF has asked the Copyright Office to recognize an exemption to the DMCA to permit jailbreaking in order to allow iPhone owners to use their phones with applications that are not available from Apple 's store ( e.g. , turn - by - turn directions , using the iPhone camera for video , laptop tethering ) .
Apple 's copyright infringement claim starts with the observation that jailbroken iPhones depend on modified versions of Apple 's bootloader and operating system software .
True enough -- we said as much in our technical white paper describing the jailbreak process .
But the courts have long recognized that copying software while reverse engineering is a fair use when done for purposes of fostering interoperability with independently created software , a body of law that Apple conveniently fails to mention .
As for the DMCA violation , Apple casts its lot with the likes of laser printer makers and garage door opener companies who argue that the DMCA entitles them to block interoperability with anything that has n't been approved in advance .
Apple justifies this by claiming that opening the iPhone to independently created applications will compromise safety , security , reliability , and swing the doors wide for those who want to run pirated software .
If this sounds like FUD , that 's because it is .
One need only transpose Apple 's arguments to the world of automobiles to recognize their absurdity .
Sure , GM might tell us that , for our own safety , all servicing should be done by an authorized GM dealer using only genuine GM parts .
Toyota might say that swapping your engine could reduce the reliability of your car .
And Mazda could say that those who throw a supercharger on their Miatas frequently exceed the legal speed limit .
But we 'd never accept this corporate paternalism as a justification for welding every car hood shut and imposing legal liability on car buffs tinkering in their garages .
After all , the culture of tinkering ( or hacking , if you prefer ) is an important part of our innovation economy .
Of course , many iPhone owners will be happy to choose solely from the applications that Apple is willing to approve , just like many Ford owners are happy relying exclusively on their local Ford dealer .
But if you want to pop the hood , the DMCA surely should n't stand in your way .
A new video interview with the governor , who talks at some length about media coverage during and after the campaign .
The interview is by conservative broadcaster John Ziegler , who is producing a documentary , " Media Malpractice ... How Obama Got Elected . "
It was done at her Wasilla home on Monday , and posted clips on YouTube yesterday .
A big chunk of the YouTube clip is Palin teeing off on media coverage of her family .
She talks about a double standard between coverage of her family and Obama's , and suggests a double standard between scrutiny of her and Caroline Kennedy ( who 's pursuing a New York Senate seat ) because of her social class .
" When I heard Barack Obama state in one of his interviews on national television that his wife was off limits , meaning , family 's off limits -- you know , ' Attack me , I 'm the public official , come after me , I can handle it and we 'll duke it out if need be , but family 's off limits ' --
I naively believed , OK , they respected that in him and his demand for that to be adhered , naively believing that must apply to all of us , right ?
But it did n't apply . "
On Kennedy : “ I ’ve been interested also to see how Caroline Kennedy will be handled and if she will be handled with kid gloves or if she will be under such a microscope also .
It ’s going to be interesting to see how that plays out and I think that as we watch that we will perhaps be able to prove that there is a class issue here also that was such a factor in the scrutiny of my candidacy versus , say , the scrutiny of what her candidacy may be . ”
Professional right wing angry person John Ziegler ( remember his potty - mouthed but fact - light challenge of 538.com 's Nate Silver ? ) is busy as a beaver , creating the " documentary " Media Malpractice ...
How Obama
Got Elected about how that " librul media " ( * sigh * Can that phrase be retired yet ? ) failed to do their job and resulted in Barack Obama 's election .
Yeah , that liberal Fox News and Rush Limbaugh ... I 'm sure it had nothing to do with the epic failure of the Republican Party .
But who better to get on camera and grouse about the mean ol ' media than Sarah Palin
Oh yeah , the media has been so kind to Caroline Kennedy .
And do n't get me started on that " Shriekin ' Evil " Keith Olbermann .
The ridiculous lengths Republicans will go to retain their victim status .

This is an interesting example .
It shows up a weakness in the GC that I 'm working on fixing right now .
The interesting aspect of this example is that the thread stacks get large .
You can see this by using +RTS - hT : a large chunk of the heap is taken up by TSOs .
Each of those ( fibs !! 100000 ) requires linear stack , because ( fibs 100000 ) depends on ( fibs 99999 ) , and so on .
That could probably be fixed by adding some strictness , but that 's not the goal here - we should still be able to run the program in parallel .
So when there are large stacks around , GC takes a long time because it has to traverse stacks .
But we should be able to alleviate the problem by ( a ) using a larger heap , and ( b ) using parallel GC .
Not doing parallel GC is seriously going to hurt peformance , because the data will have to be moved from one CPU 's cache to another .
But it turns out that parallel GC is misbehaving on this example too , because it does n't force each stack to be scanned by the same thread that is executing it - I 'm working on fixing that .
Having each CPU be able to GC independently would be a big improvement , of course .
We think we understand how this can be done in the context of GHC , it 's just a matter of doing it , but it 's a big job .
Parallel performance is something that we expect to make dramatic improvements over the next few months as we investigate more programs and improve the tools .
The current HEAD is already a lot better than 6.10.1 .

Greenwald : Cheney setting up Obama in anticipation of another terrorist attack David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday February 5 , 2009
Print This Email This
In an interview with Politico published on Wednesday , former vice president Dick Cheney defended the Bush administration 's use of torture and warrantless surveillance and suggested that unless the Obama administration maintains these policies , it risks a new " 9/11 - type event " that could " involve the deaths of perhaps hundreds of thousands of people . "
" This argument is setting us up for the future , " asserted MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow on Wednesday evening .
" If there is another attack , there 's a reason to keep pushing this legacy ... so that there will be a political blowback against Barack Obama , so ... the country would n't rally around him they way they rallied around Bush and Cheney after 9/11 . "
Constitutional lawyer Glenn Greenwald , who had previously written about the Cheney interview in his blog at Salon , agreed with Maddow : " That 's what 's so nefarious .
It 's setting the groundwork if there is another terrorist attack . "
" Why does it help Dick Cheney politically for him to be scary ? "
Maddow asked .
" There 's really no more effective weapon for a government to keep a citizenry in submission to whatever it wants than keeping the fear level as high as possible , " replied Greenwald .
Greenwald insisted , however , that it is " inane " for Cheney to argue -- and for his supporters in the media to accept -- that " there must be something to what they did , because after all they kept us safe " from a subsequent terrorist attack .
" What they 're really saying , " noted Greenwald , " is , ' During our administration , we allowed one catastrophic terrorist attack on US soil -- but do n't worry , because we only allowed one . ' "
In contrast , then - president Bill Clinton did n't use any of the Bush - Cheney methods following the first terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 , and yet , stated Greenwald , " for the next eight years of the Clinton presidency -- to use the jargon -- 'he kept us safe . ' "
Greenwald added that the Cheney interview does provide an answer to the question Americans were asking in their bewilderment after 9/11 , " Why do they hate us ? "
" The things that he 's saying are things like ... 'we need to be dirty , nasty , and mean in our foreign policy , ' " said Greenwald .
" ' We need to launch wars in order to keep people respectful . ' "
" Those things do n't stop terrorism , " Greenwald commented .
" Those are the things that fuel terrorism . "

A freelance filmmaker in Gaza shot this material for Save the Children at a UN - supported school for pupils displaced from their homes by the Israeli bombings Save the Children
Israel is facing growing demands from senior UN officials and human rights groups for an international war crimes investigation in Gaza over allegations such as the " reckless and indiscriminate " shelling of residential areas and use of Palestinian families as human shields by soldiers .
With the death toll from the 17 - day Israeli assault on Gaza climbing above 900 , pressure is increasing for an independent inquiry into specific incidents , such as the shelling of a UN school turned refugee centre where about 40 people died , as well as the question of whether the military tactics used by Israel systematically breached humanitarian law .
The UN 's senior human rights body approved a resolution yesterday condemning the Israeli offensive for " massive violations of human rights " .
A senior UN source said the body 's humanitarian agencies were compiling evidence of war crimes and passing it on to the " highest levels " to be used as seen fit .
Some human rights activists allege that the Israeli leadership gave an order to keep military casualties low no matter what cost to civilians .
That strategy has directly contributed to one of the bloodiest Israeli assaults on the Palestinian territories , they say .
John Ging , head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency in Gaza , said : " It 's about accountability [ over ] the issue of the appropriateness of the force used , the proportionality of the force used and the whole issue of duty of care of civilians .
" We do n't want to join any chorus of passing judgment but there should be an investigation of any and every incident where there are concerns there might have been violations in international law . "
The Israeli military are accused of :
• Using powerful shells in civilian areas which the army knew would cause large numbers of innocent casualties ;
• Using banned weapons such as phosphorus bombs ;
• Holding Palestinian families as human shields ;
• Attacking medical facilities , including the killing of 12 ambulance men in marked vehicles ;
• Killing large numbers of police who had no military role .
Israeli military actions prompted an unusual public rebuke from the International Red Cross after the army moved a Palestinian family into a building and shelled it , killing 30 .
The surviving children clung to the bodies of their dead mothers for four days while the army blocked rescuers from reaching the wounded .
Human Rights
Watch has called on the UN security council to set up a commission of inquiry into alleged war crimes .
Two leading Israeli human rights organisations have separately written to the country 's attorney general demanding he investigate the allegations .
But critics remain sceptical that any such inquiry will take place , given that Israel has previously blocked similar attempts with the backing of the US .
Amnesty International says hitting residential streets with shells that send blast and shrapnel over a wide area constitutes " prima facie evidence of war crimes " .
" There has been reckless and disproportionate and in some cases indiscriminate use of force , " said Donatella Rovera , an Amnesty investigator in Israel .
" There has been the use of weaponry that should n't be used in densely populated areas because it 's known that it will cause civilian fatalities and casualties .
" They have extremely sophisticated missiles that can be guided to a moving car and they choose to use other weapons or decide to drop a bomb on a house knowing that there were women and children inside .
These are very , very clear breaches of international law . "
Israel 's most prominent human rights organisation , B'Tselem , has written to the attorney general in Jerusalem , Meni Mazuz , asking him to investigate suspected crimes including how the military selects its targets and the killing of scores of policemen at a passing out parade .
" Many of the targets seem not to have been legitimate military targets as specified by international humanitarian law , " said Sarit Michaeli of B'Tselem .
Rovera has also collected evidence that the Israeli army holds Palestinian families prisoner in their own homes as human shields .
" It 's standard practice for Israeli soldiers to go into a house , lock up the family in a room on the ground floor and use the rest of the house as a military base , as a sniper 's position .
That is the absolute textbook case of human shields .
" It has been practised by the Israeli army for many years and they are doing it again in Gaza now , " she said .
While there are growing calls for an international investigation , the form it would take is less clear .
The UN 's human rights council has the authority to investigate allegations of war crimes but Israel has blocked its previous attempts to do so .
The UN security council could order an investigation , and even set up a war crimes tribunal , but that is likely to be vetoed by the US and probably Britain .
The international criminal court has no jurisdiction because Israel is not a signatory .
The UN security council could refer the matter to the court but is unlikely to .
Benjamin Rutland , a spokesman for the Israeli military , said an international investigation of the army 's actions was not justified .
" We have international lawyers at every level of the command whose job it is to authorise targeting decisions , rules of engagement ...
We do n't think we have breached international law in any of these instances , " he said .
A court has heard that the man charged over the Churchill - Jeeralang bushfire in eastern Victoria may need to be protected from other prisoners .
Assistant Police Commissioner Dannye Maloney says the man has been moved to Melbourne due to security concerns .
" People are pointing fingers , people are jumping to conclusions , rumours and innuendos are ebbing ... we do not need that , " he said .
" Let Victoria Police do its role , we identified this person , we are prosecuting this person on behalf of the community . "
The man , who can not be named , has been charged with one count of arson causing death , one count of deliberately lighting a bushfire , and one count of possessing child pornography .
Twenty - one people are confirmed to have died in the bushfire on Saturday .
The man did not attend the brief hearing at the Latrobe Valley Magistrates Court this afternoon .
Magistrate Clive Allsop ordered that he undergo a psychiatric assessment .
There was no application for bail , and the man will appear in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Monday .
On Saturday , the Grand Rapids Press reported on a rally held at the Calder Plaza in conjunction with the national “ Freedom to Marry ” week .
The event–held to promote marriage equality –featured a group of local clergy who support gay marriage .
However , in covering the event , the Grand Rapids Press largely emphasized anti-gay voices .
Rather than covering the event specifically , Press reporter Ted Roelofs decided to make the story about the so - called “ West Michigan divide over gay rights . ”
In the article “ Clergy rally to support gay marriage , ” Roelofs focused the debate over the decision made by WOOD TV 8 not to air an anti-gay special after being pressured by activists .
In the article , Roelofs featured two quotes from the Rev. Frederick Wooden of Fountain Street Church–a gay positive voice –while he included six quotes from anti-gay voices .
Those included the Rev. Dale Cross of Abundant Life Church of God who argued that Christians just want “ the practicing homosexual ” to consider what their choices mean for “ their eternity . ”
A quote from an American Family Association ( AFA ) letter and a Plainfield Township resident who said that the media would rather please “ the radical homosexual ” rather than explore “ the medical and mental health ” issues involved in homosexuality .
Not surprisingly , the Press never explored this claim , instead allowing the anti-gay comment to stand unchallenged .
While the story is upsetting for its over reliance on anti-gay voices , its made all the more upsetting because the frame Roelofs uses –the debate over the anti-gay special –was rejected by the rally ’s organizers .
Roelofs even notes this in the article :
“ Wooden said it was coincidence the Calder Plaza event was scheduled the same week as the WOOD - TV programming battle heated up the local debate over gay rights . ”
Yet that did n’t stop him from using a frame that drummed up “ controversy ” and allowed space for anti-gay comments .

I 'd only meant it as a joke
Me and my friends ( a bunch of crusty grebos to a man ) decided that for a bit of fun we'd go out to Wolverhampton for the night , but to try something different .
We dressed in our best shirts , shined our shoes , applied hairgel and decided to see what life was like in the " trendy " bars we usually eschewed .
Our skills at going undercover as " Kevs " were woeful - we stuck out like sore thumbs to the point the bouncer described my friend Si as " that one with the shirt " in a bar full of men wearing shirts .
The only upshot was that the bar we were in was having a Star Wars night and all the staff were dressed up .
I sidled up to the bar hoping to get served by one of the lucious Leias , but instead found myself confronted with a blond - wigged , judo - suited Luke .
I ordered four pints , he fetched them for me and told me the price .
Quick as a flash ( and grinning like an idiot ) I waved my hand in a mysterious way and said " It 's okay , I 've already paid you for them . "
He said , " You what ? " and I repeated it .
He said , " Oh , right " and walked away to serve someone else .
I did the Jedi mind trick on Luke Skywalker .
I 'd just like to repeat that so that my eight year - old self can feel justifiably proud of his latter - day incarnation : ( , Fri 6 Feb 2009 , 12:07 , 13 replies
Enlarge 1996 photo by Toby Talbot , AP Bad health habit : Fewer women smoked in 2006 than 1997 , but nearly one - third of men 18 - 29 still do .
LIGHTING UP LIGHTING UP Cigarette use among adults 18 - 29 in 2006 : Men : 28.7 %
Women : 20.9 % Source : CDC / NCHS , Health , United States , 2008
Young adults today are n't any healthier than 10 to 15 years ago , and in some cases — obesity , for one — they are significantly less so , says a federal report on the nation 's health released Wednesday .
The annual report , from the National Center for Health Statistics , is based on the most recent data available from a variety of health sources .
It covers health issues across ages and includes for the first time a section on 50 million young adults ages 18 - 29 , a group that is " understudied , " says lead author Amy Bernstein .
The data show that : • About one - third are obese , and one - third are overweight .
• About 30 % do not have health insurance .
•
Among men , almost one - third smoke cigarettes and a quarter binge - drink ( five or more drinks on at least 12 days in the past year ) .
" Saying they 're all basically healthy now does n't take into account ... the long - term effects of health habits formed during this time , " she says .
Obesity has tripled in three decades , to 24 % in 2005 - 06 .
Smoking among women declined nearly 20 % from 1997 to 2006 , but no significant decline was reported among men .
Findings are similar to those in the annual Monitoring the Future survey by the University of Michigan , says co-principal investigator John Schulenberg .
" Any gains we 've been getting over the years with better adolescent health , we 're not realizing in the 18 - 29 group . "
Schulenberg suggests many behaviors , such as smoking and drinking , may be low in high school but pick up after young people leave home .
Bernstein says bad health behaviors have n't seemed to slow among that age group .
" They 're still smoking , still drinking , still taking illicit drugs and not exercising , " she says .
" Whatever we 're doing , we 're not getting through to this particular age group . "

Two of Britain 's most - renowned architects are in the running for the single most audacious renovation in history : the redevelopment of Mecca .
Norman Foster and Zaha Hadid are among 18 architects to have been approached about redesigning Islam 's holiest city by building a mosque complex to host the three million Haj pilgrims who visit every year .
The development would more than triple the central al - Haram mosque 's current 900,000 capacity , making it the highest - occupancy building in the world .
The plans are thought to be backed by Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz .
The remit is to " establish a new architectural vision " for Mecca 's 356,800sq m mosques complex .
The King is to be presented with the proposals by Hadid , 58 , and Foster , 73 , with those of the other designers at an exhibition at the end of the month .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Sources close to the project told The Architect 's Journal the scheme is likely to be phased , the first stage taking the al - Haram mosque capacity to 1.5 million .
That would rise gradually until three million was reached .
Neither Foster nor Hadid wanted to comment on the project last night .
Hadid 's spokesman said he " could neither confirm nor deny " speculation , while Foster 's office said : " It has been leaked and not from us so I 'm unable to comment . "
Other sources describe the project as divided into two " tracks " , one looking at various alternatives for the northern expansion of the al - Haram complex , and the other at the al - Haram itself .
Lord Foster 's firm , Foster & Partners , has been invited to partake in the former with 10 other firms including , reportedly , Atkins Design .
Zaha Hadid , with six other world - renowned firms , has been given the task of re-envisioning the al - Haram mosque itself , as well as " revisiting the whole area of the central district " .
British engineers Adams Kara Taylor and Faber Maunsell are also thought to be under consideration .

Documentary Film is a broad category of visual expression that is based on the attempt , in one fashion or another , to document reality .
Knowledge comes in different ways through our five senses .
Hearing , watching , touching , smelling and tasting are the only doorways to the outer world .
The wise men say that if something is not truly experienced with all our five senses , the experience will be partial , not total .
Therefore in a way almost all our gained knowledge through life is partial .
And maybe they are right .
If we follow that analogy , gaining knowledge through several senses simultaneously is better than through just one .
So , educating through watching educational videos , in this case documentaries , is really a total different experience than educating only on books .

Payment Processor Breach May Be Largest Ever
A data breach last year at Princeton , N.J. , payment processor Heartland Payment Systems may have compromised tens of millions of credit and debit card transactions , the company said today .
If accurate , such figures may make the Heartland incident one of the largest data breaches ever reported .
Robert Baldwin , Heartland 's president and chief financial officer , said the company , which processes payments for more than 250,000 businesses , began receiving fraudulent activity reports late last year from MasterCard and Visa on cards that had all been used at merchants which rely on Heartland to process payments .
Baldwin said 40 percent of transactions the company processes are from small to mid-sized restaurants across the country .
He declined to name any well - known establishments or retail clients that may have been affected by the breach .
Baldwin said it would be unfair to mention any one of his company 's customers .
" No merchant of ours represents even [ one - tenth of one percent ] of our volume , and to put out any name associated with what is obviously an unfortunate incident is not fair , " he said .
" Their customers might end up having their cards used fraudulently , but that fraud might turn out to have come from their store , or it might be from another Heartland store and no one will ever really know . "
Heartland called U.S. Secret Service and hired two breach forensics teams to investigate .
But Baldwin said it was n't until last week that investigators uncovered the source of the breach : A piece of malicious software planted on the company 's payment processing network that recorded payment card data as it was being sent for processing to Heartland by thousands of the company 's retail clients .
Baldwin said Heartland does not know how long the malicious software was in place , how it got there or how many accounts may have been compromised .
The stolen data includes names , credit and debit card numbers and expiration dates .
" The transactional data crossing our platform , in terms of magnitude ... is about 100 million transactions a month , " Baldwin said .
" At this point , though , we do n't know the magnitude of what was grabbed . "
The company stressed that no merchant data or cardholder Social Security numbers , unencrypted personal identification numbers ( PIN ) , addresses or telephone numbers were jeopardized as a result of the breach .
The data stolen includes the digital information encoded onto the magnetic stripe built into the backs of credit and debit cards .
Armed with this data , thieves can fashion counterfeit credit cards by imprinting the same stolen information onto fabricated cards .
" The nature of the [ breach ] is such that card - not - present transactions are actually quite difficult for the bad guys to do because one piece of information we know they did not get was an address , " Baldwin said .
As a result , he said , the prospect of thieves using the stolen data to rack up massive amounts of fraud at online merchants " is not impossible , but much less likely . "
In many cases where a processor experiences a breach , the affected banks may simply re-issue new cards to some customers .
In other cases , consumers may spot the first signs of fraudulent activity by reviewing their bank statements .
It is unclear whether consumers who receive new account numbers from their bank will ever be able to definitively tie the re-issuance to the Heartland breach .
Baldwin said it was not appropriate for Heartland to offer affected consumers credit protection or other identity theft protection services .
" Identity theft protection is appropriate when there is enough personal information lost that identity theft is possible , " he said .
" In this case , the amount of information we know they did not get is long enough that except in very circumscribed cases identity theft is just not possible .
At the same time , we recognize and feel badly about the inconvenience this is going to cause consumers . "
Avivah Litan , a fraud analyst with Gartner Inc. , questioned the timing of Heartland 's disclosure -- a day in which many Americans and news outlets are glued to coverage of Barack Obama 's inauguration as the nation 's 44th president .
" This looks like the biggest breach ever disclosed , and they 're doing it on inauguration day ? "
Litan said .
" I can't believe they waited until today to disclose .
That seems very deceptive . "
Officials from the U.S. Secret Service could not be immediately reached for comment .
Baldwin said Heartland worked to disclose the breach last week .
" Due to legal reviews , discussions with some of the players involved , we could n't get it together and signed off on until today , " Baldwin said .
" We considered holding back another day , but felt in the interests of transparency we wanted to get this information out to cardholders as soon as possible , recognizing of course that this is not an ideal day from the perspective of visibility . "
The Heartland disclosure follows a year of similar breach disclosures at several major U.S. cards processors .
On December 23 , RBS Worldpay , a subsidiary of Citizens Financial Group Inc. , said a breach of its payment systems may have affected more than 1.5 million people .
In March 2008 , Hannaford Brothers Co. disclosed that a breach of its payment systems -- also aided by malicious software -- compromised at least 4.2 million credit and debit card accounts .
In early 2007 , TJX Companies Inc. , the parent of retailers Marshalls and TJ Maxx said a number of breaches over a three - year period exposed more than 45 million credit and debit card numbers .
In 2005 , a breach at payment card processor CardSystems Solutions jeopardized roughly 40 million credit and debit card accounts .
Update , 5:07 p.m. ET : Changed " accounts " in first paragraph to " transactions . "
Also added information from Heartland chief executive about the timing of the breach and the hiring of outside consultants .
Noncommercial file sharing should be legal in Norway , according to the Norwegian Minister of Education .
B�rd Vegar Solhjell wrote in a blog post last week that file sharing is not only a great way to discover new music , but that " there is no future in fighting " against file sharing services .
" All previous technology advances have led to fears that the older format to die .
But TV did not kill radio , the Web did not kill the book , and the download is not going to kill music , " wrote Solhjell .
He goes on to note that artists should still get paid for their work , and discusses the ad - supported revenue model for streaming music that has worked for radio for so long .
When it comes to illegal downloads , however , Solhjell says that those fighting it will only waste their resources .
" This means that less resources is used for printing , transport and music shops .
It is money that can go to the artists . "
Solhjell 's comments come at a time when the IFPI is pressuring Norway 's ISPs to start blocking The Pirate Bay , lest they face legal action from the record labels .
As noted by TorrentFreak , the ISPs have been critical of the IFPI 's demands , and now it appears that they have some allies in the government .
The record industry has , however , succeeded elsewhere in Europe in getting ISPs to start blocking The Pirate Bay — we reported Monday that Ireland 's largest ISP has agreed to begin blocking the site as part of a settlement with the Irish Record Music Association .
Norway 's largest ISP , Telenor , has spoken out against the IFP 's request .
" We are deeply skeptical of blocking , " Telenor information manager Alte Lessum told the Norwegian - language Dagens Naeringsliv .
" Our attitude is that we monitor the network , and not our customers .
We think it is a dangerous road to embark upon to block some content .
We believe the correct way to go to deal with illegal file sharing , is to facilitate legal downloadable content . "
Todd Woody reported last week that the wind energy industry now employs more people than coal mining .
That is 85,000 jobs in wind – a 70 % increase from 2007 – to coal mining ’s 81,000 jobs .
Not bad for an industry that is expected to continue to grow , even if not at the levels of the last year when wind accounted for 42 % of new energy and experienced a 50 % increase in capacity .
Plus , workers in the wind industry do n’t get trapped in mines , contract black lung , or devastate entire communities by blowing up mountains .
While the coal industry overall provides double the number of jobs as wind , it is important to note , as A. Siegel does at Get Energy Smart NOW ! , that coal accounts for about 50 % of our energy output and wind currently makes up 2 % of our energy output .
As a result , it only makes sense in terms of the environment and the economy to invest in wind while making coal - fired power plants jump through more regulatory hoops .
Just do the numbers and it is clear that increasing wind energy output while decreasing coal energy output results in a net gain in jobs – clean , green jobs .
And although American companies are well behind their European competitors when it comes to wind energy development ( though some companies are trying to catch up on wind through innovative technology ) , more U.S. wind energy still means more employment for American workers :
The U.S. wind industry is dominated by European wind developers and turbine makers – General Electric ( GE ) and Clipper are the only two domestic turbine manufacturers – and those companies ’ fortunes rise and fall with the global economy .
As the U.S. market has boomed , European companies have been moving production close to their customers – the percentage of domestically manufactured wind turbine components rose from 30 % to 50 % between 2005 and 2008 , according to the American Wind Energy Association .
– Greenwombat
The Obama stimulus package , assuming it gets through the House and Senate negotiations unscathed , includes $ 54 billion for green projects that include renewable energy like wind .
It also includes a 3 - year extension of an important production tax credit that helped stimulate the massive growth in the wind industry during the last year .
This tax credit may not be enough , however , to overcome the current economic conditions of too few investments going anywhere .
That would be a true shame as the numbers do n’t lie .
Clean energy not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions , but creates jobs .
Both are outcomes that we desperately need .

You would probably never sell out your friend for $ 5 .
But 500 cents ?
Now you ’re talking !
Sure , the value is the same , but researchers have found that people are often lured into making decisions by numbers that seem bigger than they really are .
Writing in the January issue of Psychological Science , Ellen E. Furlong and John E. Opfer of Ohio State suggested that the flaw in thinking might lead people astray in activities as different as bargaining and gambling .
The researchers asked volunteers to take part in a behavioral test known as the prisoner ’s dilemma , in which two partners are offered various rewards to either work together or defect .
The idea is that in the long term , the participants earn the most money by cooperating .
But in any given round of play , they make the most if they decide to turn against their partner while he stays loyal .
( The reward is lowest when both partners defect . )
The economy train is still going strong , just without passengers .
Intel is now planning to lay off up to 6,000 employees and close some of its facilities .
Intel plans to cut up to nearly 6,000 jobs and close four facilities in a move that will see the chip giant restructuring its manufacturing operations .
Announced on Wednesday , two assembly and test facilities – one in Penang , Malaysia and another in Cavite , Philippines , will slowly be brought to an end .
Intel also plans to halt production at two wafer - production plants – Fab 20 , which is an older 200 mm wafer fabrication plant located in Hillsboro , Oregon , and D2 , a facility in Santa Clara , California .
These changes will affect between 5,000 and 6,000 employees of Intel worldwide according to Intel .
However , not all of these employees will be out of work as Intel plans to offer some employees a chance to relocate and take up work at other facilities not included into the restructuring plans .
Intel will gradually be closing the four facilities between now and the end of 2009 .
According to Intel the closures are designed to “ align its manufacturing capacity to current market conditions . ”
For the first time Intel has seen its profits plunge nearly 90 percent from a nearly a year previous – falling short of Wall Street estimates .
CEO Paul Otellini told employees last week that the company could very well see its first quarterly loss in 22 years .
Original source .
The makers of the PearC brand of Mac clones say they 're standing on solid legal ground in Germany and will withstand legal action from Apple .
A spokesman for HyperMegaNet UG , which sells the Intel - powered towers under the PearC brand with a copy of Mac OS X installed , said while the company has n't heard from Apple Legal yet it is " awaiting some soon . "
" First , we try to settle with Apple out of court , " Dirk Bloessl told Computerworld in an e-mail .
" But if necessary , we are not afraid of going to court with Apple . "
On PearC 's website , the FAQ section includes the question " Is the PearC legal ? "
The answer reads , " Yes .
According to european laws Apples EULA is void . "
The saber - rattling from HyperMegaNet comes while Apple and Florida - based cloner Psystar are engaged in a similar dispute over copyright and competition , but according to the German company , PearC does not violate Apple 's copyright or EULA there .
" The German law says explicit[ly ] , that restrictions made after buying a product are not valid , " Bloessl said .
" So , because Apple 's EULA can [ only ] be first read after buying and starting the setup , they are invalid in Germany . "
That is , since the system has already been paid for and turned on before the End User License Agreement ever appears , Apple can't make " restrictions " on the use of the operating system , HyperMegaNet argues .
According to the clone maker 's website , the PearC Starter " combines good performance with an appropriate power drain " for 599 euros , or roughly $ 773 .
The base configuration ships with a 2.5GHz Intel Pentium Dual Core , 250GB hard drive , 2GB of 1066MHz DDR2 memory , a 256MB GeForce 7200 GS graphics card from NVIDIA , three FireWire 400 ports , and ten USB 2.0 ports .
Meanwhile , the PearC Advanced ( 799 euros or $ 1030 ) is the " allround computer " that ships with a 3.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo , 500GB hard drive , 4GB of memory , a 512MB NVIDIA GeForce 8400 GS graphics card , and wireless .
Available upgrade options include a Core 2 Quad processor , 1TB hard drive , 8GB of memory , a 1024GB NVIDIA GeForce 9800GTX
Plus , a second hard drive up to 1TB that can be preinstalled with Vista Home Premium , XP Professional , or Vista Ultimate , and a writable Blu - Ray drive .
The site offers to ship to Germany , Belgium , Denmark , Finland , France , Greece , Ireland , Luxembourg , Italy , the Netherlands , Austria , Poland , Portugal , Sweden , Spain , and the U.K .
Back in the United States , a case that began in July recently took a few steps forward with Psystar 's filing of an amended complaint late last week .
Well , I decided to take up Robb 's challenge and come up with something for the football weekend .
But I wanted to push the envelope a little with an over the top , artery clogging , bad for you something .
And that something turned out to be corn dog tamales .
I went back to J.C. Reid 's blog for the link to Alton Brown 's recipe for the batter .
The batter is buttermilk - based with creamed corn , grated onion , jalapeno chiles , flour and cornmeal and it sounded delish .
Saturday morning saw me armed with my two dozen H.E.B. tamales , bamboo skewers from the Chinese grocery store , a gallon of oil and the will to make this most evil of football week - end snacks .
They were deep fried at 375 F and drained of as much oil as could be done .
I refused to taste them but they got thumbs up from my tasters .
A friend remarked that they would sell really well at a Renaissance festival .
So if you 're up for it , here 's a confirmation that it can be done .
One note though .
Do n't heat your tamales first .
Take them out of the fridge and skewer them while cold and hard .
And do n't forget to remove the shucks .
Market participants traded 225 interest rate swaps linked to the secured overnight funding rate ( SOFR ) in the week ending September 20 , the highest weekly tally on record .
The trade count had ratcheted up over the preceding weeks , with 189 swaps struck the week ending September 13 and 104 the week before that .
An average of 42 SOFR swap trades have been made per week going back to July 22 , 2018 , when the first swaps were struck .
Honey is produced by tiny hard - working creatures – bees .
The honey of premium quality comes from drought climate areas because it is richer in healing substances and low in moisture .
Honey is very valuable , complex and extremely biologically active natural food product .
It mostly consists of glucose and fructose .
Honey also provides a great variety of micro- and macro elements and the wide complex of vitamins , about 400 components in total .
Exact composition of honey largely depends on the area it is produced and the type of flowers it is gathered from .
Honey as a Rich Source of Energy
Honey is a good source of energy , because 100 g of honey provides 315 kcal .
Not for nothing it is considered to be the elixir of youth as latest scientific studies showed that the regular consumption of honey is able to boost the vitality of our body into prolonged life span .
Healing Properties of Honey
Healing properties of honey have been known since ancient times .
However , the research into the health benefits of honey is not completed yet .
Scientists keep discovering new things about the health effects of this unique food product and constantly find new ways to apply it for medical purposes .
For example , new studies say the healing properties of honey increase with age .
Health Benefits of Honey
It helps against digestive system conditions – ulcers , gastritis , constipation and colitis .
system conditions – ulcers , gastritis , constipation and colitis .
It is effective in treatment of liver and kidney disorders .
Honey also helps against cardiovascular problems , blood disorders and anemia .

It cures the disorders of upper and lower air passages .
It helps against gynecological conditions – erosions and inflammations .
It is highly effective against eye disorders .
Honey normalizes metabolism .
.
It improves memory and stimulates brain activity .
It helps against nervous system disorders –neurasthenia , insomnia , headaches and depression .
fructose has strong anti-bacterial properties .
Even if honey does not affect viruses directly , it fights them in indirect way by strengthening the immune system .
Note :
It would be great preventive measure to make a practice of eating 1 - 2 tablespoonfuls of honey on a daily basis .
It is also idea to replace sugar with honey when cooking .
That would be not only tasty but a healthy change .

Posted on 24 February 2009 by Quaid
Hi , all , Quaid here with a piece of information that makes me excited .
Not necessarily because I am a fan of the service ( never even tried it ) , but because I am a fan of the idea .
I said in my Blu - Ray article ( which you can find HERE ) that I was hoping to skip Blu - Ray as a format .
Not because I do n’t like the image quality , but because I think physical discs are a dying medium for films .
I do n’t want to spend thousands of dollars on discs that will be replaced quickly with a new technology that is already here .
And that new technology is digital downloading of High - Definition films .
Now , just today , The Hollywood Reporter tells us that the online rental company Vudu will begin to offer HD movies for permanent download .
It ’s going to start with 50 titles , including Man on Wire , and will offer the movies for $ 13.99 - $ 23.99 ( which is a little cheaper than Blu - Ray last I checked ) .
But what about storage ?
Seems you can store the movies on either your “ Vudu box ” or in the “ Vudu Vault , ” an online storage solution .
Me , I just want to be able to pull the movie onto my terabyte harddrive and keep them close by .
Vudu wo n’t let me do this , sadly , as it is a set - top - box oriented service .
Now if only iTunes would follow suit , offering all of their movies to purchase in HD , we ’d be set .
And if Netflix offered HD streaming of rental films .
And they offered all the Blu - Ray extras via some new codec like RatDVD .
Do it now !
The internet at large will resort to piracy if you do n’t give them what they want .
It ’s an inevitability .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- A British Royal
Navy nuclear submarine and its French equivalent collided while on operations in the Atlantic Ocean earlier this month , defense ministries in Paris and London confirmed Monday .
The British Royal Navy submarine HMS Vanguard .
Both vessels , HMS Vanguard and Le Triomphant , were armed with nuclear warheads and suffered damage but were able to return to port under their own power following the collision .
" Two " SNLE " ( nuclear submarines ) , one French and the other British , were , a few days ago , on standard patrols in the Atlantic .
They briefly came in contact in a very slow speed while they were immersed , " the French Ministry of Defense said in a statement .
" There is no casualty or injury among the crew .
Neither the nuclear deterrent mission nor the nuclear security have been compromised . "
In an earlier press release issued on February 6 , the Ministry of Defense said the vessel 's sonar dome had been damaged in a collision .
The vessel was able to return to its base at Ile Longue in Brittany , northwest France , accompanied by a frigate .
The UK's Ministry of Defence also confirmed the incident .
In a statement , the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Jonathan Band said the collision occurred during " routine national patrols . "
Watch Band describe " slow - speed impact " »
" Both submarines remained safe and no injuries occurred .
We can confirm that the capability remained unaffected and there has been no compromise to nuclear safety , " Band said .
HMS Vanguard returned to its home base at Faslane in Scotland on February 14 .
The UK's Sun newspaper reported that dents and scrapes were visible on the vessel 's hull as it was towed into dock by a tugboat .
Both the UK and French nuclear deterrent operations depend on complete secrecy , despite both countries ' membership of NATO .
But naval analyst Richard Cobbold told CNN that procedures would be in place to ensure that French and British submarines were routinely kept apart .
" Either one of these submarines was doing something different or somebody made a mistake -- but we do n't know that , " Cobbold said .
Watch why the collision is an embarrassment for both the British and the French »
Both submarines were equipped with state - of - the - art sonar technology , but Cobbold said it was possible that neither was aware of the close proximity of the other vessel .
" Modern submarines are very , very quiet .
In many types of water conditions they might not hear the approach of another submarine , " he said .
But with both nations keeping at least one nuclear - armed submarine constantly at sea for the past 40 years , he said it was no surprise that they had eventually ended up in the same area of ocean .
" Even in an ocean the size of the North Atlantic the submarines are eventually going to be in the same patch of water at the same time , " he said .
In a statement issued Monday , the UK - based Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament described the incident as " a nuclear nightmare of the highest order . "
" The collision of two submarines , both with nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons onboard could have released vast amounts of radiation and scattered scores of nuclear warheads across the seabed , " said CND chair Kate Hudson .
" The dents reportedly visible on the British sub show the boats were no more than a couple of seconds away from total catastrophe . "
Hudson said the incident was the most serious involving a nuclear submarine since the sinking of the Russian Kursk in 2000 with the loss of the vessel 's entire 118 - man crew .

Navy says sub leaked radiation since 2006
HMS Vanguard , which was launched in 1992 , is one of four submarines which make up the UK 's nuclear deterrent .
Its firepower includes 16 Trident II D5 missiles capable of delivering multiple warheads to targets up to a range of 4,000 nautical miles .
The 150 - meter vessel carries a crew of 141 and is powered by a uranium - fueled pressurized water reactor .
Vanguard Class submarines routinely spend weeks at a time underwater on patrol in the North Atlantic .
But contact with naval commanders and government officials , including the defense secretary and the prime minister , is maintained at all times by a " comprehensive network of communications installations , " the Royal Navy Web site said .
Le Triomphant was launched in 1994 and entered service in 1997 with a crew of 111 , according to the GlobalSecurity.org
Web site .
Its weapons include 16 M45 missiles capable of launching multiple nuclear warheads .
The UK has maintained a nuclear arsenal since 1956 , with at least one nuclear - armed submarine somewhere at sea continuously since 1969 .
In 2006 the government approved plans to develop a new generation of nuclear weapon - carrying submarines which is due to be ready to replace the Vanguard Class by 2024 .
But the program , which is expected to cost around £ 20 billion ( $ 29 billion ) , has been heavily criticized by anti-nuclear campaigners .

TV Zombies Take Over the Consumer Electronics Show
January 8th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Apparently , a group of TV zombies have taken over the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
Why ?
Because all those supposedly “ green ” electronics being exhibited are actually heading to the dumpster after they ’ve died .
For more info on which companies are actually making the effort to help consumers recycle their TVs , check out the Take Back My TV Recycling Report Card .
Also , stay tuned for our interview tomorrow with Barbara Kyle , the National Coordinator of the Electronics TakeBack Coalition .

California ’s desert lands are in some ways a perfect fit with the renewable energy industries necessary to combat climate change .
There ’s sun .
There ’s wind .
There ’s space .
But without careful planning and regulation , these “ climate solutions ” could irrevocably damage the planet they are intended to protect .
The biologically rich but arid desert ecosystems are remarkably fragile .
Once topsoil and plant life have been disrupted for the placement of solar arrays , wind farms , power plants , transmission lines and CO2 scrubbers , restoration would be cost - prohibitive , if not technically impossible .
And widespread desert construction -- even of projects aimed at environmental mitigation -- would devastate the very organisms and ecosystems best able to adjust to a warming world .
Nevertheless , there is a public land rush underway .
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management is processing more than 180 permit applications from private companies to build solar and wind projects in the California deserts .
One such venture , the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System , will begin construction this year in a beautiful valley near the California - Nevada border in San Bernardino County .
It will occupy 3,400 acres , and that does n’t include the land needed for transmission lines .
Most projects are even larger , averaging 8,000 acres , with a few exceeding 20,000 acres .
The total public land under consideration for alternative energy production exceeds 1.45 million acres in this state alone .
The scale of some proposals borders on fantasy .
One Columbia University scientist , Wallace Broecker , has proposed installing 60 million CO2 scrubbers , each a 50 - foot - tall tower , throughout the world ’s deserts -- 17 million of them in the United States -- for the purpose of capturing greenhouse gases .
One appeal of locating projects in remote regions is that there is n’t as much NIMBYism in those areas , so approvals can be easier to get .
But there is another way .
Why not install scrubbers in parking garages , skyscrapers , transit tunnels and other existing structures ?
Existing commercial and residential rooftops , landfills , marginal agricultural lands and mine sites could readily accommodate these green technologies , and we would be creating energy closer to where it is needed .
At this point in the evolution of our ecological psychology , we need to acknowledge the true costs of any energy development .
When a dam is built , a river is lost .
But people who turn on their tap and draw that water rarely think about the river that was destroyed to produce it .
Similarly , if we choose to place our “ ugly ” industrial technologies in the wilderness , there will be less awareness of the damage , less incentive to conserve .
The out - of - sight - out - of - mind approach to solving such problems exacerbates parochial thinking and reduces the obligation of each citizen to contribute by consuming less , or by allowing solar panels to be installed on rooftops .
Besides , have n’t we learned these lessons from the destruction of other valuable ecosystems ?
We now spend billions of dollars every year to repair levees and restore wetlands that never should have been “ reclaimed ” in the name of land development .
Although the government should be encouraging alternative energy , the cumulative effects of projects need to be analyzed across the entire desert landscape .
Many are within or adjacent to designated wilderness , desert tortoise habitats , archaeological sites and the BLM ’s areas of critical environmental concern .
Roads , rails and aqueducts already harm desert bighorn sheep and other sensitive species while spreading weeds , increasing fire frequency and degrading the life - giving qualities of the native vegetation .
Such large - scale effects cannot be addressed on a project - by - project basis , as is done through the existing environmental review process .
We need effective , desert - wide planning that engages the major public and private stakeholders that determine the fate of California desert land .
The costs of industrializing the biologically rich California deserts will be measured in terms of species extinction , ecosystem degradation and the perpetuation of human self - deception .
We know better than to rush .
A cautious , informed and integrated approach will secure sustainable , clean energy without sacrificing the future of these precious lands .

Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle ’s decision Tuesday to withdraw as nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services was a setback for President Obama ’s goal of reforming the U.S. healthcare system .
What could that mean for you ?
Three words : health savings account .
As healthcare costs for employers continue to soar , and as hopes fade for quick relief from Washington , a growing number of businesses are expected to stop offering costly insurance benefits and push workers instead into tax - free health savings accounts .
Proponents of the accounts , which operate like 401 ( k ) s for medical expenses , say they give people more control over their healthcare spending .
They also say people become savvier medical consumers when they ’re more aware of the costs of treatments and procedures .
Advertisement
Critics of health savings accounts counter that the plans favor the healthy and wealthy , and can increase medical costs for everyone else by requiring people to take out high - deductible insurance policies that kick in only after thousands of dollars in healthcare expenses have been rung up .
“ Most people ca n’t even afford to put money into the account , ” said Jerry Flanagan , health policy director for Consumer Watchdog in Santa Monica .
“ All the money goes into premiums and deductibles . ”
Health savings accounts were introduced five years ago as an alternative to traditional employer - based health coverage .
Although they were championed by former President Bush as a way for Americans to exercise more control over healthcare spending , most employers have been wary of embracing them .
According to a recent report from the Government Accountability Office , only about 2 % of the more than 200 million Americans with private insurance have opted for health savings accounts .
Advertisement
But market researcher Diamond Management & Technology Consultants predicted in a report last month that as many as 10 million Americans would be enrolled in health savings accounts by next year , or about twice the number in 2007 .
Larger employers remain wary of saddling workers with high - deductible insurance plans , Diamond found , but smaller businesses are increasingly turning to health savings accounts as a way to ease runaway healthcare costs .
“ Small employers want to do the right thing , ” said Karen Pollitz , a research professor at Georgetown University ’s Health Policy Institute .
“ They want to provide healthcare .
But each year they have less money . ”
Health savings accounts , she said , “ give employers an opportunity to shift more healthcare costs onto employees . ”
Advertisement
However , this also leaves employees increasingly at the mercy of insurance companies offering “ HSA - compatible ” policies .
Sherman Oaks lawyer Ellen Kornblum , 51 , thought she was getting her healthcare expenses under control when she opened a health savings account a couple of years ago .
Although she was wary of the $ 3,500 deductible that came with the eligible policy offered by her insurer , Anthem Blue Cross , Kornblum was pleased that her annual premiums had been reduced to $ 2,544 .
As of March 1 , however , Anthem plans to raise rates for thousands of policyholders statewide .
In Kornblum ’s case , that will mean a whopping 25 % increase to $ 3,192 in premiums .
Advertisement
“ I ’m OK with a plan that has a low premium and a high deductible , ” she told me .
“ I do n’t like a plan that has a high premium and a high deductible . ”
Kornblum said she might now switch back to a pricier policy with a lower deductible .
Jerry Slowey , an Anthem spokesman , said the company ’s higher premiums reflected rising healthcare costs across the board .
“ The increasing need for medical services , the use of new , expensive prescription drugs and advanced technologies are driving up the cost of healthcare , ” he said .
“ We understand and share the concerns of our members over rising healthcare costs and higher premiums . ”
That ’s nice .
But Pollitz at Georgetown University said insurers such as Anthem were just playing the odds .
Advertisement
“ They sell you the policy on the assumption that you wo n’t make any claims right away , ” she said .
“ But over time they know you will make claims .
That ’s why insurers do n’t want you sticking around too long with lower premiums . ”
That ’s one of the fundamental flaws of health savings accounts -- the notion that affordable insurance plans will be available to meet healthcare needs .
Federal law requires account holders to be responsible for at least the first $ 1,100 in annual costs ( $ 2,200 for family policies ) .
In reality , many eligible policies come with deductibles three times that amount .
Another issue is that health savings account holders , as with 401 ( k ) holders , may be tempted to invest their money in mutual funds offering the best potential for capital gains .
That sounds fine in theory .
Advertisement
In reality , would you want your healthcare nest egg to take the same beating your retirement fund took over the last year ?
What if , God forbid , you actually needed it ?
Just as most employers found pension plans to be unsustainable and have turned instead to 401 ( k ) s to meet workers ’ retirement needs , so too will they increasingly move away from group insurance policies and adopt health savings accounts .
And , as with 401 ( k ) s , they ’ll soften the blow by contributing to employees ’ accounts , at least for a while .
“ There ’s a seductive notion that some healthcare is better than none , ” Pollitz said .
“ But that ’s not really the case .
You would n’t say that part of an air bag is better than none .
You need complete protection . ”
Advertisement
When you take into account Medicare , Medicaid , veterans assistance and similar programs , it turns out that more than half of all Americans are already receiving health coverage from the government .
Want to help working families and cash - strapped businesses ?
Extend Medicare to everyone , with employers and workers covering the tab with tax money , rather than premiums , deductibles and co-pays .
It may not be a perfect solution , but it ’s a lot better than most of the alternatives out there .
Whoever ’s next in line behind Daschle should make it a priority .

UPDATE : Join us for an expert - led reader forum April 13 - 17 on MotherJones.com around the question : Is organic and local so 2008 ?
nestled deep in the tropical rainforest on the island of Borneo , Pareh is a collection of about 60 weathered wooden houses perched on stilts and enfolded by coconut palms , banana trees , and the dappled green overhang of the towering forest .
Pareh ’s inhabitants belong to the indigenous tribes of Borneo collectively identified as the Dayak .
They have lived here for centuries , raising rubber trees , pumpkin , cassava , and rice , and harvesting wood for fuel and lumber .
In 2005 , a group of village men went hunting in the forest several hours from Pareh and stumbled on a clearing in which the trees had recently been felled .
That was how they discovered that Perseroan Terbatas Ledo Lestari , or ptll , a subsidiary of an Indonesian company named Duta Palma Nusantara , was seizing their ancestral land to establish a massive plantation of oil palms , a tree whose oil is rendered and refined into biodiesel .
( One of Duta Palma ’s major customers is Wilmar International Ltd , a Singapore - based firm in which US agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland holds a 16 percent stake . )
Over the next two years ptll destroyed 15,000 acres , which the Dayak say amounts to three - quarters of their “ customary forest ” — land that ’s vital for their survival and to which they have certain rights under Indonesian law .
The plantation also uprooted monkeys and wild boar , which began raiding the community ’s food supply .
Because ptll replaced diverse forest with a monocrop , pests invaded Pareh ’s subsistence gardens .
Rice crops failed .
The Dayak filed complaints with regional and national officials ; at one point they commandeered one of ptll ‘s bulldozers ( an offense for which Momonus , the village head , and Jamaluddin , an elder , served jail time — . pdf ) .
The clearing went on .
Increasingly desperate , in 2007 the people of Pareh offered ptll a drastic compromise .
The villagers would surrender every acre the plantation had illegally seized if the company agreed to take no more land .
There was no response .
Soon after , a villager obtained a ptll map showing the company ’s long - term plan :
It aimed to clearcut 50,000 acres , more than three times as much land as it had already taken .
On the map , both Pareh and its sister village , Semunying , were gone .
Later that fall , a hunting party was searching for wild boar when the men heard the unmistakable whine of chain saws .
This time , they did n’t write up a complaint — they assembled a posse .
More than 60 people from Pareh and Semunying descended on the site .
They found a clearcutting crew in action , protected by Indonesian army troops ; by way of protest , they seized 11 chain saws .
“ If we did n’t do anything , our land would be gone , ” a defiant Jamaluddin told me .
with governments and consumers scrambling for alternatives to fossil fuel , worldwide demand for biofuels has gone through the roof ; in Europe , where more than half of all new automobiles run on diesel , consumption of biodiesel is set to triple by 2010 .
US subsidies for biofuels , mostly ethanol , will add up to $ 92 billion between 2006 and 2012 , and producers in developing countries like Indonesia are often eligible for millions of dollars in development money from the World Bank .
But amid the hype , problems have emerged .
Biodiesel emits less than one - quarter the carbon of regular diesel once it ’s burned .
But when production — and the destruction of ecosystems in the developing countries where most biofuel crops are grown — is factored in , many biofuels may actually emit more carbon than does petroleum , the journal Science reported last year .
Because oil palms do n’t absorb as much CO 2 as the rainforest or peatlands they replace , palm oil can generate as much as 10 times more carbon than petroleum , according to the advocacy group Food First .
Thanks in large part to oil palm plantations , Indonesia is now the world ’s third - largest emitter of CO 2 , trailing only the US and China .
Yet Indonesia aims to expand these plantations from 16 million acres currently to almost 26 million by 2015 .
If deforestation , which is due largely to oil palm , continues at the present rate , 98 percent of the country ’s forest — one of only a handful of large rainforests remaining in the world — will be degraded or gone by 2022 .
And although Indonesia has strict environmental regulations and formally recognizes customary land rights , those laws are only as effective as the local bureaucrats enforcing them .
“ For the permit certification , a guy just comes to your office and you just pay him off , ” explains Ong Kee Chau , a former Wilmar executive who was responsible for most of the company ’s operations on Borneo .
“ This is how it works . ”
For everyone from national politicians to struggling villagers , biofuel represents opportunity .
“ Oil palm is one of our areas of competitiveness , ” explains Herry Purnomo , an Indonesia - based forestry researcher .
“ We ca n’t compete with information technologies or in auto manufacturing , but we have plantations . ”
the only way to get to Pareh is to travel up the Kumba River , typically in a traditional wooden boat fitted with an outboard motor .
When I make the trip with a researcher from Friends of the Earth - Indonesia , we arrive about two hours after sundown .
Momonus and his wife , Margareta , receive us in their home .
( The people I meet in Pareh all go by single names . )
There is no furniture ; we sit in flickering candlelight around plastic tablecloths spread on the floor .
Pages of newspaper have been pasted over gaps in the walls , and in one room I read a story about girls being kidnapped and used as sex slaves by plantation workers .
After a meal of fiddlehead ferns and banana flowers , the front room begins to fill with village men who spill out onto the porch and linger in the doorway .
All wear freshly washed T - shirts and jeans or khakis , and all of them smoke except Momonus , a 38 - year - old with a low , solid build , dark hair , and a thin mustache .
The men tell me that if the government and Duta Palma continue to rebuff them , they will resort to their machetes .
( The Dayak have a history of head - hunting , although nowadays they mostly use that reputation to inspire fear . )
As the meeting winds down , Julian , a young father of two , asks if anyone has been to the boundary between the forest and the plantation .
Another young man speaks up .
Yes , he was recently there , and did n’t see any logging .
The next day , I go with Momonus , Julian , and two other villagers to see for ourselves .
On motorbikes , we navigate the ribbon of slick mud that passes for a road .
After two perilous hours , we reach the land Duta Palma has seized .
The contrast between past and future is extreme .
The ancestral forest is carpeted with ferns and flowers ; monkeys swing from branches of wild mango , teak , and ironwood trees , and soaring above it all is a majestic canopy of dipterocarps .
One of the rainforest ’s iconic treasures , dipterocarps bloom just once every four years but do so in unison , their vivid red flowers erupting over millions of acres .
Across the road is a moonscape .
Charred trunks lie prone as far as the eye can see .
On the horizon we can make out a thin emerald seam — the encroaching column of palms .
Duta Palma has also planted seedlings in a narrow band along the border of the community ’s land , like a message written in green :
The forest belongs to the palm .
We pass the area denuded last fall , and the empty military guard post set up to protect the loggers .
Farther along we find a camp .
A blue tarp is pitched over a platform covered with bedding and folded clothes .
Momonus lifts the lid on a pot of rice ; it ’s still warm .
He takes a stub of wood from the cooking fire and writes on the platform in thick black letters :
Stop destroying the ancestral forest !!!
We hit the road again .
After a few miles , we come to an abrupt halt — several recently downed trees are blocking the way .
As the drone of chain saws reverberates , a few workers emerge from the trees .
Unlike the people of Pareh , they have tattered clothes and black teeth .
Momonus calmly exchanges words with one of them and heads into the forest to see what ’s going on .
When he returns 10 minutes later , his eyes shine with rage .
Then another man , better dressed than the laborers , comes barreling toward us on a white motorcycle .
He , too , looks furious .
Momonus orders us on the bikes , and we speed away .
When we finally stop , Momonus reminds me where I ’ve seen the man before .
He was the villager at the meeting last night who said the clearing had stopped .
He is Momonus ’ brother - in - law .
I have just witnessed the palm companies ’ modus operandi in miniature .
Operatives will proposition community members to assemble a logging crew in return for a sum that is insignificant to the company and a fortune to a villager .
Some people will say no —Julian refused $ 6,000 .
But the company will keep trying until someone says yes , and someone almost always does .
This helps the plantations expand into the forests , but , even more important , it sows betrayal and division that undermine the opposition .
A few days later , I get a text message from Momonus saying that the community went back to the clearing and confiscated 20 chain saws .
is there any hope for Indonesia ’s rainforests — and the people who depend on them ?
To answer that question , I visit an older oil palm plantation , Perseroan Terbatas Bumi Pratama Khatulistiwa .
It ’s owned by Wilmar and located in the coastal district of Pontianak , near the village of Mega Timur .
This terrain used to be tropical peatland forest , but in 1996 , Wilmar began razing the groves and digging deep canals to drain the soil .
Now the land is a uniform grid of oil palms .
According to Greenpeace ( .pdf ) , the destruction and degradation of Indonesian peatlands releases 4 percent of the world ’s total greenhouse gas emissions .
Unlike the Dayak of Pareh , the peasants of Mega Timur welcomed the plantation , seeing it as their ticket to a better life .
Many families agreed to surrender their land to Wilmar ; each received in exchange a smaller plot sown with palm , with the cost of the planting passed on to the family in the form of a loan .
This is a common arrangement that somewhat resembles sharecropping :
The peasants are obliged to sell their harvest to the company at a set price , regardless of the market rate .
The Wilmar plantation siphons off half the money as payments on the planting loans ; it also deducts fees for roads and drainage systems , fertilizer and pesticides , harvest collection , security and administrative charges , and a deposit into a mandatory savings account .
After almost a decade of working with the company , none of the smallholders I talk to know how much they ’ve earned , how much they ’ve saved , or what portion of their loans they ’ve paid .
They do know , however , that floods are common now that the wetlands are gone .
Several times a year their fields are submerged , sometimes for weeks on end .
Wilmar is currently under scrutiny for illegalities at three other plantations , including logging protected areas , using fire to clear trees , forcibly removing peasants and indigenous people , and operating without proper permits .
These activities violate Wilmar ’s own social responsibility policies , as well as the standards of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil , an industry - led oversight group the company belongs to , and the International Finance Corporation , a World Bank agency that has provided Wilmar tens of millions of dollars .
After considerable pressure from Indonesian activists , both agencies have launched investigations .
The industry group ’s probe ended last year after Wilmar promised to make improvements .
My last stop in Indonesia is the Center for International Forestry Research , a serene , wooded compound where more than 100 top scientists are working out ways to protect the world ’s forests and their peoples .
Researcher Herry Purnomo is part of an international team that has devised a plan to pay developing countries to leave the trees standing .
Known as the Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Degradation initiative , the program is projected to cost a mere $ 12 billion annually worldwide — not bad considering that the US government has spent $ 126 billion on post - Katrina reconstruction .
But international agencies and Western governments have promised only $ 1 billion so far — ” nowhere near what there needs to be , ” Purnomo says with frustration .
While I was in Pareh , some village men asked if I wanted to see the 11 chain saws they ’d seized the previous fall .
They led me to a hiding place and took out the orange - handled saws one by one , carefully placing them in a straight line on the ground .
A few minutes later they meticulously arranged them in a circle .
I could tell how proud they were :
The chain saws were trophies of their bravery .
I also realized that despite all they ’d been through , the villagers continued to see the saws as bargaining chips , a monumental misperception of the size and scope of their opponent .
Several American media outlets have reported in the last few days about the French government ’s new initiative aimed at resuscitating their print media .
President Sarkozy — lately seen flitting to meet the Dalai Lama in Poland and floating to Gaza to barter a ceasefire , certainly the most hyperactive of Western leaders — has announced a vast increase in state support for print media .
Included in this is a pilot program by which teenagers will be given a free yearlong subscription to the newspaper of their choice on their 18th birthdays .
In our frigid print media climate , with The New York Times flailing and other papers doing far worse , Sarkozy ’s program seems like the kind of warm , fuzzy socialism that might help the industry weather the global recession .
That ’s with the added benefit of forcing social and civic consciousness on unsuspecting youngsters , which you apparently ca n’t get from online media .
Or MyFaceSpace , I guess .
It ’s not a bad idea , though an even better one would be to give young French people free subscriptions to the newspaper of their choice and the newspaper at the other end of the political spectrum , say Le Monde on the left and Le Figaro on the right .
Unlike their major American counterparts , these French papers have given up the faulty illusion of editorial objectivity .
Often , one need only trawl a list of the companies that own or are invested in American newspapers to understand where their interests lie .
No paper is entirely truthful : declaring an ideological position allows the reader to go in understanding the slant of the coverage , which makes searching for inevitable bias easier and encourages the reader to consult more than one news source .
The Internet has the potential to encourage wider reading ; French people turning 18 this year may barely remember a time before they started getting news online .
A program for free subscriptions to multiple newspapers would be impractical , beyond the scope of Sarkozy ’s fuzzy socialism .
But such an initiative would reflect in print the easy access to information online and in other media ; it would be a powerful statement about Sarkozy ’s investment in the civic engagement of France ’s young citizens .
I ’ll pause so you can clear the image from your mind of youths pouring over Le Monde on the Boulevard Saint - Germain before mentioning that the Swiss may have one - upped monsieur le president .
Well , they have n’t yet , but listen : Mary Lou Fulton reported in the Online Journalism Review last week about a collaboration between the Swiss postal service and a German tech company that is developing a personalized newspaper :
You register online and select up to seven newspaper sections by checking a box … .
You can change your selections daily as long as you do so before the nightly 7 pm cutoff [ . ]
The participating newspapers [ including The Washington Post , the leftish Swiss Tages - Anzeiger and others ] deliver their product in PDF format to the Swiss Post , which then sends them to Syntops where the company 's custom software , Syntops GmbH , assembles individualized PDFs .
The PDFs are printed and dropped off to Swiss Post by 7 a.m. for delivery to the home by 11 a.m .
There also is a digital version of Personal News available online .
The eclecticism of the Internet is married to the familiarity of a newspaper and tailored to your interests .
Fulton goes on to point out that , among other benefits , this has the potential to eliminate readers ’ complaints when a newspaper changes a comic , for example .
For their personal newspaper , they can find Garfield elsewhere ( but why ? ) .
This is a really appealing idea — I would prefer not to have to bellyache when , apparently sooner rather than later , The Washington Post eliminates its book review section .
But change is one thing , elimination another : what if Michael Dirda , for my money the best book critic in the country , takes a buy - out from the Post and disappears from print ?
Could a personalized newspaper model employ Google - style reader - specific advertising , and help stop newspaper revenue from hemorrhaging ?
Fulton thinks so , and the possibilities are intriguing .
Would Sarkozy be willing to let French 18 - year - olds pick their own content ?
You can check out the Swiss / German experiment here ; according to a friend in Switzerland it ’s not well known , but it might catch on .
In the spirit of the possibilities of a personalized newspaper , I thought I ’d make my own .
I ’m keeping to the rule of seven sections :
1 ) Top stories from the International Herald Tribune A NYT operation with some of the same stories from that paper , I know , but a far wider variety of international news .
Analogous to CNN International vs. CNN .
2 ) UK news from The Guardian .
I currently live in the UK and this paper has second - to - none reporting and brilliant columnists including Polly Toynbee , Seumas Milne , and George Monbiot .
I like being able to tell my coverage has left - wing tendencies , not so I ’m being told what I want to hear , but so I can check elsewhere if I think the coverage gets too pink .
If I were going to be really honest I ’d also have UK news from Rupert Murdoch ’s The Times .
3 ) Local news from [ insert Baltimore newspaper here ]
Charm City is home , but the Baltimore Sun has been severely debilitated in recent years , and The Examiner has not stepped up yet .
This brings up a good question : could alternative newspapers , like the Baltimore City Paper , be included in a personal newspaper ?
4 ) Local news from the Cumberland Times - News .
My hometown newspaper , for better or worse .
I can see the appeal a personalized newspaper would have for people , like me , who divide their time between multiple places .
5 ) Book World from The Washington Post .
I ’d also take the Post ’s political coverage , but let ’s face it : the Internet was made for political journalism .
6 ) Dining & Wine from The New York Times Still the food capital of the States , and you ca n’t beat The Minimalist .
7 ) Culture Section from The Guardian .
Repetitive , I know , but the paper has the best film critic ( Peter Bradshaw ) and the best theater critic ( Michael Billington ) of any UK daily .
A lot of states ( including my home state of Pennsylvania ) have a regressive income tax .
This is the kind of thing that really needs to change , and hopefully this NY legislation will pass :
We certainly see this short - sighted and proven wrong approach being pushed in New York .
The state is confronting a budget deficit of $ 15 billion , and Governor Paterson has proposed $ 9 billion of harsh cuts in education , healthcare and social services , and $ 5 billion in new taxes that would hit the struggling poor and middle - class the hardest -- making an already regressive tax system even more so .
If you asked most New Yorkers what income level qualifies for the highest tax bracket you would get a range of answers -- from $ 250,000 to $ 1 million to $ 5 million .
In fact , an individual making just $ 20,000 pays the highest income tax rate of 6.85 percent .
So a teacher -- perhaps one of thousands who would be laid off under Paterson 's proposal -- currently pays the same rate as Bernie Madoff , Donald Trump and the hedge funders .
Equally troubling , Paterson 's proposed revenues would be generated through taxes and fees on items such as sodas , transportation , cable tv , college tuition … things that would hit the already struggling poor and working class the hardest .
Fortunately there is a great alternative proposal gaining momentum in the New York legislature and with constituents .
Democratic Senator and Nation contributor Eric Schneiderman has introduced the Fair Share Tax Reform
Act of 2009 which would raise $ 6 billion in new annual revenues by slightly increasing the taxes on the wealthiest 5 percent of New Yorkers .
" Over the last thirty years the combination of policy changes in New York State have resulted in a severely regressive tax system , " Senator Schneiderman told me .
" The richest 1 percent of New Yorkers now pay 6.5 percent of their income in state and local taxes .
While the middle - class , the poor -- everybody else -- pays over 11 percent of their income in state and local taxes .
The poorest New Yorkers -- the bottom quintile -- actually pay 12.6 percent … . "
Schneiderman 's bill would address this inequity by creating three new tax brackets for the wealthy : tax rates for households earning over $ 250,000 would rise to 8.25 percent ; over $ 500,000 would pay 8.97 percent ; and over $ 1 million would be taxed at 10.3 percent .
Schneiderman said that this structure would not only create a fairer system , it would also be more in line with neighboring states .
" The long national nightmare of supply - side economics is coming to an end and we 're trying to hasten its departure in New York by reintroducing the concept of progressive taxation to the actors in government and to the public , " Schneiderman said .
" And it 's getting a great response . "
Melbourne 's all - time weather record has been broken and the city is sweltering under the twin effects of high temperatures and hot north - west winds .
The city hit 46.4 degrees at 3.04 pm - the hottest day since the Bureau of Meteorology started keeping records 150 years ago .
The previous record was 45.6 , set on January 13 , 1939 - a day otherwise known as Black Friday .
" I 've got a massive spreadsheet here of maximum temperatures and it does n't mean anything any more .
The whole thing 's gonna have to be rewritten , " BoM senior forecaster Terry Ryan said .
" Most places around the state will break all - time records . "

CNN 's Campbell Brown says Rush Limbaugh may have a legitimate point , but he 's making it the wrong way .
( CNN ) -- Thursday night on this program , we spent some time talking about Rush Limbaugh and a piece he had in The Wall Street Journal , arguing there should be more emphasis right now on tax cuts to help the economy .
Our chief business correspondent , Ali Velshi , came on and took issue with some of what Limbaugh said .
Limbaugh responded with this Friday :
Rush Limbaugh : " Mr. Velshi , you are incompetent .
You are a disservice to your business .
Except you fit right in at CNN .
Disinformation , character assaults .
This economy is nowhere near as bad as it was in 1982 . "
Let 's stop there .
Mr. Limbaugh , you may well have a legitimate case to make about tax cuts and what they can do for the economy .
But the histrionics and name - calling , they undermine anything constructive you might have to say .
Rush , I would love for you to come on this show and debate Ali on the issues .
Make a case for your ideas .
Our country is in desperate straits right now and we need ideas .

The prolonged drought has added to the misery in rural areas
China has declared an emergency in eight northern and central drought - hit regions , where nearly four million people are suffering water shortages .
Nearly half of China 's winter crop - some 10 m hectares ( 24 m acres ) of wheat and rape seed - are also under threat .
President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao ordered all - out efforts to fight the drought , allocating 400 m yuan ( $ 58 m , £ 40 m ) in relief assistance .
China 's drought relief office called it an event " rarely seen in history " .
China faces droughts and floods annually but has seen a recent increase in extreme weather conditions .
The Chinese authorities say the current drought is expected to continue as no rain has been forecast in the affected areas for at least 10 days .
' Red alert '
The Chinese leaders ' decision was announced at a State Council meeting , according to the Xinhua news agency .
Government efforts should be directed at stabilising grain production , increasing farmers ' income and ensuring agricultural production , the Council said .
The agriculture ministry says it is on red alert .
Eight wheat - growing regions - Hebei , Shanxi , Anhui , Jiangsu , Henan , Shandong , Shaanxi and Gansu - are under threat , Xinhua reported .
The official China Daily newspaper , citing meteorological authorities , said Henan had recorded its worst drought since 1951 , going 105 consecutive days without rain .
Much of China 's farming still relies on rainfall as many of its farming communities have a poor irrigation system .
The BBC's China analyst Shirong Chen says the prolonged drought has added to the misery in rural areas where millions of migrant workers have lost their jobs as a result of the global economic downturn .
A poor harvest in the summer would mean even less income for the farmers .
The government is worried that this will dent its effort to stimulate consumer spending in rural areas , making it harder to maintain social stability , he says .
The US Federal Reserve and Wall Street 's powerful investment banks are preparing to spend billions of dollars to support the US stock market , which opens this week for the first time since last Tuesday 's terrorist attacks on New York and Washington .
A secretive committee - the Working Group on Financial Markets , dubbed ' the plunge protection team ' - includes bankers as well as representatives of the New York Stock Exchange , Nasdaq and the US Treasury .
It is ready to co-ordinate intervention by the Federal Reserve on an unprecedented scale .
The Fed , supported by the banks , will buy equities from mutual funds and other institutional sellers if there is evidence of panic selling in the wake of last week 's carnage .
The authorities are determined to avert a worldwide slump in share prices like the crashes of 1987 or 1929 .
Investment banks and their broking subsidiaries are to block short - selling by speculators and hedge funds by making it hard for them to obtain prices on favourable terms .
' Everyone is eager to avoid " contagion " , where prices fall rapidly as investors react lemming - like to a falling index , ' said one banker .
In addition , US regulators are prepared to ease rules that prevent companies from buying their own stock .
The ' plunge protection team ' was established by a special executive order issued by former President Ronald Reagan in 1989 .
It is known to include senior bankers at leading Wall Street institutions such as Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs .
It has acted before , in the early Nineties and during the 1998 LTCM hedge fund crisis .
Whether coordinated action by the US authorities and banking institutions will be sufficient to avert a large - scale sell - off on Wall Street this week remains to be seen .
Tony Jackson , director of UK equity strategy at investment bank ING Barings , believes there may be an emotional tide of support for Wall Street this week , but that it will be shortlived .
He said : ' Some people are talking about a " patriotic rally " that could lift the Dow by 1,000 points on reopening .
I do n't think it will be that high , but it will certainly go up , perhaps several hundred points .
' But long term , the trend will still be down , perhaps 10 per cent from where it opens .
Many companies will cut earnings forecasts now . '
Khuram Chaudhry , equity strategist at Merrill Lynch , believes that Wall Street could fall by as much as 10 per cent .
' You have to remember that things did not look that good before the attack on the World Trade Centre .
There were already signs that American consumer confidence was deteriorating .
I do n't think people are now going to rush out to take foreign holidays or crowd the shopping malls . '
John Llewellyn , economist at Lehman Brothers , is worried that markets may prove disorderly , despite the best efforts of the authorities .
' There is a degree of synchronisation between the three major economies .
The US and Europe are weaken ing in tandem , while Japan is in the doldrums .
In the early Nineties Japan was in better shape .
The global economy may end up in a worse condition than 10 years ago . '
But there are optimists too .
Sonja Gibbs , chief equity strategist at Nomura International , believes ' the economic fundamentals will take a turn for the better in 2002 ' .
Robin Aspinall , equity analyst at broker Teather and Greenwood said : ' The Americans will want to show that the stars and stripes still fly over Wall Street . '
Was it only a season ago that fashion was in a flap about the all - black edition of Vogue Italia ?
That was the issue in which the photographer Steven Meisel attempted to redress the negative effects that a virtual shutout of black models over the past decade has had on how beauty is perceived in the industry .
Without any particular difficulty , Mr. Meisel was able to cast an entire issue of the magazine exclusively with black models , stars of former years and contemporary beauties as well .
The normally reticent Mr. Meisel has even been speaking out lately about what he judges to be racism in fashion , notably in a long interview in the Berlin - based culture journal 032c .
A better headline for the cover of Urban might have been “ Whiteout , ” to judge by the paucity of black faces on runways after three days of presentations and shows .
While Giorgio Armani notably cast some black models for his Emporio Armani show , as did Donatella Versace for hers , there was not a single black ( or Asian or Latino ) face to be seen on the runways at Jil Sander , Missoni , Burberry , Trussardi , Bottega Veneta , Gianfranco Ferre , Roberto Cavalli or Prada .
“ Maybe they think it ’s too obvious ” to feature an ethnically inclusive runway casting in the week of Barack Obama ’s inauguration , Franca Sozzani , the Vogue Italia editor , said of designers .
“ It has nothing to do with a racist attitude , ” the editor insisted moments before the start of a Gucci show in which , as it happened , all of the models were white .
Frida Giannini , the Gucci designer , said after the show , “ I think it would be great if there was an industry initiative on this issue , because I am always looking for black models , or even Chinese or whatever , for the shows . ”
Big companies have a process for buying things .
They define the specs , they shop the vendors , they use specialized purchasing departments to define procedures and processes .
They have similar processes for recruiting human capital ( aka human beings ) .
Define the specs , shop the vendors , use special processes .
And ditto for selling .
Define targets , channels , measure hit rates , etc .
What these processes all have in common is a focus on the efficiency of the process — and not so much on the effectiveness of the result .
Purchasing managers , HR recruiters and sales managers alike would benefit from Malcolm Gladwell ’s recent New Yorker piece title Most Likely to Succeed : How Do We Hire When We Ca n’t Tell Who ’s Right for the Job ?
Gladwell ’s opening metaphor is about predicting the success of a college football quarterback in the pro game .
Despite extraordinary efforts at analytical and statistical rigor — you just never quite seem to know .
His target subject is teaching — how difficult it is to predict the success of a teacher by focusing on any available statistical predictor .
Yet the value of getting it right is huge .
Gladwell points to research that says a good teacher dwarfs the effect of any other factor on a child ’s education .
The US could overcome its middle - of - the - road global relative performance simply by substituting the bottom 6 % of teachers for average teachers .
The problem is , you ca n’t predict success in teachers , anymore than you can in quarterbacks .
The solution , he says , is to stop focusing on accreditation and criteria .
Instead , have the equivalent of apprenticeships , open admissions , tryouts open to all .
The good ones prove themselves quickly , as do the bad ones .
Find out who they are not by controlling input metrics , but by letting people jump into the water and seeing who can swim .
I suggest that the same problem exists in evaluating suppliers , recruits , and sales funnels .
These are all deeply complex , human , messy relationship issues .
Good customer , employee and supplier relationships make a huge difference .
But the prevailing business wisdom is that we can analyze and measure our way into defining the right relationships .
Think of RFPs ( requests for proposal ) or recruiting specs .
The motivation behind select - by - spec and hire - by - numbers is complex .
It ’s part blind faith in “ science . ”
It ’s part fear - driven cover - your - butt desire to appear blameless .
It ’s part fear of interaction with other people .
But whatever , it ’s hurting us .
In the name of efficiency , many business processes have been employed to bring human relationships to a least common denominator level .
The result has been low effectiveness .
Let people mix it up .
Inefficiencies can be dwarfed by effectiveness .
It ’s as true in work as it is in the NFL and the classroom .
equality before the law

sui generis
" We , Anglo - Saxons , have our peculiar contribution to make towards the good of humanity in accordance with our special talents .
The League of Nations will , I confidently hope , be dominated by us Anglo - Saxons ; it will be for the unquestionable benefit of the world .
The discharge of our duties in the maintenance of peace and as a just mediatory in international disputes will redound to our lasting prestige .
But it is of paramount importance that we Anglo - Saxons succeed in keeping in step with one another . "
( Quoted in Naoko Shimazu , Japan , Race , and Equality : The Racial Equality Proposal of 1919 , Routledge , 1998 , p155 . )
One of the points that Critical Race Theory makes , regarding the ' colour - blindness ' of the law , is that it has functioned to conserve existing hierarchies .
By expressing them as , such ' colour - blindness ' gives the impression that the pronounced racial inequalities that structure labour markets , educational access , legal entitlements , state behaviour , etc. , are .
Attempts to ameliorate those inequalities constituted ' reverse discrimination ' .
The most intensely debated example is that of ' affirmative action ' .
The conservative backlash in the 1970s against Great Society programmes included attempts to legally neuter a supposedly cumbersome bureaucracy .
For example in 1978 , following a suit by Alan Bakke who had been denied a place at the University of California , the Supreme Court ruled against universities using quotas to recruit minority candidates to their student body .
Subsequent local rulings reinforced that verdict .
The argument was that quotas protected minorities from the rigours of competition , thus promoting undeserving candidates while stigmatising those minorities as in some sense needing protection .
This re-coded inequality in the language of free markets , notwithstanding the fact that the existing testing systems are coachable and reward those of higher socioeconomic status .
By a simple ideological sleight - of - hand , fields of production that had been nakedly structured by race were de-raced .
In an analogous fashion , international relations has been the subject of an energetic white - washing .
As a discipline , and as a discourse that frames policymakers ' decisions , the problems central to IR have been always been Eurocentric .
After all , the obsession with strategies for maintaining an equilibrium between sovereign states , coupled with a tautological reading of the character of such states as ' power - maximisers ' , has its origins in the writings of David Hume , whose original contribution was to universalise the interests and behaviours of emerging European states .
Maintaining that states wereinstitutions , essentially the same from the Greek city - state to the modern nation - state , and that sovereign states had ontological primacy in world affairs , his narrative rendered invisible that majority of humanity which he , in other writings , racially denigrated .
Imperialism was similarly not among the predicaments of IR when the discipline was launched in 1919 , that year of Wilsonian ' national self - determination ' ( after which colonialism continued to expand , reaching its apogee by 1947 ) .
This was not because the institution of race was disavowed .
Quite the contrary : global jurisprudence in 1919 was explicitly imperial , colonial and racially - laden .
The dichotomy in positivist jurisprudence between civilized and non-civilized states asserted that law did not apply outside the small family of existing sovereign states .
The emerging institutions of liberal order were also underwritten by explicit codes of racial solidarity .
Woodrow Wilson 's remarks on the launching of the League of Nations at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference are worth excerpting : This was crucial to Wilson 's rationale for rejecting the proposed ' racial equality ' clause .
Parenthetically , it is only fair to state that any interest Wilson ever had in the idea was circumscribed by his own devoutly held belief in racial inequality , expressed in his support for Jim Crow in Washington , his paternalistic arguments for empire in the Philippines , and his writings on governance and statehood .
So , if race and empire were not officially recognised as problems in international relations , it was more because they were taken for granted than because it was necessary to cleanse the territory of such incriminating associations .
Post - war Realism in IR was different .
Not by accident or design , but as a consequence of its function , Realism coded imperial pursuits in the language of power - balancing , maintaining an equilibrium between the US and the USSR .
Just as anticommunism was the official ideology behind America 's attempts to variously manage , curtail , and coopt decolonizing movements , so the sacred Balance of Power was its strategic rationale .
If the US sought to repress national liberation movements through the proliferation of right - wing dictatorships , this apparent conflict with the objectives of liberal internationalism could be rationalized as a necessary balance to Soviet assertiveness in supporting Kim Il - Sung , Castro , the Viet Minh , etc .
To the extent that decolonization was important at all to Realism , it was only in the sense that European sovereignty was apparently being extended to what is still called the Third World .
And once formerly non-sovereign peoples were assimilated to the order / anarchy of sovereign states , their susceptibility to external intervention , exploitation and so on was just one more vista onto the Hobbesian tragedy of world affairs .
The dominant ideas concerning order , the sovereign , the international , and so on , were thus gradually expunged of their racial content .
The fact that decolonization did not ultimately end relations of dependence or the imposing inequalities of power and resources that were generated by the colonial system could be delicately effaced in the language of development and modernization theory .
The fact that a caste of formerly colonial powers still determine under what conditions the sovereignty of a state outside that caste is abridgable , has equally been interpreted as the right of ' democracies ' over their ' totalitarian ' opposites .
The norm has thus been established that it is bad form to notice how world affairs continue to be conspicuously structured by race .
The failure to notice , though , is so laboured , and so arduous , as to demand attention and explanation .
There is a whole genre of literature waiting to be written here .

European leaders in Berlin have agreed on the need to regulate all financial markets including hedge funds .
Leaders of Europe 's major economies said a global solution was needed to the current financial crisis .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel highlighted that leaders faced an " extraordinary international crisis " .
But leaders including UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned against reverting to protectionism in such a difficult economic climate .
The Berlin gathering is a precursor to the next meeting of the G20 group of major developed and developing countries in London on 2 April , which aims to rewrite the rules of the global financial system .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said participants at the London summit would bear a " historical responsibility " to reform the global system .
" We have to succeed and we cannot accept that anything or anyone gets in the way of that summit .
If we fail there will be no safety net , " he said .
' Supervision '
However , despite the encouraging words from key leaders , Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek , whose country currently holds the EU 's rotating presidency , voiced concern at what he saw as divisions between Europe 's major economies .
" If I put it very tenderly , the divergence in opinions was rather big , " the AFP news agency reported him saying as he headed back to Prague .
Capitalism must be given new moral foundations
Nicolas Sarkozy
French President
Protectionist forces bedevil EU
" It was obvious that the four countries representing the EU in the G20 [ France , Germany , Britain , Italy ] do not have the same opinion on a number of issues . "
Mr Brown said there was a need to create an economy that is based on the " soundest principles " , saying the world needed a " global new deal " .
Leaders said there was a need for international institutions , including the International Monetary Fund , to play a greater role not just to help countries in financial trouble but to prevent countries from getting into such difficulties .
Mr Brown said leaders had agreed that the IMF needed access to at least $ 500 bn ( £ 348bn ) .
The comments in Berlin come amid ongoing volatility in world financial markets and uncertainty over the future of some of the world 's key banks .
Ms Merkel said : " We are making a commitment that all financial markets , products , and participants - including hedge funds and rating agencies - are of course subject to supervision and regulation .
"
Details on such a plan need to be worked out before the meeting in London , she added .
Hedge funds , which typically attract wealthy private investors , have been criticised for their lack of transparency and oversight .
Bonuses
As well as greater supervision of all financial markets and instruments , leaders underlined the need to reassess the issue of pay at finance firms .
Mr Sarkozy added said people could " no longer tolerate the reward package system for traders and bankers " .
There has been much criticism of bankers ' bonuses , which have been high despite their bank 's poor performance .
Leaders also said they wanted to crack down on tax havens .
Ms Merkel said : " As far as uncooperative players , tax havens or areas where non-transparent business is carried out are concerned , we need to develop sanction mechanisms .
These must be made very concrete , " she said She added that a list would be drawn up " clearly showing which the unco-operative jurisdictions are . "
Different opinions French , Italian , Spanish , Dutch , UK and German leaders are hoping to take a common approach at the London summit .
But analysts say reaching agreement among EU powers will not be easy .
Both Mr Topolanek and the European Commission have voiced concern at attempts by France , Italy and Spain to shelter their car industries from the effects of the downturn .
Mr Sarkozy has suggested that in order to secure government aid , French carmakers should move production out of their East European factories and back to France .
Such disagreements are threatening to prevent Europe speaking with one voice , says the BBC's Rob Cameron in Berlin .

MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Thousands of Indians , many fuming over a recent assault on women in a pub , are vowing to fill bars on Valentine ’s Day and send cartons of pink panties to a radical Hindu group that has branded outgoing females immoral .
The logo for the Pink Chaddi Campaign , released on the website Thepinkchaddicampaign.blogspot.com .
REUTERS/thepinkchaddicampaign.blogspot.com
A “ consortium of pub - going , loose and forward women , ” founded by four Indian women on social networking website Facebook has , in a matter of days , attracted more than 25,000 members with over 2,000 posts about the self - appointed moral police .
The women said their mission was to go bar - hopping on February 14 and send hundreds of pink knickers to Sri Ram Sena , the militant Hindu group that has said pubs are for men , and that women should stay at home and cook for their husbands .
The same Hindu group was blamed for attacking women in a bar in the southern city of Mangalore in January , an incident that sparked a national debate about women ’s freedoms in India .
Collection centers have sprung up in several cities , with volunteers calling for bright pink old - fashioned knickers as gifts to the Sri Ram Sena as a mark of defiance .
“ Girl power !
Go girls , go .
Show Ram Sena ... who ’s the boss , ” reads one post on Facebook from Larkins Dsouza .
There is a separate campaign to “ Walk to the nearest pub and buy a drink ( and ) raise a toast , ” that has found supporters from Toronto to Bangkok to Sydney , with even teetotalers saying they will get a drink on Saturday to show solidarity .
“ Though I do n’t promote smoking or drinking for both sexes , we definitely do n’t need hooligans telling us what to do and what not .
Best of luck ! , ” reads one post from Iftehar Ahsan .
There are more heated discussion threads as well that range from the limits of independence to religion and politics , reflecting the struggle facing a country that has long battled to balance its deep - rooted traditions with rapid modernization .
Growing numbers of young and independent urban women have become an easy target for religious fundamentalists and aging politicians trying to force traditional mores on an increasingly liberal , Western outlook .
Not to be outdone , the Sri Ram Sena , which has cautioned shops and pubs in southern Karnataka state against marking Valentine ’s Day , has promised to gift pink saris to women and marry off canoodling couples to make them “ respectable . ”
As much as we love the Mozzer ’s best solo moments , especially his happier songs , nothing compares to the work he did with The Smiths — the immortal mope - rock band whose songs epitomized lyrical literacy and musical jangle .
They were such an astounding band that they turned even Noel Gallagher into a fanboy .
The Manchester band only released four albums together before imploding , but their work together remains some of the most timeless and cultish .
Here then are the 10 best songs by The Smiths .
One of three Queen Is Dead songs on this list , “ Bigmouth ” features a nice anachronistic lyric about Joan of Arc and a Walkman .
The song rocks fairly hard by Smiths standards ; a colleague recently told me that “ Morrissey actually growls on the live version off Rank then played me the clip .
( Sure enough , he does . )
This song is a highlight among highlights on Louder Than Bombs , in which our narrator spends “ warm summer days indoors / writing frightening verse to a buck - toothed girl in Luxembourg .
This underrated Meat Is Murder track makes our list for three reasons — Johnny Marr ’s jangly guitar , Morrissey ’s schoolboy angst and the hopelessly romantic lyric , “ I might walk home alone / but my faith in love is still devout ”
This vicious two - minute pop song that leaves you reeling .
Thanks to Marr ’s epic riff , this may be the most widely known Smiths song amongst the general public .
For a band that specialized in intimacy , “ How Soon ” works surprisingly well as an ’80s anthem .
I ’ve always wanted a radio show with this as my theme song .
Bonus points if you can watch the video without vomiting .
The single - best showcase for Marr ’s guitar ?
That heartbreaking melody !
Those pleading lyrics !
The song ’s mix of confidence and insecurity would seem utterly peculiar if The Smiths did n’t make it such a franchise .
A song that defines The Smiths ’ whole ethos , musically and lyrically .
The greatest , most quotable morbid love song in human history .
All together now : “ And if a 10 - ton truck kills the both of us / To die by your side , well , the pleasure , the privilege is mine . ”
Robert Mugabe marked his 85th birthday yesterday with a sumptuous banquet in Harare at the start of a week of parties which observers say is a further sign of the Zimbabwean president 's defiance in the face of growing criticism of his regime .
His latest show of excess came as prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai said " maybe US$ 5 bn ( £ 3.5 bn ) " would be needed to rehabilitate the collapsed health , social and education systems .
Surreal celebrations got under way on Friday as schoolboy pipers , accompanied by drum majorettes , marched through the decrepit capital and members of a ruling party youth organisation sold $ 10 raffle tickets .
Teetotal Mugabe 's private party yesterday was hosted by his wife , Grace , 44 , and attended by friends and a number of African diplomats .
But state television did not , as is customary , broadcast his speech .
A $ 100 - a- ticket gala dinner at Harare 's Rainbow Towers Hotel on Wednesday is advertised as a musical extravaganza including Nigerian hip - hop star 2 Face , Congolese rhumba band Werrason and a host of local acts .
The parties will culminate on Saturday with a public feast and concert at Chinhoyi , about 50 miles west of Harare , which is to be televised .
Dozens of animals will be slaughtered for the event and guests include hundreds of children also born on 21 February .
Zimbabwe University political science professor John Makumbe said the birthday display was the latest of many signals that the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front ( Zanu - PF ) does not intend to respect the power - sharing agreement that saw Tsvangirai sworn in on 11 February .
" The money for the parties and the cattle and chickens donated are extracted from people virtually against their will , " he said .
" Thousands have died from cholera and many students are not attending school or university because teachers are not paid .
It 's unbelievable that he can blow quadrillions of Zimbabwe dollars on parties . "
The celebrations have been organised since 1986 by a Zanu - PF youth group called the 21 February Movement .
Initially modelled on scouting and aimed at promoting children 's rights , it has increasingly become a young sycophants ' association .
Zanu - PF youth leader Absolom Sikhosana defended the Chinhoyi event : " It is not a feast per se , but an event where youths have a chance to meet their hero .
This inspires them to emulate his exemplary qualities of nation - building , patriotism and principled leadership . "
In a sign of the times , the 21 February Movement set out to raise only $ 500,000 ( £ 350,000 ) for Mugabe 's birthday week against a reported $ 1.2 m last year .
Last week Sikhosana made a heartfelt plea on national radio for benefactors to make good on their promises : " We know things are tough , but it would be nice to honour the pledges you made . "
According to some reports , pledges for only £ 70,000 have come in , much in the form of food donations .
State media has reported that each district in Zimbabwe is expected to donate 50 cattle and to raise US $ 1,500 ( £ 1,000 ) .
Mugabe had already run roughshod over the power - sharing agreement by appointing 61 ministers instead of the agreed 31 , Makumbe said .
" Each will need their Mercedes , their 4x4 , their driver , bodyguard and housing .
At the same time , Tsvangirai is trying to raise money for basic reconstruction . "
Amid scepticism from the international community , Tsvangirai and South African President Kgalema Motlanthe did their best to indicate progress on Friday .
At a joint press conference in Cape Town , Motlanthe even claimed that the cholera crisis , which the UN says has killed 3,800 people and is worsening , had been " contained " .
Tsvangirai played down the plight of his deputy agriculture minister , Roy Bennett , and 30 other activists who are in jail for alleged plotting against the regime .
He said : " We are working slowly to deal with that matter and to make sure it does not become the focus of the attention .
The real attention has to be on the plight of Zimbabweans . "
The two men announced that Southern African finance ministers are this week expected to announce a $ 1.5 bn loan to Zimbabwe , to be underwritten by the African Development Bank .
The institution is part - funded by Europe and the US , but decision - making rests with African governments .
International donors remain concerned that aid will be diverted to the ruling party , just as £ 20 m from South Africa last December mostly ended up in the hands of party supporters .
Obama , not Bush , now seeking delay of Rove deposition John Byrne
Published : Tuesday February 17 , 2009
Print This Email This Former Bush Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove has a new president urging Congress not to force him to testify next week .
President Barack Obama .
In a court brief quietly filed Monday , Michael Hertz , Obama 's acting assistant attorney general , said it was necessary to delay an effort to force Rove to be deposed in a congressional investigation into the firing of nine US Attorneys and the alleged political prosecution of a former Alabama governor .
Hertz said an effort was underway to find a " compromise " for Rove , and requested two weeks to broker a deal before proceeding in court .
" The inauguration of a new president has altered the dynamics of this case and created new opportunities for compromise rather than litigation , " Hertz wrote in the brief released late Monday by McClatchy 's Washington , D.C. bureau .
" At the same time , there is now an additional interested party  the former president  whose views should be considered . "
The House Judiciary Committee sued the Bush Administration to force Rove to testify last year , saying that Rove should n't be covered by executive privilege .
They won .
But their case has been held up by an appeal , and Hertz 's filing was the Obama administration 's first legal weighing - in on the matter .
Obama 's Justice Department has supplanted the role of Bush 's Justice Department in the case , and their position will likely inform the terms under which Rove is questioned by Congress .
Hertz 's statement mirrors a statement from Obama White House Counsel Gregory Craig published Saturday .
" The president is very sympathetic to those who want to find out what happened , " Craig told The Washington Post .
" But he is also mindful as president of the United States not to do anything that would undermine or weaken the institution of the presidency .
So , for that reason , he is urging both sides of this to settle . "
Both Hertz 's and Craig 's statement point to an underlying challenge Obama faces with regard to Rove .
Since former President Bush still claims that Rove is protected from testifying to Congress by executive privilege , even after departing office , Obama must decide whether he wants to risk diluting his own executive privilege in the future .
These statements , however , stand in contrast to Obama 's previous rhetoric .
In 2007 , while in the Senate , Obama rebuked Bush 's White House as " the most secretive in modern history , " which aimed " to hide its abuse of our justice system . "
Responding to a Bush claim of executive privilege , he said , " By continuing to act as the most secretive White House in modern history , the Bush Administration has once again placed itself above the law in order to hide its abuse of our justice system from the American people .
On the first day of an Obama Administration , we will launch the most sweeping ethics reform in history to shed sunlight on the decisions made by government and put the interests of the American people at the center of every decision that 's made . "
House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) , who subpoenaed Rove as recently as last week and demanded that he come before Congress Feb. 23 , refused a request from Rove 's attorney seeking a delay .
Rove did n't show up on two previous occasions he was subpoenaed , once in 2008 and again in January .
He did n't honor a 2007 Senate Judiciary Committee subpoena either .
The White House indicated in their latest filing that negotiations are ongoing between representatives of the Bush White House and the Obama team .
Rove 's lawyer , Robert Luskin , told Raw Story last week that no agreement had been reached .
A special prosecutor continues to probe what role White House officials may have had in the firings of the US Attorneys -- which Democrats say were politically motivated .
Rove also has been called to testify about his knowledge of an alleged political prosecution in Alabama , where a Democratic governor was jailed on corruption charges that may have been politically motivated .
A whistleblower fingered Rove as pushing for the prosecution behind the scenes , which Rove vehemently and categorically denies .

Last year , Number None 's Braid for Xbox Live Arcade became both a critical hit and a commercial success , proving that creator Jonathan Blow 's views on experimenting with gameplay concepts can have real relevance with the wider gaming public in a concrete way .
Does this open the door for more experimentation ?
Where is the medium headed ?
Blow , who was previously a code columnist for Game Developer magazine and a contract programmer / designer for a number of notable games , from Flow through Phase , talks in - depth to Gamasutra in this post - Braid interview .
Among other things ,
Blow discusses his thoughts on PC as a gaming platform , the importance of PR to indies , and the new game ideas he 's working on , as well as the role of story in today 's biggest games :
What have you been up to since Braid shipped ?
Jonathan Blow : A little bit working on an updated version for Xbox Live Arcade , because there were a couple of bugs in it .
There were some more minor things , just little , tiny gameplay glitches .
I 've been doing that .
I have been talking to people about Braid on other platforms , like the Mac and PC .
What 's going on is that I took some time to do that originally , and then we hit this season where there were just a zillion PC games out .
And I did n't want to release it in the middle of that , because probably nobody would notice .
You indicated at one point you were talking to Valve about Steam .
JB : A long time ago , I was talking to them , and it did n't really work out .
Since then , they 've come back and contacted me , and they are interested in putting the game up .
So it 's just a matter of me having a PC version ready that I feel is good to go with .
Would you be looking to distribute across multiple digital distribution platforms ?
JB : Yeah .
I do n't think that locking down an exclusive agreement with one online distributor is a good idea .
And a lot of people are willing to do non-exclusive publishing , so I 'm just going to do that .
There are different schools of thought on that .
Some people who would like to see it become almost more console - like , where it 's just , " I want to be able to go into Steam and everything 's there . "
Conversely , there 's the principle that the PC should stay totally unlike consoles , a completely free market .
JB : I think both those things are true .
I definitely like Steam , in that I can buy a new computer and bring it home and turn it on and install Steam and I have all my new games on there .
And pretty soon , they 're doing the settings and stuff now [ via Steam Cloud , which allows users to store save game and configurations server - side ] .
That 's pretty cool .
At the same time , I definitely want to be able to play games that are n't on Steam , right ?
I definitely want access to services that are not Steam and that are competing with them , because maybe they 'll do something better .
Maybe they 'll do something in a different way .
So I 'm in favor of both .
And I realize that that introduces some amount of chaos into the thing .
That 's okay , though , because the PC is the place where that can happen .
If you want a very clean system where there are no alternatives , then that 's consoles .
That already exists .
So , if we were to take that away from PCs , then what happens ?
What if somebody wants to do something new , and they just can't , because there 's no longer a platform ?
So , I like the way it is now .
What I do n't like about PCs is how hard it is to make a shipping - quality game on them , in terms of it not crashing on people 's machines , or sounding and looking consistent , or whatever .
It 's nearly impossible .
Well , actually , it is impossible .
What is possible is to do a job that does n't screw up on that many people 's machines .
I think that there 's no inherent reason for that anymore , so that needs to get fixed .
But I do n't see anyone working on it seriously .
Microsoft is trying to take stabs at it with Games for Windows .
JB : They 're not doing a very good job .
And I do n't think many people would dispute with me on that fact .
[ laughs ]
As an independent developer , there 's another thing about the PC , which is there are a very large number of games -- independent games , even -- getting released on the PC .
I 'm not the typical gamer , but a typical gamer only has a limited amount of attention .
What should they be paying attention to ?
It 's an open question .
And for me , as somebody who did n't have a big advertising budget , how do you communicate to people that this is a game that you actually want to be interested in ?
Having it be released on a console , you do n't have that problem , because , for example , on Xbox Live , there are only a limited number of games in the pipeline .
If a game comes out on a given week , it 's notable at least because it 's the game of the week that week , right ?
From there , if it 's well - received on the console , I can still come to the PC and say , " Well , look , this game , a lot of people liked it . "
Whereas you could release a really good game on PC , and maybe just it never gets word of mouth , even though it 's good .
I was very concerned with that .
President Obama Lifts Ban on Funding Overseas Abortions
Today President Obama lifted the ban on sending federal funding overseas to clinics that perform abortions .
In this tough economic time President Obama thought it would be wise to spend more of our tax dollars so that women in foreign countries can kill their babies .
I tend to think that that money could be put to better use right here in the United States , and I also think that it is disgusting that my money is being used to perform such a despicable procedure .
If a woman wants to get an abortion that is her decision , but I sure as hell do n’t feel as though I have to pay for it and if that woman is not even a citizen of this country it is doubly offensive to me .
The cowardly lion president was supposed to sign the bill yesterday but he did n’t have the balls to do it because there was a pro-life rally in Washington DC .
Obama avoided signing the executive order on Thursday , when thousands of pro-life activists came to Washington to mark the 36th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court ’s Roe v.
Wade decision that legalized abortion on demand
This executive order coupled with the executive order to close down GITMO tells us that President Obama cares more about the rights of terrorists who are enemies of the country than the rights of the most helpless among us , the babies .
The Israeli military estimates that between 60 to 70 per cent of tunnels were destroyed during its bombing campaign , the evidence of which is everywhere one looks along the border .
The EU said women like this spy drama character could pose a security risk
The European Commission says it is being targeted increasingly by spies , who may include a " pretty trainee with long legs and blonde hair " .
The warning came in a security note circulated to human resources staff at the commission - the EU 's executive arm , which drafts legislation .
Commission spokeswoman Valerie Rampi said the note gave advice on the recruitment of non-EU nationals .
It said the espionage threat to the commission was " increasing day by day " .
Ms Rampi said the information seekers included lobbyists , journalists , private agencies and IT experts .
" It could be the pretty trainee with long legs and blonde hair , " she warned .
Hostile intelligence services are making repeated attempts to compromise commission information
Valerie Rampi
European Commission spokeswoman
Her comments were prompted by a German newspaper report on Wednesday about the commission 's security note .
Ms Rampi told the BBC News website that the commission was not singling out journalists as a threat .
" There is not a general institutional suspicion towards journalists , " she explained .
She declined to give any details of specific threats identified by the commission , but said " hostile intelligence services are making repeated attempts to compromise commission information " .
The commission 's internal security agents were working closely with the national security authorities of the 27 member states to thwart spies , she added .
“ We are poised to be specific on what we regulate and on what schedule , ” Ms. Jackson said .
“ We do n’t want people to spin that into a doomsday scenario . ”
Even some who favor an aggressive approach to climate change said they were wary of the agency ’s asserting exclusive authority over carbon emissions .
They say that the Clean Air Act , now more than 40 years old , was not designed to regulate ubiquitous substances like carbon dioxide .
Using the law , they say , would capture carbon emissions from new facilities , but not existing ones , blunting its impact .
They also believe that a broader approach that addresses all sectors of the economy and that is fully debated in Congress would be better than a regulatory approach that could drag through the courts for years .
The finding and proposed regulations would be issued in sequence , with ample opportunity for public comment and not in a sudden burst of regulatory muscle - flexing , Ms. Jackson said .
The regulations would work in concert with any legislation and not supplant it , she added .
“ What we are likely to see is an interplay of authorities , some new , some existing , ” she said .
That is not likely to assuage critics , including many Democrats from states dependent on coal - generated electricity and manufacturing jobs , where such regulation could significantly increase costs .
Representative John D. Dingell , the Michigan Democrat who has long championed the interests of the auto industry , said that the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions by the E.P.A. would set off a “ glorious mess ” that would resonate throughout the economy .
Senator John Barrasso , Republican of Wyoming , warned Ms. Jackson during her January confirmation hearing that she should not undercut Congress ’s authority by using the agency ’s regulatory power to address global warming .
Mr. Barrasso called the use of the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon “ a disaster waiting to happen . ”
Many environmental advocates , however , said the E.P.A. ’s action was long overdue , but added that it was only as a stopgap until Congress passed comprehensive climate change legislation .
“ It ’s politically necessary , scientifically necessary and legally necessary , ” said David Bookbinder , chief climate counsel at the Sierra Club , a plaintiff in the Supreme Court case .
Finding simpler ways to deliver insulin into the blood stream is one important avenue for tackling the diabetes epidemic that is sweeping the developed world .
The preferred option for many patients would be an insulin pill taken orally .
But studies have long shown that insulin is easily broken down by the digestive system and that any surviving hormone is not easily absorbed into the bloodstream from the gut .
An insulin inhaler made it as far as the US market in 2006 , but was withdrawn a year later because it was n’t cost effective .
But Robert Doyle , a chemist at Syracuse University in New York state , has a potential solution .
He points out that the body has specific mechanisms for protecting and absorbing valuable molecules that would usually be damaged by conditions in the gut .

For example , vitamin B12 is protected by a salivary protein called haptocorrin that binds to it in the mouth and protects it in the stomach .
Once haptocorrin reaches the intestines , another chemical pathway takes over to help vitamin B12 pass into the bloodstream .
Doyle suggests binding insulin molecules to vitamin B12 so that it can hitch a ride on this protected supply chain .
The insulin could ride all the way into the bloodstream , where it is released to do its work .
Doyle and colleagues say early tests on rats appear to work well .
The rodents got their new treatment in liquid form , but chewing gum would be a better delivery method in humans , the team says .
Chewing would ensure a plentiful supply of saliva , providing the protein needed for the insulin to make its way into the bloodstream .

Robert Reich was Secretary of Labor under Bill Clinton and is currently a professor at the University of California , Berkeley ’s Goldman School of Public Policy
Professor Reich :
I have some questions about some of the points that you brought up when you appeared on CNN's The State of the Union show Superbowl Sunday .
Although all my own training in economics is purely autodidactic , it seems to me that your arguments rest on faulty premises .
When asked what is the fastest way for the government to create jobs ( a question which itself relies on the erroneous presumption that the government has the ability to " create " jobs ) , you replied with a three - part answer , and first stated that " almost all economists agree " with you .
Whether almost all economists agree or not of no importance , but gives your answer an air of authority .
Unfortunately , it is the policies of these same economists which have caused the mess in which America currently finds itself .
While " almost all economists " may still possess authority in academia , their credibility on Main Street is sorely lacking .
In addition , many economists do not agree with you .
In fact , Austrian economists vehemently disagree with you .
In any case , you said that the government 's first priority should be to expand the social safety net , which will cause money to go directly into circulation .
Historically , government welfare programs have been wasteful , inefficient , and corrupt .
Private charities do a much better job of administering aid to those in need with the final goal of helping the unemployed get back to work .
Government programs , on the other hand , lead to longer periods of unemployment by encouraging welfare recipients to remain on the dole as long as possible .
I am also curious as to how you propose to fund these programs .
There are only three ways that the government can raise revenue : taxation , borrowing , and printing ( both the latter are actually forms of deferred taxation ) .
All of these methods have dire implications for the economy .
Direct taxation retards economic growth by punishing producers .
Borrowing crowds out investment in the private sector .
Printing money causes distortions in the market , misallocation of resources , and eventually destroys the purchasing power of the monetary unit .
In addition , of what importance is " money in circulation " ?
You contend that passing money around will create jobs , but the fact is that passing money around is simply passing money around .
What you seem to be proposing is that the government take money from some people , and then give it to people on welfare so that they can buy stuff from the same people that the government originally took the money from in the first place .
How is that going to create jobs ?
Why not allow the people with money to invest it and build their businesses so that they can hire the people to whom the government is planning on giving their money ?
Professor Reich , it seems that you have confused money with wealth .
The government can create all the money it wants simply by printing it .
Wealth , on the other hand , can only be created through saving and investment .
The government 's second priority , you said , should be to build infrastructure — putting people to work building roads , bridges , a new electrical grid , and a broadband internet system .
While we certainly need those things , how is this going to create jobs and why is it the government 's business to build them anyway ?
Labor is not homogeneous .
Yes , people can do many different jobs , but many jobs require specialized training and skills .
While building a road may be a boon to the road construction industry , how does it benefit an investment banker who just lost his job ?
How does building a bridge in California benefit an aerospace engineer who was just laid off in St. Louis ?
Or running fiber optic cable in North Dakota benefit a real estate agent out of work in Florida ?
While the government can create jobs in one sector of the economy , it can only do so by destroying jobs in another sector of the economy .
Perhaps you are familiar with Frdric Bastiat 's famous essay What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen .
In it , Bastiat explains that when the government undertakes a project such as building a bridge we see the benefits it brings — the jobs that it creates .
What we do not see are the things that are destroyed because of the project — the jobs that are not created because the government confiscates the resources needed to create them .
You may also be familiar with the Nobel Prize winning economist F.A. Hayek .
One of the major themes of Hayek 's work is that the free market is a discovery process .
Since none of us are omniscient , none of us has perfect knowledge of market conditions .
Hence , no central planner can effectively allocate resources .
In contrast , the free market 's pricing mechanism provides us with the information needed to efficiently allocate resources , and rewards those who do so correctly and punishes those who do not .
Instead of relying on market signals to determine where to allocate resources , the government relies on political pressures .
Most likely , roads and bridges will not be built where they are needed , but where the politicians think it will best serve them .
The beneficiaries of these programs will not be the American people in general , but political patrons and special interests .
The government 's third priority , according to you , should be tax cuts .
I wholeheartedly agree .
Let 's eliminate personal income tax , property taxes , sales taxes , and corporate taxes , as well as the onerous regulations that have driven so many companies out of the country .
Unfortunately , that 's probably not what you meant by tax cuts , is it ?
All in all , Professor Reich , it seems to me that your arguments defy logic and common sense .
However , as a prominent economist , public policy expert , and opinion molder , I 'm sure that you can explain what I am missing .
I anxiously await your reply .

The Best of Glenn Jacobs
HOUSTON -- Nov. 10 , 2008 --
It sounds like a science fiction movie : A killer contagion threatens the Earth , but scientists save the day with a designer drug that forces the virus to mutate itself out of existence .
The killer disease ?
Still a fiction .
The drug ?
It could become a reality thanks to a new study by Rice University bioengineers .
The study , which is available online and slated for publication in the journal Physical Review E , offers the most comprehensive mathematical analysis to date of the mechanisms that drive evolution in viruses and bacteria .
Rather than focusing solely on random genetic mutations , as past analyses have , the study predicts exactly how evolution is affected by the exchange of entire genes and sets of genes .
" We wanted to focus more attention on the roles that recombination and horizontal gene transfer play in the evolution of viruses and bacteria , " said bioengineer Michael Deem , the study 's lead researcher .
" So , we incorporated both into the leading models that are used to describe bacterial and viral evolution , and we derived exact solutions to the models . "
The upshot is a newer , composite formula that more accurately captures what happens in real world evolution .
Deem 's co-authors on the study include Rice graduate student Enrique Muñoz and longtime collaborator Jeong - Man Park , a physicist at the Catholic University of Korea in Bucheon .
In describing the new model , Deem drew an analogy to thermodynamics and discussed how a geneticist or drug designer could use the new formula in much the same way that an engineer might use thermodynamics formulas .
" Some of the properties that describe water are density , pressure and temperature , " said Deem .
" If you know any two of them , then you can predict any other one using thermodynamics .
" That 's what we 're doing here , " he said .
" If you know the recombination rate , mutation rate and fitness function , our formula can analytically predict the properties of the system .
So , if you have recombination at a certain frequency , I can say exactly how much that helps or hurts the fitness of the population . "
Deem , Rice 's John W. Cox Professor in Biochemical and Genetic Engineering and professor of physics and astronomy , said the new model helps to better describe the evolutionary processes that occur in the real world , and it could be useful for doctors , drug designers and others who study how diseases evolve and how our immune systems react to that evolution .
One idea that was proposed about five years ago is " lethal mutagenesis . "
In a nutshell , the idea is to design drugs that speed up the mutation rates of viruses and push them beyond a threshold called a " phase transition . "
The thermodynamic analogy for this transition is the freezing or melting of water -- which amounts to a physical transition between water 's liquid and solid phases .
" Water goes from a liquid to a solid at zero degrees Celsius under standard pressure , and you can represent that mathematically using thermodynamics , " Deem said .
" In our model , there 's also a phase transition .
If the mutation , recombination or horizontal gene transfer rates are too high , the system delocalizes and gets spread all over sequence space . "
Deem said the new results predict which parameter values will lead to this delocalization .
A competing theory is that a mutagenesis drug may eradicate a virus or bacterial population by reducing the fitness to negative values .
The new mathematical results allow calculation of this mechanism when the fitness function and the mutation , recombination and horizontal gene transfer rates are known .
Without theoretical tools like the new model , drug designers looking to create pills to induce lethal mutagenesis could n't say for certain under what parameter ranges the drugs really worked .
Deem said the new formula should provide experimental drug testers with a clear picture of whether the drugs -- or something else -- causes mutagenesis .

Though Barack Obama ’s cabinet appointments have received the big headlines , it is worth noting two important sub - cabinet choices .
Both are scientists , committed to using rather than abusing science to address issues like climate change , and a welcome departure from the many ideologues and lobbyists that Dick Cheney assembled to advise President Bush on environmental matters .
The first of these choices is Jane Lubchenco , a marine biologist at Oregon State University , to run the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , a division of the Commerce Department responsible for the health of the atmosphere and the oceans .
Ms. Lubchenco is an expert on two grave threats to the oceans , both linked to global warming .
One is acidification , which is destroying coral reefs , the other hypoxia , a condition that robs fish of the oxygen they need to survive .
She has also been a powerful advocate for stronger federal and international efforts to protect declining fish species .
We are also heartened by Mr. Obama ’s choice of John Holdren , a Harvard physicist , as his science adviser .
Mr. Holdren has served as chairman of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , as has Ms. Lubchenco .
Both have argued strongly and repeatedly for a mandatory limit on greenhouse gases to avoid catastrophic climate change .
In the midst of an economic crisis that ’s getting scarier by the day , it ’s time to ask whether the nation can really afford some 1,000 military bases overseas .
For those unfamiliar with the issue , you read that number correctly .
One thousand .
One thousand U.S. military bases outside the 50 states and Washington , DC , representing the largest collection of bases in world history .
Officially the Pentagon counts 865 base sites , but this notoriously unreliable number omits all our bases in Iraq ( likely over 100 ) and Afghanistan ( 80 and counting ) , among many other well - known and secretive bases .
More than half a century after World War II and the Korean War , we still have 268 bases in Germany , 124 in Japan , and 87 in South Korea .
Others are scattered around the globe in places like Aruba and Australia , Bulgaria and Bahrain , Colombia and Greece , Djibouti , Egypt , Kuwait , Qatar , Romania , Singapore , and of course , Guantánamo Bay , Cuba  just to name a few .
Among the installations considered critical to our national security are a ski center in the Bavarian Alps , resorts in Seoul and Tokyo , and 234 golf courses the Pentagon runs worldwide .
Unlike domestic bases , which set off local alarms when threatened by closure , our collection of overseas bases is particularly galling because almost all our taxpayer money leaves the United States ( much goes to enriching private base contractors like corruption - plagued former Halliburton subsidiary KBR ) .
One part of the massive Ramstein airbase near Landstuhl , Germany , has an estimated value of $ 3.3 billion .
Just think how local communities could use that kind of money to make investments in schools , hospitals , jobs , and infrastructure .
Even the Bush administration saw the wastefulness of our overseas basing network .
In 2004 , then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced plans to close more than one - third of the nation ’s overseas installations , moving 70,000 troops and 100,000 family members and civilians back to the United States .
National Security Adviser Jim Jones , then commander of U.S. forces in Europe , called for closing 20 % of our bases in Europe .
According to Rumsfeld ’s estimates , we could save at least $ 12 billion by closing 200 to 300 bases alone .
While the closures were derailed by claims that closing bases could cost us in the short term , even if this is true , it ’s no reason to continue our profligate ways in the longer term .
Unfortunately , the financial costs of our overseas bases are only part of the problem .
Other costs to people at home and abroad are just as devastating .
Military families suffer painful dislocations as troops stationed overseas separate from loved ones or uproot their families through frequent moves around the world .
While some foreign governments like U.S. bases for their perceived economic benefits , many locals living near the bases suffer environmental and health damage from military toxins and pollution , disrupted economic , social , and cultural systems , military accidents , and increased prostitution and crime .
In undemocratic nations like Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan , and Saudi Arabia , our bases support governments responsible for repression and human rights abuses .
In too many recurring cases , soldiers have raped , assaulted , or killed locals , most prominently of late in South Korea , Okinawa , and Italy .
The forced expulsion of the entire Chagossian people to create our secretive base on British Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean is another extreme but not so aberrant example .
Bases abroad have become a major and unacknowledged “ face ” of the United States , frequently damaging the nation ’s reputation , engendering grievances and anger , and generally creating antagonistic rather than cooperative relationships between the United States and others .
Most dangerously , as we have seen in Saudi Arabia and Yemen , and as we are seeing in Iraq and Afghanistan , foreign bases create breeding grounds for radicalism , anti-Americanism , and attacks on the United States , reducing , rather than improving , our national security .
Proponents of maintaining the overseas base status quo will argue , however , that our foreign bases are critical to national and global security .
A closer examination shows that overseas bases have often heightened military tensions and discouraged diplomatic solutions to international conflicts .
Rather than stabilizing dangerous regions , our overseas bases have often increased global militarization , enlarging security threats faced by other nations who respond by boosting military spending ( and in cases like China and Russia , foreign base acquisition ) in an escalating spiral .
Overseas bases actually make war more likely , not less .
This is n’t a call for isolationism or a protectionism that would prevent us from spending money overseas .
As the Obama administration and others have recognized , we must recommit to cooperative forms of engagement with the rest of the world that rely on diplomatic , economic , and cultural ties rather than military means .
In addition to freeing money to meet critical human needs at home and abroad , fewer overseas bases would help rebuild our military into a less overstretched , defensive force committed to defending the nation ’s territory from attack .
In these difficult economic times , the Obama administration and Congress should initiate a major reassessment of our 1,000 overseas bases .
Now is the time to ask if , as a nation and a world , we can really afford the 1,000 bases that are pushing the nation deeper into debt and making the United States and the planet less secure .
With so many needs facing our nation , it ’s unconscionable to have 1,000 overseas bases .
It ’s time to begin closing them .

You name it , if it ’s an antioxidant , we ’ll swallow it by the bucket - load .
According to some estimates around half the adults in the US take antioxidant pills daily in the belief they promote good health and stave off disease .
We have become antioxidant devotees .
But are they doing us any good ?
Evidence gathered over the past few years shows that at best , antioxidant supplements do little or nothing to benefit our health .
At worst , they may even have the opposite effect , promoting the very problems they are supposed to stamp out .
It ’s little surprise that antioxidants have acquired a reputation as miracle health supplements .
As long ago as the 1950s , scientists discovered that many diseases – including heart disease , strokes , cancer , diabetes , cataracts , arthritis and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson ’s and Alzheimer ’s – were linked to damage caused by highly destructive chemicals called free radicals .
Free radicals are compounds with unpaired electrons that stabilise themselves by oxidising other molecules – including proteins , carbohydrates , lipids and DNA .
In the process they often create more free radicals , sparking off a chain of destruction .
Oxidative damage accompanies most , if not all , diseases and has even been proposed as a direct cause of some including lung cancer , atherosclerosis and Alzheimer’s .
Free radicals are an unavoidable hazard of being alive .
We live in an oxygen - rich atmosphere , and radicals , particularly reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , are natural by - products of respiration .
“ One per cent of the oxygen we consume turns into ROS , ” says biochemist Barry Halliwell from …
Mirrors Edge was a fantastic game .
It had moments of frustration of course , but overall , it was a wonderful idea wrapped in a neat package that I enjoyed immensely .
Though it was n’t one of my top 10 games of 2008 , it was definitely a “ just missed ” kind of title .
My favorite part about the game was the thrill and exhilaration the running sequences gave you , as there was nothing more satisfying in the Mirrors Edge universe than running and jumping on rooftops , over fences , through alleys and around your enemies .
That ’s why when EA announced that there would be additional time trial maps for purchase in the future - and that they would leave the city behind and delve into the realm of main character Faith ’s imagination - my attention was caught .
The first of these maps was released exclusively for the Playstation 3 , and it ’s called Synesthesia .
Synesthesia means a “ joining the senses ” .
If you were to experience the effects of synesthesia , your perception would be slightly different , as you would be more aware of the colors , shapes and sensations surrounding you .
The map is aptly named , as all you can see stretching around you are brightly colored blocks , all different geometric shapes , and with various paths amongst them that you need to traverse in order to make it through in the shortest amount of time possible .
Unlike the city , where your brain would naturally seek out certain objects - the red colored objects that signified at least one way through the maze of rooftops , or maybe a fence , ledge , etc. - all you have to work with here are the shapes and your own imagination as it seeks out the fastest route .
If you have played the time trial maps that come packaged with the game , and you enjoyed them , then this free map is right up your alley .
If you ’re on the fence , remember ; this is essentially a demo of the downloadable content , so you have nothing to lose but the time you spend testing it .
As for my own opinion , playing through Synesthesia was as fun as the trailers led me to believe , and I ’ll be waiting for the rest of the pack to release later in February .
Check out the screens from the downloadable map pack , to see what a difference there is between the original game ’s level design and these new sets , developed exclusively for time trials .
Remember , though this map is PS3 exclusive , the DLC will be available across all three platforms that support the title .
The Battle of Stamford Bridge
An article by
After suffering through three decades of Viking raids that culminated in a short - lived line of Danish kings , Anglo - Saxon England experienced a period of relative peace and stability in the years prior to 1066 .
Upon the death of the last Danish king in 1042 , Ethelred the Unready 's pious son Edward succeeded to the English throne .
Although he turned Westminster into a great religious and political center , Edward the Confessor neglected to provide England with an heir .
Having spent over twenty - five years in exile in Normandy , Edward had developed strong ties with the Norman lords and their culture .
This caused a rift to develop between the king and his most powerful earl , Godwin of Wessex .
The Earl faced banishment in 1051 over a dispute involving Edward 's Norman brother - in - law .
When he returned to England in 1052 , Godwin , along with the earls of Mercia and Northumbria , forced Edward to name an Anglo - Saxon as Archbishop of Canterbury in place of a Norman appointee .
Shortly before his death , Edward chose Godwin 's son Harold as his successor , even though he had made the promise to name Duke William of Normandy his heir apparent in 1051 .
Harold Godwinson had succeeded to his father 's earldom in 1053 .
Like his father before him , he was the most powerful nobleman in England .
Earl Harold had campaigned in Wales in 1055 and again in 1062 .
During the mid-winter expedition of 1062 , Harold displayed a swiftness of military action that foreshadowed his lightning march north to Stamford Bridge .
Due to his success against the Welsh , Harold became a respected and popular noble .
After the death of Edward the Confessor in January , 1066 , the Witan , a council made up of many of the most powerful secular and ecclesiastical lords of England , met and elected Earl Harold Godwinson as king .
The appearance of a " star with hair " , Halley 's Comet , for seven days beginning on April 24th heralded trouble for the Anglo - Saxon monarchy .
Two rivals laid claim to King Harold II 's contested crown : Duke William the Bastard of Normandy and King Harald Sigurdsson " Hardråde " of Norway .
Harald Sigurdsson , posthumously given the epithet " Hardråde " ( Hard Council , or The Ruthless ) , was one of the last great Viking adventurers .
A supporter of his half - brother , King Olaf Haraldsson , Hardråde fled to Russia after the death of that royal saint at the Battle of Sticklestad in 1030 .
Hardråde then made his way to the Byzantine court and enrolled in the vaunted Varangian Guard .
He fought in Anatolia , Sicily , Southern Italy , and Bulgaria , until his imprisonment for misappropriation of imperial booty .
Escaping in 1042 , he journeyed back to Scandinavia and eventually succeeded to the Norwegian throne .
Already having designs on the English throne as well , Hardråde needed little coaxing to gather an invasion fleet when Harold Godwinson 's exiled brother Tostig appeared at his court in search of support to regain the earldom of Northumbria .
Duke William of Normandy played no direct role in the Battle of Stamford Bridge , but a realization of the imminent threat he posed to Anglo - Saxon England is essential to understanding the course of events that led up to the battle and beyond .
The bastard child of Duke Robert the Magnificent by a tanner 's daughter , William survived the turmoil of Norman politics and several assassination attempts to become the dominant magnate of northern France .
Brave , just , and sometimes ruthless , William was a competent commander and as good a fighter as any of his Norman knights .
Having little understanding of the English system of succession , William believed that Edward the Confessor 's vague promise was binding .
Feeling confident in the legitimacy of his claim , William was struck momentarily mute by the news of Edward 's death and Harold 's election as king .
A year or two before 1066 , Harold had even sworn an oath to help William secure the English throne .
Gaining papal approval for his forthcoming invasion , William recruited his feudal levies and hired mercenaries from all parts of France , Flanders , and the Norman territories of southern Italy .
He assembled a fleet at the mouth of the River Dives and then sailed to St. Valéry sur Somme to await a favorable easterly wind that would carry his ships across the English Channel .
King Harold
II gambled that his northern nobles could hold a Norwegian attack at bay and gathered his army of housecarls ( household troops ) and fyrdmen ( free men who owed military service in return for the right to hold land ) and headed to the Isle of Wight to supervise defensive preparations in the south .
Contrary north winds delayed Duke William 's expected expedition .
After having spent the summer in arms on the southern coast , Harold II 's force suffered from dwindling supplies and desertions .
The English king was forced to disband his army during the first week of September and send his fleet back to London .
Carried by the same winds that stalled the Norman invasion , the Norwegian king 's flotilla of 300 - 500 ships , met by Tostig with 12 vessels of his own , landed at Tyne in the north later that same month .
After sacking Scarborough and sailing up the Humber and Ouse , Hardråde left about a third of his force with his ships at Riccall and marched across the swampy flats toward York .
Believing help may not be forthcoming from Harold to the south , Earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria left the city on the twentieth of September and faced the invaders on a wet field at Fulford .
A hard battle ensued , and at first the English battered Hardråde 's right flank .
The veteran Viking king turned the tables on the young earls when he swung his left away from the river and then pushed the enemy into a large , water - filled ditch .
Edwin and Morcar retreated as their men were slaughtered or drowned .
The Norse accepted York 's surrender and returned to their ships at Riccall .
Hardråde demanded hostages from the surrounding countryside , choosing Stamford Bridge over the river Derwent as the site for the surrender .
Thinking that the north of England was won , the Norse left their mail corselets in their ships and carried only their helmets , shields , spears , swords , axes , and perhaps bows , on the journey to the crossing .
They were caught unprepared as an ominous cloud of dust and the gleam of hauberks and shields marked the swift approach of Harold 's army on the York road .
The Anglo - Saxon king had heard about the Norse landings shortly after he disbanded his southern army .
He summoned his troops together and hurriedly departed for York less than two weeks later .
Showing the same dash that made him a hero during his fight against the Welsh prince Griffith ap Llwelyn , Harold marched his host an impressive 190 miles in five days .
He reached Tadcaster on the 24th , and then pushed his men on through York and toward Stamford Bridge on the 25th .
Taking it easy in the warm sun of a fine early autumn day , Hardråde 's Vikings were shocked to see an English army appear over the ridge at Gate Helmsley , a mile to the west of their position astride the Derwent .
The Battle
At some point prior to or during a pause in the bitter conflict , a group of twenty horsemen rode forward from the English army seeking a parley with the invaders .
Hiding his identity from the Norse , King Harold spoke with his treacherous brother .
He offered Tostig Northumbria if he turned on his new allies .
When Tostig enquired as to what compensation Hardråde would receive , Harold offered the Norwegian king only " seven feet of English earth - - or as much more as he is taller than other men " .
The exiled earl refused to turn traitor twice , and Harold 's little band rode back to their own ranks .
Stung into desperate action by Harold 's sudden arrival and blatant defiance , Hardråde dispatched riders to Riccall to fetch the men under Eyestein Orre 's command .
Meanwhile , his outposts on the western side of the Derwent tried to hold off the English advance as the bulk of his army prepared for battle on the opposite end of the bridge .
The sheer weight of Harold 's attack swept aside the lightly - equipped defenders on the western bank .
Many Viking warriors suffered the same fate they had meted out five days before to the English troops under Edwin and Morcar .
After a brief exchange of arrows and javelins , bloody hand - to - hand battle commenced for control of the wooden span .
Both sides fought on foot with sword , axe , and spear .
English sources suggest that a lone Norseman grimly defended the narrow wooden span , felling many a housecarl and thegn with great blows from his axe .
An Anglo - Saxon archer failed to bring down the daring Viking hero .
Finally , an enterprising Englishman paddled a swill tub under cover of overhanging willows and speared the Norseman from beneath the bridge .
The delay to the English advance caused by the doomed warrior enabled his comrades to form up in a shield wall on the Derwent 's east bank .
With the death of the Norse berserker holding the bridge , the English charged across the river and clashed with the Norse shield wall .
With their backs to the Derwent , the English fought hard against the invaders , knowing retreat would be impossible .
The fighting lasted throughout the afternoon .
Driven into a berserk rage , the giant Norwegian king rushed ahead of his men and dealt devastating two - handed blows all about him .
As dusk drew near , an arrow to the windpipe finally ended the marauding career of that great Viking adventurer and former officer in the Byzantine Varangian Guard .
After Hardråde fell , Tostig took up the Viking Raven Banner , " Land - Ravager " , but the shield wall began to crumble .
The English refused to give quarter .
They suffered a temporary setback when Eyestein Orre arrived with the reinforcements from the Norse ships .
Tired from their forced - march in armour , many of Eyestein 's men eventually threw aside their mail and shields to continue the fight , but they then fell easy prey to English weapons .
Tostig and Eyestein died as darkness fell .
Without a leader around which to rally , the battered remnants of the Norse invasion force broke and fled to their longships .
Magnanimous in victory , Harold allowed those that had remained at Riccall , including Harrada 's son Olaf and the young earls of Orkney , to leave without ransom .
Only twenty - four vessels were needed to carry the survivors of Stamford Bridge back to Norway .
Conclusion
The people of York , who had so recently recognized Hardråde as king , welcomed Harold as a conquering hero .
The troubled king 's joy was tempered by the fact that he had committed fratricide , a sin that the Normans later used to fuel their cause .
Godwinson also knew he had yet to face William 's anticipated attack .
Even though triumphant , the English army had suffered heavy casualties .
While attending a victory feast on or about the first of October , Harold heard of Duke William 's fateful landing at Pevensey on the Sussex coast .
He mustered his men yet again and rushed this tired and depleted host south to Caldbec Hill near
Fate was ultimately unkind to Harold Godwinson , last Anglo - Saxon king of England .
If Duke William 's fleet had landed first , or if Hardråde had been defeated at Fulford , Harold and Anglo - Saxon England might have survived beyond the calamitous year of 1066 .
English history may have followed a much different course if Harold had fought the Normans first , or had met William 's invasion force with a well - rested army .
As it was , the Anglo - Saxon king staved off one attack , only to face another that was to lead to his death and the Norman Conquest of England .

‘ Moose for Ruby Programmers ’ was the programmed title for the talk I gave at the London . pm technical meet on Thursday , but that was something of a stalking horse for the real title , but I ’ll save that for the end of this writeup .
Why Ruby ?
I ’ve said this before , and I ’ll no doubt say it again , but the main reason I started programming in Ruby was that I got fed up of unrolling @_.
From a Perl programmer ’s perspective , Ruby is like Perl 5 , but with a way better object system out of the box .
What ’s so awful about unrolling @_ ?
Think about the way we program has changed over time .
There ’s been a trend of replacing conventions with code or , to look at it another way , of replacing imperative code with declarative code .
An example
Here ’s some pseudo code explaining how we used to do code reuse back when everything got written in assembly language :
save stuff we need later put the RETURN label on the stack put arguments on the stack goto FUNC_FOO RETURN : # return in accumulator # saved values on the stack
Every time we called another bit of code , we had to jump through all these hoops in order to manage the resources of the machine .
The particular sequence of hoops used within a program or library is called a calling convention .
Nowadays we do n't have to do all that explicit control stuff , we just make a function call .
Instead of a chunk of imperative code , we simply declare that we 're making a function call and let the computer do the bookkeeping .
On the other side of the function call , our function fulfils its side of the conventional bargain :
FUNC_FOO : pop arguments # maybe check types # do the real work of the function , put the result in the accumulator register pop continuation goto continuation
sub somefunc { my ( $argument ) = @_ ; $ argument -> isa( Whatever ) or die ; # do stuff return $ result ; }
def somefunc ( argument ) argument.is_a ?( Whatever ) or raise # do stuff return result end
Of course , it 's much easier in a high level language like Perl : Hmm ... actually ... okay , so we 're not having to manage the call stack in Perl , but we 're still writing imperative code just to give names to our parameters .
Meanwhile , in Ruby , we have :
One line shorter , and we get to name our parameters in a declarative style .
We 're still stuck with imperative code to do the type checking , but we 'll live .
It seems such a silly reason to switch programming languages does n’t it ?
Wading in treacle
The trouble is , unrolling @_ is like wading through treacle .
It exerts a great deal of drag .
When every function you write carries with it the need to write a little bit of custom code just to do the simplest of tasks every time , it ’s awfully tempting to just stick another level of indentation into your function and leave your worries about the Single Responsibility Principle to one side .
I mean , what ’s a 127 line method or two between friends ?
And those little bits of custom code are great places for silly little bugs to hide .
Most measures of defect rates seem to suggest that defects per line is pretty much constant across languages .
There ’s a very real benefit in writing concise , expressive code and that benefit is n’t simply the programmer ’s idea of elegance .
Concise languages “ make the easy things easy , and the hard things possible ” .
If your programming style is heavily object oriented , Perl 5 does n’t make the easy things as easy as they could be ( and are in other languages ) .
Ruby , for me , hit that sweet spot – it feels sufficiently perlish to make the transition easy , and its syntax for making classes and methods kicks Perl ’s arse .
Of course , after a while , you ’ll start hitting other limits and annoyances in Ruby ( just as you will in any other language ) , it ’s software after all and rule 1 of software is “ Software sucks ” .
The Moose effect
Although , in recent years , I ’ve been pretty much exclusively a Ruby programmer , I ’ve kept my eye on Perl and it ’s been almost impossible not to notice the rise of Moose .
To a Ruby programmer , I ’m sure that the very idea of Moose would seem silly .
Having to install an entirely new package and its dependency chain just to get something that looks a bit like Ruby ’s class objects and accessor method auto generation ?
Are you kidding ?
Ruby ’s stuff is good enough .
I used to think Perl ’s OO was good enough .
It turns out that it is .
Because if there ’s one glorious thing about Perl it ’s malleability .
There ’s very little you ca n’t change if you ’re prepared to delve into the weirder bits of the way the runtime is put together .
And , for all Perl has a reputation for oodles of syntax and weird special cases , once you get down to the bones , it ’s consistent .
The syntax to get there can be horrible , but the structure makes sense .
So Perl has just enough object support for sufficiently clever programmers to build something really decent .
Here ’s a bit of noddy code to show you what I mean .
First , a ruby version and then I ’ll show you the Moose equivalent .
class Article attr_reader : title def title= ( a_string ) raise unless a_string.is_a ?( String ) @title = a_string end attr_reader : body def body =( a_string ) raise unless a_string.is_a ?( String ) @body = a_string end def initialize ( initial_values = { } ) self .
title = initial_values [ : title ] end def print_on ( html ) html.h1 ( title ) html.div( class => ' body ' ) { body } end end And here 's the Perl equivalent .
package Article ; use Moose ; has title => ( is => ' rw ' , isa => ' Str ' ) ; has body => ( is => 'rw ' , isa => ' Str ' ) ; sub print_on { my ( $ self , $ html ) = @_ ; $ html - > h1 ( $ self - > title ) ; $ html - > div ( $ self - > body , class => ' body ' ) ; } Note that the Ruby version omits the detailed error reporting of the Moose version , and if I were writing a _real_
Ruby class , I would n't bother with type checking something as simple as a string .
It 's not really a fair comparison ( I could tilt things far more steeply in Moose 's favour by using some of the more sophisticated attribute declaration possibilities that Moose offers ) .
The important thing to remember is that accessor methods are the most boring bits of writing a class .
The interesting bits are the methods that _do_ stuff .
There 's a school of thought that says that accessor methods should be private ( or at least protected ) - otherwise you 're just using data structures with benefits .
In any class worthy of the name , there will be more methods that do stuff than accessors after all , and I definitely prefer the Ruby version of @print_on@ to the Moose one .
However , if we sprinkle a bit of magic dust on the Perl version , we have : use MooseX : : Declare ; class Article { has title => ( is => 'rw ' , isa => ' Str ' ) ; has body => ( is => 'rw ' , isa => ' Str ' ) ; method print_on ( Document $ html ) { $ html - > h1 ( $ self - > title ) ; $ html - > div( $ self - > body , class => ' body ' ) ; } }
I still find myself pinching myself when I see that .
I can't quite believe it 's still Perl 5 and I have n't fallen through a wardrobe to a magical land where everything is flowers and ponies , and Perl 6 Christmas has arrived at last after too long a winter [ 1 ] .
But it is Perl 5 and it ’s here now .
Sort of ( see Caveats below ) .
How does it work ?
I neither know nor care [ 2 ] .
As far as I ’m concerned it ’s sufficiently advanced rocket science and I ’ll leave it at that .
I ’m just glad to be able to use it .
About the only thing I can say with confidence about it is that Florian Ragwitz , Ash Berlin , Stevan Little and all the other who ’ve made this possible are geniuses .
There ’s more to it , of course , but the documentation covers things in more detail than I ’m happy to write here , so I ’d suggest you read that if you want to know more .
Generally , things just work the way you ’d expect them to .
Caveats
This is seriously bleading edge code .
There are bugs ( though substantially fewer of them today than there were when I delivered the talk on Thursday ) , and you will trip over them .
And when you do , the error reporting currently leaves something to be desired [ 3 ] , but it ’s improving in leaps and bounds .
The more people who are using it , the more people there are to submit patches ( and a patch to the test suite with a bug and no fix is just as welcome as a patch that includes a fix ) .
So , if you ’re starting a new project , you should consider going one step further than Moose , and using MooseX : : Declare .
Heck , if you ’re feeling courageous , you should consider using it in existing projects as well .
You can introduce it piecemeal after all - you can simply use class Foo {...} and only gradually introduce the extra method goodness as you refactor existing methods .
The real title
I knew I ’d forgotten something .
The real title of my talk was MooseX :: Declare – Why I came back to Perl
[ 1 ] I ca n’t quite believe I just used that metaphor .
[ 2 ]
Not quite true .
It ’s important that MooseX : : Declare does n’t use source filters , and it does n’t , so that ’s all right .
[ 3 ]
That ’s the error reporting that happens when you trip a bug , not when you , for example , call a method that that expects an argument of one type with an argument of the wrong type , which is pretty exemplary .
Greenpeace stages a protest against a new Mexican bio-security law that , it claims , does not include safeguards to prevent transgenic contamination of corn seeds ( Image : Marco Ugarte / AP / PA )
NOW it ’s official : genes from genetically modified corn have escaped into wild varieties in rural Mexico .
A new study resolves a long - running controversy over the spread of GM genes and suggests that detecting such escapes may be tougher than previously thought .
In 2001 , when biologists David Quist and Ignacio Chapela reported finding transgenes from GM corn in traditional varieties in Oaxaca , Mexico , they faced a barrage of criticism over their techniques .

WSJ Letter :
This year marks the 100th anniversary of the drug war , which started in 1909 with the prohibition of opium processed for smoking .
Over the course of the past 100 years , more substances have been banned and enforcement has become more brutal .
Despite these measures , the percentage of Americans addicted to drugs has increased .
WSJ Article : Much as Pakistan is fighting for survival against Islamic radicals , Mexico is waging a do - or - die battle with the world 's most powerful drug cartels .
Last year , some 6,000 people died in drug - related violence here , more than twice the number killed the previous year .
The dead included several dozen who were beheaded , a chilling echo of the scare tactics used by Islamic radicals .
Mexican drug gangs even have an unofficial religion :
They worship La Santa Muerte , a Mexican version of the Grim Reaper .
In growing parts of the country , drug gangs now extort businesses , setting up a parallel tax system that threatens the government monopoly on raising tax money .
In Ciudad Juarez , just across the border from El Paso , Texas , handwritten signs pasted on schools warned teachers to hand over their Christmas bonuses or die .
A General Motors distributorship at a midsize Mexican city was extorted for months at a time , according to a high - ranking Mexican official .
A GM spokeswoman in Mexico had no comment .
" We are at war , " says Aldo Fasci , a good - looking lawyer who is the top police official for Nuevo Leon state , where Monterrey is the capital .
" The gangs have taken over the border , our highways and our cops .
And now , with these protests , they are trying to take over our cities . "
WSJ Editorial :
The war on drugs has failed .
And it 's high time to replace an ineffective strategy with more humane and efficient drug policies .
This is the central message of the report by the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy we presented to the public recently in Rio de Janeiro .
Prohibitionist policies based on eradication , interdiction and criminalization of consumption simply have n't worked .
Violence and the organized crime associated with the narcotics trade remain critical problems in our countries .
Latin America remains the world 's largest exporter of cocaine and cannabis , and is fast becoming a major supplier of opium and heroin .
Today , we are further than ever from the goal of eradicating drugs .
Over the last 30 years , Colombia implemented all conceivable measures to fight the drug trade in a massive effort where the benefits were not proportional to the resources invested .
Despite the country 's achievements in lowering levels of violence and crime , the areas of illegal cultivation are again expanding .
In Mexico -- another epicenter of drug trafficking -- narcotics - related violence has claimed more than 5,000 lives in the past year alone .
The revision of U.S. - inspired drug policies is urgent in light of the rising levels of violence and corruption associated with narcotics .
The alarming power of the drug cartels is leading to a criminalization of politics and a politicization of crime .
And the corruption of the judicial and political system is undermining the foundations of democracy in several Latin American countries .
A well - known Chinese blogger and novelist is recovering after he was stabbed by unidentified assailants as he gave a talk in a Beijing bookshop this weekend .
Audience members apparently heard one of the attackers accuse him of " offending " people , leading friends and readers to suggest he was targeted because of his outspoken blog .
Xu Lai was rushed to hospital following the attack on Saturday afternoon , but given the all clear following an emergency operation .
He remained in hospital today .
Xu works as a journalist , but is best known for his edgy , satirical blog ProState In Flames which covers many sensitive issues .
It was shut down by censors last November , but he reopened it at another site .
According to the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper , two men grabbed Xu shortly after he finished speaking and dragged him into the toilets .
When his wife forced her way in , she saw that one was holding a dagger while the other one had a kitchen knife and was preparing to hack Xu's hand .
The men fled from the One Way Street bookshop before anyone could catch them .
Guo Jianlong , a reporter and friend of Xu , said he noticed a commotion and spotted the writer holding his stomach and leaning against the wall .
According to various reports , the attackers said either " We 're here for revenge , " " You 'll know better than to offend people next time , " or " You brought this on yourself .
You know why you 're doing this , do n't you ? "
His friend and fellow blogger Hecaitou wrote on Twitter : " Xu Lai does n't have any private enemies . "
According to the Southern Metropolis Daily he described Xu as " a low - key sort of person who would n't provoke anyone .
However , there are many things on his blog that can touch a nerve and he has probably made enemies that way . "
As news spread rapidly via websites , bulletin boards and Twitter , many people expressed fears that Xu had been targeted for his writing .
One commenter asked : " My god.are we living in Wen Yiduo 's era ? " – in reference to the poet and activist assassinated in 1945 after a public talk .
Another wrote , in the comments section of Xu's blog : " Comrades , netizens , such a despicable trick cannot stop the progress of Chinese people toward freedom and democracy . "
But others said people should not leap to conclusions about the cause of the attack , which is under investigation by the police .

LONDON , Jan. 29 ( UPI ) -- A 21 - year - old man who serves as an impersonator of Prince Harry says he has gone into hiding due to all of the female attention the British royal draws .
Elliott Gibson said while he is used to some female attention due to his physical similarities to Prince Harry , he has been overwhelmed with lovelorn girls since the prince 's publicized split from his girlfriend , Chelsy Davy , The Daily Telegraph reported Thursday .

" People have been staring at me my entire life because of how much I look like Harry -- and , as embarrassing as it is , a lot of girls come up to me to get a picture , " Gibson said .
" But the past few days have been like nothing I 've ever experienced . "
The prince and Davy ended their 5 - year - relationship this month .
Gibson said during a recent London visit he was mistaken for Harry once again , but this time he barely escaped being chased by 50 U.S. teenagers .
" I seriously thought I might be injured .
I could n't even begin to think what they'd do to me if they caught me , " he told the Telegraph of the Sunday incident .
In the “ 7 Fallacies of Economics ” series , I have covered the fallacies of “ collective terms ” and “ composition , ” and now turn to the third fallacy : Money is Wealth .
FEE president Lawrence Reed writes :
The mercantilists of the 1600s raised this error to the pinnacle of national policy .
Always bent upon heaping up hoards of gold and silver , they made war on their neighbors and looted their treasures .
If England was richer than France , it was , according to the mercantilists , because England had more precious metals in its possession , which usually meant in the king ’s coffers .
It was Adam Smith , in The Wealth of Nations , who exploded this silly notion .
A people are prosperous to the extent they possess goods and services , not money , Smith declared .
All the money in the world — paper or metallic — will still leave one starving if goods and services are not available .
The “ money is wealth ” error is the affliction of the currency crank .
From John Law to John Maynard Keynes , great populations have hyperinflated themselves to ruin in pursuit of this illusion .
Even today we hear cries of “ we need more money ” as the government ’s monetary authorities crank it out at double digit rates .
The good economist will recognize that money creation is no short - cut to wealth .
Only the production of valued goods and services in a market which reflects the consumer ’s wishes can relieve poverty and promote prosperity .
Those words are still true , if only because our political and financial “ leaders ” want us to believe that they can end the current recession if the Federal Reserve System creates “ liquidity . ”
Thus , we see the Fed doing whatever it can to push more money into the economy .
One reason that the “ money is wealth ” fallacy has thrived for so long is that many people – including academic economists – fall prey to another fallacy , the fallacy of composition ( discussed last week ) .
In the case of money , it is especially pernicious .
Assume , for example , that I had a printing press in my house which could crank out undetectable counterfeit money .
I could print huge amounts and purchase whatever I pleased .
No doubt , I would be better off ( as long as the authorities did not discover what I was doing ) , but others would be made worse off .
First , and most important , is the nature of money .
Money is a good that is used to trade for other goods , and by making trade easier ( and more abundant ) , it is a productive asset .
However , as Adam Smith understood , money itself is not wealth ; instead , it is a good that we use in order to obtain wealth .
( Pieces of government - produced green paper do not qualify as historical “ money . ”
Government ’s monopoly on money has led to its debasement . )
Second , money follows the same economic laws that govern all other goods .
The more money created , the less its marginal value .
( In other words , money is subject to the Law of Decreasing Marginal Utility . )
Many economists have missed this point .
In typical academic classes , money is described as a quantity variable .
Double the amount of money and the “ price level ” doubles as well , but the monetary increase has brought about no real harm .
Other academic models note that an increase in the amount of money will increase the amount of wealth ( call it “ Gross Domestic Product ” ) , even if it also raises the “ price levels . ”
While such models are easy to teach ( and to use for solving math problems ) , nonetheless they are inaccurate at best and dangerous at worst .
They do not demonstrate what really happens when the amount of money in an economy is increased .
If the process of creating more and more money by fiat ( called inflation ) goes on unchecked , as it did during the past decade , then not only does the value of money on the margin fall , but its growth triggers an unsustainable boom that ultimately collapses in a bust .
This process has repeated itself time and again , which demonstrates that most policy makers do not understand that money is not wealth .
The lesson still has not been learned .
Next Week : The Fallacy of Production for its Own Sake
Harmonix 's big hit before Guitar Hero / Rock Band , and a foreshadowing of their gameplay , was Amplitude , developed for SCEA on the PS2 .
Harmonix CEO
Alex Rigopulos says he'd love to " do it right " for the PS3 .

Ars Technica interviewed Rigopulos earlier this week , and in the discussion , both noted that Sony owns the IP , but doing up a sequel remains very much on the mind of the Harmonix boss .
" That game is still close to my heart .
I love it .
I 'd love to do a sequel to Amplitude , actually , " Rigopulos said , noting that Harmonix commitments to other projects ( like the Beatles title ) make it " an issue of prioritization . "

But " for us , that lingering question of ' what are we going to do about Amplitude ' is still very much out there .
I would love to come back and do it right for the PlayStation 3 , for example . "
Ars asked if he 'd talked with Sony about such a possibility .
" I think they recognize that the environment for that game is different now than it was six years ago when it was first released .
I 'd love to see us come back to it at some point . "

There is something deeply exasperating about the debate , spotlighted Thursday , about whether unlocking an iPhone violates Apple ’s copyright on the cellphone ’s software .
There ’s a real issue at stake , but it is n’t fundamentally about copyrights .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , in a filing with the Copyright Office , argues that the government should allow iPhone owners to circumvent technical barriers meant to keep them from changing the phone ’s software , a process called jailbreaking .
The Digital Millennium Copyright
Act bans people from defeating technical protections for copyrighted materials ( such as the encryption on DVDs ) .
The act requires the government to consider exemptions to this ban every three years .
Apple , not surprisingly , filed an objection , saying that jailbreaking a phone indeed violates copyright law and that no exception should be granted .
One of the key legal arguments is whether installing software on an iPhone that is not sold through Apple ’s iTunes store is an infringement of Apple ’s copyright .
The E.F.F. argues that it does not and that Apple ’s motivation is simply to preserve its revenue from software sales .
Apple argues that its copyright is infringed , in part because its reputation and potential to profit from iPhone sales in the future is hurt because jailbroken phones may be more subject to bugs and security flaws .
The copy protection scheme enforces a “ chain of trust ” that allows Apple to make sure that harmful software does not get onto the phones .
Here is a key summary from its argument , which refers to T.M.P. ’s , or technical protection measures , the software meant to keep people from jailbreaking the phone :
It should be clear that the iPhone ecosystem Apple has built is good for developers , good for iPhone users , good for Apple , and good for the policies underlying the copyright laws to encourage the creation of works of authorship .
That ecosystem depends upon the “ chain of trust ” implemented in the iPhone through its T.M.P.’s.
The proposed exemption would destroy that chain of trust and threaten many of the benefits the ecosystem affords , and should therefore be rejected .
Stepping back , one of the big issues here is whether Apple has the right to tell people who buy iPhones to use them only in the way it wants them to .
Why should n’t I be able to run buggy software if I choose to ?
But it ’s not quite so simple .
Jennifer S. Granick , a lawyer for the E.F.F. , said that Apple could force buyers of the phone to agree to any conditions it wants to write into a user agreement .
But those agreements would be governed by contract law , which would force Apple to sue users and prove actual damages .
Under copyright law , Apple would have the right to claim statutory damages of up to $ 2,500 “ per act of circumvention . ”
People who jailbreak phones might even be subject to criminal penalties of as long as five years , if they circumvented copyright for a financial gain .
“ Apple is bringing the hammer down in a way that Congress never intended and is really severe for something that is just not wrong , ” Ms. Granick said .
An Apple spokesman declined to comment beyond the company ’s legal filing .
The issue will be decided by the Library of Congress by this fall after several hearings in the spring .
This is the exasperating part .
It ’s hardly clear that the Library of Congress , which does look after copyright law , is the right place for this debate .
After all , the copyrighted software is really a small part of a cellphone and not really part of the fundamental issue .
This is an issue that Congress may have to take up .
Ms. Granick also pointed out that Congress has from time to time limited the ability of companies to use contract law to limit what buyers of their products can do with them .
For example , car companies are not allowed to void warranties for people who chose to have repairs done somewhere other than at dealers .

It 's 10 years since the release of The Big Lebowski , a film that split cinema audiences down the middle but created a strange cult .
Is The Dude a slacker prince for our times ?
Not everybody likes The Big Lebowski .
The Big Lebowski is a cult film .
That is to say , not everybody likes it but those who do , in the main , have a special relationship with it .
One of the dream sequences ( photo courtesy of Universal Pictures )
When it was released , as the follow - up to the Coen brothers ' well - regarded and academy - impressing Fargo , many critics found themselves underwhelmed .
Fargo was a film that hung together well - tightly paced and plotted , full of dark humour and moments of pathos .
The Big Lebowski , on the other hand , could be viewed as two hours of wild self - indulgence , packed to the gills with bowling , White Russian cocktails , and swearing .
Variety said it " does n't seem to be about anything other than its own cleverness " , while the LA Times moaned that the " story line is in truth disjointed , incoherent and even irritating " .
Even its staunchest fan would have to say the plot , a pastiche of a Chandler or Hammett mystery , takes a little decoding .
The central character is Jeff Lebowski , aka The Dude , who has his rug urinated on by thugs , setting off a complicated chain of events .
Power of quotability
In 1998 the film failed , initially at least , to set the box office on fire .
QUOTABLE LINES
The Dude : Nice marmot Careful man , there 's a beverage here
This aggression will not stand , man That rug really tied the room together Walter Sobchak :
This is not Nam , this is bowling , there are rules
You 're entering a world of pain I did not watch my buddies die face down in the mud ...
Chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature
You want a toe ?
I can get you a toe ... hell , I can get you a toe by three o'clock this afternoon , with nail polish
The flicks were then being bestrode by Titanic , a big sentimental monster of a replica - ship melodrama .
The ordinary cinemagoer preferred Celine Dion 's heart going on , and Kate Winslet threatening to jump to a watery grave , to the antics of a bearded slacker in Los Angeles .
But while The Big Lebowski did not initially put bums on seats , it was not a total turkey and proved something of a very slow - burn hit , particularly on DVD .
It became a popular choice for midnight screenings .
Fans liked to go along and quote the dialogue .
It was perhaps not surprising when four years after its release , it spawned Lebowski Fest , a chain of conventions , centred on Louisville , Kentucky , celebrating the film .
There have even been Lebowski celebrations in the UK .
" The first night we watch the movie , the second night we become the movie , " says Will Russell , who describes himself as " co-founding dude " of the Lebowski Fest .
At the annual events , fans dress up as the Dude himself , or as crazed Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak , German nihilists , purple - clad Jesus Quintana , bowling pins , Valkyries and even as the dancing landlord .
Then they read quotations to each other , much as might be seen at a Monty Python convention .
Will Russell ( right ) with another co-founder , Bill Green " It is fun to drink and bowl , " says Mr Russell , co-author of I'm a Lebowski , You 're a Lebowski .
And they are all united into one temporarily tight - knit community by their love of the film .
" The characters are so loveable and it is a really quotable movie .
Not everybody gets it .
A lot of people see the movie and they do n't like it .
Other people fall in love with it . "
It 's a key element in cult appeal .
Not just loving something , but also relishing the fact that not everybody does .
" It was considered a flop at the time .
Titanic was in its 20th week and it still beat the Big Lebowski .
US Marshals beat it . "
But neither have the quotability of The Big Lebowski .
At the festival the " achievers " - as the fanatics of the film call themselves , after the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers mentioned in the movie - shout " nice marmot " or " careful man , there 's a beverage here " .
John Goodman 's character , Walter Sobchak , provides many of the most glorious lines with his preposterous ruminations on his experiences in Vietnam such as : " This is not Nam , this is bowling , there are rules . "
Regular swearing
The fans love the glorious level of deadpan wit .
In one scene the two protagonists enter a house and see a famous TV writer ensconced in an iron lung , his laboured breathing audible across the room .
" Does he still write ? " , they ask the woman who answers the door .
" No , no , no , he has health problems , " she replies .
Fans regard Jesus Quintana as one of the great movie cameos
And then there is the swearing .
Mr Russell estimates the F - word is used 281 times .
Lou Harry , author of the as - yet - unpublished Behind the Screen : The Big Lebowski , says the film 's appeal lies in its " compulsive rewatchability " .
" It is in a line of Coen Brothers films - it has the same quirkiness and unexpected 180 degree turns until you have seen it 17 times .
It does that in a way that is satisfying . "
With a marijuana - smoking burned out hippie as the protagonist , it 's easy to place The Big Lebowski as one of the forerunners of today 's wave of slacker comedies like Knocked Up , Pineapple Express and The Wackness .
But its place is really in the line of under - appreciated - at - time - of - release cult films - a list featuring everything from Tod Browning 's Freaks to Russ Meyer 's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls .
The Big Lebowski is of an era where fanatics find it easier to discover the shared nature of their fanaticism thanks to the internet and now , to social networking .
The result is the continuance of the concept of " cult " .
Below is a selection of your comments .
You could say that the movie is still a relevant social commentary .
The two main characters are polar opposite of each other : the Dude , a liberal , slacker , anti-establishment guy ;
Walter a conservative , war veteran , law - and - order guy .
This is juxtaposed against Donny the ill - informed and out of touch middle ground .
All three coexist in a fragile harmony that is in conflict with the issues of the day of uncheck aggression , under the table deals and moral debauchery .
With the death of Donny , they realise their personal angst is just not that important and what matters is having civility and pursuing what makes you happy .
I still will not bowl on the Sabbath .
Maude , Jacksonville , Florida The Big Lebowski is a good film .
No more and certainly no less .
That alone makes it interesting and somewhat of a rarity .
Is it a cult film ?
Well , it certainly provides fuel for one of the most irritating manifestations of cult status - that of quotability .
This basically means a few people shouting lines from a film at each other in sad displays of one - up - manship and " insider " knowledge [ aka elitism ] .
The fact that one of the fans seems to revel in the idea of other people not liking the film is very revealing and not in a good way .
This kind of behaviour is actually a bad advert for a decent film .
The bottom line is we could all join in but most choose not to .

The soundtrack alone puts this film up there as one of the greats .
Having Sam Elliott as the narrator pushes it into the top 10 .
Jesus threatening to pull the trigger until it goes click eases it into the top 5 .
But Steve Buschemi as the thing you only appreciate when it 's gone nails it firmly at number 1 .
Is it bad form to wish for Lebowski 2 : Abide Harder ?
Olav , Sidcup
It is one of the funniest and most charming films ever .
Can you think of another movie where the Barry White - voiced narrator loses his train of thought in the opening two minutes , and lets the viewer just work it out himself ?
Or where even the most miniscule character - such as Brandt the secretary - is drawn in loving detail ?
You could make a whole movie about ANYBODY in this film , and it would be wonderful .
It 's a joy .
Russell Jones , Manchester , UK Repeated watchings of The Big Lebowski have just got me through a difficult four - day labour ...
I just hope my son will like the film as much as I do !
Lisa , Swansea
At last , the BBC has lent its unique authority to my quest to convince non-believers of the importance of this film ( or at very least justify my white - Russian - soaked annual home Lebowski Fest with fellow achievers to my wife ) .
I like your style , dudes .
Mike , Chicago Dude Living in London
It may just be the Coen brothers ' most overrated film .
It 's not bad , far from it , it 's just NOT as funny as Raising Arizona , and there 's not nearly enough John Turturro for my liking .
Oh and any film featuring Julianne Moore just is n't going to get my vote .
Neale , Cardiff
My best man organised a Big Lebowski themed stag night consisting of dressing up as The Dude , bowling and drinking copious amounts of White Russians .
It dawned on me whilst I was there that maybe not everybody had seen this classic movie when a fellow bowler asked why we were all dressed in pyjamas ( even though we had Bermuda shorts , shades and dressing gowns on - who sleeps in that ? ) .
I felt like saying " Obviously you 're not a golfer " but thought the quote may be lost on them .
Andy Robinson , Manchester I admit to being distinctly underwhelmed by The Big Lebowski .
Considering myself to be fairly savvy when it comes to cinema , I 'm always wary of watching a film , such as this , that carries a certain weight of expectation along with it .
For this reason , I consciously stayed away from The Big Lebowski .
Generally speaking , I would consider myself to be a fan of " cult " films , though not really a fan of the phrase " cult films " .
I can quote Withnail & I with the best of them .
I would also consider myself to be a very culturally aware person .
There are many reasons why I should have fitted the model for somebody who would have " got " this film .
But I just did n't ...
David Berry , Wirral , UK Without parallel my favourite film of all time .
The Dude typifies someone we all want to be associated with .
A carefree relaxed person , who speaks his mind and does what he likes to .
We need to revive the UK Lebowski Fest which I missed in Edinburgh two years ago .

It 's a pastiche - rubbish and not even original rubbish .
It 's a cult success - my family and friends and some sad types with nothing to do that night saw it .
If this baloney ever becomes popular , i.e. redone with class , characterisation and acting involved , the underwhelmed critics of before will explain their comments were a pastiche .
Arts are just a pastiche on themselves .

Theytry , South Wales I discovered this film on VHS when it went to rental .
At 16 years old , bits probably went over my head , but I instantly took to dressing gowns and White Russians ( milk , Kaluha and vodka went down far easier than those baby steps into cheap larger ) .
The habit only gathered pace when I started university as I rejoiced in the ' bum ' lifestyle .
This film is a stonewall classic and I 've been saying it for years .
When you come across someone who agrees with you , it 's instant respect .
You can entertain yourselves for a wonderful 15 minutes as you exchange quotes and then , like waking up next to a stranger , there 's an awkward silence as nothing else seems half as funny afterwards .
Jesus ... you said it man .

One of the funniest movies of all time , and a criminally overlooked performance by Jeff Bridges .
Coen quirkiness at its best .

I experienced my first underwhelming viewing of The Big Lebowski at the cinema upon its release .
I can't remember being particularly impressed , thinking " it 's no Fargo / Hudsucker Proxy / Blood Simple " etc .
Ten years on , I 'm not quite sure how it happened , but it has now beaten the likes of Apocalypse Now , Empire Strikes Back , Blade Runner , Lawrence of Arabia and Citizen Kane as my favourite all - time film .
I 've no idea when I first noticed the genius of Walter and Donny 's love / hate relationship , or the timeless strut of Jesus , or the hilarious subtlety of the script that just grows on you like your favourite album .
The Coen Brothers have worked some magic in their time , rarely missing the spot .
But I do n't think they ever hit the spot so perfectly as they did with The Big Lebowski .
They got career - best performances from the two leads , combined it with perfect pace , direction , cinematography , soundtrack and made the perfect film in my opinion .
David Harrison , Birmingham Quite simply one of the best films ever :
" He 's a nihilist "
" Oh , really .
That must be exhausting . "

What makes the dude so appealing is his attitude towards life .
Yes , he is a slacker , but he also is a Zen master .
He takes things as they come , simply trying to move through life with as little friction as possible .
He does n't accept society 's version of what life is supposed to be .
That makes him my hero .
Eric , Buffalo I have a copy that I watch every now and then as I do with Nacho Libre .
It 's a simple plot with very real people in it .
It 's not about superheroes or super - fighters or aliens but about ordinary , stupid every day kind of people .
It 's also about friendships maintained with disparate people in a world that changes too fast , is dark , threatening and frightening .
The Dude , Donny and Walter could n't be more different from each other yet they meet in the seemingly serene environs of the bowling hall .
We do n't see their homes or families .
Their friendship exists in a kind of limbo .
Behind them are experiences that they probably do n't want to repeat or remember and they find solace in each others ' company and the quiet distraction of bowling .
Matt Lees , Milton Keynes
It 's a pity that no one can see that this is the Coen 's take on As You Like it .
Watch the movie ( tens of times ) and then re-read the famous quote :
" All the world 's a stage , And all the men and women merely players ;
They have their exits and their entrances ;
And one man in his time plays many parts , His acts being seven ages ... "
Nick , London , UK Comparing The Big Lebowski with Titanic is a tad unfair .
Titanic was created as a spectacle , called a " must - see " movie and generally liked up to the the grand scale of it 's title .
The Big Lebowski was created from a love of the story , from fantastic writing talent and a sense of humour and the obscure that appeals to people who prefer to go to movies to be stimulated , not just wowed .
Cult movies will always be created and always be worshipped by legions of fans who like their entertainment to need a little effort from the viewing audience .
Heather , Willenhall Brilliant film , I think of it every time I paint my toenails green .
Sarah , Bristol , UK Love of The Big Lebowski is one of those rare things upon which whole wonderful friendships can be built .
In addition to its eternal quotability is the fascination that comes from the fact that many of the events in the film came from real life and many of the characters - Little Larry , Walter - are real people .
And The Dude ?
Sometimes , there 's a man , well , he 's the man for his time and place and maybe if we were all a bit less un - Dude we would n't have the problems we have at the moment .
Jackie Treehorn , Malibu Beach Great piece although you could have ended it perfectly with -
The Dude abides .
I do n't know about you but I take comfort in that .
It 's good knowin' he 's out there .
The Dude . Takin ' 'er easy for all us sinners .

What are these ?
This weekend we showed you some concept art from two unannounced Lionhead games .
Despite the art ’s recent appearance on the Internet , a Lionhead spokesman has confirmed that the pieces are old news .
“ They are concepts for old projects dating back a few years ago , ” a spokesman told CVG today .
“ Neither is in production now . ”
It ’s a bummer that Justice and Survivors are dead , but that does n’t mean the Leading Light Conceptual Design speculation express has left the station .
Climb aboard the boys and girls , because there ’s another dead title on the Web site .
Check out these concepts for Sony and Stormfront ’s Titan .
The majority of images focus on a huge robot coddling a human .
Think Vin Diesel ’s The Iron Giant with a violent , alien - smashing twist .
[ Update : Titan is toast , too . ]

For a street artist whose work is scrupulously shrouded in anonymity to evade detection by the NYPD , Poster Boy 's comeuppance resulted from a puzzlingly sloppy lowering of his guard .
The anti-consumerist guerrilla artist , dubbed New York 's Banksy , was picked up by plain clothed officers on Saturday at an art show in the SoHo area of Manhattan , his presence at the event having been openly proclaimed on a fly leaflet .
It was an invitation that the NYPD could not resist .
For months they have been trying to track down the mysterious figure , whose work on the city 's subway system has earned him increasing celebrity or notoriety , depending on your point of view .
His work is a twist on the age - old form of New York subway graffiti .
The city 's zero tolerance policy towards petty crime has long eradicated painted graffiti from the trains themselves , and most graffiti practitioners are now reduced to " scratchiti " where logos are etched into the windows of the carriages .
Poster Boy has taken the reliance on razor blades inherent in scratchiti and put it to much more sophisticated and intriguing use .
He realised that the film and product adverts at subway stations are now made with self - adhesive backing , rendering them giant stickers , which can be cut up into bits and remodelled in an echo of a digital mash - up .
So the Hollywood star Alec Baldwin is recast with a red nose and blue tears .
The Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt , appearing on a poster advertising Puma shoes , is metamorphosed so that he now lends his name to the fast food chain McDonald's , with the headline " McDorse the world " .
The anti-consumerist edge is put to even more overt political use in posters such as one for the film Iron Man which is remoulded as Iran = Nam .
More than 400 such interventions in less than a year has earned the artist a large internet following .
A short video on YouTube , Spending Time With Poster Boy , has been viewed 785,897 times .
He was also featured on an underground art website called Friends We Love , wearing a businessman 's white shirt and tie but with his face pixellated .
The Guardian 's Guide magazine caught up with Poster Boy in Brooklyn last month and heard his explanation of his work .
" The idea of taking your environment into your own hands and making it what you want .
As long as you 're not hurting other people , it can't be bad . "
That is not the view taken by the NYPD which takes a tough line on any acts classed as vandalism .
In the Guardian 's company , the artist was extremely cautious , working only on empty platforms and having studied CCTV cameras and police officers ' rotations .
But the guard was well and truly down on Saturday .
The leaflet boasted the presence of " Poster Boy NYC " , billing him as an artist who " takes it upon himself to remix and recreate ads that bombard us in the subways into politically charged social commentary " .
The NYPD announced they had arrested a 27 - year - old from Bushwick , Brooklyn and promptly placed him on Rikers Island .
He was later released on bail put up by friends .
He was named as Henry Matyjewicz .
But as you might expect , that is not entirely the end of the mystery .
Hours after his arrest , the New York Times received an email purporting to come from a " Henry " who claimed that Poster Boy was not a single individual but a " movement " .
" Henry 's part is to do legal artwork while propagating the ideas behind Poster Boy .
That 's why it was OK for him to take the fall the other night . "
The email ended : " Henry Matyjewicz is innocent . "
The Chiemgauer is one of 16 regional currencies that have sprung into existence across Germany and Austria since the launch of the euro five years ago .
Another 49 regios are in the pipeline .
They are outside the control of the political authorities , mostly run by activists , farmers , eco-enthusiasts , anti-globalists , and citizen committees .
Some are rural , others circulate like underground money in Berlin and Bremen .
Hamburg has two : the Alto and the Hansemark .
Italy has its version in the Valchius Valley , in the Alps .
The phenomenon , not seen since the Great Depression , has left experts scratching heads at the Bundesbank .
The mighty reserve bank , which issues euro notes and coins worth € 146bn for a third of the eurozone economy , is relaxed about the risk of monetary anarchy .
But it is sufficiently puzzled to publish a 63 - page report probing the eruption of this movement .

Leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints have said they do not object to rights for same - sex couples , as long as those rights do not infringe on the integrity of the traditional family .
Now , gay - rights activists and at least five Utah legislators are asking the Church to demonstrate its conviction .
The group Equality Utah says the Church made the invitation , and they 're accepting it .
" The LDS Church says it does not oppose same - sex couples receiving such rights as hospitalization and medical care , fair housing rights or probate rights , " said Mike Thompson , executive director of Equality Utah .
That 's based on a statement released by the LDS Church last week .
It read , in part , that the Church , quote : " does not object to rights for same - sex couples regarding hospitalization and medical care , fair housing and employment rights or probate rights . "
So for this group , the next step is a logical one : Turn that statement into several new laws .
" Setting aside the marriage issue for now , there is so much in that space that is short of marriage that we need to talk about ; and we 're saying , ‘ Let 's talk about it , ' " said Utah Sen. Scott McCoy .
Those issues include rights in medical care and hospital visitation , housing and employment protections , insurance rights for a partner , a statewide domestic partner registry .
Repealing the second part of Utah's Amendment 3 would officially recognize gay couples .
Most Utah legislators are not aware of the proposals , a few hesitating to comment until specific bills are available .
This group knows there will be questions , resistance , even negative reactions .
They 're hoping to create a dialogue based on the common ground they say the LDS Church has laid down .
" It 's not our intention to bring these things forward without significant education and understanding , " said Salt Lake Rep. Christine Johnson .
" I have had conversations with representatives of the LDS Church initially about this , letting them know what we were going to do here today , what we 're going to do with these kinds of measures , " McCoy said .
" We need to channel our feelings into a constructive direction and dialogue . "

( CNN ) -- Daniel
Pharr says he was in the middle of his first - ever skydive , thousands of feet over South Carolina , when the instructor strapped to his back stopped talking to him Saturday .
Army Pvt. Daniel Pharr says he " went into survival mode " when his instructor stopped talking during their skydive .
The instructor , George " Chip " Steele of Skydive Carolina , was later pronounced dead .
But as they were falling , Pharr -- an Army soldier taking a private skydiving lesson -- knew only that Steele was n't responding .
Pharr said he " went into survival mode , " using his military training to calm himself as he tried to get to ground safely .
" We 're just taught to deal with adversity , whether it be on the battlefront or at home or ... up in the air , and you just do what you have to do -- assess the situation and keep a calm head about you because it does n't do anybody any good to panic , " said Pharr , a private in the Army .
Pharr , able to steer himself only in right circles because he could use only the parachute 's right steering mechanism , managed to maneuver away from some obstructions and landed safely in Chester , South Carolina .
When they landed , Pharr attempted CPR , but it was too late .
Watch Pharr describe what happened »
Steele , 49 , appeared to have died of a heart attack , Chester County Coroner Terry Tinker told the Rock Hill ( South Carolina ) Herald .
An autopsy was being conducted Monday .
Everything seemed to be normal at the beginning of the jump , Pharr said .
He asked a question and Steele responded .
They chatted for a moment in the air , but when Pharr asked another question about 5,500 feet above ground , Steele did not respond .
Pharr asked the question again .
When he still got no response , he did n't panic -- he realized to get down safely he had to remain calm , he said .
" The likelihood of you surviving , you know , decreases absolutely amazingly by factors exponentially if you panic , " he said .
The skydive was a Christmas gift from Pharr 's girlfriend , who he said is now having regrets about it .
But Pharr assured her there was no reason for regret .
" It 's a lifelong experience now , not to be turned around into a bad thing , " he said .
" I just hate it for the family . "
Pharr -- based at Georgia 's Fort Gordon , according to CNN affiliate WJBF -- said his focus was just to get down to the ground and help Steele .
Pharr said his family wo n't let him go near skydiving again , and he is n't arguing with them .

Viennese scientists are trying to understand the mysteries of the holographic principle :
How many dimensions are there in our universe ?
Some of the world 's brightest minds are carrying out research in this area -- and still have not succeeded so far in creating a unified theory of quantum gravitation is often considered to be the “ Holy Grail ” of modern science .
Daniel Grumiller from the Institute of Theoretical Physics , Vienna University of Technology , can now at least unravel some of the mysteries of quantum gravitation .
His results on black holes and gravitational waves are pretty mind - boggling - to say the least .
Only recently he won the START prize and will use these funds to engage even more young physicists at the TU Vienna .
We perceive the space around us as three - dimensional .
According to Einstein , time and space are inseparabely linked .
Adding the time axis to our three - dimensional space makes our space - time - continuum four - dimensional .
For decades , scientists have been wondering about the existence of additional dimensions so far hidden to our senses .
Grumiller and his colleagues are trying the opposite approach : Instead of postulating additional dimensions , they believe that our universe could in fact be described by less than four dimensions .
“ A hologram , as you find it on bank notes or credit cards , appears to show a three - dimensional picture , even though in fact it is just two - dimensional , ” Grumiller explains .
In such a case , reality has fewer dimensions than we would thinkit appears to have .
This “ holographic principle ” plays an important role in the physics of space time .
Instead of creating a theory of gravity in all the time and space dimensions , one can formulate a new quantum theory with one fewer spatial dimension .
That way , a 3D theory of gravitation turns into a 2D quantum theory , in which gravity does not appear any more .
Still , this quantum theory correctly predicts phenomena like black holes or gravitational waves .
“ The question , how many dimensions our world really has , does probably not even have a proper answerprobably cannot be answered explicitly , ” Grumiller thinks .
“ Depending on the particular question we are trying to answer , either one of the approaches may turn out to be more useful . ”
Grumiller is currently working on gravitational theories which include two spatial dimensions and one time dimension .
They can be mapped onto a two - dimensional gravitationless quantum theory .
Such theories can be used to describe rapidly rotating black holes or “ cosmic strings ” – spacetime defects , which probably appeared shortly after the Big Bang .
Together with colleagues from the University of Vienna , Grumiller is organizing an international workshop , which will take place from April 14 to 24 , 2009 .
Renowned participants , like scientists from Harvard , Princeton , the MIT and many other universities , reveal that the Viennese gravitation physicists are held in high regard internationally .
OMAHA , Neb . —
When Danielle Nitzel found her three - year - old marriage drawing its last breath in 2004 , she could n’t afford the minimum of $ 1,000 she was told she would need to hire a divorce lawyer .
So she did what more and more Americans are doing :
She represented herself in court .
I looked online and just tried to figure out how to write out the paperwork , said Nitzel , a nursing student who at the time had little money and a pile of education loans .
I think it cost us $ 100 to file it ourselves .
The number of people serving as their own lawyers is on the rise across the country , and the cases are no longer limited to uncontested divorces and small claims .
Even people embroiled in child custody cases , potentially devastating lawsuits and bankruptcies are representing themselves , legal experts say .
It ’s not just that poor people can’t afford lawyers .
This is really a middle - class phenomenon , said Sue Talia , a judge from Danville , Calif. , and author of Unbundling Your Divorce : How to Find a Lawyer to Help You Help Yourself .
The trend has resulted in court systems clogged with filings from people unfamiliar with legal procedure .
Moreover , some of these pro se litigants , as they are known , are making mistakes with expensive and long - lasting consequences — perhaps confirming the old saying that he who represents himself has a fool for a client .
Paul Merritt , a district judge in Lancaster County , Neb. , said he knows of cases in which parents lost custody disputes because they were too unfamiliar with such legal standards as burden of proof .
There is a lot on the line when you have a custody case , Merritt said .
There are a lot of things that judges take into consideration in determining what ’s in the best interest of the child , and if you ’re a pro se litigant , the chances that you will know what those things are , and that you will present evidence of all those issues , are really small .
While the fees lawyers charge vary widely , the average hourly rate ranges from around $ 180 to $ 285 in the Midwest , and from $ 260 to more than $ 400 on the West Coast , according to legal consultant Altman Weil Inc .
Tim Eckley of the American Judicature Society in Des Moines , Iowa , said no national figures are kept on how many people represent themselves , but I do n’t think anybody who ’s involved in the courts would deny that this is a growing trend in the last 10 to 15 years .
In California , about 80 percent represent themselves in civil family law cases — such as divorce , custody and domestic violence cases — according to the Self - Represented Litigation Network .
In San Diego alone , the number of divorce filings involving at least one person not represented by a lawyer rose from 46 percent in 1992 to 77 percent in 2000 .
In Nebraska in 2003 , 13,295 people represented themselves in civil cases in state district courts .
By 2007 , the number had risen to 32,016 , or 45 percent .
The result ?
Courts are absolutely inundated with people who do not understand the procedures , Talia said .
It is a disaster for high - volume courts , because an inordinate amount of their clerks ’ time is spent trying to make sure that the procedures are correctly followed .
Talia has traveled to nearly every state to speak to lawyers , judges and court workers about measures to handle the growing number of people representing themselves .

Earlier today I was munching on some bulk peanuts from Target ( on sale , three bucks .
Good protein ) , and flushing some email .
Quality of the nuts varies , however .
( Well , as with the email ) .
I took another handful of nuts , chewed , and found that one of them had a strange flavor .
Kind of sweet and tangy .
“ Good peanut , ” I thought ; one of those nonsense , no - consequence thoughts that floats through your head when you ’re staring into space and cud-chewing .
A minute later , I ran my fingers through my hair and got back to the keyboard .
Something stuck to my fingers .
It was the leg of a spider .
Beat .
“ Huh .
I think I ate a spider . ”
Beat .
“ Not bad . ”
Beat .
“ I wonder if there are any more ? ”
[ I was going look , just to see if I could find more evidence and return the rest of them to Target … ]
Sara Kuszak : Pregnant Tourist Abducted and Murdered in Puerto Rico
, a pregnant American tourist who lived in Savannah , GA , was was abducted and killed during a morning jog in eastern Puerto Rico .
Kuszak , who was five months pregnant , was in Puerto Rico with her fiance Cheshir McIntosh , visiting friends whose yacht was at a marina in Fajardo .
She called a marina employee from the trunk of her kidnapper 's car , and the employee called 911 .
It is assumed that Kuszak was not aware that 911 is the same emergency number used in Puerto Rico .
Police found Kuszak 's abductor after picking up a signal from the victim 's cell phone , which he was carrying .
The suspect , who has not been charged , was covered in blood , which he claimed was from a cut on one of his brother 's horses .
Kuszak 's partially clothed body was found in a field about an hour later .
Her throat had been slashed .
No further information is available at this time .

Conyers publishes massive report on ' Imperial Presidency ' Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday January 13 , 2009
Print This Email This Report demands investigation of Bush administration 's abuses of power
Everyone wants to know : will Obama order investigations into the Bush administration 's abuses of power ?
But , perhaps a better question would be : if he does n't , who will ?
House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) , it appears , will at least try .
Conyers published a 487 - page report ( PDF link ) Tuesday titled , " Reining in the Imperial Presidency : Lessons and Recommendations Relating to the presidency of George W. Bush . "
Conyers ' report makes 47 recommendations " designed to restore the traditional checks and balances of our constitutional system , " reads the foreward .
Recommendations include the establishment of a ' blue ribbon ' commission to fully investigate the Bush administration , and the launch of criminal probes .
" Even after scores of hearings , investigations , and reports , we still do not have answers to some of the most fundamental questions left in the wake of Bushs Imperial Presidency , " Conyers said in a release .
" Investigations are not a matter of payback or political revenge  it is our responsibility to examine what has occurred and to set an appropriate baseline of conduct for future administrations . "
On Jan. 6 , Conyers introduced a bill that , if passed , would create the " Commission on Presidential War Powers and Civil Liberties , " which would seek to root out President Bush 's abuses .
 The Bush Administrations approach to power is , at its core , little more than a restatement of Mr. Nixons famous rationalization of presidential misdeeds : ' When the president does it , that means its not illegal , ' " Conyers wrote in the report 's foreward .
Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann on Monday , " We now have President Bush speaking quite candidly that he was in the loop , we have Dick Cheney who almost bragged about it .
The question for Barack Obama is whether he wants to own part of this by looking the other way . "
Obama told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Sunday , " We have not made final decisions , but my instinct is for us to focus on how do we make sure that moving forward we are doing the right thing .
That does n't mean that if somebody has blatantly broken the law , that they are above the law .
But my orientation 's going to be to move forward . "
" If waterboarding is torture -- and Barack Obama has said that it is torture , " Turley emphasized , " and torture is a war crime , then the president has committed a war crime if he did order waterboarding .
You have to do some heavy lifting to avoid the simplicity of that logic . "
" What I would want to do is to have my Justice Department and my Attorney General immediately review the information that 's already there and to find out are there inquiries that need to be pursued , " Obama told Philidelphia Daily News reporter Will Bunch in April 2008 .
Obama added , " if crimes have been committed , they should be investigated , " but agreed with Bunch 's assertion that the effort could turn into a " partisan witch hunt " that threatens to consume his first term .
" Now , if I found out that there were high officials who knowingly , consciously broke existing laws , engaged in coverups of those crimes with knowledge forefront , then I think a basic principle of our Constitution is nobody above the law -- and I think that 's roughly how I would look at it , " he concluded .
Is it real ?
Last year , Conyers came under heavy criticism for allowing Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) to present and speak about articles of impeachment against Bush and Cheney , but prohibiting any committee vote on the measure .
Prior to the Democrats ' takeover of the House in 2006 , he penned a Washington Post editorial in which he all but promised he would n't .
But by August of 2008 , he seemed to have warmed .
" Nancy Pelosi has impeachment ' off the table , ' but that 's off her table , it is not off John Conyers ' table , " the Michigan Democrat said during a town hall meeting in his district Aug. 28 .
" Nancy Pelosi , who I actually supported , cannot prevent me from introducing an impeachment resolution against , well I 've got a long list of people who are eligible , " said Conyers .
The statement seems in contradiction to Conyers ' Washington Post editorial .
" It was House Republicans who took power in 1995 with immediate plans to undermine President Bill Clinton by any means necessary , and they did so in the most autocratic , partisan and destructive ways imaginable , " he wrote .
" If there is any lesson from those ' revolutionaries , ' it is that partisan vendettas ultimately provoke a public backlash and are never viewed as legitimate .
" So , rather than seeking impeachment , I have chosen to propose comprehensive oversight of these alleged abuses .
The oversight I have suggested would be performed by a select committee made up equally of Democrats and Republicans and chosen by the House speaker and the minority leader .
" The committee 's job would be to obtain answers -- finally .
At the end of the process , if -- and only if -- the select committee , acting on a bipartisan basis , finds evidence of potentially impeachable offenses , it would forward that information to the Judiciary Committee .
This threshold of bipartisanship is appropriate , I believe , when dealing with an issue of this magnitude . "
This promise appears to be the basis of his proposed ' blue ribbon ' commission .
" There 's a big debate going on about holding the previous administration accountable for [ its ] actions , and I would say for the time being that the Obama team is focused properly on the future , " says Sen. Dick Durbin in a Tuesday report by National Public Radio .
" Our economy is so weak ; we 're in desperate need of jobs .
Before we start looking at the pages of history in the Bush administration , we should be looking at the obvious need to create jobs and create a new economic climate in this country . "
And Conyers ' commission would do just that : take political pressure to pursue prosecutions off of Obama , placing the onus on the investigatory body .
However , " a commission with no power to punish anyone except through shame is powerless in an age of shamelessness , " writes David Swanson , co-founder of Afterdowningstreet.org and press secretary for the 2004 Kucinich for President campaign .
" The commission 's subpoenas would be enforced through the courts , allowing the process to be dragged out well beyond a year and a half , or allowing witnesses to refuse compliance .
" All of this delay would simply serve to bolster claims that the crimes of the past eight years are unimportant because in the past .
And if the commission offered criminal immunity to witnesses in order to entice them to testify , then its result would be permanently blocking prosecutions in the name of revealing the ' truth . ' "
" There 's no real question that crimes were committed here by [ Obama 's ] predecessor , " Turley said on Monday .
" And he can either begin his administration as a man of principle , and allow the law to take us wherever it may lead , or he will inherit the same type of moral relativism that really corrupted the previous administration .
I 'm going to say a silent prayer for principle . "
ALLAHABAD : In a major breakthrough that could help in the fight against global warming , a team of five Indian scientists from four institutes of the country have discovered a naturally occurring bacteria which converts carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) into a compound found in limestone and chalk .
When used as an enzyme ��� biomolecules that speed up a chemical reaction ��� the bacteria has been found to transform CO2 into calcium carbonate ( CaCO3 ) , which can fetch minerals of economic value , said Dr Anjana Sharma from the biosciences department of RD University , Jabalpur , who was part of the Rs 98.6 lakh project sponsored by the department of biotechnology ( DBT ) under the Union science and technology ministry .
CO2 is a greenhouse gas produced in the burning of fossil fuels and other industrial activities .
The rising emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere is chiefly responsible for global warming .
Reducing CO2 levels is the single most important strategy to fight global warming and the resulting effects of climate change .
"
The enzyme can be put to work in any situation , like in a chamber fitted inside a factory chimney through which CO2 would pass before being emitted into the atmosphere , and it would convert the greenhouse gas into calcium carbonate , ����� � Dr Sadhana Rayalu , the project coordinator who is from the National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute ( NEERI ) , Nagpur , told TOI on phone from Nagpur .
This potentially means that the bacteria ��� extracted from a number of places including brick kilns in Satna , Madhya Pradesh ��� can be used to take out CO2 from its sources of emission itself .
Rayalu said the chemical reactions involved in the process have been successfully established while its economic viability , cloning , expression and single - step purification are under study .
The team has published its findings in the Indian Journal of Microbiology and its paper has been accepted for publication in the World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology .
Sharma said the breakthrough was the result of marathon research work spanning more than three years .
Other members of the team are Dr K Krishnamurty from NEERI , Dr T Satyanarayana from Delhi University and Dr A K Tripathi from Banaras Hindu University .
"
Interestingly , it is nature that has come to the rescue of the human race from harmful effects of global warming .
Investigators of the team have discovered as many as seven such micro-organisms that have the tendency to convert carbon dioxide into calcium carbonate at different natural locations , ������ said Sharma , who was on a visit to Allahabad .
Google Flu Tracker via Flu Trends
Google developed a flu tracker called Google Flu trends .
It was developed with the help of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and is based on the number of search queries made about influenza .
Google said it noticed that there was a relationship between the frequency of search queries and the number of people who are experiencing flu - like symptoms each week .
Our team found that certain aggregated search queries tend to be very common during flu season each year .
We compared these aggregated queries against data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and we found that there ’s a very close relationship between the frequency of these search queries and the number of people who are experiencing flu - like symptoms each week .
As a result , if we tally each day ’s flu - related search queries , we can estimate how many people have a flu - like illness .
Based on this discovery , we have launched Google Flu Trends , where you can find up - to - date influenza - related activity estimates for each of the 50 states in the U.S. [ via Google Blog ]
Instead of the one or two week delay that the traditional flu surveillance systems have , Google said its reports will be updated daily and may provide an early warning system for influenza outbreaks .
The CDC does a great job of surveying real doctors and patients to accurately track the flu , so why bother with estimates from aggregated search queries ?
It turns out that traditional flu surveillance systems take 1 - 2 weeks to collect and release surveillance data , but Google search queries can be automatically counted very quickly .
By making our flu estimates available each day , Google Flu Trends may provide an early - warning system for outbreaks of influenza .

Influenza , also known as “ flu ” is responsible for up to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year .
The outbreak was traced back to a factory in Georgia A peanut supplier blamed for a US - wide outbreak of salmonella poisoning sold nuts it knew were infected , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) says .
The FDA was revising an earlier report it had issued saying the Georgia - based firm Peanut Corporation of America ( PCA ) had waited for negative results .
A criminal inquiry was launched last month .
The corporation denies any wrongdoing and says it is co-operating .
The outbreak has been linked to eight deaths and more than 500 illnesses .
The FDA carried out an inspection of the corporation 's plant in the town of Blakely in January , after it was identified as a possible source of the contamination .
The inspection found that the factory was " not compliant with Current Good Manufacturing Practices required by the FDA " .
Children affected
The FDA 's initial report had stated that all of the batches of nuts that had tested positive for salmonella had been retested by the firm , and negative results had been returned before the products were sold .
But in a statement , the administration said : " Certain information provided by PCA management during the inspection was not consistent with the subsequent analysis of the company 's records . "
In its new report , the FDA details several instances going back to 2007 when the firm shipped out products that had tested positive for salmonella before receiving the results of second tests .
In some cases , the FDA said , the firm received a subsequent negative test , and in other cases " no additional testing appears to have been done " .
Salmonella causes diarrhoea , vomiting and fever More than 1,300 food products containing PCA peanut butter have now been recalled .
A total of 575 people in 43 US states are reported to have fallen ill with the outbreak strain of salmonella typhimurium since September 2008 .
More than half of those affected were under 16 years old .
Eight deaths have also been reported , which the FDA said earlier " appeared to be associated with the outbreak " .
PCA announced a voluntary recall of its peanut butter on 13 January and has apologised " to peanut consumers everywhere " for the crisis .
The company has not denied that its plant was the source of contamination .
Earlier , officials said national brands of peanut butter have not been affected , but they have warned consumers to be cautious with peanut products produced by smaller companies .
Symptoms of salmonella poisoning , which usually appear within 12 to 72 hours of eating contaminated food , include diarrhoea , nausea and vomiting , headaches , stomach cramps and fever .
The symptoms can last for several days but most otherwise healthy people make a full recovery within a week .

MESSAGE OF HIS HOLINESS
BENEDICT XVI
FOR LENT 2009
" He fasted for forty days and forty nights ,
and afterwards he was hungry " ( Mt 4,1 - 2 )
Dear Brothers and Sisters !
At the beginning of Lent , which constitutes an itinerary of more intense spiritual training , the Liturgy sets before us again three penitential practices that are very dear to the biblical and Christian tradition – prayer , almsgiving , fasting – to prepare us to better celebrate Easter and thus experience God ’s power that , as we shall hear in the Paschal Vigil , “ dispels all evil , washes guilt away , restores lost innocence , brings mourners joy , casts out hatred , brings us peace and humbles earthly pride ” ( Paschal Præconium ) .
For this year ’s Lenten Message , I wish to focus my reflections especially on the value and meaning of fasting .
Indeed ,
Lent recalls the forty days of our Lord ’s fasting in the desert , which He undertook before entering into His public ministry .
We read in the Gospel : “ Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil .
He fasted for forty days and forty nights , and afterwards he was hungry ” ( Mt 4,1 - 2 ) .
Like Moses , who fasted before receiving the tablets of the Law ( cf. Ex 34,28 ) and Elijah ’s fast before meeting the Lord on Mount Horeb ( cf. 1 Kings 19,8 ) , Jesus , too , through prayer and fasting , prepared Himself for the mission that lay before Him , marked at the start by a serious battle with the tempter .
We might wonder what value and meaning there is for us Christians in depriving ourselves of something that in itself is good and useful for our bodily sustenance .
The Sacred Scriptures and the entire Christian tradition teach that fasting is a great help to avoid sin and all that leads to it .
For this reason , the history of salvation is replete with occasions that invite fasting .
In the very first pages of Sacred Scripture , the Lord commands man to abstain from partaking of the prohibited fruit : “ You may freely eat of every tree of the garden ; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat , for in the day that you eat of it you shall die ” ( Gn 2 , 16 - 17 ) .
Commenting on the divine injunction , Saint Basil observes that “ fasting was ordained in Paradise , ” and “ the first commandment in this sense was delivered to Adam . ”
He thus concludes : “ ‘ You shall not eat ’ is a law of fasting and abstinence ” ( cf. Sermo de jejunio : PG 31 , 163 , 98 ) .
Since all of us are weighed down by sin and its consequences , fasting is proposed to us as an instrument to restore friendship with God .
Such was the case with Ezra , who , in preparation for the journey from exile back to the Promised Land , calls upon the assembled people to fast so that “ we might humble ourselves before our God ” ( 8,21 ) .
The Almighty heard their prayer and assured them of His favor and protection .
In the same way , the people of Nineveh , responding to Jonah ’s call to repentance , proclaimed a fast , as a sign of their sincerity , saying : “ Who knows , God may yet repent and turn from his fierce anger , so that we perish not ? ” ( 3,9 ) .
In this instance , too , God saw their works and spared them .
In the New Testament , Jesus brings to light the profound motive for fasting , condemning the attitude of the Pharisees , who scrupulously observed the prescriptions of the law , but whose hearts were far from God .
True fasting , as the divine Master repeats elsewhere , is rather to do the will of the Heavenly Father , who “ sees in secret , and will reward you ” ( Mt 6,18 ) .
He Himself sets the example , answering Satan , at the end of the forty days spent in the desert that “ man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God ” ( Mt 4,4 ) .
The true fast is thus directed to eating the “ true food , ” which is to do the Father ’s will ( cf. Jn 4,34 ) .
If , therefore , Adam disobeyed the Lord ’s command “ of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat , ” the believer , through fasting , intends to submit himself humbly to God , trusting in His goodness and mercy .
The practice of fasting is very present in the first Christian community ( cf. Acts 13,3 ; 14,22 ; 27,21 ; 2 Cor 6,5 ) .
The Church Fathers , too , speak of the force of fasting to bridle sin , especially the lusts of the “ old Adam , ” and open in the heart of the believer a path to God .
Moreover , fasting is a practice that is encountered frequently and recommended by the saints of every age .
Saint Peter Chrysologus writes : “ Fasting is the soul of prayer , mercy is the lifeblood of fasting .
So if you pray , fast ; if you fast , show mercy ; if you want your petition to be heard , hear the petition of others .
If you do not close your ear to others , you open God ’s ear to yourself ” ( Sermo 43 : PL 52 , 320. 322 ) .
In our own day , fasting seems to have lost something of its spiritual meaning , and has taken on , in a culture characterized by the search for material well - being , a therapeutic value for the care of one ’s body .
Fasting certainly bring benefits to physical well - being , but for believers , it is , in the first place , a “ therapy ” to heal all that prevents them from conformity to the will of God .
In the Apostolic Constitution Pænitemini of 1966 , the Servant of God Paul VI saw the need to present fasting within the call of every Christian to “ no longer live for himself , but for Him who loves him and gave himself for him … he will also have to live for his brethren “ ( cf. Ch. I ) .
Lent could be a propitious time to present again the norms contained in the Apostolic Constitution , so that the authentic and perennial significance of this long held practice may be rediscovered , and thus assist us to mortify our egoism and open our heart to love of God and neighbor , the first and greatest Commandment of the new Law and compendium of the entire Gospel ( cf. Mt 22 , 34 -40 ) .
The faithful practice of fasting contributes , moreover , to conferring unity to the whole person , body and soul , helping to avoid sin and grow in intimacy with the Lord .
Saint Augustine , who knew all too well his own negative impulses , defining them as “ twisted and tangled knottiness ” ( Confessions , II , 10.18 ) , writes : “ I will certainly impose privation , but it is so that he will forgive me , to be pleasing in his eyes , that I may enjoy his delightfulness ” ( Sermo 400 , 3 , 3 : PL 40 , 708 ) .
Denying material food , which nourishes our body , nurtures an interior disposition to listen to Christ and be fed by His saving word .
Through fasting and praying , we allow Him to come and satisfy the deepest hunger that we experience in the depths of our being : the hunger and thirst for God .
At the same time , fasting is an aid to open our eyes to the situation in which so many of our brothers and sisters live .
In his First Letter , Saint John admonishes : “ If anyone has the world ’s goods , and sees his brother in need , yet shuts up his bowels of compassion from him – how does the love of God abide in him ? ” ( 3,17 ) .
Voluntary fasting enables us to grow in the spirit of the Good Samaritan , who bends low and goes to the help of his suffering brother ( cf. Encyclical Deus caritas est , 15 ) .
By freely embracing an act of self - denial for the sake of another , we make a statement that our brother or sister in need is not a stranger .
It is precisely to keep alive this welcoming and attentive attitude towards our brothers and sisters that I encourage the parishes and every other community to intensify in Lent the custom of private and communal fasts , joined to the reading of the Word of God , prayer and almsgiving .
From the beginning , this has been the hallmark of the Christian community , in which special collections were taken up ( cf. 2 Cor 8 - 9 ; Rm 15 , 25 - 27 ) , the faithful being invited to give to the poor what had been set aside from their fast ( Didascalia Ap. , V , 20,18 ) .
This practice needs to be rediscovered and encouraged again in our day , especially during the liturgical season of Lent .
From what I have said thus far , it seems abundantly clear that fasting represents an important ascetical practice , a spiritual arm to do battle against every possible disordered attachment to ourselves .
Freely chosen detachment from the pleasure of food and other material goods helps the disciple of Christ to control the appetites of nature , weakened by original sin , whose negative effects impact the entire human person .
Quite opportunely , an ancient hymn of the Lenten liturgy exhorts : “ Utamur ergo parcius , / verbis cibis et potibus , / somno , iocis et arctius / perstemus in custodia – Let us use sparingly words , food and drink , sleep and amusements .
May we be more alert in the custody of our senses . ”
Dear brothers and sisters , it is good to see how the ultimate goal of fasting is to help each one of us , as the Servant of God Pope John Paul II wrote , to make the complete gift of self to God ( cf. Encyclical Veritatis splendor , 21 ) .
May every family and Christian community use well this time of Lent , therefore , in order to cast aside all that distracts the spirit and grow in whatever nourishes the soul , moving it to love of God and neighbor .
I am thinking especially of a greater commitment to prayer , lectio divina , recourse to the Sacrament of Reconciliation and active participation in the Eucharist , especially the Holy Sunday Mass .
With this interior disposition , let us enter the penitential spirit of Lent .
May the Blessed Virgin Mary , Causa nostrae laetitiae , accompany and support us in the effort to free our heart from slavery to sin , making it evermore a “ living tabernacle of God . ”
With these wishes , while assuring every believer and ecclesial community of my prayer for a fruitful Lenten journey , I cordially impart to all of you my Apostolic Blessing .
From the Vatican , 11 December 2008 .

Krispy Kreme , being the genial purveyor of glazed goodness that it is , decided to get in on the Obama inauguration craze and is offering one free doughnut to every costumer on January 20 , Inauguration day , and released this seemingly innocuous press release :
" Krispy Kreme Doughnuts , Inc. ( NYSE : KKD ) is honoring American 's sense of pride and freedom of choice on Inauguration Day , by offering a free doughnut of choice to every customer on this historic day , Jan. 20 .
By doing so , participating Krispy Kreme stores nationwide are making an oath to tasty goodies -- just another reminder of how oh - so - sweet ' free ' can be . "
Well ,
The American Life League noticed the liberal use of the word choice and decided to blast the chain bakery for producing abortion doughnuts .
" The unfortunate reality of a post - Roe v. Wade America is that ' choice ' is synonymous with abortion access , and celebration of ' freedom of choice ' is a tacit endorsement of abortion rights on demand , " the group 's president , Judie Brown said in a statement .
File this under " Overreactionary Wing Nuts " and another attempt of conservatives to redefine words for their political means ( You can try to rewrite the Constitution , but not the dictionary ) .
Of course , the " overreactionary libtard " counter to this is that conservatives want to demonize all choice from America until we 're living under a fundamentalist dictatorship .
A fundamentalist dictatorship without doughnuts .
UPDATE : The ALL has declared Victory in thier war on doughnuts .
The full , completely unbelievable press release follows after the jump .
The BIGGEST gay rights demonstration in the world will take place on June 28th 2009 .

( Santa Barbara , Calif . ) –– Scientists at UC Santa Barbara have discovered that a protein called BAG2 is important for understanding Alzheimer 's disease and may open up new targets for drug discovery .
They are ready to move from studying these proteins in culture to finding out how they work with mice .
In a paper published this week in the Journal of Neuroscience , the scientists describe important activities of BAG2 in cleaning up brain cells .
The protein tau is normally found in brain cells , but scientists do n't know why it clumps into tangles in people with Alzheimer 's disease .
Senior author Kenneth S. Kosik , co-director of UCSB 's Neuroscience Research Institute , and Harriman Chair in Neuroscience , has been involved in the study of neurons that develop neurofibrillary tangles , one of the hallmarks of the disease , since he was a postdoctoral fellow .
" Early on in my career , we were one of several labs to discover that tau was in the neurofibrillary tangles , " said Kosik .
Kosik 's team recently started to work on BAG2 to find out how it may be involved in the removal of tangled tau .
" It turns out that when you put this protein into the cell , it clears away the damaged tau very nicely , " said Kosik .
It does n't clear away all the tau ; it goes for the damaged tau protein and removes it .
These are images of neurons in culture .

For unknown reasons , when tau accumulates in a neurofibrillary tangle , the cell can't get rid of it .
" All cells including neurons have an elaborate , sophisticated , elegant system for disposing of proteins , " said Kosik .
" Proteins have a certain turnover ; sometimes they get damaged .
The cell has its own trash can called the proteosome , and damaged proteins are deposited there .
" We 've done this experiment many ways , " said Kosik .
" We 've discovered a bit about how BAG2 works .
We 've turned it on to remove tau .
We 've turned it off to increase tau .
We 've really done a lot of manipulations using cell culture . "
So BAG2 is a new player , a new protein that may be a good target for study in the research of Alzheimer 's disease .
" There is nothing about a drug or a treatment in any of these findings ; however , the first step in fighting any illness is finding what you want to target the drug to , " said Kosik .
" This is a protein that is involved in neurofibrillary tangles , so now we have a new target for drug discovery .
This is not a drug or a treatment , just a new target .
The new target is BAG2 . "
Kosik is looking forward to studying BAG2 in mice .
Kosik explained that we all have these proteins in our cells ; however , they can go awry .
Their levels can be off , or they may malfunction in another way .
The same normal protein can begin to malfunction .
" It may be that BAG2 is not doing its job right ; it may be that BAG2 is overwhelmed , because sometimes tau is building up , and there is not enough BAG2 there , " said Kosik .
" We cannot conclude from this that BAG2 is the fundamental problem in the disease state .
It is only a possible target that can help us find our way out of the disease . "
However , as Kosik explained , the current project started when he and his team suspected that one of the problems in Alzheimer 's disease is to find out why the cell fails to dispose of tau and degrade it .
They knew , even before starting the project , that the cell has marked the tau protein in Alzheimer 's disease for degradation .
There is a marker on the tau protein in the neurofibrillary tangles , which indicates that this is a protein that should go to the trash .
The marker is called ubiquitin .
Previously , Kosik 's team found a protein that is involved in the decision to throw away tau .
That protein is called CHIP , and Kosik 's team published information on that about four years ago .
" We knew something was going on there , " said Kosik .
" CHIP has a dual function .
It calls out to the cell and says there is a protein here that is at a critical juncture .
If the protein is salvaged , then CHIP goes off tau , and tau goes back to being a normal protein .
But if the protein cannot be salvaged because it is so badly damaged , then CHIP goes into action and marks the tau for degradation by putting on several ubiquitins , and that 's the signal to go to the trash . "

Even before a new coalition could emerge , Israel 's latest election was historic .
It marked the collapse of Labor , the party that can plausibly claim to have founded Israel and produced its most celebrated prime ministers , from David Ben-Gurion ( as head of Labor 's predecessor , Mapai ) , through Golda Meir to Yitzhak Rabin .
The last vestige of old Labor is Shimon Peres , who -- with fitting irony -- is the country 's president only because he quit the party .
Israel 's political spectrum is now dominated by three right - wing groups : Likud , Kadima ( the Likud offshoot founded by Ariel Sharon ) and Yisrael Beytenu , a party of Russian immigrants .
But while most commentators focus on the future of the peace process and the two - state solution , a deeper and more existential question is growing within the heart of Israel .
It 's a question posed by the election 's biggest winner : Avigdor Lieberman .
His Yisrael Beytenu party won 15 seats , placing third but gaining enormous swing power in the Israeli system .
Whether or not the new government includes him , Lieberman and his issues have moved to center stage .
As fiercely as he denounces the Palestinian militants of Hamas and Hizbullah , his No. 1 target is Israel 's Arab minority , which he has called a worse threat than Hamas .
He has proposed the effective expulsion of several hundred thousand Arab citizens by unilaterally redesignating some northern Israeli towns as parts of the Palestinian West Bank .
Another group of several hundred thousand could expect to be stripped of citizenship for failing to meet requirements such as loyalty oaths or mandatory military service ( from which Israel 's Arabs are currently exempt ) .
The New Republic 's Martin Peretz , a passionate Zionist and critic of the peace movement , calls Lieberman a " neo-fascist ... a certified gangster ... the Israeli equivalent of [ Austria 's ] Jörg Haider . "
No liberal democracy I know of since World War II has disenfranchised or expelled its own citizens .
Today 's Arab Israelis are descendants of roughly 160,000 Arabs who stayed in the lands that became Israel in 1948 .
Their number now stands at 1.3 million , 20 percent of Israel 's total population , and demographers predict that by 2025 they 'll be a quarter of the country 's people .
Aside from their military exemption , they have the same legal rights and obligations as all other Israeli citizens .
But they face discrimination in many aspects of life , including immigration , land ownership , education and employment .
" This inequality has been documented in a large number of professional surveys and studies , has been confirmed in court judgments and government resolutions , and has also found expression in reports by the state comptroller and in other official documents , " retired High Court justice Theodor
Or concluded in an official investigation of the second intifada .
" Although the Jewish majority 's awareness of this discrimination is often quite low , it plays a central role in the sensibilities and attitudes of Arab citizens .
This discrimination is widely accepted ... as a chief cause of agitation . "
The antipathy is mutual .
" The people who stayed here did not immigrate here , this is our country , " declared Azmi Bishara , a former Arab member of the Knesset , after being charged with sedition for his expressions of support for Hizbullah .
" That is why you cannot deal with us on issues of loyalty .
This state came here and was enforced on the ruins of my nation .
I accepted citizenship to be able to live here , and I will not do anything , security - wise , against the state .
I am not going to conspire against the state , but you cannot ask me every day if I am loyal to the state .
Citizenship demands from me to be loyal to the law , but not to the values or ideologies of the state .
It is enough to be loyal to the law . "
For decades Israel 's Arabs remained loyal to the law - - and loyal to the country during its many wars with its neighbors .
Now that loyalty is waning .
Israeli Arabs -- even those who are Christian , rather than Muslim - - no longer vote for Israel 's mainstream parties .
Despite low turnout , the Arab parties fared well in this election , winning some 11 seats in the Knesset .
The Arab parties have never been invited into the government , which limits the influence of the Arab population in Israeli politics .
For Israel , handling the relationship with its Arab minority is more crucial even than dealing with Hizbullah or Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Israel needs to decide how it will deal with the Arabs in its midst .
As extreme as it may sound , Lieberman 's call to disown them seems to have resonated with many of his fellow Israelis .
Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that Israel 's Arabs constitute a demographic time bomb .
He calls it unacceptable .
Benny Morris , the once dovish historian who chronicled the forced expulsion of most Palestinians from the Jewish state in 1948 , has turned to arguing that Israel needs to protect itself from the Arabs now living within its borders .
" They are a potential fifth column , " he warned five years ago in an interview with Haaretz .
" In both demographic and security terms they are liable to undermine the state ...
If the threat to Israel is existential , expulsion will be justified . "
It 's a dangerous spiral : the worse the distrust gets , the less loyalty Israel 's Arabs feel toward their country -- and vice versa .
Last week 's election has brought the issue into the open .
Its resolution will define the future of Israel as a country , as a Jewish state , and as a democracy .
As the Obama administration pushes through Congress its $ 800 billion deficit - spending economic stimulus plan , the American public is largely unaware that the true deficit of the federal government already is measured in trillions of dollars , and in fact its $ 65.5 trillion in total obligations exceeds the gross domestic product of the world .
The total U.S. obligations , including Social Security and Medicare benefits to be paid in the future , effectively have placed the U.S. government in bankruptcy , even before new continuing social welfare obligation embedded in the massive spending plan are taken into account .
The real 2008 federal budget deficit was $ 5.1 trillion , not the $ 455 billion previously reported by the Congressional Budget Office , according to the " 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government " as released by the U.S. Department of Treasury .
The difference between the $ 455 billion " official " budget deficit numbers and the $ 5.1 trillion budget deficit cited by " 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government " is that the official budget deficit is calculated on a cash basis , where all tax receipts , including Social Security tax receipts , are used to pay government liabilities as they occur .
TRENDING : Alleged attacker behind carnage at pro-Trump event linked to ' Caravan 4 Justice ' group
But the numbers in the 2008 report are calculated on a GAAP basis ( " Generally Accepted Accounting Practices " ) that include year - for - year changes in the net present value of unfunded liabilities in social insurance programs such as Social Security and Medicare .
Under cash accounting , the government makes no provision for future Social Security and Medicare benefits in the year in which those benefits accrue .
" As bad as 2008 was , the $ 455 billion budget deficit on a cash basis and the $ 5.1 trillion federal budget deficit on a GAAP accounting basis does not reflect any significant money [ from ] the financial bailout or Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , which was approved after the close of the fiscal year , " economist John Williams , who publishes the Internet website Shadow Government Statistics , told WND .
Find out what 's behind the chaos at the White House , in the No. 1 best - seller " Obama Nation "
" The Congressional Budget Office estimated the fiscal year 2009 budget deficit as being $ 1.2 trillion on a cash basis and that was before taking into consideration the full costs of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan , before the cost of the Obama nearly $ 800 billion economic stimulus plan , or the cost of the second $ 350 billion in TARP funds , as well as all current bailouts being contemplated by the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve , " he said .
" The federal government 's deficit is hemorrhaging at a pace which threatens the viability of the financial system , " Williams added .
" The popularly reported 2009 [ deficit ] will clearly exceed $ 2 trillion on a cash basis and that full amount has to be funded by Treasury borrowing .
" It 's not likely this will happen without the Federal Reserve acting as lender of last resort for the Treasury by buying Treasury debt and monetizing the debt , " he said .
" Monetizing the debt " is a term used to signify that the Federal Reserve will be required simply to print cash to meet the Treasury debt obligations , acting in this capacity only because the Treasury cannot sell the huge of amount debt elsewhere .
The Treasury has been largely dependent upon foreign buyers , principally China and Japan and other major holders of U.S. dollar foreign exchange reserves , including OPEC buyers purchasing U.S. debt through London .
RELATED : Soros swoops in , takes another bank
" The appetite of foreign buyers to purchase continued trillions of U.S. debt has become more questionable as the world has witnessed the rapid deterioration of the U.S. fiscal condition in the current financial crisis , " Williams noted .
" Truthfully , " Williams pointed out , " there is no Social Security ' lock - box . '
There are no funds held in reserve today for Social Security and Medicare obligations that are earned each year .
It 's only a matter of time until the public realizes that the government is truly bankrupt and no taxes are being held in reserve to pay in the future the Social Security and Medicare benefits taxpayers are earning today . "
Calculations from the " 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government " also show that the GAAP negative net worth of the federal government has increased to $ 59.3 trillion while the total federal obligations under GAAP accounting now total $ 65.5 trillion .
The $ 65.5 trillion total federal obligations under GAAP accounting not only now exceed four times the U.S. gross domestic product , or GDP , the $ 65.5 trillion deficit exceeds total world GDP .
" In the seven years of GAAP reporting , we have seen an annual average deficit in excess of $ 4 trillion , which could not be possibly covered by any form of taxation , " Williams argued .
" Shy of the government severely slashing social welfare programs , federal deficits of this magnitude are beyond any hope of containment , government or otherwise , " he said .
" Put simply , there is no way the government can possibly pay for the level of social welfare benefits the federal government has promised unless the government simply prints cash and debases the currency , which the government will increasingly be doing this year , " Williams said , explaining in more detail why he feels the government is now in the process of monetizing the federal debt .
" Social Security and Medicare must be shown as liabilities on the federal balance sheet in the year they accrue according to GAAP accounting , " Williams argues .
" To do otherwise is irresponsible , nothing more than an attempt to hide the painful truth from the American public .
The public has a right to know just how bad off the federal government budget deficit situation really is , especially since the situation is rapidly spinning out of control .
" The federal government is bankrupt , " Williams told WND .
" In a post - Enron world , if the federal government were a corporation such as General Motors , the president and senior Treasury officers would be in federal penitentiary . "

G. W. Bush a mis en accusation le Hamas , omettant de parler du Blocus …
Après 60 ans d’occupation avec le plus sombre colonialisme que connaît l’humanité depuis que les expéditions d’occupation existent , consistant à la spoliation du peuple palestinien de sa Terre , le monde regarde encore ce conflit à travers le monde arabe .
Ce dernier décrié , par ses complicités aussi , est loin de toute idée de démocratie , même spécifique à sa culture qu’il croit en posséder les clés de l’adapter à la modernité contemporaine .
Cette offensive de Tsahal prétendument pour arrêter les jets d’artisanales roquettes du mouvement islamiste devenu , par l’intuition des comploteurs , à la pointe du nationalisme indépendantiste palestinien vient de la misère causée par le Blocus .
L’adhésion de la population vivant un éternel joug , était aussi bien prévisible que désirée .
L’opportunité criminel pour Tsahal des absences …
Dans un contexte de vacance généralisée marquée par : le nouveau président des USA ne prend ses fonctions que le 20 janvier et hérite d’une économie qui l’oblige à s’occuper plus de la ruine du capitalisme que des autres bouts du monde .
Le mandat de Mahmoud Abbas a pris fin officiellement le 8 janvier , de ce côté le Hamas compte bien se substituer au « Harkisme » ( de harki ) du dirigeant impuissant et roulé dans la farine par les ennemis de l’existence d’Etat palestinien dont il rêve .
Les préparatifs des élections en Israël ne rassurent guère l’opinion mondiale de l’option de paix .
Dans ce dernier cas , celui qui tuera le plus de palestiniens gouvernera l’Etat hébreu .
Le ministre de défense israélien , parmi les plus redoutés faucons des va-t - en - guerres , dirigeant du Likoud ne cesse de monter dans les sondages .
L’interdiction des journalistes à entrer à Gaza reste l’une des manœuvres pour que les crimes restent impunies .
Plus de 30 % des victimes de cette opération dite « Plomb dure » sont des enfants , sans les humanitaires , y compris ceux du terrain , n’arrivent à se faire entendre .
L’ONU est carrément mise en échec .
Le président de l’assemblée général a été même menacé de mort .
Mais d’autres acteurs manquent encore .
Tony Blair , l’ancien Premier ministre britannique et actuel représentant du Quartette ( Etats - Unis , Russie , ONU et Union européenne ) pour le Moyen - Orient brille par son absence .
Il est en vacances croit - on auprès de ceux que cette taraude .
Il avait loué un bureau sur tout le quatrième étage de l’hôtel , au nom évocateur , « American Colony » depuis plus d’un an et demi .
Il reste invisible et ses collaborateurs parlent d’un travail en coulisses .
Hundreds of Palestinian Christians at the southern West Bank town of Biet Sahour near Bethlehem marked Holy Saturday .
The festivities started as scout bands played music and marched throughout the streets of Biet Sahour .
People of the town waited for the light to come from the church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem .
Today Israel deployed thousands of police officers in the Jerusalem ’s old city and around it .
Police allowed only limited number of people to the church of the Holy Sepulcher casting a shadow over the festivities in Jerusalem .
By early afternoon hours the light arrived from Jerusalem to the town of Beit Sahour .
Palestinian Prime Minster Salam Fayyad joined the town residents as they headed with the light to the local Greek Orthodox Church .
At the church , a number of speeches were made by local community leaders , the Mayor of Beit Sahour , Hanni Al Hayik and Father Issa Muslih .
Father Muslih in his speech reaffirmed the right of Palestinians , Christians and Muslims , in Jerusalem .
Tonight the local churches will mark the Easter Midnight mass .
Biet Sahour town is dominated by Palestinian Christians .
As Palestinian Christians numbers are deteriorating as result of immigration , the town of Biet Sahour is one of the few Christian majority towns left in the West Bank .
Commentators mainly blame the Israeli occupation for high immigration percentages in the Palestinian territories .

Being both a skeptic and a physician I have focused a great deal of my skeptical efforts towards science and medicine .
While I endeavor to be a full - service skeptic , pseudoscience in medicine is definitely my specialty .
It is therefore especially painful for me to admit that in this arena , more than any other , we are getting our butts kicked .
We are almost at the point of being routed , with the defenders of scientific medicine being relegated to the role of insurgency .
How did this happen ?
What is Alternative Medicine ?
I think the biggest victory scored by the promoters of complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) was the name itself .
Fifty years ago what passes today as CAM was snake oil , fraud , folk medicine , and quackery .
The promoters of dubious health claims were charlatans , quacks , and con artists .
Somehow they managed to pull off the greatest con of all – a culture change in which fraud became a legitimate alternative to scientific medicine , the line between science and pseudoscience was deliberate blurred , regulations designed to protect the public from quackery were weakened or eliminated , and it became politically incorrect to defend scientific standards in medicine .
The goal of CAM proponents is nothing less than the elimination of the standard of care in medicine in exchange for an anything goes approach .
Key to their strategy was the language game – getting people to talk about fraud and pseudoscience in medicine as if it were a legitimate “ alternative ” , that pseudoscience can “ complement ” science or be “ integrated ” with it .
Scientific medicine was rebranded with derogatory labels such as “ Western ” and “ allopathic . ”
Anyone defending the scientific standard of medicine was attacked as closed - minded , and accused of protectionism .
The very fact that there is a category of medicine such as CAM , whatever you call it , is a significant defeat for scientific medicine .
CAM as a category includes an extremely diverse collection of claims and modalities that do not share a common theme or philosophy , including some that are mutually exclusive .
The only thing they have in common is that they do not meet the scientific standards of mainstream medicine .
The only purpose of the CAM category is to create a space in which substandard or unscientific modalities can exist .
It exists to create a double standard .
A Perfect Storm of Anti-Science
Wallace Sampson , writing for Science - Based Medicine , gives an excellent overview of the last forty years of medicine and what went wrong .
He points to several cultural trends that conspired together to allow the anti-scientific revolution to occur .
These include political correctness – which has had the effect of rendering appropriate scientific criticism as impolite .
The post - modernist influence in academia also played a major role , one aspect of which is the portrayal of science as just another narrative without any special relationship to the truth .
In fact science , according to some post - modernists , is just a way for one group ( in this case Western white males ) to impose their power over minorities and the oppressed .
Add to this a general anti-establishment movement beginning in the 1960s .
CAM proponents were successful in portraying scientific medicine as the Establishment – something that needed to be taken down .
This evolved into the “ health care freedom ” movement , the ostensible purpose of which was to earn freedom for the public to access whatever health care they wanted .
In reality the health care freedom movement is about earning freedom for practitioners to do whatever they want , free from any regulation meant to protect the public .
I find it one of the greatest ironies of the CAM phenomenon that they have been able to pass laws that are overtly anti-consumer , in that they remove protection from fraud or incompetence , in the name of consumer freedom .
Why has n’t Ralph Nader noticed this ?
What if the auto industry promoted “ automobile freedom ” laws so that consumers could buy any vehicles they wanted , free from any government quality or safety regulation ?
This brings up the political dimension of CAM .
Proponents have been successful at working both sides of the aisle , appealing to anti-regulation sentiment on the right and anti-corporate / anti-establishment sentiment on the left .
Unfortunately , science has no political party .
And of course all of this is happening in a generally scientifically illiterate society .
In my experience most of the public does not understand why homeopathy cannot possibly work ( it ’s just water ) , why scientists are confident that there is no mysterious life force at work in the body , why chiropractic subluxations make no sense , and why megadosing vitamins or the latest fad tropical fruit juice cannot cure everything .
And yes , of course , there are legitimate criticisms of mainstream medicine .
The system is under great financial strain .
Technology , while extremely effective , is very expensive and may render some medical encounters very unpleasant and frightening .
The ethical model in medicine has also shifted from a paternalistic model , where doctors just did what they thought was best , to a cooperative model that focuses on informed consent .
This is a good thing , but it means that physicians are ethically obliged to tell patients the whole and unpleasant truth .
We do not have the luxury of lying to patients to make them feel better .
Charlatans have no such constraints .
Tactical Defeats
The specific tactical defeats of scientific medicine include , first and foremost , the cultural non-judgmental acceptance of an “ alternative ” category of medicine .
But in addition to this , there is the NCCAM ( National Center for CAM ) , which was created specifically to fund CAM research .
These funds , however , are generally spent doing studies designed to promote CAM , not answer the only question that really matters – does it safely work .
More than a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars later , there has not been a single CAM modality that has been proven by research to the point that is has gained general acceptance , nor has any modality been rejected as disproven .
Sorting what works from what does not work is the primary purpose of medical research , so in that regard the NCCAM is an unmitigated failure .
But , it has lent incredible legitimacy to CAM .
Healthcare freedom laws have been passed in almost 20 states – eliminating the ability of states to act against practitioners simply because what they are doing is substandard ( as long as they self - label what they do “ alternative ” ) .
That ’s right – eliminating the standard of care .
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 removed “ supplements ” from the control of the FDA , and redefined supplements to include herbs used as drugs , and pretty much anything else that is not already a drug .
It also created a separate category of health claims , so - called structure function claims , that are beyond regulation .
This led to an explosion of the supplement industry .
This allows snake oil peddlers to decry the excesses of the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry , while making billions in the largely unregulated supplement industry .
To further increase the irony , in many cases the two industries are one and the same .
A reasonable person might think that medical academia would be the last line of defense for scientific medicine .
Surely trained medical scientists can see anti-scientific propaganda for what it is and will defend the scientific integrity of their profession .
Unfortunately , this is largely not the case .
Academics have been cowed by calls for “ freedom ” and political correctness .
Promoters have learned to speak the language of academics to further subdue their skepticism – using pleasant terms like “ holistic ” , and “ patient - centered ” practice .
Like most deceptions , there is always a kernel of truth to such ideas .
But in the end it all amounts to a sweet - sounding justification for outright pseudoscientific quackery in medicine .
This happens , however , because the academics who should know better are largely asleep at the switch .
They have mostly put CAM into the hands of proponents , because they are the ones who are interested .
Most physicians and scientists are “ shruggies ” when it comes to CAM – they just do n’t think about it and do n’t want to think about it .
So proponents have been able to become the gatekeepers of their own claims .
CAM proponents are appointed to committees on CAM , are able to make CAM curricula for students , and decide what CAM journals should be registered with the International Library of Medicine ( which means they can keep out critics ) .
The foxes are in charge of the hen house .
What this also means is that those few of us who are trying to point out that the Emperor has no clothes ( to use a tired metaphor ) , and defend science - based medicine are made to seem like ideological , closed - minded fanatics .
Defending science in medicine is no longer politically correct – at least not within the alternate reality of CAM .
Evidence - Based Medicine
More irony .
Over the last couple of decades there has been a growing movement within mainstream medicine called evidence - based medicine ( EBM ) .
One might think that EBM would have worked to retard the advance of CAM but the opposite was true .
It is an unfortunate happenstance of history that the minds behind EBM inadvertently played into the hands of CAM proponents .
The concept behind EBM is that medical modalities should be judged primarily by the empirical evidence , not by their plausibility .
The reason for this was the perception that too many practices were being widely used because they made sense – they were plausible – despite a lack of evidence that they actually worked .
Therefore EBM was constructed to eliminate the advantage of plausibility .
Medical claims require evidence no matter how plausible they are .
But by eliminating plausibility ( or prior probability ) from consideration EBM also leveled the field for highly implausible claims , even though this was never the intent .
EBM is not unreasonable in a world where it is assumed that treatments and claims make basic scientific sense , but it is not equipped to deal with a world in which highly implausible claims are being promoted .
This had the effect of almost eliminating basic science from consideration .
Under EBM claims that are highly implausible are treated the same as claims that are highly plausible .
This approach exists no where else in science .
Therefore , CAM proponents just adopted the language of EBM .
It did not take long for CAM modalities to have the EBM label slapped on them , whether or not they earned it even by the flawed methods of EBM .
I see “ evidence - based homeopathy ” or “ evidence - based acupuncture ” promoted all the time , even though these terms are oxymorons .
Even without consideration of prior plausibility CAM modalities do not fair well under EBM examination , so proponents simply lie .
They claim their methods are EBM even when no formal EBM evaluation has validated them .
They behave as if their personal assessment of the evidence is sufficient to support a claim of EBM , when in fact there are formal methods of systematic review that are required .
But the EBM infrastructure is vulnerable .
They already fail to put CAM modalities in their proper scientific perspective by considering prior probability .
And now they too are putting the foxes in charge of the hen house – allowing CAM proponents to perform and publish biased EBM reviews .
A Ray of Hope
I recently wrote about the National Health Statistics on use of CAM by Americans .
The stats have been misrepresented by proponents to argue that CAM is increasingly popular , followed by the argument ad populi that therefore they should be supported .
A closer look at the data , however , shows that the hard - core CAM modalities are still marginal , and not significantly increasing .
In the last year only 1.4 % of Americans used acupuncture , 1.7 % homeopathy , and 0.5 % energy healing ( by self report ) .
These numbers are not significantly different than 20 years ago .
Use of these modalities remains marginal .
I am not sure exactly how to interpret this .
The best - case interpretation is that most of the public still regards the magical claims of homeopathy and acupuncture with skepticism .
The most pessimistic interpretation is that the public accepts these modalities in greater numbers , but the infrastructure has not yet expanded to meet demand .
I also find some comfort in the fact that most of my colleagues have not drunk the Koolaid of CAM .
They regard it as quackery – and yet frustratingly think it ’s not their responsibility to do anything about it .
But perhaps there is a growing backlash against the nonsense .
I think as CAM ’s profile increases , the sham at its core is more apparent .
Maybe .
Conclusion
The situation is grim .
A generation of health care providers is being indoctrinated into unscientific acceptance of dubious claims and methods .
The public has largely bought the framework of CAM .
Even among skeptics I find that CAM is a frequent blind spot .
The propaganda has simply been extremely effective .
Most disheartening is that academia has largely failed to recognize and confront this attack on science .
They now understand well the threat of creationism / intelligent design .
They get it .
They do not understand how CAM erodes the scientific basis of medicine and the standard of care .
Those of us who are opposing the infiltration of pseudoscience into medicine have an uphill battle , and no apparent allies .
We have been marginalized .
We are also a couple of steps behind the CAM proponents in understanding how the language and the laws are being manipulated .
We ’re catching on , but we are already far behind .
The situation is not hopeless , but it is desperate .
I think in the long run science always has the advantage that it actually works .
But history has shown us that cultural inertia can be immense .
As CAM becomes infused in the culture and in the institutions of health care it is becoming entrenched and will be difficult to remove .
It will likely continue to be a drain 0n the effectiveness and efficiency of health care for decades to come .

Aasiya Hassan had recently filed for divorce , alleging domestic violence
The founder of a US Muslim TV network has been charged over the beheading of his wife , media reports say .
Muzzammil Hassan , 44 , is accused of second degree murder of Aasiya Hassan , whose body was found last week at the TV station in New York state .
Both Mr Hassan and his wife worked at Bridges TV , a station aimed at countering stereotypes of Muslims .
Authorities said Mrs Hassan , 37 , had recently filed for divorce .
The couple had two children , aged four and six .
Bridges TV , a satellite - distributed news and opinion channel , was founded by Mr Hassan in 2004 and was based in a suburb in Buffalo , in upstate New York .
Mrs Hassan had filed for divorce after enduring previous incidents of domestic violence , her lawyer told the Buffalo News .
In a statement on its website , Bridges TV said it was " deeply shocked and saddened by the murder of Aasiya ( Zubair ) Hassan and subsequent arrest of Muzzammil Hassan " .
A family court hearing was due to address the future of the couple 's two children .
Their grandparents have travelled from Texas and Pakistan to attend the hearing , John Tregilio , a lawyer for the children , told the Buffalo News .
Mr Hassan also has two other children , aged 17 and 18 , from a previous marriage , according to reports .
Drunken drivers in Wisconsin are not charged with a felony until they have been arrested a fifth time .
Wisconsin law prohibits sobriety checks by the police , a common practice in other states .
“ People are dying , ” the newspaper exclaimed in an editorial , “ and alcohol is the cause . ”
Wisconsin has long been famous for making and drinking beer .
Going back to the 1800s , almost every town in the state had its own brewery .
Milwaukee was the home of Miller , Pabst and Schlitz .
Now Miller is the only big brewery in the city .

Most people in Wisconsin say the beer - drinking traditions reflect the customs of German immigrants , passed down generations .
More than 40 percent of Wisconsin residents can trace their ancestry to Germany .
Some experts , though , are skeptical of the ethnic explanation .
It has been a very long time , after all , since German was spoken in the beer halls of Wisconsin .
Whatever the reason , plenty of Wisconsin people say they need to make no apologies for their fondness for drinking .
“ I work 70 , 80 hours a week , and sometimes I just want to relax , ” said Luke Gersich , 31 , an engineering technician , who drank a Miller as he watched the Monday Night Football game at Wile - e ’s tavern .
On a weeknight , he said he might drink seven or eight beers .
On a weekend , it might be closer to 12 .
In Wisconsin , people often say , there is always a bar around the next corner .
But drinking is scarcely limited to taverns .
A Friday fish fry at a Wisconsin church will almost surely include beer .
The state counts some 5,000 holders of liquor licenses , the most per capita of any state , said Peter Madland , the executive director of the Tavern League of Wisconsin .
In the Loop , the big - screen companion piece to the acclaimed The Thick of It , explores the process by which Iraq invasion was sold to the public on both sides of the Atlantic
While the rest of America wakes up to the first full day of an Obama presidency , the Sundance film festival appears to be still haunted by the ghosts of the last administration .
Armando Iannucci's
In the Loop , an acid satire that spotlights the run-up to the 2003 war on Iraq , premiered in Park City yesterday to glowing reviews .
In the Loop is the big - screen companion piece to Iannucci 's acclaimed BBC series The Thick of It .
The film widens its focus beyond the confines of Whitehall to explores how the Iraq invasion was sold to the public on both sides of the Atlantic .
It stars Tom Hollander as a diffident , gaffe - prone British minister who is packed off to Washington DC , where he becomes a pawn in the political opposition to the war .
Peter Capaldi reprises his TV role as Malcolm Tucker , a splenetic , combative director of communications who may be loosely based on Alastair Campbell .
Sopranos star James Gandolfini takes a pivotal supporting role as a sceptical US general .
Reviewers at Sundance have hailed the film as a breath of fresh air : a sharp , quick - witted political farce that blends aspects of Yes Minister , The Office and such vintage British comedies as Our Man in Havana .
The Times , in a five - star writeup , claimed that " this stark , foul - mouthed black comedy is an artfully written skit that combines pin-sharp characterisation with brutally effective one - liners " , and described it as " a classic British comedy reminiscent of the very best of old Ealing " .
Trade magazine Variety commented that " intelligent political satire this expertly acted is nothing to sneeze at " .
Elsewhere , however , Screen International struck a note of caution , admitting that In the Loop was likely to play well in the UK but suggesting that American audiences might now want to put the film 's subject matter behind them .
" US fans of The Office could rally for this one , " it admitted , " although its exuberant , boundless cynicism will test the demand for political satire in an Obama - infatuated America . "
They could n’t guess what was in the potion , but then , they did n’t have the benefit of Dr. Young ’s research with prairie voles at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University .
These mouselike creatures are among the small minority of mammals  less than 5 percent  who share humans ’ propensity for monogamy .
When a female prairie vole ’s brain is artificially infused with oxytocin , a hormone that produces some of the same neural rewards as nicotine and cocaine , she ’ll quickly become attached to the nearest male .
A related hormone , vasopressin , creates urges for bonding and nesting when it is injected in male voles ( or naturally activated by sex ) .
After Dr. Young found that male voles with a genetically limited vasopressin response were less likely to find mates , Swedish researchers reported that men with a similar genetic tendency were less likely to get married .
In his Nature essay , Dr. Young speculates that human love is set off by a “ biochemical chain of events ” that originally evolved in ancient brain circuits involving mother - child bonding , which is stimulated in mammals by the release of oxytocin during labor , delivery and nursing .
“ Some of our sexuality has evolved to stimulate that same oxytocin system to create female - male bonds , ” Dr. Young said , noting that sexual foreplay and intercourse stimulate the same parts of a woman ’s body that are involved in giving birth and nursing .
This hormonal hypothesis , which is by no means proven fact , would help explain a couple of differences between humans and less monogamous mammals : females ’ desire to have sex even when they are not fertile , and males ’ erotic fascination with breasts .
More frequent sex and more attention to breasts , Dr. Young said , could help build long - term bonds through a “ cocktail of ancient neuropeptides , ” like the oxytocin released during foreplay or orgasm .
Researchers have achieved similar results by squirting oxytocin into people ’s nostrils  not terribly sexy , but it seems to enhance feelings of trust and empathy .
Although Dr. Young is not concocting any love potions ( he ’s looking for drugs to improve the social skills of people with autism and schizophrenia ) , he said there could soon be drugs that increase people ’s urge to fall in love .
“ It would be completely unethical to give the drug to someone else , ” he said , “ but if you ’re in a marriage and want to maintain that relationship , you might take a little booster shot yourself every now and then .
Even now it ’s not such a far - out possibility that you could use drugs in conjunction with marital therapy . ”
I see some potential here , but also big problems .
Suppose you took that potion and then suddenly felt an urge to run off with the next person you spent any time with , like your dentist ?
What if you went to a business convention and then , like an artificially stimulated prairie vole , bonded with the nearest stranger ?
What if , like Tristan , you developed an overwhelming emotional connection to your boss ’s spouse ?
The Nikon D700
Tech ARP may have started out as a PC technology website , but we enjoy digital photography as well .
Of course , photography have always been an intrinsic part of our work process , but it is more than just a tool for us .
It 's a hobby .
That 's why we wrote several articles on digital photography ( see insert on the right ) and maintained a dedicated Digital Photography section in the Tech ARP forums .
Recently , our lichest ( that 's rich and 1337 in Tech ARP speak ! ) team member , Chai , bought himself the Nikon D700 , which retails at about US $ 2,500 and that 's just for the body , no lens included !
Now you know why he's the lichest member in Team ARP !
As crazy as it sounds , anyone into digital photography can tell you that the Nikon D700 is actually the cheapest DSLR body from Nikon that comes with a full - frame sensor , or an FX - sized sensor in Nikon parlance .
It is this large and expensive sensor that puts the Nikon D700 out of reach of all by the most avid ( and rich ! ) photographers .
Although Nikon D700 is an excellent camera , it has its drawbacks which may deter potential buyers .
First of all , there 's the high cost .
Since it comes with a full - frame sensor , do n't expect the D700 to become truly affordable anytime soon .
In addition , some sports photographers might not appreciate the ' wider ' prespective because they will need lens with a longer zoom to get the same reach as that of cameras using the smaller DX sensors , and that means investing in more expensive telephoto lenses .
Of course , the converse is also true .
Those who enjoy photographing sceneries and architecture will love the wider angle afforded by the full - frame sensor .
With that said , the Nikon D700 is more or less a Nikon D300 with a full - frame sensor .
So , unless you need a wider angle , much better performance at insanely high ISO levels , a slightly better dynamic range , a bigger viewfinder , the Nikon D300 may be more up your alley .

INTERNAL SEGA COMMUNICATIONS - SOUL CALIBUR PANTS -COLOUR CHEAT CONFUSION MADE GOOD [ UK:R ]
A software distributor faces nine months in jail for selling ' grey ' imported copies of Microsoft software .
Sales firm ITAC 's founder Barry Omesuh must pay £ 2.5 million in damages to the software giant .
Omesuh was found guilty by the High Court of disobeying earlier Court orders about his behaviour and concealing his assets from the Court .
Microsoft said that it had obtained a judgment against Omesuh because he infringed its rights by engaging in parallel importing .
This is the importing and selling in one region software intended for another region .
Software makers and other businesses based on licensing , such as music labels , issue licences for their products ' sale only in certain territories .
Products are often priced more cheaply in some parts of the world than others .
Anyone who knowingly imports and sells goods in contravention of those licences is breaking the licence terms , and that can amount to copyright infringement and trade mark infringement .
Microsoft said that it first took action against ITAC in 2004 , and that that case concluded in 2006 with the court ordering it to pay Microsoft £ 1 million and stop its grey import activity .
It said that Omesuh was found liable for infringing its intellectual property again in 2008 .
It was given court orders freezing Omesuh 's assets and ordering him to tell the company where his assets were but he broke those orders , the company said .
Last year Microsoft hired a private detective to keep Omesuh under surveillance , according to court papers .
That private detective said he overheard Omesuh on the phone arranging to transfer money overseas and to go to Africa .
It was that which prompted further legal action .
The High Court found that Omesuh had breached a number of court orders and had concealed his assets to prevent them being taken from him .
" There has been deliberate and active concealment and attempts to prevent , or , failing that , delay discovery [ of Omesuh 's assets ] , " said Mrs Justice Proudman in the ruling .
" His disregard of the Court 's authority is thus very serious indeed .
There is every reason to suppose that even now the defendant has not made full disclosure . "
" Microsoft has obtained a judgment of £ 2.5 million in damages against Mr Omesuh for his latest infringements , and will be implementing an earlier Court Order entitling it to sell Mr Omesuh ’s properties in order to partly discharge his debts to Microsoft , " said a company statement .
" Mr Omesuh was also found in contempt of court for breaching Court Orders issued in March 2008 .
Mr Omesuh was given a total of seven custodial sentences at the Royal Courts of Justice in London , ranging in duration between one and nine months , all of which are to be served concurrently , " it said .
" We want to make sure that retailers caught cheating the system are held accountable for their damaging actions , " said Graham Arthur , anti-piracy attorney at Microsoft UK .
" We caught ITAC trading illegally more than once which shows how determined we are to protect genuine , honest businesses from being undercut by unscrupulous traders . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday denied a bid by the cable industry to overrule privacy rules that make it more difficult for them to share subscribers ’ personal information with other parties .
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied a petition by the National Cable and Telecommunications Association , which argued that federal rules on telecom carriers ’ use of customer data violated free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution , federal law or both .
At issue are rules set by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission that mandate telecommunications carriers must get an “ opt - in ” before disclosing customers ’ information to a carrier ’s joint venture business partner or an independent contractor .
The FCC “ gave sufficient reasons for singling out the relationships between carriers and third - party marketing partners , ” the court said in denying the petition for judicial review sought by the NCTA .
The cable group ’s spokesman , Brian Dietz , said it is disappointed with the ruling , but could not comment on whether the group would appeal .
FCC Acting Chairman Michael Copps said the rules are needed to protect consumers .
“ Telephone carriers today handle vast amounts of their customers ’ personal information , and in light of documented abuses of consumers ’ privacy , the Commission appropriately required carriers to institute additional safeguards to protect customers ’ personal information , ” Copps said in a statement .
The cable trade group ’s members sell local phone service using voice over Internet protocol ( VoIP ) technology .
Cable companies have about 18 million phone subscribers nationally , according to NCTA .
Verizon Communications < VZ.N , one of the biggest telephone and mobile phone companies , had backed the cable industry ’s petition .
Christian Bale 's on - set meltdown , in which he tore a Terminator Salvation cinematographer a new one , catapulted the volatile actor into rare company with other celebrities who managed to make absolute jackasses of themselves while the recorders were rolling .
" I want you off the fucking set , you prick , " Bale said in the vitriolic outburst that 's turned into a viral sensation .
" No , do n't just be sorry – think for one fucking second . "
A totally NSFW audio clip ( .mp3 ) of Bale 's F - bombing tirade , which took place in July , surfaced on TMZ earlier this week , touching off a fireworks display of online dance remixes like RevoLucian 's " Bale Out " ( embedded above ) .
Parodies , in which Bale takes on craft services and other easy targets , a Christian Bale Soundboard and the inevitable T - shirt quickly followed .
The sweeping online attention guarantees Bale a spot among the all - time great unhinged celebrity screamers , as chronicled in this list of the top 10 celebrity rants caught on tape .
Some are subtle , some are shocking : Bale 's now - legendary outburst gives us a great opportunity to revisit a few evergreen entries that caught fire before the internet even existed .
( Editor 's note : Nearly all these clips are NSFW . )
1 ) Orson Welles and his frozen peas :
It could n't have been easy to go from Citizen Kane to ads for cheap wine and bagged vegetables , and Welles ' bitterness shows in this classic outtake from a vegetable commercial .
The portly actor 's diva-esque behavior formed the basis for John Candy 's hilarious impression on SCTV .
2) Michael " Kramer " Richards ends his career : Perhaps the former Seinfeld actor 's racist onstage ravings should be disqualified because this list is for " celebrities , " but how often do you get a chance to see a man truly lose his mind and his means to make a living all at once ?
3 ) Buddy Rich drum - beats his band : Better known in many circles for his obnoxious , foul - mouthed assault on his band than for his breakthrough jazz drumming , Rich was – by many accounts – a real jerk .
In this audio recording , Rich shifts from general anti-Semitism to personal assaults with the same ease and accuracy he displayed flowing from snare to high hat .
" How dare you call yourselves professional ? "
Rich raves .
" Assholes are playing like fucking children up there . "
4 ) William Shatner sabotages a session :
By many accounts , Star Trek 's Shatner is a good guy .
However , step between him and his work or get too nit-picky with directions , and he can " sabotage " the production – as one simpering audio director found out .
5 ) Casey Kasem frowns on dead puppies : Yes , the " America 's Top 40 " host and voice of Shaggy went over the top chewing out his radio producers in this clip .
But he has a point .
Was this the best place to put a dead dog story ?
Indeed , is there ever a play to put a deceased puppy carcass in what 's supposed to be an entertaining radio show ?
6 ) Elvis Presley is not strung out : Elvis insisted he was never " strung out " on heroin , and he wanted the world to know it back in 1974 .
He did n't say whether he was potentially strung out on every prescription medication known to humankind .
At least The King was polite enough to end even this cussword - strewn speech with the traditional , " Thank you very much . "
7 ) Bill O'Reilly wants to do it live :
It 's hard to tell if the Fox News pundit is freaking out in this infamous Current Edition clip , or if that 's just the way he is most of the time .
This footage was one of the first rants to get the YouTube remix treatment .
8 ) Alec Baldwin sends a hateful message : The Team America : World Police star gets extra credit for spitting animosity all over his own daughter in this voicemail message , in which he calls her a " thoughtless little pig . "
He 's winning awards on TV these days , but when it comes to child care , we agree with Kim Jong -il .
9 ) David O. Russell " collaborates " with Lily Tomlin : Directors are responsible for controlling the set – creating an efficient and professional atmosphere where on - screen and behind - the - scenes talent can work in unison .
( It 's the precise atmosphere Terminator Salvation 's helmer , McG , failed to oversee . )
I Heart Huckabees director Russell shows how not to do it when he tussles with Tomlin .
10 ) Lee Elia tears down Cub fans :
No , former Chicago Cubs manager Elia is no longer considered a celebrity , but his diatribe about drunken , idiotic fans is too rich to ignore .

Every couple of years I find myself replaying Final Fantasy IV .
Part of the reason is a steady stream of remakes coupled with a bit of nostalgia , but an even bigger part is that FF IV is actually a really good game .
Like many RPGs , FF IV is an abstraction of a fantasy world .
Its planet is peppered with just a few notable locations , and each of its kingdoms comprises only a handful of houses .
Beyond these somewhat awkward limitations , though , the setting is structured in a very interesting way .
The feudal world is pretty standard , but it ’s also infused with numerous traces of human religion and mythology .
The summoned monsters include deities from Norse , Greek , Hindu and Arabic legends , and there ’s even a couple of weapons made famous for being wielded by Arthurian and Japanese heroes .
None of these elements are logically tied together , but they represent iconic touchstones of many cultures , ensuring that most people who play FF IV will find aspects of it that are familiar yet mysterious .
The game ’s own original mythos also revolve around crystals and the moon , both of which contain a plethora of mystical associations .
While all these elements might not make for the most original setting , they do create an aura of magic and intrigue that ’s more universal than the series ’ later focus on hyper stylized aspects of Japanese pop culture .
FF IV ’s world does not change based on the player ’s choices , but its storyline fuels numerous large - scale events : Leviathan attacks and sinks a ship , dwarf tanks battle an invading force , the Giant of Babel wrecks havoc on the planet ’s surface , etc .
A further sense of life is added to the overworld through various modes of transportation : yellow and black chocobos , the hovercraft , and three different types of airships .
On a smaller - scale , the towns are filled with their own personal touches .
The citizens of Agart ponder the legends of their subterranean ancestors while bomb shards are scattered throughout the ruined village of Mist .
The towns are populated by a sparse cast of supporting characters , but each locations has its own distinct layout and overall feel .
Many are also associated with individual dungeons and offer unique items for sale , promising exotic upgrades just around the corner .
Aside from facilitating a varied pace and providing background depth , towns also help to make the setting come to life .
By physically travelling from one location to another , the player discovers the layout of the world and how to orient himself within it .
This might not seem like a big deal , but it ’s a much more immersive approach than a linear series of videogame levels .
Simply put , the cohesiveness of the world anchors the player and helps to suspend his disbelief .
The dungeons are also varied , but they do n’t rely on dubious one - time gameplay gimmicks common to current day JRGPs , e.g. , sneaking into a guarded compound .
Since the game ’s story dictates which characters are in the party at any given time , the treasures in each area are also conveniently synced with the player ’s troops .
In addition , the dungeons contain lots of secret passages and some unique attributes — e.g. , the damaging tiles leading to Feymarch that require Float to be cast on the whole party , or the Lodestone Cavern where wielding metal equipment brings instant death — but the greatest variety comes through in the battles .
And FF IV has a great battle system .
Each character ’s profession is reflected in combat , bringing together story and gameplay .
Kain the Dragoon utilizes massive aerial attacks , black and white mages cast offensive and defensive spells respectively , Edward the bard - prince strums along songs of dubious usefulness , etc .
These abilities come into play against a variety of enemies , all of whom are imbued with a certain sense of personality .
Some foes are resistant to magical elements , others counter physical attacks , and a few even inflict punishing status effects ( like the swamp hag surrounded by giant frogs that cast toad at the end every turn , morphing the party into a group of feeble amphibians ) .
Since the story dictates the party ’s makeup , the player is often forced to switch up his tactics .
A single fighter with 3 mages must keep them all in the back row so they can safely launch their powerful spells , while 3 fighters and a single mage have to preserve MP for healing or make more liberal use of Osmose / MP restoring items .
The items are also great as they represent a steady stream of collectibles that are actually useful in combat .
They give each character something to do even when they ’re facing a foe that ’s immune to their innate abilities , providing some extra options for what would otherwise be boring battle scenarios .
The combat encounters are never puzzles with a single solution .
The player can simply gain enough levels to overpower the enemy , but he can also utilize various strategies that might prove effective , e.g. , the undead are extremely weak to phoenix downs / elixirs / healing magic , but they ’re also susceptible to fire and can be dispatched with simple physical attacks .
Of course daring players can simply choose to run away from standard encounters and only fight the bosses , but it ’s a bit tricky to pull off .
The internal logic of all the items , spells and abilities is quite consistent and gives depth to the world , but it also shines through in other areas of the game .
My favourite example of this is how often spells are cast outside of combat ( especially considering the abstract nature of the battles and how separate they are from the rest of the game ) : Palom and Porom use the petrifying “ Break ” to turn into statues and save the party from a deadly trap , Rydia melts a blockade of ice once she gets past her traumatic aversion to fire spells , the citizens of Mysidia exact revenge on the protagonist by turning him into a pig and other “ polymorph ” critters , etc .
FF IV is a relatively simple RPG by today ’s standards , but its overall structure still holds up .
In fact , I prefer its setup to most current entires in the genre , but if you want to ( re ) check it out , I ’d first recommend reading up on the various version differences .
Whichever one you choose , though , you ’ll get a nice little world to explore .

Spoiler alert !
If you 're going to play Grand Theft Auto IV : The Lost and Damned and find digitally rendered flaccid penises offensive , you may want to avert your sensitive eyes during one in - game cinematic .
Rockstar Games , no stranger to controversy as marketing tool , will likely come under fire for its inclusion of completely uncensored , full frontal male nudity in The Lost and Damned , giving us our very first glimpse of digital dick on the Xbox 360 .
To say it was a surprise would be an understatement , as the scene in question is expert at providing flirtatious glimpses of one character 's fleshy business , only to give Congressman Thomas Stubbs ' junk plenty of screen time .
Allow us to set the scene ...
Stubbs , in his first meeting with lead character Johnny Klebbitz , is receiving a massage at the private gentleman 's club Jousters when we meet him .
The Congressman , dressed in nothing but a towel , quickly becomes pretty comfortable with his new biker friend , choosing to deliver his monologue in the buff .

While Rockstar 's cinematics director teases the player with mere glimpses of Mr. Stubbs ' junk , during the final moments of the cinematic , we get to see everything : a very poorly groomed , uncut and unabashed set of man tools .
We 've opted not to include a shot of the scene , instead choosing to show the next encounter between Messrs .
Klebitz and Stubbs , which also happens to be mostly clothing free .

The ESRB rating for the game — which is " M " for Mature — does make mention of the gratuitous digital dick on display , noting that the game has " Nudity " in its content .
The original Grand Theft Auto IV is listed as having only " Partial nudity . "
There is no lack of homosexual innuendo in the expansion , as the Lost bikers regularly question one another 's sexuality and gush about the love of brotherhood throughout the game , but it certainly was surprising to see Rockstar go there .
[ digg - reddit - me ] I ’ve been writing for some time about how the War on Drugs is both undermining our national security at home and abroad .
The Pentagon , with their Joint Operating Environment Report for 2008 [ pdf ] , confirmed this :
In terms of worst - case scenarios for the Joint Force and indeed the world , two large and important states bear consideration for a rapid and sudden collapse : Pakistan and Mexico .
The Pentagon understands that the escalating drug gang violence ( with casaulty rates higher than Iraq ) is destabilizing our neighbor to the south .
Sam Quinones , writing for Foreign Policy , describes the changes in the levels of violence in the past four years ( when he last lived in Mexico ) :
When I lived in Mexico , the occasional gang member would turn up executed , maybe with duct - taped hands , rolled in a carpet , and dropped in an alley .
But Mexico ’s newspapers itemized a different kind of slaughter last August :
Twenty - four of the week ’s 167 dead were cops , 21 were decapitated , and 30 showed signs of torture .
Campesinos found a pile of 12 more headless bodies in the Yucatán .
Four more decapitated corpses were found in Tijuana , the same city where barrels of acid containing human remains were later placed in front of a seafood restaurant .
A couple of weeks later , someone threw two hand grenades into an Independence Day celebration in Morelia , killing eight and injuring dozens more .
And at any time , you could find YouTube videos of Mexican gangs executing their rivals — an eerie reminder of , and possibly a lesson learned from , al Qaeda in Iraq .
The former U.S. drug czar , Gen. Barry McCaffrey , commenting on the same situation warned that :
The outgunned Mexican law enforcement authorities face armed criminal attacks from platoon - sized units employing night vision goggles , electronic intercept collection , encrypted communications , fairly sophisticated information operations , sea-going submersibles , helicopters and modern transport aviation , automatic weapons , RPG ’s , Anti-Tank 66 mm rockets , mines and booby traps , heavy machine guns , 50 [ caliber ] sniper rifles , massive use of military hand grenades , and the most modern models of 40 mm grenade machine guns .
The situation is clearly dire .
Which makes last week ’s report by the former presidents of Mexico , Brazil , Columbia , and other nation ’s all the more significant .
They see the status quo as unacceptable – and insist that we must decriminalize marijuana and stop treating the problem of drugs as a war lest we end up with nothing but failed states and military dictatorships in Latin America , or as the diplomatic language of the report states , current drug policies have ” enormous human and social costs ” and are “ threats to democratic institutions . ”
In part , this is due to the “ criminalization of politics and the politicization of crime , as well as the proliferation of the linkages between them , as reflected in the infiltration of democratic institutions by organized crime . ”
But it describes further threats arising more directly from the policies themselves .
The report describes the problem of the status quo in stark terms :
Current drug repression policies are firmly rooted in prejudices , fears and ideological visions .
The whole issue has become taboo which inhibits public debate .
The association of drugs with crime blocks the circulation of information and segregates drug users in closed circles where they become even more exposed to organized crime .
Hence , breaking the taboo and acknowledging the failure of current policies and their consequences is the inescapable prerequisite for opening up the discussion about a new paradigm leading to safer , more efficient and humane drug policies .
This does not mean the outright rejection of [ all Drug War ] policies …
There are two main strategies for combatting drugs which it describes – both of them critically – the prohibitionist strategy , or Drug War of the United States , which is reflected in Columbia , Mexico , America , and Afghanistan ; and the harm reduction strategy of Europe .
The report is most critical of the prohibitionist strategy .
In the United States itself , the Drug War ’s “ policy of massive incarceration of drug users [ is ] questionable both in terms of respect for human rights and its efficiency . ”
Describing the effect of the Drug War on Columbia , the report is harsher :
For decades , Colombia implemented all conceivable measures to fight the drug trade in a massive effort whose benefits were not proportional to the vast amount of resources invested and the human costs involved …
The traumatic Colombian experience is a useful reference for countries not to make the mistake of adopting the US prohibitionist policies and to move forward in the search for innovative alternatives .
At the same time , the report finds fault with the European method of dealing with the problem of drugs , saying that :
[ H] arm reduction minimizes the social dimension of the problem [ and ] the policy of the European Union fails to curb the demand for illicit drugs that stimulates its production and exportation from other parts of the world .
In other words , the European Union ’s approach merely attempts to quarantine the problem as it exists within their own societies while doing nothing about the gang warfare and destabilization the production and smuggling of drugs means abroad .
Apparently , at the same time drugs themselves are taking a greater toll on Latin America :
The levels of drug consumption continue to grow in Latin America while there is a tendency toward stabilization in North America and Europe
This collection of prominent Latin American politicians has a number of suggestions to help reverse the destabilizing effects of current drug policies .
One of the most prominent is to descriminalize marijuana .
While considered “ the king crop ” by the Mexican gangs thanks to the steady and broad market and it ’s cheapness to produce ( as opposed to the riskier cocaine and heroin production , sale , and smuggling ) , the report states that :
[ T ]he available empirical evidence shows that the harm caused by this drug is similar to the harm caused by alcohol or tobacco .
More importantly , most of the damage associated with cannabis use – from the indiscriminate arrest and incarceration of consumers to the violence and corruption that affect all of society – is the result of the current prohibitionist policies .
Another major change in policy the report suggests is to treat “ those who have become addicted to drugs ” as “ patients of the health care system ” instead of : buyers in an illegal market . ”
As I wrote before :
This is what makes a reevaluation of our Drug War a national security priority as well as a civil liberties issue .
The former presidents of Mexico , Brazil , and Columbia all saw hope in the administration of Barack Obama , citing him in the report , hope that he will finally tackle this long - festering issue .
He may on his own – and he has made some remarks which constitute progress .
But the issue may be , to paraphrase FDR ’s oft - repeated line : Obama agrees with us in principle ; now we need to put political pressue on him to do something about it .

An English driver has beaten a 98 MPH speed camera ticket by re-purchasing his Honda Civic and paying a firm to test the vehicle .
The Civic 's top speed as tested ?
85 MPH .

21 - year - old Dale Lyle was shocked to receive the ticket for going 98 MPH in the mail not only because he has a perfect driving record and no longer owned the car in question anymore , but because his 1.3 - liter Honda Civic could barely get up to highway speed , much less do nearly 100 MPH .
The penalty for the ticket could have been a fine of as much as $ 1,400 and a six - month driving ban .

Dale told the Daily Mail , " ' I 've never driven my car over the speed limit , let alone at 98 mph .
It 's such a small car I would n't feel safe . "
Determined to beat the charge , Dan took out a loan to buy the Civic back from his friend , then turned it over to an independent expert who verified the Civic 's 85 MPH top speed on Millbrook 's high - speed banked oval .
The same one used in many Top Gear episodes .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Presented with the results , the Crown Prosecution Service had no choice but to drop the case .
Dale will now seek compensation for the $ 1,700 and many hours of his own time that it took to prove his innocence .
Dale 's advice to other motorists ?
" The video evidence the CPS sent me was just appalling .
They are just picking on innocent motorists .
It makes you wonder how many people say , " Fine , give me the points " , when they are not guilty . "

Enlarge Family photo via AP Gilad Shalit , an Israeli soldier was captured at 19 .
His fate is uncertain .
JERUSALEM  Hamas has a feared arsenal of rockets and suicide bombers , but its best bargaining chip in the current war may prove to be a 22 - year - old Israeli soldier named Gilad Shalit .
The uncertain fate of Shalit , who was abducted by militants at a Gaza border crossing in June 2006 , has transfixed Israelis as their aircraft and infantry pounded the area in recent days .
His plight has also sparked a debate in Israel about when it is OK to negotiate with terrorists , and whether Shalit 's release should be a part of eventual negotiations for a cease - fire .
It is not publicly known whether Shalit is still alive .
However , Maj. Avital Leibovich , an Israeli military spokeswoman , described him Monday as Hamas ' " biggest asset " and said the militant group " will do everything to keep him safe and sound . "
Public pressure has mounted on the Israeli government to secure Shalit 's release , even as the military pursues its broader goal of stopping rocket fire into southern Israel .
For months , volunteers have maintained a tent dedicated to Shalit 's cause across from the Israeli prime minister 's residence .
Ron Katzenelson , a 50 - year - old who was sitting there Monday , said the current offensive marks a unique chance for Israel to press Hamas for Shalit 's freedom .
" It 's a narrow window that is open now , " Katzenelson said .
He said the issue was particularly poignant in a country where every man and woman must perform military service .
" Tomorrow it could happen to someone else , " he said .
Noam Shalit , the soldier 's father , has criticized the government for not doing enough to secure his son's release .
He has not made public comments since the Gaza war started Dec. 27 .
Unlike the United States and most European countries , Israel has made no secret of its willingness to negotiate with militants .
" We 'll do whatever we can … to return abducted soldiers , " Leibovich said .
Eitan Barak , an international relations professor at Hebrew University , is among those who believe that stance has led it to pay ever - higher ransoms and encouraged more abductions .
" It is out of control , " Barak said .
In July , Israel exchanged one of its most reviled prisoners , Lebanese national Samir Kuntar , for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers captured and killed in 2006 .
In 1979 , Kuntar killed an Israeli policeman , then killed another Israeli man before smashing in the man 's 4 - year - old daughter 's skull with the rifle butt .
Yoel Hasson , a member of the Knesset , Israel 's parliament , counters that " Israel is in a bad neighborhood " and therefore does n't have the luxury of refusing to negotiate with militants .
Meanwhile , on Monday , Hamas continued using Shalit as a psychological weapon .
In a statement on Hamas ' Al Aqsa TV , a hooded spokesman for the group 's military wing who identified himself as Abu Obeida said : " We tell the Israeli soldiers that Gilad Shalit is missing you and wants someone who can be his companion . "
" We will make sure that his wish will be fulfilled by bringing him more of his colleagues . "

Portable fuel cells powered directly by ethanol could become a viable technology thanks to a new catalyst that has been developed that breaks a strong bond at the heart of ethanol molecules .
This frees electrons and generates electricity .
These types of fuel cells could replace lithium - ion batteries in laptops and cell phones , and could eventually be used to power electric vehicles .
Ethanol is much easier to transport and store than hydrogen , but up until now researchers have not been able to create a good catalyst for oxidizing ethanol in order to make such fuel cells possible .
Previous catalysts could only release a couple of electrons per ethanol molecule , hence they generated low currents .
The new catalyst , developed by researchers at Brookhaven National Laboratory , breaks the carbon bonds without high voltages , efficiently releasing enough electrons to produce electrical currents 100 times higher than those produced with other catalysts .
The next step is to incorporate the catalyst into a fuel cell , so that its performance can be compared with those of other catalysts in fuel cells , says Brian Pivovar , a scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory , in Golden , CO , who was not involved in the research .
The researchers hope that the new catalyst will produce power in the range of hundreds of milliamps per square centimeter .
This level of current , multiplied by the anticipated voltage produced by the cell , would put ethanol fuel cells in the same range as methanol - powered fuel cells , producing enough power for portable electronics .
Ethanol is preferable to methanol in several ways : it stores more energy , is less toxic , and is easier to make from renewable sources .
For powering vehicles , and competing with the performance of hydrogen fuel cells , the catalyst and fuel cell would need to be improved .
The currents would need to be well above 1,000 milliamps per square centimeter , says Andy Herring , a professor of chemical engineering at the Colorado School of Mines , in Golden , CO .
Radoslav Adzic , the senior chemist at Brookhaven National Laboratory who led the work , deposited tiny clusters of platinum and rhodium on tin oxide nanoparticles .
In earlier studies , rhodium had been shown to break bonds between carbon atoms , but only if vaporized at high temperatures in an ultrahigh vacuum .
The combination of rhodium with the tin oxide allowed it to break these bonds as a solid and at the relatively low temperatures needed for portable fuel cells .
The platinum plays a key role in producing protons and electrons from hydrogen atoms in ethanol .
There are many significant challenges before the catalyst can be commercialized in ethanol fuel cells .
In addition to facing the challenges of incorporating it into fuel cells and engineering these to produce electricity efficiently at high currents , the researchers will need to find ways to reduce costs .
Rhodium is the most expensive precious metal–it ’s even more expensive than platinum–so it will either need to be replaced with another element , or techniques must be developed to reduce the amount of rhodium required .
Still , the new catalyst is a significant improvement over previous attempts .
“ Breaking the carbon - carbon bond at low temperatures is an extremely hard problem , ” Herring says .
“ The fact that [ Adzic ] is breaking that bond is pretty exciting . ”
But he adds that “ it ’s just one step on the pathway toward this dream of a direct ethanol fuel cell . ”

Without decisive action , global warming in the 21st century is likely to accelerate at a much faster pace and cause more environmental damage than predicted , according to a leading member of the Nobel Prize - winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
IPCC scientist Chris Field of Stanford University and the Carnegie Institution for Science points to recent studies showing that , in a business - as - usual world , higher temperatures could ignite tropical forests and melt the Arctic tundra , releasing billions of tons of greenhouse gas that could raise global temperatures even more — a vicious cycle that could spiral out of control by the end of the century .
“ There is a real risk that human - caused climate change will accelerate the release of carbon dioxide from forest and tundra ecosystems , which have been storing a lot of carbon for thousands of years , ” said Field , a professor of biology and of environmental Earth system science at Stanford , and a senior fellow at Stanford ’s Woods Institute for the Environment .
“ We do n’t want to cross a critical threshold where this massive release of carbon starts to run on autopilot . ”
Field will present his findings Saturday , Feb. 14 , at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) in Chicago during a symposium titled , “ What Is New and Surprising Since the IPCC Fourth Assessment ? ”
Nobel Prize
Established by the United Nations in 1988 , the IPCC brings together hundreds of experts from around the world to assess the science and policy implications of climate change .
In 2007 , the IPCC and Al Gore were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
Field was among 25 IPCC scientists who attended the award ceremony in Oslo , Norway .
Since 1990 , the IPCC has published four comprehensive assessment reports on human - induced climate change .
Field was a coordinating lead author of the fourth assessment , Climate Change 2007 , which concluded that the Earth ’s temperature is likely to increase 2 to 11.5 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1.1 to 6.4 degrees Celsius ) by 2100 , depending on how many tons of greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere in coming decades .
But recent climate studies suggest that the fourth assessment report underestimated the potential severity of global warming over the next 100 years .
“ We now have data showing that from 2000 to 2007 , greenhouse gas emissions increased far more rapidly than we expected , primarily because developing countries , like China and India , saw a huge upsurge in electric power generation , almost all of it based on coal , ” Field said .
This trend is likely to continue , he added , if more developing countries turn to coal and other carbon - intensive fuels to meet their energy needs .
“ If we ’re going to continue re-carbonizing the energy system , we ’re going to have big CO2 emissions in the future , ” he said .
“ As a result , the impacts of climate change will probably be more serious and diverse than those described in the fourth assessment . ”
IPCC assessment reports are organized into three working groups .
In September 2008 , Field was elected co-chair of Working Group 2 , which is charged with assessing the impacts of climate change on social , economic and natural systems .
One of his major responsibilities is to oversee the writing and editing of the “ Working Group 2 Report ” for the IPCC fifth assessment , which will be published in 2014 .
“ In the fourth assessment , we looked at a very conservative range of climate outcomes , ” Field said .
“ The fifth assessment should include futures with a lot more warming . ”
Forest - carbon feedback
Of particular concern is the impact of global warming on the tropics .
“ Tropical forests are essentially inflammable , ” Field said .
“ You could n’t get a fire to burn there if you tried .
But if they dry out just a little bit , the result can be very large and destructive wildfires . ”
According to several recent climate models , loss of tropical forests to wildfires , deforestation and other causes could increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations from 10 to 100 parts per million by the end of the century .
This would be a significant increase , given that the total concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is currently about 380 parts per million , the highest in 650,000 years .
“ It is increasingly clear that as you produce a warmer world , lots of forested areas that had been acting as carbon sinks could be converted to carbon sources , ” Field said .
“ Essentially we could see a forest - carbon feedback that acts like a foot on the accelerator pedal for atmospheric CO2 .
We do n’t exactly know how strong the feedback could be , but it ’s pretty clear that the warmer it gets , the more likely it is that degradation of tropical forests will increase the atmospheric CO2 . ”
The ocean is another vital reservoir for carbon storage .
Recent studies show that global warming has altered wind patterns in the Southern Ocean , which in turn has reduced the ocean ’s capacity to soak up excess atmospheric CO2 .
“ As the Earth warms , it generates faster winds over the oceans surrounding Antarctica , ” Field explained .
“ These winds essentially blow the surface water out of the way , allowing water with higher concentrations of CO2 to rise to the surface .
This higher - CO2 water is closer to CO2 - saturated , so it takes up less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere . ”
Tundra thawing
Climate scientists also worry that permafrost in the Arctic tundra will thaw , releasing enormous amounts of CO2 and methane gas into the atmosphere .
According to Field , the most critical , short - term concern is the release of CO2 from decaying organic matter that has been frozen for millennia .
“ The new estimate of the total amount of carbon that ’s frozen in permafrost soils is on the order of 1,000 billion tons , ” he said .
“ By comparison , the total amount of CO2 that ’s been released in fossil fuel combustion since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution is around 350 billion tons .
So the amount of carbon that ’s stored in these frozen soils is truly vast . ”
Much of the carbon is locked up in frozen plants that were buried under very cold conditions and have remained in deep freeze for 25,000 to 50,000 years , he added .
“ We know that the Arctic is warming faster than anyplace else , ” he said .
“ And there is clear evidence that these frozen plants are very susceptible to decomposition when the tundra thaws .
So melting of permafrost is poised to be an even stronger foot on the accelerator pedal of atmospheric CO2 , with every increment of warming causing an increment of permafrost - melting that shoots an increment of CO2 into the atmosphere , which in turn increases warming .
“ There ’s a vicious - cycle component to both the tundra - thawing and the tropical forest feedbacks , but the IPCC fourth assessment did n’t consider either of them in detail .
That ’s basically because they were n’t well understood at the time . ”
For the fifth assessment report , Field said that he and his IPCC colleagues will have access to new research that will allow them to do a better job of assessing the full range of possible climate outcomes .
“ What have we learned since the fourth assessment ?
We now know that , without effective action , climate change is going to be larger and more difficult to deal with than we thought .
If you look at the set of things that we can do as a society , taking aggressive action on climate seems like one that has the best possibility of a win-win .
It can stimulate the economy , allow us to address critical environmental problems , and insure that we leave a sustainable world for our children and grandchildren .
Somehow we have to find a way to kick the process into high gear .
We really have very little time . ”

Are you interested in taking a more in - depth look at observing ?
Then why not wait until the Moon sets this weekend and have a look at two splendid galaxies for any size optics – Messier 81 and Messier 82 .
If you ’ve ever been curious about exactly what can be seen in a particular sized telescope , what else is in the area and what the story is behind these two , then come on in …
Welcome , Traveller .
Our celestial journey resumes to the north , in the realms of Ursa Major : the Great Bear .
“ Let my lamp at midnight hour , Be seen in some high , lonely tower .
Where I may oft outwatch the Bear . ”
Our sojourn will take us to a place of intrigue .
A realm where two galaxies hold each other in cosmic grip .
A place where a single gem of spiral perfection is mounted against a setting of broken interaction .
Here we continue our observing quest in exploration of Bode ’s Galaxies – twin jewels of the circumpolar north sky – M81 and M82 …
Discovered in December , 1774 by JE Bode at Berlin , these two deep sky favourites hold secrets between themselves .
Photographed as early as March , 1899 , this pair is central to a group of galaxies encompassing the northern circumpolar constellations of Ursa Major and Camelopardalis .
Modern photos ( such as at the above taken by Karel Teuwen ) , show the superb spiral structure of the M81 .
At some 36,000 light years in diameter , it is one of the densest known galaxies .
One third of the mass is concentrated at the core .
Its glow is the combined luminosity of twenty billion suns …
Often mistaken in the small telescope for an edge - on spiral , M81 ’s neighbor – M82 – shows no sign of “ swirling ” .
As a true space “ oddity ” , the light from M82 journeying back to our eyes is polarized .
This galaxy probably contains a super - massive magnetic field .
Not only is M82 polarized visually , it is also a powerful radio source .
Within its broken structure lay huge masses of dust accompanied by the radiance of stars possessing unusual spectral qualities .
These facts lead scientists to believe that a violent outburst may have occurred within the galaxy as recently as 1.5 million years ago …
About the time when our own adventurous ancestral species began seeking patterns in the night sky !
It is estimated M82 ’s defining event released the energy equivalent of several million exploding suns .
“ Shock waves ” emanating from the galaxy greatly resemble synchrotron radiation .
This phenomenon was first discovered in association with planetary nebula M1 – but within the M82 , on an enormous scale .
Can you image a super nova remnant the size of an entire galactic core region ?
Roughly every one hundred million years , M81 and M82 make a “ pass ” at one another .
Immensely powerful gravitation arms reach out and intertwine to produce a spectacular embrace .
It is theorized that during the last go - round , M82 raised rippling density waves which circulated throughout M81 .
The result ?
Possibly the most perfectly formed spiral galaxy in all of space !
M81 is among the nearest and brightest spiral galaxies , visible even with binoculars at dark sites .
It is also is one of the nearest to our Local Galaxy Group , being only some 12 million light - years from our own celestial backyard .
As with almost all spiral - structured galaxies , star formation is continuing to take place inside this grand galaxy along the arms .
When shown in specific wavelengths of light ( like the above photo take by Dietmar Hager , F.R.A.S. ) it can be evidenced as pink areas of light where the HII regions exist – while the blue areas are home to countless new stars .
It is this incredible energy that makes Messier 81 such a breath - taking spectacle …
But M81 ’s influence left M82 a broken galaxy .
Filled with exploded stars and colliding gas , a galaxy so violent it emits X - rays .
Reactions induced by colliding dust and gas caused the birth of these numerous brilliant stars .
Stars capable of creating extremely dense atoms …
Some of which are now excited by the kind of extreme motion that induces immense magnetic fields .
The end may already be envisioned .
Scientists speculate within a few billion years , out of the two , there shall be one …
Indistinguishable but for the welter of radiation only such an embrace can create .
It is known this same fate awaits our own galaxy .
Billions of years from now , our own galaxy and its ’ largest neighbor – the Great Spiral in Andromeda – will perform this same duet .
Let ’s not talk about just this fascinating galactic duet , however .
For the M81 and M82 also have some very unusual playmates !
Neighboring galaxy NGC3077 displays some of the same “ peculiarities ” as its larger companion , M82 .
At 6,000 light years in diameter , NGC3077 is little more than a third the size of its prototype .
Southwest of Spiral M81 , is yet another “ odd ball ” .
Like NGC3077 , NGC2976 is a dwarf .
At less than 1/5th the size of M81 , NGC2976 is some 7,000 light years across .
A value only three times the distance between our own Sun and the nearby , spectacular Great Nebula in Orion !
Three faint , irregular galaxies are also associated with our galactic pair .
The NGC2366 jumps the border into Camelopardalis .
IC2574 is found just a bit southeast of the M81 and is a real “ toughie ” for most telescopes .
A smaller system known as Ho II was discovered in 1950 by astronomer E. Holmberg .
Even farther into Camelopardis is the large spiral NGC2403 , also thought to be a member of the M81/82 “ family ” of galaxies .
As one of the two galaxy groups closest to our own Milky Way system ( the other lies in Sculptor ) , this region presents a fascinating opportunity for study by the backyard astronomer .
Why , the main pair can even be seen through 6x35 mm binoculars !
So , while we have a relatively dark skies left for a few days , let us turn our telescopes toward study .
Drawing an imaginary line between Phecda and Dubhe , we extend that just one step further into space …
And Galaxy Quest continues !
Some Basic Information :
Like many galaxies seen at right angles to the Milky Way ’s galactic plane , M81/ M82 Galaxy Group members are best observed during Spring just after skydark .
Of course , these galaxies may be observed year - round from the temperate northern hemisphere , but best views are had when found in the middle third of the sky .
Despite the brightness and susceptibility of the main pair , amateurs take it as a source of some pride to readily locate the pair in what amounts to a rather nondescript region of sky .

At the Eyepiece :
M81 & M82 :
So Traveller , shall we start with the 80 mm ?
Here we find the M81 shows an obvious starlike core , with bright and extended core region blending into the beginnings of faint spiral arms .
Although this showpiece galaxy flares to all directions on eye movement ( which basically doubles any scope aperture ) , it appears somewhat “ flattened ” , showing a better defined frontier to the west .
On nights of superb transparency ( and at low magnification – 40x ) , the broad extensions of the galaxy ’s spiral arms may be seen clearly with strongly averted vision .
And surprisingly , some five arc minutes north of the galaxy ’s core , a faint condensation may be detected .
But the limits of small aperture leave the observer wanting more …
So , let ’s increase to 114 mm …
At 53X , we find M81 as a lovely , soft “ disc ” with an intense core .
By increasing the power to 90X , its true spiral form begins to show .
Meanwhile , the central portion of the galaxy takes on a very concentrated appearance , and the outer frontiers fade gently away .
Still , no “ definitive ” view of this superfine study , however .
Time to check out the view in the 150 mm …
At 52x , spiral galaxy M81 sports a very bright , star - like central core .
It ’s core is large , elongated , and displays a considerable luminosity gradient from core-central to faint spiral arms .
At this magnification , extended spiral arms require but the slightest aversion of the sight .
As large as M81 is , it ’s still helpful to bump up the magnification .
At 70 x , averted vision reveals a certain subtle “ spiral - sweep ” about the core region .
The core itself orients more or less north - south and extends perhaps 5 by 10 arc -minutes in apparent size .
This sweep of the core region is larger than many galaxies .
A pair of 12th magnitude stars lie just off axis to the southwest .
Careful inspection shows that the galaxy as a whole orients toward the more westerly of these two field stars .
Under less than optimal conditions , less than half of M81 is susceptible to direct vision .
But under optimal conditions , we are rewarded with fine views of large faint splotches of outlying luminosity .
Through a six inch instrument , this grand galaxy needs to be doted over to be truly appreciated .
While the core is easy , M81 ’s spiral arms are quite faint and need a good night of seeing to reveal themselves as something more than vague “ mounds of luminosity ” .
Increasing the aperture again to 310 mm , let ’s go to the eyepiece …
At minimum magnification ( 60X ) , the M81 does indeed remind one of a miniature “ Andromeda ” galaxy .
The intense core , the sense of spiral arms folding round , all say “ Grand Spiral ” .
But let ’s head to a “ higher power ” ( 170X ) and rock out structure .
At this magnification , indications of dark dustlanes begin to exist at the outer edges .
The central formation of the galaxy itself is impenetrable .
More than two - thirds of its ’ structure holds even concentration and makes the core area intense .
It is toward the elongated edges that our attention is drawn with direct vision .
Here are the classic “ spiral arms ” we ’ve been looking for !
At the highest of magnifications ( 312x ) , they fold themselves very close to the body of the M81 , with each “ tip ” extending both above and below the central structure evenly .
At the outermost fringes of these arms , averted vision reveals the mottling of distant clusters , and a sense of “ trailing away ” that give this well - endowed spiral real “ class ” !
Now , let ’s go back to the 80 mm and examine the M82 …
On shifting the field to the more northern M82 , we immediately catch the dark vertical break that splits this edge on west of the galaxy ’s irregular core .
Direct inspection of the galaxy fails to show more than where the break occurs – since little of luminosity can be seen further west of the discontinuity .
Both the northern and southern frontiers are well defined and quite linear – even under marginal conditions .
Aversion of the sight shows a bit of an extended halo outside the bounds of the flanking frontiers .
We also note that the eastern extension shows a well defined “ daggerlike ” blade and tip .
At 114 mm , that first view at low power ( 36X ) screams “ edge-on ” !
But , with patience and practice , delicate detail with averted vision begins to form , and the dark break becomes perceivable .
Increasing the magnification to 90X makes this division more apparent , and causes the M82 to appear “ spindle - shaped ” … much like a child ’s dirty kite string wrapped round a stick .
Very little in the way of structure is seen , other than the fact than it ’s lumpy .
Let ’s move to 150 mm …
M82 stretches out perhaps 10 arc - minutes east and west like a knife splitting the sky .
It ’s core is not of the luminous star - like variety …
A gradual brightening is seen from one end of the galaxy to the center and back again to the opposite extreme .
Unlike M81 , the change is very gradual .
A curious kneadiness or mottling is apparent – especially to the west .
This edge - on irregular galaxy is broken by a dark lane along its southern frontier .
The lane is not visible – only the sharpness by which it truncates the galaxy .
In addition , a more obvious cleft of darkish matter divides the trailing half of the core .
Overall , the visible part of the galaxy covers a region perhaps 2 by 8 arc - minutes in apparent size .
A pair of 11th magnitude stars are visible west - southwest .
In many ways M82 is more interesting than M81 .
It ’s beauty lies in subtle variations of surface brightness which defy notions of pattern and verbal description .
Shall we seek in the 310 mm ?
Then let ’s find some answers …
At moderate magnifications ( 90X ) , M82 begins revealing structure to direct vision .
The dark “ break ” one third of the way across its ’ breadth is fully apparent , and the thickening portions along the body of the galaxy itself warrant closer investigation .
Moving now to higher magnification ( 170X ) , we get the structure we were looking for …
The galaxy no longer can be called “ edge- on ” , and clotted appearance of what must be thousands upon thousands of clusters make this one truly fine .
The central portion bears no nucleus … pardon the descriptor , but it looks like cottage cheese !
Toward one end , the dark division holds the lump of galactic mass in a gravity “ lock ” , and bleeds away into what almost appears with averted vision to be several open clusters .
At the other end of the M82 , all thoughts of resolution stop .
Here the galactic matter appears to be “ smeared ” … as if the inner concentration of stars might perhaps be calmer , somehow .
A very fine galaxy …
It has earned its ’ classification as irregular .
NGC2976 :
Continuing with our study , we break away from this splendid galactic pair , and move onward toward yet another …
This galaxy “ lives ” within a large house of 10th and 11th magnitude stars south - southwest of M81 .
The peaked - roof of the house lies to the east .
And its ’ name ?
NGC2976 …
Starting with our 80 mm refractor , this galaxy is difficult , but positively located within the same “ house - shape ” of stars .
The sense of large apparent size remains present .
Quite diffuse overall with slight condensation , it requires extreme aversion .
Despite a dearth of structure , the galaxy hints at north - south orientation with a possibly better defined frontier to east .
Moving now to the 114 mm newtonian reflector , we find it is detectable at 114 mm in aperture … but that is all it is .
A soft , elongated smudge that requires averted vision just to make out form .
Through 150 mm at 52 x and under 5.0 ULM conditions , NGC2976 appears large and diffuse .
Maybe 3×5 arc minutes of the galaxy is possible with a southeast to northwest orientation .
It displays a large , but dim core region .
This gives it a sense of structure .
On eye movement , the galaxy flares to all directions , but less so to the southwest .
It ’s core region appears quite large , football shaped and diffuse .
Bumping the magnification to 70 x gives the core a somewhat edge - on appearance .
At 120 x the low surface brightness of this large galaxy causes it to completely dissolve .
At 310 mm in aperture , the NGC2976 does not rock out detail in an expected fashion either , Now we are talking about being able to hold this galaxy direct , which means averted should bring out structure …
What structure ?!
A tear drop , grainy - looking patch on the night with a bright star at the edge , tapering off into a chain of stars …
That ’s it .
No sense of a nucleus ….
no apparent fading at frontiers .
Time to move on ?
You bet !
Let ’s head off to capture another …
NGC3077 :
Going to the 80 mm , we find this galaxy easily located but lacking structure under direct perception .
NGC3077 is small and diffuse , with faint extensions north and south .
Sense of vague truncation ( flattening ) to east along with a soft , but perceptible degree of central condensation .
Extreme aversion of the eye is needed to make out any of these details .
Now , moving on to the 114 mm we find the NGC3077 is also detectable … as a very dim glow of galactic light with extreme averted vision , and one pinpoint star nearby .
Shifting our view points to 150 mm we find at 52 x and a 5.0 sky , this vaguely football - shaped galaxy is easily located but lacks obvious structure .
There is a subtle sense of east - west orientation .
Perceptible flaring appears on eye movement to all directions - except north .
This lack of northern flaring hints at a dark lane that direction .
A very faint star - like point can occasionally be seen near the center of the nebulosity .
A slight amount of central condensation is possible but the lack of a defined core region means a very loose and diffuse appearance .
At 70x , the faint starlike - nucleus occasionally seen at 52 x becomes a bit more consistent .
The beginnings of a core region also emerges .
At 120 x a roundish blue core region with a soft , “ unstarlike ” nucleus can be seen , but the bulk of the galaxy is lost to sight for lack of photons …
Going to the 310 mm dobsonian at differing ranges of magnification changes the picture just slightly .
The most pleasing view is at 180X .
Here we see an egg - shaped elliptical … evenly lighted , but there is a certain amount of degeneration at the edges … a sense that the light is being eroded away .
Several field stars are also visible .
A chain of three varying magnitudes to one side , and an elongated rectangular structure to the other .
Ready to rock on ?
Then let ’s head toward a particularly difficult study …
IC2574 :
IC2574 is next .
Welcome only to large aperture telescopes !
Once again , a faint , elongated , lumpy bar of light .
This one shows “ lobes ” of concentration at either end of it ’s structure .
Not only does this one appear as “ lumpy ” … but there are a great many field stars that accompany it … like very precise open clusters !
They are vague … and when the dob presents you with vague light in the presence of pinpoint stars , we would venture to say that this galaxy is accompanied by some nebulosity .
Right ?
Wrong ?
It ’s a study … and we ’re not through yet .
So let ’s head on back to our galaxy hunt , and see what else we can find .
Another faint member of this group stretches across the border into Camelopardis .
It is also a rather difficult study …
But that ’s why we ’ve brought along the power of aperture .
NGC2366 :
Between apparent size and surface brightness , the NGC2366 is best left to the larger scope .
Detectable as low as 48X as a tiny , grainy bar of light , the best view comes at 170X .
At this magnification , the NGC2366 takes on structure .
Several areas of light concentration are seen , making it appear as though it has three centers .
Adding the barlow and increasing to 340X pulls the picture in much closer , losing hard edge clarity , but reveals at one end , a notch occurs in the galaxy …
Much like a crescent wrench .
Opposite of this “ notch ” is also what may either be a small open cluster , or perhaps a bit of wayward galactic material .
Going back to 170X is much more comfortable , and the lumpy figure of the NGC2366 most definitely has earned its ’ classification as an “ irregular ” galaxy !.
NGC2403 :
On to our last study , the NGC2403 …
This one is definitely a “ all scopes ” kinda ’ galaxy !
In the 80 mm there is nothing diffuse about this galaxy .
Orienting northwest to southeast , it displays a well - developed northwest spiral extension and surprisingly little to the southeast .
( Giving NGC2403 a very “ cometlike ” appearance . )
This baby is definitely overdeveloped .
No starlike core , just a general brightening toward the center .
Bright stars flanking it complicate the view .
It ’s not hard to be both baffled and impressed by this bright galaxy way out in the reaches of Camelopardis .
Easily found and recognizable in the 114 mm at 17 mm as a spiral , the little scope pulls out a stellar core and definately sense of fading toward the frontiers .
Moving up to 150 mm , we find that although NGC2403 fails to rival Bode ’s Galaxies in terms of brightness and structure , it makes a good run for it .
The galaxy is large , conspicuous and possesses a well - defined northern frontier , starlike core and extended core region .
It also presents mostly edge - on ( cigar - shaped ) and shows well even under marginal 5.0 ULM skies .
At 70x , two faint spiral extensions are possible , with the western extension more obvious than the east .
This gives the sense of the core region being offset in that direction .
At 120x , a tiny blue nucleus can just be held with slight aversion .
Complicating the view of this galaxy are a series of bright 7th and 8th magnitude stars flanking it along the southern frontier .
314 mm time ?
Oh , yeah …
Now here is some superior structure !
Mottling begins even with as little magnification as 60X .
Adequately large enough to be studied at lower magnifications , we find the view at 90X the most pleasing .
Concentrated , egg - shaped nucleus … one soft “ horseshoe ” of a dark dust lane , and hints of globular clusters that cry out for more .
Comply ?
Of course .
Let ’s set 170X on it …
We have what appears to be globular structure in a very “ open ” looking arm .
Not only here , but several knots exist throughout the NGC2403 .
And yet again , we “ make out ” something that looks like a small , attendant open cluster .
No nearby bright stars at magnification as markers , the field is nothing more than some fine chains …
But who cares ?
Cuz ’ this is one fine galaxy !!
Parting Thoughts :
And so we have journeyed eight million light - years across the night together .
And still I would stay with you , Traveller .
For a hundred billion more .
“ The Bear that sees star setting after star …
In the blue brine , descends not to the deep . ”
The stars , the night , and the far flung universes awaits you …
My many thanks to Karel Teuwen and Deitmar Hager , F.R.A.S. of Northern Galactic for their outstanding images and I would like to gratefully acknowledge Jeff Barbour for being a major contributor to both the studies and writing that went into this article .
It ’s nice to be able share the view through an 80 mm refractor and 150 mm SCT from 3,000 miles away !
Chionodraco hamatus , an Antarctic ice fish , can withstand temperatures that freeze the blood of all other fish types .
This finger - lengthed juvenile was photographed in 2008 .
Scientists have determined that at least 235 species live in both polar seas despite the 8,000 miles ( 13,000 km ) between the ends of the Earth .
How some of the creatures wound up at the top and bottom of the planet is a mystery .
Distance and habitat divisions — such as warm water between the two regions — are among the things that can separate creatures and lead to new species .
A DNA analysis is underway to confirm if the like species are in fact identical , the researchers announced today .
The researchers also found evidence that cold water species are moving toward the poles to escape rising ocean temperatures .
The project has also returned dramatic photos of species as wide - ranging as ice - loving sand fleas and an antifreeze Antarctic fish that can withstand temperatures that would freeze other fish .
Among the beasts that call both polar seas home are marathon migrators such as grey whales and birds .
But the researchers , working on the ongoing Census of Marine Life , also found bipolar worms , crustaceans , and angelic snail - like pteropods .
" The polar seas , far from being biological deserts , teem with an amazing quantity and variety of life , " said Ian Poiner , chair of the Census Scientific Steering Committee for the project .
Biologists from several nations have for the past two years worked on the census , at times braving 48 - foot ( 16 - meter ) waves and frigid conditions .
" Only through the cooperation of 500 people from more than 25 countries could the daunting environmental challenges be overcome to produce research of such unprecedented scale and importance , " Poiner said .
" And humanity is only starting to understand the nature of these regions . "
The team estimates there are 7,500 animals in the Antarctic and 5,500 in the Arctic , and the total number of marine life species known globally is about 250,000 .
That number may eventually rise to about a million , scientists say .
In general , other scientists have said they do not know how many species exist on Earth .
The National Science Foundation estimates there could be anywhere from 5 million to 100 million species of life on the planet , but science has only identified about 2 million .
One result of the sea - life census : Researchers are beginning to understand how the polar seas act as incubators for life that sometimes ventures away from the poles as sea temperatures rise and fall over the eons .
Last year they discovered that several octopus types have repeatedly colonized the deep sea , each migration coinciding with retreating Antarctic ice over 30 million years .
The scientists now theorize that the Antarctic regularly refreshes the world 's oceans with many new creatures , including different varieties of sea spiders , isopods ( crustaceans related to shrimp and crabs ) , and more .
They believe the new species evolve when expansions of ice cloister around the south polar region ; when the ice retreats , creatures radiate northward along the same pathways followed by the octopuses .
Meanwhile , the census finds smaller marine species are replacing larger ones in some Arctic waters .
The reasons are unclear but the implications for the Arctic food web may be profound , the scientists said .
Lawyers representing the victims of Bernard Madoff 's alleged $ 50 bn fraud are calling on the US government to bail them out with billions of taxpayers ' dollars .
They say the government should bolster the Securities Investor Protection Corporation , which helps creditors of collapsed brokerages .
The SIPC has little more than $ 1.6bn of funds and has promised $ 500,000 to each Madoff victim who had an account with his firm in the past 12 months .
Losses in the Madoff affair are estimated to be between $ 30bn and $ 50 bn .
Michael Sirota , a lawyer representing KML Investments , a firm claiming to have lost $ 80 m , said : " What if SIPC needs $ 15 bn to compensate all the victims because this fraud is bigger than anything they imagined could happen ?
The government should step up with funds like it has for the banking sector and the automotive sector . "
Stuart Rich , a lawyer representing seven investors who lost sums from $ 3 m to $ 30 m , says : " We desperately need to see the pool of assets we are working with and the pool of losses . "
Madoff has presented a list of his assets to the Securities and Exchange Commission , the US market regulator , but the document remains under seal .
Rat -Killing Champion Crowned in Bangladesh
After disposing of 39,650 rodents , a man from Bangladesh has been crowned a rat - killing champion and has been awarded a 14 - inch Sony color television for his efforts .
It took Binoy Kumar Karmakara one year to perform the daunting task and he used traps , poison and flooding to capture the animals .
He also kept their tails so that he could keep count .
Killing rats is a strategy that was launched by the government of Bangladesh because rats are responsible for the loss of about 10 % of the country ’s crops .
That is a terrible figure for a region of the world where people starve and die in the public streets .
â€ œDuring the year , our farmers killed around 25 million rats and Kumar Karmakara has been declared the champion for killing 39,650 , â€ said agriculture department spokesman , Abdul Halim .
Hail to the champion !
Pied Pier , step down !

House Democrats today released an updated version of The Heroes Act , addressing needs that have developed since the House passed an earlier iteration and reflecting negotiations between Democrats and Republicans .
Exclusive : Rove not covered by executive privilege in political prosecution case , lawyer says John Byrne
Published : Monday February 16 , 2009
Print This Email This Lawyer : Rove wo n't take the Fifth if he testifies Representatives of the Bush White House are no longer advising former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove that he is protected by executive privilege as regards testimony about the alleged political prosecution of an Alabama governor .
In an exchange with Raw Story , Roves Washington , D.C. attorney , Robert Luskin , also said Rove wont invoke his Fifth Amendment right to protect himself from self - incrimination , if and when he testifies about the firing of nine US Attorneys and the prosecution of the former governor .
There 's been speculation that he would decline to answer questions on Fifth Amendment grounds ,  Luskin said .
 That 's a personal privilege ; he will not assert it . 
Asked if he had a comment on Sen. Patrick Leahys ( D - VT ) proposed truth commission ,  in which Bush officials would be offered immunity in exchange for testimony , Luskin said ,  No . 
Last year , the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Rove to testify about his knowledge concerning the prosecution of former Democratic Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman , which they alleged was carried out on political grounds after a whistleblower said Rove had a hand in seeking the prosecution .
In 2007 , Rove was subpoenaed by the Senate about the firing of nine US Attorneys .
Both times , the Bush Administration asserted that Rove was protected by executive privilege ; both times , Rove did not appear .
Now , with a newly - installed Democratic president , the ice under Rove appears to have thinned .
Rove was subpoenaed in January and again last week by House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) .
He has been told to appear Feb. 23 for a congressional deposition .
Though it remains unclear what form Roves cooperation with Congress and Justice Department investigators  who continue to probe the US Attorney firings and the Siegelman case  might take , it seems increasingly likely that Rove will testify to Congress in some way .
Luskin said last Thursday that no agreement had yet been reached with the committee .
Last year , Rove offered to speak in private to House Judiciary Committee investigators about the Siegelman case .
He has said repeatedly that he had no involvement in the corruption prosecution mounted by a Bush - appointed US Attorney that critics say was motivated by politics .
He refused , however , to testify under oath or in public , and the Committee balked .
Luskin says Roves previous stance was based on advice from the Bush White House but that Bush representatives are no longer advising him on the matter .
 The only basis that Rove has ever declined to appear has been the White House claim of immunity for senior advisors to the president and executive privilege ,  Luskin said .
 I do think that it 's clearer now that the Siegelman matter falls outside the scope of the former claim and , on that basis , I offered to have Rove appear on this matter . 
 Previously , as to the Siegelman matter , the White House was involved in the discussions about what form Rove 's cooperation might take , hence the discussions about interviews , not public testimony , et cetera ,  he said in an earlier exchange .
 Rove 's most recent guidance from the White House did not express any limitations . 
Today ,  I do not think there are any limitations on potential testimony about Siegelman ,  Luskin added .
 The circumstances  public testimony , deposition , under oath or not  would be up to the committee . 
That said , Luskin refused to commit his client to testifying publicly or under oath .
 My circumspection now about what form Rove 's cooperation might take regarding Siegelman comes from a desire not to say anything publicly that might prejudice opportunities to reach a constructive resolution with the committee ,  he said .
 Rove is already on the record regarding the Siegelman allegations  they are wholly without merit  and he would obviously like to put this to rest . 
He added ,  We 're continuing to engage in constructive discussions with the committee to that end , and I 'd hesitate to speculate about what form Rove 's cooperation might ultimately take . 
A House Judiciary Committee spokesman declined to comment .
The Committee wrote in a letter to Luskin last week that they would n't accept testimony on Siegelman alone , saying that witnesses did n't get to dictate terms .
Siegelman was convicted in 2006 on bribery charges stemming from accusations that in 1999 former HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy had donated to a political fund that was lobbying for Siegelman 's lottery plan in exchange for being appointed to a key medical licensing board .
He was released on bail last April , after a series of investigations into allegations that his prosecution had been politically motivated .
At that time , one Republican whistleblower named Rove as having had a hand in pushing for the prosecution .
The charges against Siegelman were brought by US Attorney Leura Canary , who had been appointed by President Bush in 2001 .
Her husband , Bill Canary , was a veteran GOP operative who worked in partnership with Rove on numerous Alabama campaigns in the 1990's , as well as for the Republican challenger who had defeated Siegelman in Alabama 's 2002 gubernatorial race .
Peter Beaumont finds Israel 's peace movement being pushed to the margins like never before as the country prepares to vote
Out of Gaza and across the border to the sound of rocket fire .
A handful of hours later I am at the Hebrew University for a lecture by Gershon Baskin , one of Israel 's most prominent peace activists , who is describing his attempts to open a channel of communication between Israel 's leaders and Hamas .
It 's a strange and sudden quantum shift – from the ruins , anxiety and stench of war to normality , calm and mannered debate .
What it entails is a journey from one ethos of conflict , the Palestinian one still raw , edgy and angry from the recent violence , to an Israeli one , expressed – most obviously for most – in the harsh rhetoric of political contest .
In a bare room littered with bean bags and exposed piping , less than a dozen students sit patiently to listen to Baskin 's account .
The meeting has been organised by a group called It Is No Legend .
It is an ironic play on a quote from Theodore Herzl , the founder of modern Zionism : " If you will it , it is no legend " .
Herzl meant the will to bring about the foundation of Israel .
Among this group it signifies the will to peace and coexistence with Palestinian Arabs .
I know Baskin via his articles and his emails .
The story he tells to the students is largely unreported : one of the hidden tales that Israel 's government would like to gloss over .
In meetings with Hamas figures , arranged through texts , calls and emails , Baskin established a kind of one - way channel of communication to the office of Israel 's prime minister , Ehud Olmert .
It was the offer of a means of negotiation that Olmert and his government emphatically rejected .
The students pose questions at the end .
Was the war inevitable , they want to know .
Most think it was .
What are the prospects for the future ?
It is a subdued gathering .
The reality is that the facts of the war , the civilian deaths and the destruction , are not simply better known in Gaza than they are in Israel .
In its sparse attendance , this meeting reflects a fundamental shift in Israeli society – despite the students ' excuses to the contrary .
Support for the war has been almost unanimous at up to 94 % .
Israel 's peace movement , as a consequence , has been pushed to the margins like never before .
More than that , many of its members have been co-opted .
I recall a conversation I had with Orith Shochat before going into Gaza .
A liberal Israeli journalist , she has spent most of her life campaigning against the occupation .
It was Shochat who drafted the 2003 letter for the Israeli air force pilots who refused to take part in attacks on civilian areas .
This is a war , however , that Shochat has supported .
When I ask her about the civilian casualties she tells me she is " shocked how it does not shock her " .
" I am amazed , " she adds , " how it does n't haunt me . "
She reflects on a journey over five years that led her to the conclusion that the targeted assassinations she once opposed might be more moral than the alternative .
That there might be no other solution to the rocket fire out of Gaza than a demonstration that Israel 's commitment to deterrence has not weakened .
I meet others – at a friend 's flat in Jerusalem and elsewhere – who evince the same views while insisting that they belong to the left ; that they support the idea of peace and a negotiated two - state solution .
I hear from several people the conviction that out of the blood of Gaza a new solution and impetus towards peace might yet be born .
It is a view , having come from Gaza , that I struggle to understand .
Physics student Ofek Birnholtz , 25 , who organised the lecture at the Hebrew University , offers another take .
He is convinced that the two trends – strong support for the war and growing support for the end of occupation and a two - state solution – coexist ; that it is caught up in a moment of collective anger that will pass .
But the political dynamics of the Israeli election campaign suggest something else is going on .
The rightwing Likud party of Binyamin Netanyahu , and the far - right Yisrael Beiteinu party of Avigdor Lieberman – both of which had the least to do with the war against Gaza and Hamas – have have benefited most , suggesting a nationalist retrenchment .
The reality is that a polarisation and radicalisation within Palestinian society has been reflected in an equal radicalisation among Israeli Jews , accelerated by the conflict in Gaza , that has seen even well - established connections between peacemakers on both sides collapse .
The question that remains is why ?
For Daniel Bar -Tal , of Tel Aviv University , who has a long record of researching the functioning of each group 's " conflict ethos " in the Israeli - Palestinian confrontation , the current state of the national psyche is as much manufactured as it is willed .
He explained it in a recent interview in Haaretz .
" After the bitter experience of the second Lebanon war , during which the memory of the war was taken out of their hands and allowed to be formed freely , " he explained , " the country 's leaders learned their lesson , and decided that they would n't let that happen again .
" They were not satisfied with attempts to inculcate Palestinian awareness and tried to influence Jewish awareness in Israel as well .
For that purpose , heavy censorship and monitoring of information were imposed [ during the Gaza campaign ] . "
It was achieved , he believes , by the willing enlistment of the media , who concentrated only on the sense of victimisation of residents of the so - called " Gaza envelope " – those within the range of missiles from Gaza – largely ignoring the situation of the residents of besieged Gaza .
The veteran peace campaigner Gila Svirsky , of Women in Black , argues for an even more radical interpretation .
At her small flat in Jerusalem , cluttered with the mementoes of her life in activism , she says she believes that much of the rejection of the " others ' story " has been self - willed .
Gila tells me a story .
It is about a neighbour who admits avoiding the take of foreign media on Gaza to avoid being challenged in her assumptions .
" You can feel it , " says Gila .
" The temptation of being sucked into only watching Israeli news .
It is really hard to extricate oneself from the dominant discourse .
There is a word in Hebrew – miguyas – it means , I suppose , seduced .
People do n't want to go there .
Do n't want to think bad thoughts [ about what is being done in their name ] . "
It has been accomplished , Svirsky insists , by portraying Hamas as an " existential threat , the forward guard of Iran " , not as a local problem to be negotiated .
It is precisely the story that Netanyahu has been pushing so hard and successfully in the election campaign .
But there is another difficulty .
While those like Gershon Baskin frame the war in terms of multiple missed opportunities to engage with Hamas – or attempts to understand it at least – there are others on the left like Yaron Ezrahi , author and professor of politics at the Hebrew University , who believe there was a failure on the Israeli left 's part to formulate an adequate response to the Qassam missiles fired out of Gaza into southern Israel .
Despite that , this war – he insists to me – will be Israel 's " Macbeth moment " .
It will be something – to reverse Shochat 's formulation – to shock in the long run .
" Israel will be forever haunted by the ghosts of this war , " Ezrahi says sadly .
But in the immediate aftermath of war , there does not seem to be much haunting of the majority .
It is embraced enthusiastically , grimly or fatalistically as necessary .
At the margins it is not rejected but avoided .
I meet an elderly woman in a deli in west Jerusalem , listening to the radio and drinking her tea among a handful of pavement tables .
I am told she was a demolitions expert in the Palmach , the organisation that fought for Israel 's creation in 1948 .
We chat and she is happy to talk about most things .
But when I ask her about the current situation she says – with a touch of anger at my presumption in asking the question – that she does not feel well enough informed to comment .
A young woman at Hebrew University , who listens to Baskin for an hour and half , fends off my questions with the same determined excuse : she does not know enough .
But in the offices of Breaking the Silence , the organisation of former Israeli soldiers dedicated to exposing human rights abuses committed by the Israeli defence forces , Michael Manekin and Yehuda Shaul believe it is simply a question of time .
After previous operations , they say , it has taken six months to a year for soldiers to come forward with testimony about events that disturbed them .
The media , Manekin explains , acted as the military 's cheerleader at the beginning of the war in Gaza .
Now , he says , it is calling every day , hungry for soldiers ' stories that contradict the official line .
Yehuda , a burly former infantryman who served during Operation Defensive Shield in 2002 , opens up a scanned file on his computer – a pamphlet circulated by the army 's chief military rabbi to soldiers before entering Gaza .
It is a document as unsettling in its own way as the religious justifications of Hamas for its own violence .
It talks about the necessity of cruelty against the enemy , and dehumanises and de-legitimises the Palestinians and their claims .
Manekin translates the words : " We are not allowed by religious command to return an inch of land to the Palestinians .
It is our land – God 's land .
There is a question [ in the pamphlet ] : ' Can we compare the Palestinians now to the biblical era of the Philistines ?
And if so , does this guide us how we act militarily ' ?
The answer says : ' Yes we can .
The Palestinians like the Philistines are not a natural part of this region ' . "
Listening to Manekin , I think about the words of Bar - Tal .
And I wonder – as I have always wondered in wartime – how much is manufactured ?
How much willed ?
And I wonder what kind of government a society still drunk on the euphoria of military action will elect with a handful of days remaining .
It ’s a sad truth of the urban landscape : Today ’s street tree is tomorrow ’s mulch .
But in the foothills of Santa Barbara , a former stuntman and onetime sea-urchin diver named Rob Bjorklund turns fallen city trees into flooring , mantels , plaques and massive , irregularly shaped conference tables that appear to be suited for a wizard ’s laboratory .
He uses oaks toppled by storms ; eucalyptuses leveled by bulldozers ; trees taken down for being too old , too sick , too close to foundations , too hard on sidewalks .
Many would otherwise be cut for firewood or buried in a landfill .
“ All these awesome logs ! ” said Bjorklund , a rangy 52 - year - old who tends to sprinkle his conversation with exclamation points when he talks about wood .
Part of a growing nationwide movement to reuse urban trees , he operates a sawmill on a rugged 90 - acre spread that has been in his family for four generations .
Advertisement
On any given day , he said , about 20 trees fall to disease or development in Santa Barbara alone , and one or two of them are valuable enough to recycle .
According to some studies , fallen urban trees can provide as much as 30 % of all the lumber used in the U.S .
“ People think , ‘ When I want lumber , I ’ll go to the lumberyard , ’ ” said Eric Oldar , a retired California forestry official who helped start the state ’s urban wood recycling program in the 1990s .
“ They do n’t perceive the trees in their yards as part of a forest . ”
Bjorklund does n’t cut trees down ; he saws them into boards or slabs after they ’ve been felled .
A jumble of trunks , stumps and huge limbs sits in an arroyo on his ranch , left by tree - trimmers eager to avoid fees at municipal dumps .
On occasion , Bjorklund , who wears a sweat - stained hat with a homemade rattlesnake band , heads for town in an old truck to retrieve dead trees he ’s heard about from arborists or friends .
“ A commercial sawmill wo n’t touch them because of the impurities , ” he said .
“ There are a lot of strange things in the urban forest -- nails and barbed wire , bolts that shatter your saw blade . ”

From a great old oak in Montecito , Bjorklund extracted a rusty wire cable and a beehive still dripping with honey and wax .
He also found a grapefruit - size rock that had been inserted deep in a hole -- Bjorklund figures a boy did it -- and swallowed up by wood decades ago .
Finally , a rat ran from the trunk as the whirring blade bore down .
“ It was just a battle , ” he said .
Similar struggles go on across the country .
At the home of a corporate chief executive in the suburbs of Cincinnati , Sam Sherrill was part of a crew that set off explosives to blow apart a downed oak 6 feet across , making it easier to cut the wood .
Advertisement
“ It was a weird thing to do , but I ’m glad we did it , ” said Sherrill , a retired professor and author of a guide called “ Harvesting Urban Timber . ”
“ We got beautiful , one - of - a - kind boards that are ‘ book - matched , ’ or mirror images of each other .
Among other things , the family now has two terrific tables that are 8 inches thick .
It ’ll mean something to them . ”
Throughout the Midwest , millions of street trees have been rendered into arboreal road kill by an unrelenting bug called the emerald leaf borer .
More and more , the fallen ash trees have drawn craftsmen who turn them into furniture so elegant that some of it is on display in a traveling exhibition put together by the Chicago Furniture Designers Assn .
In California , state officials who wanted to keep massive tree trunks out of crowded landfills spurred the movement to resurrect dead trees .
With a sawmill on permanent loan from the state , Palomar College teaches woodworking students how to build fine furniture from San Diego - area trees that would otherwise have been destined for the chipper .
Residents can get a tax deduction by giving the community college suitable trees that are dead or dying .

In El Cajon , the Taylor Guitar Co. snatched up 15 tons of a centuries - old tulip poplar from a Maryland landfill , the partial remains of a so - called Liberty Tree taken down on the campus of St. John ’s College in Annapolis .
Fragments from the tree -- which shaded a gathering spot for irate colonists before the American Revolution -- are used in a line of Taylor guitars .
A few local governments also salvage toppled trees .
In Lompoc , parks and urban forestry manager Cindy McCall said the city annually saves $ 100,000 in dumping fees by using native wood in its bleachers , benches , signs , City Hall seating areas and some of its workers ’ desks -- including her own .
“ Why should we clear - cut the Amazon when we can work toward using the woods we have ? ” she asked .
Still , mahogany from Brazil can be an easier sell than eucalyptus from Goleta .
Advertisement
The streets deliver a dizzying variety of species , but not enough at any one time to guarantee the uniform appearance offered by commercial growers .
That cultivated tidiness frustrates Bjorklund , who sold portable sawmills before starting his business -- Local Wood -- two years ago .
“ Every knot , every crack , every imperfection is wood love , ” he said .
“ That ’s what makes wood real .
There ’s an energy to it :
If you ’ve got a thick , awesome wood desk , it balances out all the electronic -y , plastic -y stuff you put on it . ”
Salvagers of street trees never know when , what or how much they ’ll get .
Most of the wood has not been certified for structural uses .
It tends to be more expensive than store - bought lumber .
And drying -- Bjorklund has a solar kiln -- can take many months .
Advertisement
“ Contractors want what they ’re used to -- oak , walnut , Douglas fir , ” he said .
“ Boring , boring , boring ! ”
In a floor Bjorklund constructed for Santa Barbara ’s Environmental Defense Coalition , the boards are multihued , fashioned from black walnut , black acacia , yellow acacia , sycamore , ash , pine and blue gum eucalyptus .
Last summer , he installed an all - eucalyptus floor -- a rarity given that the tree is often considered a nuisance -- for the Santa Barbara Contractors Assn .
“ It shows what can happen with local materials , ” said Dan George , the group ’s president .
“ We ’ve had classroom tours , architects and city officials come to look at it .
We ’re delighted . ”
One recent afternoon , Bjorklund was guiding the blade of his portable sawmill over a huge sycamore trunk .
His wife , Roxanne , was spritzing it with a hose to keep it cool .
Felix Pfirrmann , a woodworker from a German craft guild that occasionally sends Bjorklund temporary workers , was looking on .
Advertisement
“ It ’s stunning to see what treasures are under the bark , ” Pfirrmann said .
Bjorklund sliced a deep - red 300 - pound slab off the trunk like a chef carving a prime rib .
Asked what it would become , he did n’t know .
“ Something cool , ” he said .

Payment processor Heartland Payment Systems reported that it was the victim of a security breach within its processing system in 2008 .
For unknown reasons , the breach was reported on January 20 , 2009 -- inauguration day for the incoming President Obama administration .
Tens of millions of credit and debit card transactions may have been breached , making the Heartland incident one of the largest data breaches ever reported .
( Source : washingtonpost.com )
Heartland believes the intrusion is now contained and that no merchant information or cardholder Social Security numbers were compromised .
According to Heartland , no merchant data or cardholder Social Security numbers , unencrypted personal identification numbers ( PINs ) , addresses or telephone numbers were involved in the breach .
( Source : 2008 breach.com )
Credit card issuers , the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Department of Justice were notified of the intrusions .
Visa and MasterCard alerted Heartland of suspicious activity surrounding processed card transactions .
After enlisting the help of several forensic auditors to conduct a thorough investigation , malicious software that recorded payment card data as it was being sent for processing was discovered .
It 's unknown how long the malicious software was there , how it got there , or how many accounts may have been compromised .
The stolen data includes names , credit and debit card numbers and expiration dates -- including the digital information that is encoded onto the magnetic stripe on the backs of credit and debit cards .
Robert Baldwin , Heartland 's president and chief financial officer , said that Heartland processes payments for more than 250,000 businesses , but declined to name any clients affected by the breach .
Heartland processes about 100 million transactions a month .
In response to the crisis , the company created a website to provide information about the incident and is advising cardholders to examine their monthly statements closely , urging them to report any suspicious activity to their card issuers .
The cardholders are not responsible for unauthorized fraudulent charges made by third parties .

It 's been more than a year since my first endeavor to setup a healthy environment to deploy Django ( as I was rudely reminded by the Ubuntu repositories for my server 's version ceasing to function ) .
In that time I 've learned a lot , and have also stretched my original setup to its breaking point , but inevitably the day comes for a fresh deployment with better configurations and more flexible folder layouts .
From my last server setup guide , a number have things have remained the same : still using Ubuntu , Memcached , Postgres and still using Nginx as a proxy server infront of Apache2 .
A number of things have changed as well : using mod_wsgi over mod_python , cmemcache over python - memcached , and a more intentional folder layout along with virtualenv to make it straightforward to host multiple projects and domains ( including some serving only static files or PHP scripts ) .
More than just an update , I 've also included a few side - quests like using your server as a remote Git repository over SSH , and installing pluggable Django libraries .
Finally , in the vein of my previous tutorial , I tried to include every keystroke required to transform a naked Ubuntu Intrepid server into a full - featured multi-site Django - loving server .
Please let me know if you run into any problems , or have suggestions on improvements !
Somehow get a Ubuntu Intrepid server or VPS .
( Perhaps go to your SliceHost console and request a new Slice running Ubuntu Intrepid ( 8.10 ) . ;)
Write down root password and IP address for your box .
SSH into your server .
ssh root@255.255.255.255
Update your apt - get sources .
apt - get upgrade
Make sure there is an editor that suits your taste available on the system .
Vim is pre-installed , but I prefer Emacs ... apt - get install emacs
Setup any non -root accounts you want , and one for Django .
useradd django mkdir / home / django chown django : django / home / django useradd will mkdir / home / will chown will : will / home / will passwd will
Unless you like sh , change your default shell to something more humane .
chsh root -s / bin / bash chsh will -s / bin / bash chsh django -s / bin / bash ( These changes wo n't be applied until you log in the next time . )
Give your account ( but not Django ) root permissions .
visudo
Then use the down arrow for find a line that looks like this : root ALL = ( ALL ) ALL Replicate that with your username : root ALL = ( ALL ) ALL will ALL = ( ALL ) ALL
Open a second terminal ( leave the first one logged in while we keep configuring SSH , incase something goes horribly awry ) , and SSH in as your non -root user .
ssh will@255.255.255.255
Verify it works , then exit back to your system .
Now it 's time to setup password - less login .
Return to your home system , scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub will@255.255.255.255 :~/ ssh will@255.255.255.255 mkdir .ssh mv id_dsa.pub .ssh/authorized_keys chmod go-w ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
~/.ssh /
Now exit and ssh back in .
You should have been logged in without needing to supply your password .
Now it 's time to restrict ssh a bit .
sudo groupadd sshers sudo usermod - a - Gsshers will sudo emacs /etc/ssh / shhd_config
Make these changes : # X11 Forwarding yes X11 Forwarding no And add these lines to the end of the file : UseDNS no AllowGroups sshers
Save the file , and then restart the ssh service .
sudo / etc / init.d/ ssh restart exit your VPS , and once again try logging back in .
If that worked , again open / etc / ssh / sshd_config .
sudo emacs
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
And append this line to the end of the file : PasswordAuthentication no And once again restart the ssh service .
sudo /etc / init.d/ ssh restart Finally , disable password access to the root account .
sudo passwd -l root Now your VPS is only accessible through your approved account from machines with the correct SSH key .
Now it 's time to start installing some general libraries .
sudo apt - get install subversion git - core gcc curl sudo apt - get install build - essential python - dev python - setuptools sudo apt - get install python - egenix - mxdatetime memcached postfix
Now it 's time to configure Postgres , first we need to grab some libraries .
sudo apt - get install postgresql - 8.3 postgresql - server - dev - 8.3 sudo apt - get install postgresql - 8.3 postgresql - server - dev - 8.3
Rather than a typo , I really did need to run the above command twice for a successful installation .
Next we need to configure the postgres user .
sudo -u postgres psql template1 ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD ' password ' ; \q ( Make sure that you used a real password , rather than ' password ' in the above example . )
We also need to modify Postgres ' configuration file .
sudo emacs
/etc/ postgresql/8.3/main/pg_hba.conf
Move to the bottom of the file , and comment out ( add a # at the beginning of the line ) all lines which begin with host .
( This prevents external access to your database . )
It should look like this : # Database administrative login by UNIX sockets local all postgres ident sameuser # TYPE DATABASE USER CIDR - ADDRESS METHOD # " local " is for Unix domain socket connections only local all all password # IP v4 local connections : #host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5 # IP v6 local connections : #host all all ::1/128 md5
Note that we switched ident sameuser to password for the second local line !
Then restart Postgres to have it reload its settings .
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.3 restart
And there we have it , Postgres is setup and functioning .
And now it 's time to setup memcached .
This is a two part process .
First we need to start memcached , which is very easy , and second we need to build cmemcache , which is a bit harder .
sudo memcached -u www - data -p 11211 -m 32 -d
That runs memcached on the standard port , with the standard www - data user ( standard for Ubuntu , that is ) , with 32 megabytes of ram .
You might want to allocate more , depending on how much data you 're expecting to store in memcached , and the size of your VPS .
Next we need to setup cmemcache .
First grab libmemcache , sudo apt - get install libmemcache - dev
Next we actually build cmemcache .
su django mkdir ~/ libs / cd ~/libs / wget http://gijsbert.org/downloads/cmemcache/cmemcache-0.95.tar.bz2 tar - xjvf cmemcache -0.95.tar.bz2 cd cmemcache - 0.95 exit
We 'll need to actually install the library later when we setup our virtualenv .
If you are unable to install cmemcache , follow these instructions .
Alternatively , if you want to use the Python based python - memcached ( runs a bit slower , but no C module to build and install ) , you can do that as follows .
wget ftp://ftp.tummy.com/pub/python-memcached/python-memcached-latest.tar.gz tar - zxvf python - memcached - latest.tar cd python - memcached - 1.43 # later on use python setup.py install inside virtualenv
The preference for cmemcache is strictly based on speed .
But python - memcached is still quite usable , and if the choice is between python - memcached and not running memcached as your caching backend , picking python - memcached is the clear winner .
Next it 's time to setup Nginx , which is a lightweight server we 'll use to serve static content as well as proxy requests to Apache 21 .
sudo apt - get install nginx
We can quickly verify that it installed correctly .
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start curl 127.0.0.1
Should return : < html > < head > < title >
Welcome to nginx ! </ title > </ head > < body bgcolor= " white " text= " black " > < center >< h1 > Welcome to nginx !
</h1></center > </ body > </html >
Now we 're going to modify the nginx .
conf file a bit ( based on the advice here ) .
sudo emacs
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
Right now we only need to make two minor changes , first change line 2 to use four worker processes , worker_processes 4 ; And next uncomment line 18 , tcp_nopush on ;
We wo n't need to edit this file again , because of the last line , include / etc / nginx / sites - enabled / * ; which makes it easy to declare site specific settings in their own files , and really cuts down on clutter in nginx .conf .
We also need to create a proxy .
conf file , which is a common Nginx practice for keeping nginx .
conf clean .
sudo emacs
/etc/nginx/proxy.conf
Which should contain these lines : # proxy.conf proxy_redirect off ; proxy_set_header
Host $ host ; proxy_set_header X - Real - IP $ remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X - Forwarded - For $ proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; client_max_body_size 10 m ; client_body_buffer_size 128k ; proxy_connect_timeout 90 ; proxy_send_timeout 90 ; proxy_read_timeout 90 ; proxy_buffers 32 4 k ; Finally , stop and start Nginx ( I do n't know if this is still the case with the current version of Nginx , but historically I 've never gotten it to reload a configuration file with just a reload or restart ) .
sudo /etc/ init.d/ nginx stop sudo
/etc/init.d/nginx start
Now it 's time to setup Apache2 .
First we grab the necessary libraries .
sudo apt - get install apache2 libapache2 - mod- wsgi Because we already have Nginx bound on port 80 it will throw a bit of a complaint ( 98 ) Address already in use : make_sock : could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80 no listening sockets available , shutting down Unable to open logs ... fail !
invoke - rc.d : initscript apache2 , action " start " failed .
But no worries , we 're going to be alright .
The first thing we need to do is to setup Apache to run on the internal 127.0.0.1:80 instead of on port 80 .
sudo emacs
/etc/apache2/ports.confg
Then modify these lines : NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1 :80 Listen 127.0.0.1 :80
We also want to make a modification to apache2.conf : sudo emacs
/etc/apache2/apache2.conf
Search for KeepAlive ( it 's around line 77 ) , and change its value as follows : # KeepAlive On KeepAlive Off
We do this because Nginx does n't yet support the KeepAlive option .
Now let 's try starting Apache , again .
sudo apache2ctl start
Which may complain yet , again .
apache2 : Could not reliably determine the server 's fully qualified domain name , using 127.0.0.1 for ServerName [ Thu Feb 12 17:14:46 2009 ] [ warn ] NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80 has no VirtualHosts
But once , again , no worries , it 's just a phase in the process .
Finally we get to actually grab Django .
Switch over to the / home / django folder we created earlier , and it 's time for us to create some folders .
su django mkdir domains mkdir libs mkdir .
python - eggs exit
Then let 's do some permissions wrangling .
sudo chown django : www - data .
python -eggs sudo chmod g+w .
python-eggs / sudo usermod - a - G www - data django sudo usermod - a - G www - data will sudo chgrp - R www - data /home/django/ domains sudo chmod - R 2750 /home/django/ domains
Then let 's grab the Django source code .
cd libs svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/
django
Normally this would be a great time to symlink the packages into / usr / lib / python2.5 / site - packages , but we 're going to go a slightly different route instead and use virtualenv to encapsulate each of our projects .
sudo easy_install virtualenv
We 'll take care of setting up virtualenv later , because it is done on a per-project basis .
Our last step of generic preparation is to remove the default sites for both Apache and Nginx .
With properly configured setup files for Nginx / Apache ( we 'll get to those soon ;) you wo n't run into many situations where you are accidentally showing the default pages , but they often will be displayed when visiting the page directly via it 's IP address .
While that is n't a terribly common event , it 's probably undesirable nonetheless .
sudo rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled / default sudo rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled /default sudo rm /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled /default
You 'll need to restart the server for the changes to take effect .
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx stop sudo
/etc/init.d/nginx start sudo apache2ctl graceful
The MS09 -002 exploit that we posted a diary about two days ago ( http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=5884) was initially introduced to the target as a Word document .
This confused a lot of people as the vulnerability is really in Internet Explorer ( it has nothing to do with Microsoft Word ) , but the attackers used an interesting trick which probably helped a lot as the infection vector .
The attackers created a Word document which was an XML file .
Microsoft Office supports XML documents for quite some time already and you can normally save any document as XML .
These are fully featured Word documents which means that they can have references to various objects .
And this is exactly what the attacker used – what makes it easier is the fact that you can change the extension to .DOC and Word will happily render it .
The screenshot below shows a part of the exploit used with MS09 - 002 ( I have deliberately removed part of the URL ) :
The XML document creates a reference to an object with class ID of AE24FDAE - 03C6 - 11D1-8B76-0080C744F389 .
This object is a reference to mshtml.dll which features Internet Explorer ’s HTML rendering engine .
In other words , it will make Word connect to the target web page and render it inside the document , without requiring absolutely any user interaction !
As you can guess , since it uses Internet Explorer ’s engine , the exploit will get executed unless the machine has been patched against the MS09 - 002 vulnerability .
The w:data tag in this sample just contains the BASE64 encoded URL to the exploit .
While researching this I found two more interesting things :
First , this way of rendering HTML web pages work in fully patched Microsoft Word 2007 .
This is pretty nasty considering that people can make your web browser render any content on any web page just by opening a Word document .
This technique , though , appears to be well known since May 2008 though .
Second , the XML document contains the timestamp of when it was created .
While this field can be obviously very easily spoofed , the date it contains is 6th of February 2009 , which is before Microsoft released the patch .
This could mean that the exploit was known to the attacker before and that there was no reverse engineering of the patch involved as I initially thought .
So , to wrap this up – make sure that your client machines are fully patched but also pay attention to e-mails you receive .
Remember that this was sent as a .DOC file , but contained plain text ( XML ) tags .
It makes one wonder how many AV programs fail to properly render this ( there are signatures for this specific file ) .

With the axing of the CNN Science News team , most science stories at CNN are now being given to general assignment reporters who do n’t necessarily have the background to know when they are being taken for a ride .
On the Lou Dobbs show ( an evening news program on cable for those of you not in the US ) , the last few weeks have brought a series of embarrassing non-stories on ‘ global cooling ’ based it seems on a few cold snaps this winter , the fact that we are at a solar minimum and a regurgitation of 1970s vintage interpretations of Milankovitch theory ( via Pravda of all places ! ) .
Combine that with a few hysterical ( in both senses ) non-scientists as talking heads and you end up with a repeat of the nonsensical ‘ Cooling world ’ media stories that were misleading in the 1970s and are just as misleading now .
Exhibit A. Last night ’s ( 13 Jan 2009 ) transcript ( annotations in italics ) .
Note that this is a rush transcript and the typos are n’t attributable to the participants .
DOBBS : Welcome back .
Global warming is a complex , controversial issue and on this broadcast we have been critical of both sides in this debate .
We ’ve challenged the orthodoxy surrounding global warming theories and questioned more evidence on the side of the Ice Age and prospect in the minds of some .
In point of fact , research , some of it , shows that we could be heading toward cooler temperatures , and it ’s a story you will only see here on LOU DOBBS TONIGHT .
Ines Ferre has our report .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
INES FERRE , CNN CORRESPONDENT ( voice - over ) :
Will the day after tomorrow bring a deep freeze like that shown in the movie ?
Research more than 50 years ago by astrophysicist Milanchovich ( ph ) shows that ice ages run in predictable cycles and the earth could go into one .
How soon ?
In science terms it could be thousands of years .
But what happens in the next decade is still up in the air .
Part of the science community believes that global warming is a man -maid threat .
But Dennis Avery of the Hudson Institute predicts the next 20 to 30 years will actually bring cooling temperatures .
Dennis Avery is part of the ‘ science community ’ ?
Who knew ?
And , while amusing , the threat of ‘ man - maids ’ causing global warming is just a typo .
Nice thought though .
Oh , and if you want to know what the actual role of Milankovitch in forcing climate is , look at the IPCC FAQ Q6.1 .
Its role in current climate change ?
Zero .
DENNIS AVERY , HUDSON INSTITUTE :
The earth ’s temperatures have dropped an average of .6 Celsius in the last two years .
The Pacific Ocean is telling us , as it has told us 10 times in the past 400 years , you ’re going to get cooler .
For those unfamiliar with Dennis Avery , he is a rather recent convert to the bandwagon idea of global cooling , having very recently been an advocate of “ unstoppable ” global warming .
As for his great cherry pick ( 0.6 º C in two years – we ’re doomed ! ) , this appears to simply be made up .
Even putting aside the nonsense of concluding anything from a two year trend , if you take monthly values and start at the peak value at the height of the last El Niño event of January 2007 and do no actual trend analysis , I can find no data set that gives a drop of 0.6ºC .
Even UAH MSU - LT gives only 0.4ºC .
The issue being not that it has n’t been cooler this year than last , but why make up numbers ?
This is purely rhetorical of course , they make up numbers because they do n’t care about whether what they say is true or not .
FERRE : Avery points to a lack of sunspots as a predictor for lower temperatures , saying the affects of greenhouse gas warming have a small impact on climate change .
Believers in global warming , like NASA researcher , Dr. Gavin Schmidt disagree .
I was interviewed on tape in the afternoon , without seeing any of the other interviews .
Oh , and what does a ‘ believer in global warming ’ even mean ?
DR . GAVIN SCHMIDT , NASA :
The long term trend is clearly toward warming , and those trends are completely dwarf any changes due to the solar cycle .
FERRE :
In a speech last week , President - elect Obama called for the creation of a green energy economy .
Still , others warn that no matter what you think about climate change , new policies would essentially have no effect .
FRED SINGER , SCIENCE & ENV .
POLICY PROJECT : There ’s very little we can do about it .
Any effort to restrict the use of carbon dioxide will hurt us economically and have zero effect on the Chicago mate .
Surely another typo , but maybe the Chicago mate is something to do with the man-maids ?
See here for more background on Singer .
FERRE : As Singer says , a lot of pain , for no gain .
Huh ?
Try looking at the actual numbers from a recent McKinsey report .
How is saving money through efficiency a ‘ pain ’ ?
( END VIDEOTAPE )
FERRE :
And three independent research groups concluded that the average global temperature in 2008 was the ninth or tenth warmest since 1850 , but also since the coldest since the turn of the 21st century .
DOBBS : It ’s fascinating and nothing — nothing — stirs up the left , the right , and extremes in this debate , the orthodoxy that exists on both sides of the debate than to even say global warming .
It ’s amazing .
This is an appeal to the ‘ middle muddle ’ and an attempt to seem like a reasonable arbitrator between two opposing sides .
But as many people have previously noted , there is no possible compromise between sense and nonsense .
2+2 will always equal 4 , no matter how much the Hudson Institute says otherwise .
FERRE :
When I spoke to experts and scientists today from one side and the other , you could feel the kind of anger about —
That was probably me .
Though it ’s not anger , it ’s simple frustration that reporters are being taken in and treating seriously the nonsense that comes out of these think - tanks .
DOBBS : Cannot we just all get along ?
Ines , thank you very much .
Joining me now three leading experts in Manchester , New Hampshire , we ’re joined by Joseph D’Aleo of the International Climate and Environmental Change Assessment Project .
Good to have with you us .
JOSEPH D’ALEO , CO - FOUNDER WEATHER CHANNEL :
Thank you , Lou .
DOBBS : He ’s also the cofounder of The Weather Channel .
In Washington , D.C. , as you see there , Jay Lehr , he ’s the science director of the Heartland Institute .
And in Boston , Alex Gross , he ’s the cofounder of co2stats.com .
Good to have you with us .
Well that ’s balanced !
Let ’s put a few numbers out here , the empirical discussion and see what we can make of it .
First is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has very good records on temperatures , average temperatures in the United States , dating back to 1880 .
And here ’s what these numbers look like .
You ’ve all seen those .
But help us all — the audience and most of all me to get through this , they show the warmest years on record , 1998 , 2006 , and 1934 .
2008 was cooler , in fact the coolest since 1997 .
It ’s intriguing to see that graph there .
The graph we ’re looking at showing some question that the warming trend may be just a snapshot in time .
The global temperatures by NOAA are seven of the eight warmest years on record have occurred since 2001 .
The ten warmest years have all occurred since 1995 .
So let me start , if I may , Joseph , your reaction to those numbers .
Do you quibble with what they represent ?
D’ALEO : Yes , I do .
In fact , if you look at the satellite data , which is the most reliable data , the best coverage of the globe , 2008 was the 14th coldest in 30 years .
That does n’t jive with the tenth warmest in 159 years in the Hadley data set or 113 or 114 years in the NOAA data set .
Those global data sets are contaminated by the fact that two - thirds of the globe ’s stations dropped out in 1990 .
Most of them rural and they performed no urban adjustment .
And , Lou , you know , and the people in your studio know that if they live in the suburbs of New York City , it ’s a lot colder in rural areas than in the city .
Now we have more urban effect in those numbers reflecting — that show up in that enhanced or exaggerated warming in the global data set .
D’Aleo is misdirecting through his teeth here .
He knows that the satellite analyses have more variability over ENSO cycles than the surface records , he also knows that urban heat island effects are corrected for in the surface records , and he also knows that this does n’t effect ocean temperatures , and that the station dropping out does n’t affect the trends at all ( you can do the same analysis with only stations that remained and it makes no difference ) .
Pure disinformation .
DOBBS : Your thoughts on these numbers .
Because they are intriguing .
They are a brief snapshot admittedly , in comparison to total extended time .
I guess we could go back 4.6 billion years .
Let ’s keep it in the range of something like 500,000 years .
What ’s your reaction to those numbers and your interpretation ?
JAY LEHR , HEARTLAND INSTITUTE : Well , Lou —
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I ’m sorry .
DOBBS : Go ahead , Jay .
LEHR : Lou , I ’m in the camp with Joe and Fred Singer and Dennis Avery , and I think more importantly , it is to look at the sun ’s output , and in recent years , we ’ve seen very , very low sunspot activity , and we are definitely , in my mind , not only in a cooling period , we ’re going to be staying in it for a couple decades , and I see it as a major advantage , although I think we will be able to adapt to it .
I ’m hopeful that this change in the sun ’s output will put some common sense into the legislature , not to pass any dramatic cap in trade or carbon tax legislation that will set us in a far deeper economic hole .
I believe Mr. Obama and his economic team are well placed to dig us out of this recession in the next 18 months to 2 years , but I think if we pass any dramatic legislation to reduce greenhouse gases , the recession will last quite a few more years and we ’ll come out of it with a lower standard of living on very tenuous scientific grounds .
DOBBS : Alex , the carbon footprint , generation of greenhouse gases , specifically co2 , the concern focusing primarily on the carbon footprint , and of course generated by fossil fuels primarily , what is your thinking as you look at that survey of 130 — almost 130 years and the impact on the environment ?
ALEX WISSNER - GROSS , CO2STATS .COM : Well , Lou , I think regardless of whatever the long - term trend in the climate data is , there a long - term technological trend which is that as time goes on our technology tends toward smaller and smaller physical footprint .
That means in part that in the long term we like technology to have a smaller environmental footprint , burning fewer greenhouse gases and becoming as small and environmentally neutral and noninvasive as possible .
So I think regardless of the climate trend , I think we ’ll see less and less environmentally impactful technologies .
Wissner - Gross is on because of the media attention given to misleading reports about the carbon emissions related to Google searches .
Shame he does n’t get to talk about any of that .
DOBBS : To be straight forward about this , that ’s where I come down .
I do n’t know it matters to me whether there is global warming or we ’re moving toward an ice age it seems really that we should be reasonable stewards of the planet and the debate over whether it ’s global warming or whether it ’s moving toward perhaps another ice age or business as usual is almost moot here in my mind .
I know that will infuriate the advocates of global warming as well as the folks that believe we are headed toward another ice age .
What ’s your thought ?
Curious train of logic there …
D’ALEO : I agree with you , Lou .
We need conservation .
An all of the above solution for energy , regardless of whether we ’re right and it cools over the next few decades or continues to warm , a far less dangerous scenario .
And that means nuclear .
It means coal , oil , natural gas .
Geothermal , all of the above .
DOBBS : Jay , you made the comment about the impact of solar sunspot activity .
Sunspot activity the 11 - year cycle that we ’re all familiar with .
There are much larger cycles , 12,000 to 13,000 years as well .
We also heard a report disregard , if you will , for the strength and significance of solar activity on the earth ’s environment .
How do you respond to that ?
Is he talking about me ?
Please see some of my publications on the subject from 2006 , 2004 and 2001 .
My point above was that relative to current greenhouse gas increases , solar is small – not that it is unimportant or uninteresting .
This of course is part of the false dilemma ‘ single cause ’ argument that the pseudo - skeptics like to use – that change must be caused by either solar or greenhouse gases and that any evidence for one is evidence against the other .
This is logically incoherent .
FEHR : It just seems silly to not recognize that the earth ’s climate is driven by the sun .
Ah yes .
Your Chad Myers pointed out it ’s really arrogant to think that man controls the climate .
This is a misquoted reference to a previous segment a few weeks ago where Myers was discussing the impact of climate on individual weather patterns .
But man ’s activities do affect the climate and are increasingly controlling its trends .
90 percent of the climate is water vapor which we have no impact over and if we were to try to reduce greenhouse gases with China and India controlling way more than we do and they have boldly said they are not going to cripple their economy by following suit , our impact would have no — no change in temperature at all in Europe they started carbon — capping trade in 2005 .
They ’ve had no reduction in groan house gases , but a 5 percent to 10 percent increase in the standard of living .
We do n’t want to go that route .
What ?
Accounting for the garbled nature of this response , he was probably trying to say that 90 % of the greenhouse effect is caused by water vapour .
This is both wrong and , even were it true , irrelevant .
DOBBS : Alex , you get the last word here .
Are you as dismissive of the carbon footprint as measured by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ?
GROSS : No , not really .
But I think in the long term , efficiency is where the gains come from .
I think efficiency should come first , carbon footprint second .
DOBBS : Thank you very much .
Alex , Jay , and Joe .
Folks , appreciate you being with us .
FEHR : Thank you .
The oceans have long buffered the effects of climate change by absorbing a substantial portion of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide .
But this benefit has a catch : as the gas dissolves , it makes seawater more acidic .
Now an international panel of marine scientists says this acidity is accelerating so fast it threatens the survival of coral reefs , shellfish and the marine food web generally .
The panel , comprising 155 scientists from 26 countries and other international groups , is not the first to point to growing ocean acidity as an environmental threat .
For example , a group of eminent scientists convened by The Nature Conservancy issued a similar assessment in August .
But the new report ’s blunt language and international backing give its assessment unusual force .
It called for “ urgent action ” to sharply reduce emissions of carbon dioxide .
“ Severe damages are imminent , ” the group said Friday in a statement summing up its deliberations at a symposium in Monaco last October .
The statement , called the Monaco Declaration , said increasing acidity was interfering with the growth and health of shellfish and eating away at coral reefs , processes that would eventually affect marine food webs generally .
Already , the group said , there have been detectable decreases in shellfish and shell weights , and interference with the growth of coral skeletons .

More than a quarter of the nation ’s bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete .
Leaky pipes lose an estimated seven billion gallons of clean drinking water every day .
And aging sewage systems send billions of gallons of untreated wastewater cascading into the nation ’s waterways each year .
These are among the findings of a report to be released Wednesday by the American Society of Civil Engineers , which assigned an overall D grade to the nation ’s infrastructure and estimated that it would take a $ 2.2 trillion investment from all levels of government over the next five years to bring it into a state of good repair .
The society had planned to release the report in March , but moved it up to try to influence the debate over the $ 825 billion economic stimulus bill being negotiated by the Obama administration and Congress .
Advocates for greater investment in public works projects have expressed disappointment that less than a third of the current proposal  which could be approved by the House on Wednesday  would be spent on infrastructure , and an even smaller part of that would go toward traditional concrete - and - steel projects like roads and transit .
“ Crumbling infrastructure has a direct impact on our personal and economic health , and the nation ’s infrastructure crisis is endangering our future prosperity , ” the president of the society , D. Wayne Klotz , said in a statement .
“ Our leaders are looking for solutions to the nation ’s current economic crisis .
Not only could investment in these critical foundations have a positive impact , but if done responsibly , it would also provide tangible benefits to the American people , such as reduced traffic congestion , improved air quality , clean and abundant water supplies and protection against natural hazards . ”

was going to save my life .
Like most , I instantly heraldedas a brilliant masterstroke , along with the fine , efficient Japanese workhorses responsible for such an ingenious and useful product .
After all , here was a video game conglomerate using its powers for good .
Inventing the cardio - friendly Wii was n’t enough on its own ; they actually went the extra step and attempted ( and succeeded ) to make exercising super fun and original .
It was , for me , one of the brightest spots of 2008 .
While American car companies were busy blowing smoke up our asses about going Green , while simultaneously begging for billions because they missed the Green Boat years ago and watched their consumers turn away from a fleet of obsolete automobiles , here was a multi-billion dollar company that saw an open and evolved market , tackled it in a new and exciting way , and also slimmed down a few fat - ass gamers in the process .
was a success in every possible way .
I purchasedmere days after it was released .
In an almost identical fashion as to how I stumbled upon a Wii , I was in the right place at the right time , threw it into my cart and hit the road .
was going to change me .
It was going to save me the cash of buying into a Health Club , save me the burden of packing a duffel bag and leaving my home , track my progress , whip me back into fighting shape and be a whole lot of fun in the interim .
$ 100 well spent , if you asked me .
My first week withwas a complete success .
I plowed through the Yoga poses , mastered the balance games , jogged in place , worked up a sweat and lost nearly three pounds in the first eight days .
I had an after - work routine in place , and much like the first week spent in a Health Club , I felt extremely good about myself .
I finally found something I could stick to ; something that worked for me .
Almost a year removed now , andsits underneath my television , nearly as new as the day I bought it .
Apart from two unrelated and random workout sessions ( including one that took place while I was eating a slice of thick - crust Domino ’s pizza ) , I have n’t touched the thing since the first week I bought it , and I ’m not alone .
Human beings like the idea of Change .
We love planning for Change ; we love fantasizing about the end results of said Change , but tend to forget about the middle part which requires the most effort .
We ’re more than happy to throw hundreds of dollars at the Health Club membership , the jogging outfit , the new shoes , the water bottle and iPod ; but when the time comes to put that preparation and positive attitude towards … you know … the thing that gets you from Point A to Point B , we tend to lose steam and once again attempt to determine the Path of Least Resistance .
After all , preparation for positive change is the funnest part .
We all certainly know how to spend money .
Spending money is easy , and we love finding excuses to do it ; excuses that make us feel like we ’re accomplishing something noble .
In this case , a new iPod or track shoes wo n’t suck the belly fat off of our torsos or tuck the second chin back into our necks all on their own , but the idea that they will is present when we justify our rationalizations .
After all , if it ’s worth doing , it ’s worth doing right , right ?
In this regard , thetucked under the television is the Basement Treadmill of the New Millennium .
The Bowflex that we hang our clothes on .
The NordicTrack that we sold at a garage sale for $ 20 , which now sits unused in someonebasement .
And why ?
Was it because we lacked the self - control and determination needed to commit to an act as difficult and tedious as weight loss and muscle conditioning ?
Was it because we realized early that we were in way over our heads ; that we did n’t fully realize how much we had to break our irresponsible daily routines to make way for such dedication ?
Well , of course not .
Besides , it ’s ’s fault for not planning our exercises and scheduling everything out for us like a real - life Personal Trainer would .
Taking away the variables of variety and allowing us to slack .
Not literally pulling us off of the couch and onto the Balance Board .
Calling us obese when we first stepped onto the scale .
Not our fault , nope .
Besides , I do n’t have time for this .
I need to look for instant results ; I ’ve heard that getting your stomach stapled can be done on an outpatient basis now !
This is typical , normal , and indicative of moments we ’ve all probably experienced at least a dozen times .
It does n’t mean that you ’re a loser or quitter ( well , it kind of does , I guess ) ; it just means that you were n’t up to that particular challenge at that particular time .
Maybe another time , maybe a slightly different challenge .
Hey , if it needs to be done , it ’ll get done .
Millions of years of Human Evolution have brought us to this point ; we ’re a versatile bunch and we ’ll damn sure rise to any challenge …eventually .
Most of us - not all of us , but most - have a basement treadmill .
Athat ’s still in the box .
Some sort of glaring monument to our lack of commitment to something that , at one time , seemed so important to us .
Something we ’ve turned our backs on because it was too difficult .
Because our priorities have changed .
Because we stopped caring .
Because we ’ve lacked the determination and foresight to maintain an eye on the eventual goal .
One of the reasons that we ’re so prone to turn our backs on something we ’ve failed at is to save face .
After all , who wants to admit personal defeat ?
The frustration here lies not in the money spent on a toy that ’s not being used , but the embarrassment in knowing that the toy reminded you of your shortcomings as a person .
We do n’t like to be reminded of that stuff , and rightfully so .
Who would want to admit that they ’re just not motivated and determined enough to lose the weight , quit smoking , become a better spouse or merely lay off the meth a squinch ?
After all the effort , all the optimistic , borderline - delusional glimpses into our future , to fall short is usually too much of a bummer to revel in for an extended period of time , so we just make a pithy excuse and move on to our next project .
And why would n’t we ?
It ’s an instinctual defense mechanism ; I ’m not going to let a goddamnremind me that I ’m weak .
I ’ll return it and buy a game that I can .
I ’m still in charge , here .
In these instances , we ’ve been taught that this is the precise difference between winners and losers in Life .
Losers do exactly what I described : make an excuse for their shortcomings , tuck tail and run .
While winners do the opposite and valiantly fight back , persevere and shine through .
They throw the cigarettes in the trash .
They flush the cookies and meth down the toilet .
They strap on the sweatbands and make that Balance Board their Prison Bitch for the next eight months straight .
Truth is , however , it ai n’t that black and white .
There can be a certain degree of nobility in quitting , and there can also be failure in the perception of individual success .
The perfect personal example that springs to my mind was my big health kick of 2007 .
After competing ( and totally succeeding ) in my first 10 K run in 2006 ( on a last - minute dare , I might add ) , I realized that not only was I able to knock out anything that I could put my mind and body into , but that I was kinda sorta good at it , too .
So in 2007 , I literally hit the pavement running , armed with the optimistic knowledge that I ’ve seen the top of the mountain once before , and I could probably do it again in half the time with the proper motivation .
A month later , and I was diagnosed with shin splints in both legs , and a fractured tibia that I actually ran three miles on before completely blowing it out during a 5 K .
From that day forward , there ’s still considerable pain in my ankles when any pressure is applied , and my running days are as good as over .
Like it or not , I ’m probably never going to be able to compete in distance running ever again ; something that I was once pretty good at .
So I threw the track shoes and jogging pants into the closet and moved on , happy as a Christmas Clam that I pushed myself that far and saw what I was made of .
It was n’t the happiest ending imaginable , but I emerged from the fiasco stronger than ever , based solely on the fact that I went outside of my comfort zone ( and straight into Physical Therapy and an MRI machine ) .
I failed miserably on an external level , but boosted my confidence and self - faith exponentially .
So , what ’s the point , here ?
What ’s to be learned from these experiences ; these little tests of self - will ?
Is it about picking your battles wisely , or merely the lessons learned from their outcomes ?
Probably a little bit of both , provided you at least make a concerted effort to take something positive away from every success or failure .
You know me pretty well by now .
My entire life ( and subsequently , my entire writing career ) has been about making mistakes and learning from them .
Stumbling ass - first into bad luck and attempting to laugh it off .
Bruising up the ego a bit , but remaining intact as a constantly evolving human being .
I ’ll be the first to admit that it ’s all one huge defense mechanism set in place to keep me from stepping in front of a cement mixer , but hey , sometimes that ’s all we have .
So , here comes the part of the essay where I attempt to tie this in somehow with the Inauguration of our new President , and the current message of self - motivation for the long - term outcome of positive national and global change .
Let ’s be real .
We probably wo n’t live to see an Earth that somehow got Global Warming under control through a massive Tipping Point concerning major ecological and environmental breakthroughs .
We probably wo n’t live to see an Earth where things like racism , homophobia and ethnic stereotyping become truly obsolete , instead of merely ignored ( and do n’t pretend it ’s not ) .
For you agnostics and atheists out there , we certainly wo n’t live to see an Earth where the irrelevance of un-evolved religions are left in the Stone Age , ushering us into a veritable Renaissance of culture , forward thinking and global peace .
For these reasons alone , it may seem for some like a waste of time to venture along this rough evolutionary path , knowing full well that we ’ll never be able to visualize and reap the fruits of our labor .
Just do whatever makes you feel good and does n’t hurt anyone in the process .
Live your life , take care of your family , and that ’s it .
But it has to start somewhere .
It has to start sometime .
What better place than here ?
What better time than now ?
Rage Against The Machine was , man !
Why did n’t we appreciate them before they broke up and kind of got back together again when the royalty checks ran dry ?
Damn !
Look , we ’re a nation of nearly a billion people , and it ’s almost frightening how easy it is to make a drastic difference and change the perception of the majority .
Hell , depending on what you believe , you probably represent the majority right about now ( and believe me , I feel just as uncomfortable about that as you do , assuredly ) .
Not to get too philosophical and sentimental here , but on Inauguration Tuesday , I felt as if I finally saw the official beginning of the 21st Century .
The New Millennium , to me , finally began in January of 2009 , and it brought with it the idea that in the face of failure and uncertainty , there were lessons to be learned and optimism to be mined from their experiences .
Still no jetpacks or Hamburger Earmuffs , but I feel like we ’re finally in the Future that I envisioned as a kid .
And quite frankly , I very much preferred the symbolic start of the 21st Century in comparison to the actual January 1 of 2000 , which found me vomitous , reeking of vodka and passed out on a filthy mattress in an unfinished basement after being duct - taped to a hot water pipe .
True , sad story .
I ’m going to wrap this up before the preaching gets any thicker than it already is , but I ’ll say that things never evolve if they never up and fail .
Things never change if you ignore them and take them for granted .
The Wii Fit ca n’t help you if it ’s tucked underneath the television ; the treadmill can’t help you if it ’s in the basement ; the major changes that we want to see made in our world ca n’t happen if we just assume that someone ’s handling it for us .
If you fail , you fail .
At least you know what you were capable of .
This life is n’t a dress rehearsal ; if there ’s something you ’ve always wanted to do , but for whatever reason , abandoned it out of fear of failure or situational apathy , why not now to try again ?
Spring is coming .
Do something .
Anything .
It does n’t matter how insignificant it appears .
Me ?
I ’m pulling theback out .

Like any thrilled mother to be , Michelle Stepney cherished the first kicks she could feel from her unborn babies .
But her lively twin girls were doing more than simply making their presence felt .
Each little kick was saving their mother 's life .
Scroll down for more ...
Unknown to her , Mrs Stepney , 35 , had developed cervical cancer .
Her unborn twins ' constant kicking in the womb actually managed to dislodge the tumour .
It was only when Mrs Stepney was taken to hospital with a suspected miscarriage that doctors realised she had cancer .
They told her the babies had saved her life .
Without them , the cancer may not have been discovered until it was too late .
Then came another bombshell .
In order to treat the cancer , she needed immediate chemotherapy and a hysterectomy , which would mean terminating the pregnancy .
Mrs Stepney refused .
" I could n't believe it when the doctors told me that the babies had dislodged the tumour , " she said .
" I 'd felt them kicking , but I did n't realise just how important their kicking would turn out to be .
" I owe my life to my girls , and that 's why I could have never agreed with a termination . "
Instead , she waited for her lifesaving treatment until they had been born .
Now the proud mother of year - old girls Alice and Harriet , Mrs Stepney has been given the all - clear .
She and her husband Scott , 36 , a civil servant , were told they were expecting twins at a 14 - week scan .
The couple , who also have a five - year - old son , Jack , were thrilled .
But three weeks later , Mrs Stepney was back at the hospital with a suspected miscarriage .
" I was just in shock when the doctors told me what it was .
When they said that the babies had literally kicked my tumour out , I just could n't believe it .
" If I had n't been pregnant with the twins , the cancer may not have been discovered until it was too late .
" I knew I could have an operation straight away and it would cure me of the cancer , but that would mean getting rid of my babies and I could n't do that .
" I had two lives inside me and I just could n't give up on them - especially after they had saved me like this . "
Doctors at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London agreed to give Mrs Stepney reduced chemotherapy in the hope of stopping the cancer spreading during the pregnancy .
" The doctors had tried this with women who were pregnant before , but they had n't treated a woman with twins before .
I knew it was our only hope , " she said at her home in Cheam , South - West London .
She had chemotherapy every fortnight and was constantly scanned to monitor the babies ' development .
" The doctors did n't know what the chemotherapy would do to the twins , and the first time I had it , I dreaded what it was doing to the girls .
But they actually carried on growing well . "
The twins were delivered by caesarean - section 33 weeks into the pregnancy , in December 2006 .
Alice weighed 3lb 11 oz and Harriet 3lb 5 oz .
" They were born without any hair as a result of the chemotherapy , but other than that , they were healthy .
" When I heard them both let out a cry it was the best sound in the world . "
Four weeks later Mrs Stepney had a hysterectomy to remove the tumour .
Tests showed the cancer had not spread .
The twins have just celebrated their first birthday and are thriving .
Mrs Stepney , an accountant , had a scan in December which showed she was still free from cancer .
She has been nominated for a Woman of Courage award by Cancer Research UK Race for Life and will be honoured at a ceremony in London on February 12 .
" I 've had wonderful support from my husband and I could n't have got through it without him , " she said .
" I feel so lucky .
And one day I will tell my daughters how they saved their mummy 's life . "
UT investment boss quits in flap over pay , losses UTIMCO chairman resigns as legislators criticize board

AUSTIN —
An influential businessman resigned as chairman of the agency that manages higher education investments Thursday amid questions about why fund managers received $ 2.3 million in performance bonuses when the investments lost $ 2.5 billion last year .
Republican and Democratic members of the Senate finance committee accused the University of Texas Investment Management Co. board of directors of “ shattering ” the public trust for a $ 1.05 million bonus given to UTIMCO President Bruce Zimmerman plus another $ 1.3 million given to the rest of the staff .
“ When I go home to my district , I visit with people who no longer have a job ; people who are scared of losing their job , ” said state Sen.
Kevin Eltife , R - Tyler .
“ Now the headlines all across the state will be that state government gave $ 2.3 million in bonuses to administrators of a fund that is down 27 percent .
It shatters the trust in government . ”
When Eltife told UTIMCO Chairman Robert Rowling , a university regent , that the board should have negotiated a smaller bonus for Zimmerman or fired him for taking the larger bonus , Rowling quit on the spot .
“ You know what , you can have my job .
I resign .
I ’m out of here , ” ’ Rowling said .
“ You come here and you abuse him ( Zimmerman ) .
We did what was right .
We felt like we had an obligation . ”
Rowling explained that the bonuses were based on annual performance in staff contracts that ended in June .
And in June , Rowling said , the Permanent University Fund and the General Endowment Fund were both in the black .
The board in November voted for the bonuses , he added , despite more recent losses because there was a feeling UTIMCO had a contract obligating payment of the bonuses .
The value of UTIMCO investments on Nov. 30 , 2008 , was $ 18.3 billion .
How contract interpreted
State Sen. Royce West , D - Dallas , said he read the contract to mean the board had to consider giving bonuses , but was not obligated to do so .
Rowling is the founder of TRT Holdings , owner of the Omni Hotel chain .
A major Republican campaign donor , he was appointed by Gov. Rick Perry as a UT regent .
Fellow regents appointed him to the UTIMCO board , which elected him chairman .
Zimmerman told senators university investments were down 27 percent through Dec. 31 , but he said the Standard & Poor 500 was down 35 percent and non-U.S. equities were down 45 percent .
“ We were very disappointed with a 27 percent loss .
But in the context of the market place , we feel like we did our job in protecting capital to the extent that it could be protected , ” Zimmerman said .
Finance Chairman Steve Ogden , R - Bryan noted that executives at the Teacher Retirement System of Texas , because of losses in that fund , did not receive bonuses they were due this past year .
Perry and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst sent a letter to the UTIMCO board objecting to the bonuses .
“ We find it hardly defensible to issue bonuses of this size during a time when state agencies are being asked to tighten their belts , and Texans across the state are facing difficult personal budget decisions , ” the joint letter said .

Vince Cable : ' Bring back the guillotine ... for bankers '
CABLE : ' The unfettered greed and rewards for stupidity and failure which have been exposed in the City leave a very bad taste in everyone 's mouth '
The crass behaviour of Britain ’s financial aristocracy rivals the last of the Bourbons .
Marie Antoinette famously patronised the Parisian mob with her ‘ let them eat cake ’ , while dining in luxury in the Tuileries .
The City bankers who ruined their banks but have been kept in employment by the taxpayer now demand we pay them their bonuses to maintain the aristocratic lifestyle to which they have become accustomed .
They know no shame and take no blame .
They are lucky the British have no guillotines in stock .
Is the public outrage simply the politics of envy ?
I think not .
Most of us have no problem with successful entrepreneurs earning lots of money .
They rightly command respect , as the backbone of a healthy , private enterprise system .
The bonus - hunting bankers , by contrast , stand charged with destroying wealth on an epic scale .
Foolish , greedy , irresponsible behaviour and excessive risk - taking led to massive losses and the crisis in the banking system which is now costing millions their jobs and many their homes .
Why should such failure be rewarded ?
The banks were deemed ‘ too big to fail ’ .
Otherwise , the bankers would be on the dole .
The Royal Bank of Scotland / NatWest has a balance sheet – assets and liabilities – much bigger than the British economy .
It is one of the biggest banks in the world .
Had it been allowed to go bankrupt , it would have caused massive destruction : the financial equivalent of detonating an H - bomb .
So the Government had to step in , using taxpayers ’ money to buy shares .
The chief culprit , the bank ’s former chief executive Sir Fred ‘ The Shred ’ Goodwin , has disappeared with his millions .
But most senior executives and the whizzkids in the investment banking arm whose trading activities with billions of pounds of ‘ toxic ’ paper lie at the heart of the present crisis , have remained .
Managers now seek their ‘ bonuses ’ , arguing that their unique skills are needed to dig the bank out of the hole they created .
This is a little like the managers of a hospital with a terrible record of poor hygiene and premature deaths surviving the sack , then demanding more money as an incentive to improve .
Other banks , less in the spotlight , incubate the same culture of excessive pay .
It was revealed last week that Barclays pays a man £ 40 million to legally avoid British taxes – the ultimate insult to taxpayers who have to underwrite the bank .
When I debated these issues with a leading hedge fund manager on Newsnight , he argued that there is a ‘ market ’ rate and we have to pay it to attract the best people to clean up the mess .
I understand the pragmatic approach , but it is wrong .
There are more bankers than banking jobs .
Large numbers are being laid off .
Those who remain are lucky to be in work .
Nor are there easy pickings overseas .
The Obama Administration is cracking down on bonuses in the US .
Even the banker - friendly Swiss government has now slashed bonuses in the banks it had to rescue .
Sir Fred ' The Shred ' Goodwin , the former head of Royal Bank Of Scotland , presided over the company as it plunged to losses of £ 28bn
In this new world , those running the Government - subsidised or guaranteed banks are public servants , in the same position as the top managers of the NHS or the immigration service or the prison service .
The head of the NHS , the fourth - biggest employer in the world , is paid £ 220,000 a year , an extremely good salary but way below what the City bankers have come to expect .
The Government will have to be firm and stop dithering on the sidelines appealing plaintively to them to behave , like a weak teacher struggling to control an unruly class .
First , the pay and benefits of all employees in publicly supported institutions should be fully declared .
Anyone paid over , say , £ 100,000 , should have their remuneration made public .
Just as MPs are being called to account on careless policing of expenses and generous pension arrangements , so should others who benefit from the taxpayers ’ support .
Now is also the time to set the rules for bonuses in future contracts .
Many good companies have incentive schemes which motivate their employees .
The banks , by contrast , have incentivised their employees , particularly in investment banks , to take extreme risks with depositors ’ money , then walk away from their deals with fat commission payments .
In future , any bonuses must be in company shares , properly priced , which can only be cashed in after five years or more .
In other words , cash bonuses should be banned .
The future of High Street banking will also be very different .
The old - fashioned clearing banks should be stripped of their high - risk , gambling operations and be required to operate as the safe , reliable , stable institutions they once were .
Britain will continue to need bright , enterprising people and to reward success .
But the unfettered greed , and rewards for stupidity and failure which have been exposed in the City , leave a very bad taste in everyone ’s mouth .
The financial aristocracy has to learn to respect the public who pay their wages .
Otherwise we shall soon be importing French guillotines .
Vince Cable is the Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesman .
If the thought of veggies makes you cringe , you may be .
Around one in every four people are born with thousands of extra taste buds , which enable them to more acutely detect sweetness , sourness , and bitterness in foods .
Think you fit in this category ?
Try this test ( it 's a little odd , yes , but experts stand by it ) :
What you 'll need : A hole punch , a one - inch - square piece of waxed paper , blue food coloring , and a cotton swab .
What to do : Punch a hole in the waxed paper ; set it aside .
Dab a little blue food coloring on your tongue .
It should turn blue , with the exception of tiny pink circles .
( These are " fungiform papillae , " and each contains six to 15 taste buds . )
Place the waxed paper over the blue area of your tongue and count the pink circles in the hole that you punched out .
More than 25 circles ?
You 're a supertaster .

Peacekeepers are desperate to stop all the shooting going on .
There are too many people with AK - 47 running around , firing at anything and everything .
How to stop that ?
Simple .
Outlaw 7.62x39 ammunition .
Since the end of the Cold War in 1991 , this rifle round has become the biggest killer on the planet .
This is the ammo used in the AK - 47 and the SKS carbine ( a non-automatic rifle with a smaller magazine than the AK - 47 ) .
You can't get all those weapons collected and destroyed .
But you can sharply reduce the supply of ammo .
Unlike the rifles , which last a long time , the ammo has a limited shelf life , and it tends to get used real quick .
There are millions of half - century old rifles still out there , and many that go back nearly a century ( to World War I ) .
But ammo degrades rapidly , and people tend to use it .
Empty rifles are basically awkward clubs , and left without ammo long enough , will be discarded by their owners .
Over twenty million AK - 47s went on to the market after the Cold War ended .
All those huge military establishments in communist nations were dissolved with the collapse of communism .
The unneeded weapons were sold off , legally or illegally .
Suddenly , angry people around the world had cheap automatic weapons .
And cheap ammunition ( 10 - 20 cents a round for 7.62x39 ) .
Where before , tribal or warlord warfare was a lot of guys with spears , knives , machetes and bows , now they had automatic weapons .
The old style warfare produced a low body count , because the weapons at hand were not all that effective , and it took a lot of courage to get up close and personal with that stuff .
But an AK - 47 , and a few dollars worth of ammo , suddenly made turned any twelve year old kid into a mass murderer .
Armed mayhem was now cheaper , and deadlier , and millions of people died in Africa , and elsewhere , as a result .
It 's probably not practical to expect the 7.62x39 round to be successfully outlawed .
Cocaine and heroin are illegal , and look at how much of that stuff is to be had .
But the big difference here is that it 's poor people who are getting this ammo , and killing each other with it .
The illegal drug business is driven by huge demand in affluent nations .
The AK - 47 is doing the most damage in poor countries .
So if you make manufacture of the 7.62x39 illegal , most of the large producers will have to shut down , or face international sanctions .
The small , outlaw , producers will make a lot of money , because suddenly 7.62x39 ammo will be real scarce , and the price will skyrocket .
Not as much of the ammo will be available for all those weapons .
Fewer bullets means fewer dead bodies .
The poor users are not stupid , and they can count .
Expensive ammo means you use the weapons less .
That means fewer people get killed .

The restaurant chain now offers two - for - one deals in half of its markets .
Few come -ons are more enticing to folks on tight budgets than these three words : two - for - one .
That may be why , in the economic downturn , two - for - one offers are showing up in so many industries at once — from restaurants to retailers to telecommunications companies .
Even some car dealers and home sellers are testing twofers .
TELL US : What two - fer deal gets you out of the house ?
The deals , also known as " buy one , get one free " offers , are a way for retailers to avoid price discounting — which is hard to reverse once folks get used to lower prices .
Limited - time " twofers " also play on the current consumer need to feel OK about spending money on anything .
" The real driver is that people feel guilty about shopping right now , " says Thomas Hine , author of I Want That !
How We All Became Shoppers .
" In times of economic uncertainty , people are more willing to make a purchase if they feel they 're being responsible . "
Of course , he warns , they also might be nudged into buying stuff they do n't need .
Twofers give folks a feeling of control in hard times , says Los Angeles ad psychologist Renee White Fraser .
" There 's that wonderful sense of power when you 're getting a deal . "
Some of the twofer deals : • Restaurants .
T.G.I. Friday's is offering two entrees for the price of one for customers who bring in coupons downloaded from www.fridays.com.
The promotion expires Sunday .
" This is driving traffic , " says Andrew Jordan , marketing chief .
Ruby Tuesday is offering two - for - one entrees in half of its markets via newspaper inserts and coupon downloads .
" Consumers are looking for offers like this , " spokesman Rick Johnson says .
• Retailers .
For three months , Men's Wearhouse , the clothing chain , has offered a two - for - one special on hundreds of men's suits at $ 399 and up .
" It 's the first time we 've had an offer like this , " says President Doug Ewert , who says it 's boosted store traffic .
• Telecommunications .
Verizon Wireless has offered two - for - one phone promos before , but for the first time it 's offering BlackBerrys , spokesman Jim Gerace says .
A two - year contract is required .
" This is a way to get others in the family — or small business — to use the device . " •
Car dealers .
At all 15 Russ Darrow Group car dealerships in Wisconsin , customers who buy a pricey new car or truck can get a " free " used car worth up to $ 10,000 .
" We are trying to unload our inventory of new vehicles , " owner Russ Darrow says .
" We had to be aggressive . " •
Home builders .
Last summer , San Diego home builder Michael Crews had a " Buy one home , get one free " offer .
Folks who bought a $ 1.6 million estate home would get a $ 399,900 row home for " free . "
There were no takers , marketing director Dawn Berry says , but it created lots of buzz and additional foot traffic .

Pictures from rehearsals have been published for the first time
DUSTED OFF
The Magazine delves into the archives
Newly released documents , which reveal the 1960s conception of Doctor Who , show how nervous the BBC was about producing a sci- fi show , writes Tom Geoghegan .
The Doctor without his time - travelling police box is difficult to imagine , but its creators initially proposed he journey through space in an invisible machine covered in light - resistant paint .
When BBC producers were devising the show in the early 1960s , they thought viewers should see no machine at all , only " a shape of nothingness " .
The original Doctor Who

The BBC 's head of drama Sydney Newman , who commissioned the first series , insisted an invisible machine would not work and the doctor 's vehicle should be a strong visual symbol .
Wisely , writers also said a transparent , plastic bubble would be " lowgrade " .
But a seed of the Tardis idea is sown when they suggest using " some common object in the street " like a night - watchman 's shelter .
These discussions are revealed in six previously unpublished documents , now digitised on the BBC Archive website .
These include handwritten notes by Mr Newman , regarded by fans as the genius behind the original concept .
The papers , accompanied by previously unseen images at rehearsals , show deep concerns about bringing a science fiction drama to a mainstream audience - " not an automatic winner " , says a researcher .

It was regarded as a rather obscure subject , says BBC archivist Jim Sangster , and given the space limitations at Lime Grove studios that ruled out an ambitious set , this added up to a huge gamble .
" Even having done something as massive as Quatermass , they did n't have confidence in sci-fi .
It was seen as niche and American .
" After Star Wars , we have a different view of course , and we see it as hugely entertaining and successful .
But they were nervous - it was n't a Western or a period drama .
It was something really obscure and they had to do research into it . "
Dead ringer
There was no fanfare when the first episode was discreetly advertised in the Radio Times on Saturday 23 November 1963 , at 5.15 pm , sandwiched between Grandstand and Juke Box Jury .
In the first episodes , there were four main characters
That was typical of the times , says Mr Sangster .
" They never said ' This is a TV event ' because TV itself was an event .
We only had two channels .
ITV was all about spectacle and the BBC was a lot more dignified .
So the Radio Times just says ' Here 's something you might like to see . ' "
At the start of that year , the BBC children 's writer Cecil Webber had devised three " main characters " , schoolgirl Biddy ( later named Susan Foreman ) and two teachers , Lola ( later Barbara Wright ) and Cliff ( renamed Ian Chesterton ) .
They were to be the audience 's eyes and ears , through which viewers would learn about the mysterious father figure , the Doctor .
In Mr Cecil 's illuminating background notes , he describes the Doctor as follows : " A frail old man lost in space and time .
They give him this name because they do n't know who he is .
He seems not to remember where he has come from : he is suspicious and capable of sudden malignance ; he seems to have some undefined enemy ; he is searching for something as well as fleeing from something .
He has a ' machine ' which enables them to travel together through time , through space and through matter . "
It 's hardly heroic but that description , apart from being frail , fits David Tennant perfectly , says Mr Sangster .
He 's quite unforgiving and it's up to humans to remind him of his moral duty .
And the characteristics of the three humans have been amalgamated into female companions such as Billie Piper 's Rose , he says .
Alternatives to the Tardis

That first description of the Doctor , played initially by an old - looking William Hartnell , still holds true today , says Doctor Who Online editor , Sebastian Brook , and his mystique is one of the show 's guiding principles .
" The suspiciousness is something that 's passed on through the years and the undefined enemy is things going wrong with the universe .
" And the mystery as well .
It 's not just a question mark , but the character itself - who is he ?
If that 's ever resolved in the series , then that 's the day it fails . "
He believes Russell T Davies has seen these original ideas and gone back to basics to replicate its early success .
" He could have picked anything in 45 years to go back on .
But as the show lost its way a bit during the 80s , it 's interesting that he 's picked that point at the beginning . "
' Silly and condescending '
But what about the ideas that did n't make it ?
Mr Newman scribbled " Nuts ! " next to the suggestion that the Doctor 's secret mission was to meddle with time and destroy the future .
But six years later , an element of that was worked into the plot when the Time Lords arrived .
Sydney Newman is worshipped by fans as the man behind the show In his background notes , Mr Webber had a brainstorm about ways the Doctor 's identity could develop .
He stopped short of making him appear as Santa Claus but he suggested Bethlehem as a location and the Doctor as Merlin , as Jacob Marley , and even the Doctor 's wife as Cinderella 's godmother .
But Mr Newman wrote in the margin : " I do n't like this much - it reads silly and condescending .
It does n't get across the basis of teaching of educational experience - drama based upon and stemming from factual material and scientific phenomena and actual social history of past and future . "
Mr Newman insisted that the show educate and inform , as well as entertain .
Hence scenes where science teacher Ian discussed the property of acid on a planet , or history teacher Barbara enlightened viewers about the Aztecs .
A TOUCH OF TORCHWOOD Doctor
Who spin - off began in 2006 but some of its elements can be traced back to 1963 A plot written for the original Doctor but rejected , called Troubleshooters , can be seen in Torchwood Not many dashing male leads but Captain Jack Harkness continues what began with Ian Chesterton and continued later with Harry Sullivan But even Mr Newman 's foresight failed him on occasion .
One of the cardinal rules for the new show , spelled out in one of the newly - released documents , is " No Bug - Eyed Monsters " - which Newman abbreviated to " No BEMs " - and no tin robots .
He was therefore angry to find that rule had been broken to accommodate tin-can baddies armed with plungers , called Daleks .
Producer Verity Lambert had commissioned Terry Nation to devise an alien and he had come up with one that would glide across the floor like a Russian dancer .
But Mr Newman 's fury turned to delight when episode six of the first series , in which the Daleks made their debut , added six million viewers .
Even geniuses can get some things wrong .

I remember being upset at missing the first episode as my parents took me to visit some friends and I was really happy when it was repeated the following week along with the second .
I was eight at the time and it is one of my earliest memories .
I have been a fan since and my three grown up children are also Dr Who fans .
Now I watch the recent series on BBC Prime .
Corinne Hainsworth , Moscow , Russia
I remember when the first Dr Who programmes were shown and I thoroughly enjoyed them ... until the Daleks arrived on the scene .
They were so scary ( although obviously fake ) , the way they made everyone turn into negatives !!
It was horrific - at least to a 7 yr. old .
They gave me nightmares .
I still shudder when I recall the original theme music .
Dum de dum , de dum de dum .
Alison , Virginia , USA Very interesting .
I saw the first episode and have been hooked since .
It was a big surprise to get some new science fiction after 1961's A for Andromeda .
The latter could do with a full remake as a serial rather than the BBC4 single show remake , welcome as it was .
Frederick Thompson , Romford I loved reading about the history of this amazing show .
I never even suspected that the creative genius behind " Dr Who " initially despised the Daleks ' appearance .
They * do* look rather silly .
More articles of this sort on other great shows would be indeed welcome .
Cheers .
Mircea Zaharia , Bucharest , Romania Keep the Tardis - give it a lick of paint if you like to tidy it up - but we need the old telephone box - otherwise it is not Doctor Who .
I find that if too many people or things are changed in a programme I lose interest in it - and in Doctor Who everything including the people and Doctor Who change - the only things we have are things like the tel box and Daleks .
I have been watching this programme since I was a young child , and it is an excellent programme for all the family - do n't spoil it .
Imelda Henning , Ballyhalbert , Co Down , N Ireland
Thanks for releasing the Doctor Who archive material - a fascinating and timely 45th birthday present for us Whovians
Tom Mills , St. Helens , UK
An interesting read .
Mind - blowing information that most fans will not know about .
Completely agree with the Dr who online guy - if we ever find out who the doctor is , the show is over .
Paul Anthony , London I can clearly remember coming home to Falmouth after a Saturday shopping trip to Redruth with my parents and seeing the very first episode of Dr Who .
( I seem to remember it replaced a programme which contained a character called " The Voice " ) I think the first adventure was something to do with cavemen .
Later stories put the Daleks in London and some horrible flying things called Zorbas ( ? )
As a teenager my doctor was Jon Pertwee and although Tom Baker was very good I had grown out of Dr Who by that time .
Since its comeback and especially with the introduction of David Tennant of Dr Who I am once again hooked !
Viv Wilson , Newbury
The creatures Viv Wilson is trying to recall were Zarbies .
If memory serves they were like giant upright ants .
Dr Who was the highlight of my childhood Saturday evenings , and the new series have succeeded in bringing the same feelings to a new generation .
Long may it continue .
Matthew Scott , Huddersfield
I was nearly 12 when the first episode was shown and I have a " memory " that the next week , BBC showed both the first and second episodes back to back because the previous weeks episode had been cut short because of JFK 's assassination .
( one of those " where were you when JFK was shot questions " ) .
Eric Lowes , Newcastle Dr. Who is not so much a sci - fi series as a horror show .
Once you get past the ( frankly irrelevant )
Tardis , there 's no science in it .
However , the whole series is based on " monsters " doing bad things .
if that 's not mainstream horror , I can't say what is .
Pete , Harlow I 've always been a bit disappointed that the Doctor only ever seems spend his time defeating evil aliens bent on taking over Central London .
Time travel offers so many other possibilities that are never exploited .
Neville Collins , Paris , France
Not true Neville , the latest aliens are mostly taking over Cardiff - tee hee !
Paul , Pontypool , Wales Neville , I concur with this whole - heartedly , and I love the episodes best where they are n't set on Earth .
And as for " Mr Newman insisted that the show educate and inform , as well as entertain " , we have n't been seeing much of that in the recent series nor in Torchwood .
Dr
Who for me should be sci - fi / horror and being older I would like more mature theme , but Dr Who is aimed at " family " audiences .
Just wish the BBC would realise children today are a bit more educated in the genre thanks to film and video games .
Some episodes have been so fan fiction or blatant nostalgia I have sat and cringed , where I as a child I would of been hiding behind the sofa .
Ion Griffis , Bradford I remember watching the first show in black and white , we had no option then .
I was hooked there after and even went to the pictures to see the first movie .
Fabulous piece of children 's drama .
Long may the BBC keep up such wonderful children 's programmes .

British protesters say they burned the book out of frustration Twenty years ago Muslims were called on to kill the author Salman Rushdie as a wave of protest grew about one of his books .
But do those who demonstrated against Rushdie have any regrets ?
When Iran 's late ruler , the Ayatollah Khomeini , issued a fatwa of death on Salman Rushdie , it sent the award - winning author into hiding for almost a decade .
In the weeks before the pronouncement there had been growing unrest among many British Muslims about his book , The Satanic Verses , for its blaspheming of the Prophet Muhammad .
The pictures of Rushdie 's book being burned on British streets outraged liberals while stirring strong sentiments among Muslims .
This was also a watershed in the history of Britain 's Muslims - a moment when , for the first time , many united over what they saw as an attack on their faith .
But looking back , do the protesters still think they were right ?
ISHTIAQ AHMED Ishtiaq Ahmed , of the Bradford Council of Mosques , was at the centre of UK calls to have The Satanic Verses banned and took part in the first book - burning protest in Britain in January 1989 .
He remembers the moment members of the mosques ' council read a copy of the book and concluded parts of it were " grossly insulting to Islam " .
THE SATANIC VERSES
First published in September 1988 Won Whitbread novel of the year Title refers to disputed story of the Prophet adding Koran verses which he later revoked saying he had been deceived by Satan Banned in 11 countries , including India Sparked protests and book - burnings across the UK and abroad
1989 : Ayatollah sentences author to death
They went on to write to the book 's publishers , Penguin , MPs and the government to voice their concerns .
But , having received little support for their cause , members felt they had no alternative but to take matters into their own hands , recalls Mr Ahmed , now in his 50s .
The " anger and emotion " within the community at the lack of understanding of their position finally led to calls to " burn the damn thing " in a protest in front of Bradford 's key public buildings , he says .
" A spot was selected - it had a symbolic meaning ... a faith community demonstrating and saying , ' We matter , we exist , we are here , our presence matters ' .
This police station , town hall , Magistrates ' Court - they are ours as much as anyone else 's . "
After a number of speeches , the protesters burned their one - and - only copy of The Satanic Verses , but not before overcoming a technical glitch .
" It was a very thick book - particularly the hard copies - and it was very difficult to actually set fire to it .
So we had to actually find a can of petrol to pour on the book , " Mr Ahmed laughs , acknowledging the bizarre nature of events .
But he remembers the strength of the collective " sigh of relief " from those present who he believes felt " a burden had been lifted off their shoulders " .
" Finally they had made a statement .
Finally that had found a way to express their anger and their frustration , their disgust , their emotions about this book , " he says .
Other demonstrations in the UK and abroad followed , including one in the Pakistani capital Islamabad in which five people died .
Then came the Ayatollah Khomeini 's fatwa , which Mr Ahmed believes " hijacked " the British Muslims ' battle for recognition and did them a " great disservice " .
In the end , the protesters did not achieve any of their three demands - the extension of blasphemy law , an apology from the author or the banning of the book - but Mr Ahmed believes the Muslim community in Britain has benefitted indirectly from The Satanic Verses affair .
" People became more aware about the presence of Muslims , more aware of their sensibilities regarding their faith , " he says .
AKI NAWAZ Mr Nawaz is now a musician with rap group Fun-Da-Mental Aki Nawaz , of rap group Fun-Da-Mental , confesses to being in " rebellious mode " in 1989 when he took part in the protests in Bradford .
He admits he was initially confused about the whole issue surrounding The Satanic Verses , but , as he saw senior members of his community get increasingly angry about the book , he decided to take more interest .
" In Bradford , here was a whole contingent of nice , happy - clappy , peaceful , kind of hippy Muslims - elders - all in pain about what was going on and it made me want to look into the whole issue deeper than it was being portrayed in the media , " he recalls .
Mr Nawaz attended his first demonstration outside Bradford Magistrates '
Court where he joined just 20 people .
But over the next few months protests grew and several British bookstores were firebombed .
" All I could hear was ' They keep shutting the doors ' - they meaning the publishers , the government , the departments , they keep shutting the doors , they wo n't have any dialogue .
Salman Rushdie , who has now been knighted , was in hiding for nine years " So when people shut off discussion and debate on an equal level , then at some point the bubble 's going to burst and it's going to become chaos - and that 's exactly what happened . "
Although he has no regrets about the protests themselves , he believes the fatwa was damaging to the aims of British Muslims .
" For me it was just a tragic step in a tragic long episode and I think this caused the biggest division - it was the beginning of the division of Muslims and everybody else , including inside our communities , " he says .
However , looking back on the events of 1989 , Mr Nawaz still believes the community was right to do what it did .
" Whatever this tragic episode , however it turned out , wherever it ended , I personally think - and I do n't really care what non-Muslims think - I think what the Muslims did had to be done . "
INAYAT BUNGLAWALA Mr Bunglawala regrets the message the protests sent to non-Muslims Inayat Bunglawala was a 19 - year - old student at Queen Mary College , London , when he attended a large protest against The Satanic Verses in Hyde Park .
" I just remember it being a very glorious summer 's day and I 'd never seen those kinds of numbers , and we 're talking 20 or 30,000 Muslims - British Muslims who had come together , " he recalls .
But , some months after the demonstration , Mr Bunglawala found himself questioning its achievements .
As a student who read a great deal of books , he was particularly troubled by the message some of the protests had sent to others .
" The whole book - burning thing conjured up very horrible images , you know of Nazi Germany , and clearly most people find that a lot more disturbing , " says Mr Bunglawala , of Luton .
" It just played into this stereotype of Muslims being opposed to modernity or incapable of adapting to modernity , of being narrow minded , not willing to listen to the arguments of others , being intent on enforcing their views upon others , regardless of what others may think .
Protests also took place elsewhere , including Slough in Berkshire " So it just created a whole batch of some very unfortunate stereotypes which we are still battling now 20 years on . "
Somewhat ironically , reading Salman Rushdie 's Imaginary Homelands - the collection of essays the author wrote in hiding - also persuaded Mr Bunglawala the tactics of the UK protesters had been wrong .
" To use offence as the reason to call for a book to be withdrawn has all sorts of repercussions - far wider repercussions - because who is to decide what is offensive ? " he asks .
Finally , on reflection , Mr Bunglawala believes the book - burnings and protests were damaging and misguided .
" Looking back on it , there was the realisation that we may have done ourselves a great deal more harm than good . "

Ever wonder why many women like sweets more than men ?
A new study says that men can control their food cravings more than women .
Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Brookhaven National Laboratory found that men were able to control their brain ’s response to favorite foods .
They say that this may explain why obesity rates are higher in women than men , and also why it ’s generally harder for women to lose weight .
“ Our findings may help us understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the ability to control food intake , and suggest new pharmacological methods or other interventions to help people regulate eating behavior and maintain a healthy weight , ” said Gene - Jack Wang , lead author on the study .
“ The surprising finding of a difference between genders in the ability to inhibit the brain ’s response to food and hunger will certainly merit further study . ”
Scientists monitored brain activity in 13 female and 10 male subjects by using positron emission tomography ( PET ) scanning .
On the first day of scanning , the subjects were shown their favorite foods .
They were asked to observe , smell , taste and react to the food , but not eat it .
On another day , they were asked to inhibit their desire for food prior to being shown the food .
The last scanning was a control scan with no food .
The subjects were asked to describe their hunger feelings and to rate the food when it had been presented to them .
In both men and women , areas in the brain associated with emotional regulation showed more activity when tempted with the foods compared to the control scan .
When giving their responses to food , men showed a lower activity in the brain regions .
“ Even though the women said they were less hungry when trying to inhibit their response to the food , their brains were still firing away in the regions that control the drive to eat , ” Wang said .
“ In contrast , men ’s brain activity decreased along with their self - reports of hunger during the scan when they were asked to keep their hunger in check . ”
“ This may indicate a difference between the genders in the ability to perceive and respond to internal body signals , ” Wang said .
Researchers say that more exploration needs to be done because other factors like hormones may play a part in the results .
This study is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

Embattled Illinois Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich compared himself to Nelson Mandela on Sunday and impugned the integrity of his impeachment trial the day before it was to begin .
Appearing on NBC’s “ Today ” show , Blagojevich said the trial was “ rigged and it ’s fixed . ”
“ I think what you ’ll see is a roll call that will be pre-designed , and we ’ll see whether or not I even get one vote , ” he said .
With state senators serving as Blagojevich ’s judge and jury and the governor mounting no defense , the trial is expected to conclude within days .
A conviction would require a two - thirds vote and result in the governor ’s removal from office .

In the NBC interview , portions of which aired Sunday and others to be aired today , Blagojevich said that when he was arrested on federal corruption charges last month , “ I thought about Mandela , Dr. King , Gandhi , and trying to put some perspective in all of this . ”
The governor was referring to civil rights leaders Nelson Mandela of South Africa , the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and India ’s Mohandas K. Gandhi .
Blagojevich is accused of trying to sell the Senate seat vacated by President Obama .
Federal prosecutors also said their wiretaps caught Blagojevich threatening to withhold money for children ’s healthcare unless he got campaign donations from a hospital executive and offering to trade state aid to the Tribune Co. in exchange for the Chicago Tribune firing unfriendly editorial writers .
Tribune owns several newspapers and television stations , including the Los Angeles Times and KTLA .

Several politicians have called on Blagojevich to resign , but he has refused -- as he did again Sunday .
“ And for me to just quit because some cackling politicians want to get me out of the way because there ’s a whole bunch of things they do n’t want known about them and conversations they may have had with me . . . would be to disgrace my children when I know I ’ve done nothing wrong , ” he told NBC .
Blagojevich is scheduled to appear today on “ Good Morning America , ” “ The View ” and “ Larry King Live . ”
Blagojevich ’s burst of media outreach prompted a tart rejoinder from Sen. Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill . ) .
The governor should be defending himself at the impeachment trial , Durbin said , because the extra media attention wo n’t impress state senators .
Advertisement
“ Barbara Walters is not on his jury , ” Durbin said , referring to the veteran journalist who co-hosts “ The View . ”
Over the weekend , Illinois House prosecutors moved to ask that four secret recordings of the governor , part of the federal criminal charges that led to his arrest , be played in the Senate .
The recordings involve alleged attempts by the two - term Democratic governor to secure campaign funds from the horse - racing industry in return for signing a bill to divert casino gambling revenue to horse tracks .
On “ Today , ” Blagojevich maintained that some of the state senators who will decide his fate do n’t want him to present defense witnesses .
“ Let me say there are some of those that are sitting in on judgment of me on Monday in the state Senate that were on telephone calls with me during that period of time ” when his phones were tapped , Blagojevich said .

The governor ’s arrest was the final straw for state lawmakers , who had spent six years butting heads with Blagojevich .
The House quickly voted 114 to 1 to impeach him .

Some 35 % of doners contained a different meat than advertised Doner kebabs sold in the UK contain " shocking " levels of salt , fat and calories , a survey has concluded .
Officers from 76 councils sampled 494 kebabs to test their nutritional value , during the Local Authority Coordinators of Regulatory Services ( Lacors ) study .
The average doner they tested contained almost 1,000 calories - half a woman 's recommended daily intake .
Geoffrey Theobald , of Lacors , said : " The level of saturated fat and salt in some is a serious cause for concern . "
He added that while they " would never consider kebabs part of a calorie - controlled diet " the true content of the average kebab was worrying .
Among the kebabs sampled - without salad or sauces - the average doner contained 98 % of an adult 's recommended daily salt and 148 % of their daily saturated fat allowance .
Graph : Kebab content compared to recommended daily allowances
Under the supermarket " traffic lights " system , red marks would be earned by 97 % for fat , 98 % for saturated fat and 96 % for salt .
Some 35 % of labels listed a different meat species than that actually found in the kebab .
This study has turned the spotlight on doner kebabs

How unhealthy is a doner ?
Six kebabs were found to include pork when it had not been declared as an ingredient .
Two of the six were described as Halal - food or drink permitted for Muslims , which must not contain pork .
Mr Theobald said it was " totally unacceptable " that people with certain faiths were unknowingly eating meats that were against their beliefs .
The worst doners inspectors came across contained 1,990 calories before salad and sauces - over 95 % of a woman 's recommended daily calories , 346 % of a woman 's saturated fat intake and 277 % of an adult 's daily salt intake .

Researchers uncovered significant regional variations , with the average kebab in the north - west of England containing 1,101 calories , compared with 1,084 in Scotland , 1,055 in Wales and 1,066 in England 's south - east .
Northern Ireland 's average of 843 was the lowest in the UK .
Mr Theobald said it was " totally unacceptable " that inaccurate labelling was so widespread .
In addition , there was little difference in weight between kebabs labelled as " small " and " large " , he added .
" While some people may think they are making sensible choices by ordering a small kebab , this study showed little difference between small and large kebab weight . "
He said with obesity rates rising so rapidly in the UK , portion size was as important as content , he said .
" This study has turned the spotlight on doner kebabs and we hope that manufacturers rise to the challenge and work with councils to provide a healthier product that contains only what it says on the label , " Mr Theobald said .
Research by the UK's Food Standards Agency in 2006 found that 18.5 % of doner takeaways posed a " significant " threat to public health , and 0.8 % posed an " imminent " threat .

It 's often hard to take Keith Vaz seriously , as the member of British Parliament seems happy to assume the role of the video game industry 's major antagonist in the UK .
However , his complaint about Amazon selling a " rape simulator " has turned out to be more truth than not , and the online retailer has taken the game off its site .
Vaz lambasted Amazon for selling the hentai rape - simulator , Rapelay , on its site , telling the Belfast Telegraph that , " It is intolerable that anyone would purchase a game that simulates the criminal offence of rape .
To know that this widely available through a major online retailer is utterly shocking , I do not see how this can be allowed . "
Because the game was actually offered on Amazon via a third party reseller known as " Hentaiguy , " it seems likely that Amazon did n't actually know about the game until it made the news .
As a result , the game was yanked from Amazon shortly afterwards .
That Rapelay raised public ire is n't surprising , as a detailed review of the game makes its content sound incredibly objectionable .
Aside from the fact that the game has been pulled off Amazon 's website , seller Hentaiguy 's store seems to have been eliminated , as well .
Following are excerpts from a speech by Kuwaiti Professor Abdallah Al - Nafisi , which aired on Al - Jazeera TV on February 2 , 2009 .
Abdallah Al - Nafisi : " Four pounds of anthrax - in a suitcase this big - carried by a fighter through tunnels from Mexico into the U.S. , are guaranteed to kill 330,000 Americans within a single hour , if it is properly spread in population centers there .
" What a horrifying idea .
9/11 will be small change in comparison .
Am I right ?
There is no need for airplanes , conspiracies , timings , and so on .
" One person , with the courage to carry four pounds of anthrax , will go to the White House lawn , and will spread this ' confetti ' all over them , and then will do these cries of joy .
It will turn into a real ' celebration . '

Barron's has an article by Alan Abelson that expresses my sentiments better than I could today .
Here 's the crux : " House prices , in our bloodshot view , have another 20 % or so to fall before hitting bottom and , at the earliest , we 're talking sometime next year .
And , possibly more important , a meaningful brightening of the current , profoundly bleak jobs picture , is n't in the cards for certainly as long , if not longer .
" A sad assessment of affairs , with which I agree .
[ Thanks to CDIN.org for the touching image .
]
He bases this conclusion on a study by ISI Group ( not web - accessible ) and its two charts that really tell the picture like nothing else I 've seen recently .
They can be found on the second page of his article .
They are ( 1 ) the ratio of house prices to rents , and ( 2 ) the median house price divided by median family income .
Both of these long - term lines , drawn from 1975 or before to date , demonstrate with stark clarity that house prices are still on the high downside slope of this bubble .
A majority of people believe that government intervention of the kind our legislators have just put in place can stop this " drop " ( read " re-normalization " ) of housing prices .
But this legislation has a good chance of missing the mark , at least as far as arresting housing price falls is concerned .
As Abelson says : " While fewer foreclosures are likely to slow the rate of decline , they wo n't reverse the downtrend or determine ' where homes prices end up . ' ... [ G ] iven the remorseless rise in unemployment , which , if anything , is destined to accelerate in the months ahead , the simple fact that so many people are too strapped to afford to buy a home , is , we believe , the most formidable barrier to even a tepid housing recovery .
" Right on .
It 's called pushing the string .
( See my cartoon on this subject . )
And frankly , I think it would be criminal to deprive us of the benefits of lower prices , whether it be for food , gas , or housing .
Lower prices enrich us all .
Personal footnote : I am a commentator , not a researcher .
I do not claim to have a Ph.D. in economics .
For those readers who would like the academic nuts and bolts under my skepticism , start here here , and here .
You will find the deeper research papers accessible on other pages of their website .
Some may object that all of these come from the same think tank , Cato , with its libertarian - oriented research team .
This is true .
I happen to follow their reasoning on most subjects , having yet to come across a more " progressive " reasoning that can hold a candle to it .
Academics can provide us with some very useful thinking and writing , but they do n't have a monopoly on logic .
There are many non-academics who have contributed valuable work .
There are also academics who have steered us astray .
Here are some examples of both :
A few non-academic leaders : Henry George Bill Gates ( honorary doctorates only ) , and Benjamin Franklin , to name only four .
Academics who should have had more humility : Robert C. Merton and his economics Nobel Prize partner at LTCM Myron Scholes ; and Margaret Mead , to name only three .

An epic poem is a long narrative that tells of an epic hero 's journey .
Many famous works are epic poems , including Homer 's " The Odyssey " and Virgil 's " The Aeneid . "
There is no required rhyme or meter for an epic poem , which may make the form more approachable for some writers .
However , epic poems do require many stylistic conventions , which dictate the content and the language choices .
Define the Epic Hero
The epic hero is at the heart of the epic poem .
The narrative tells of the hero 's journey to complete a quest .
For example , Odysseus in " The Odyssey " was on a quest to return home after the war , but faced many struggles along the way .
While many epic heroes have been kings or other noble figures such as warriors , your epic hero can be anyone you choose .
You can be the epic hero in your own poem , or you can choose someone you know or admire from afar , from the president to a celebrity .
The hero should embody the ideals of the time and culture in which the poem is set .
Brainstorm what these values would be , and use your notes to guide the poem .
Outline the Epic Journey
The epic journey is perhaps the second most important characteristic of the epic poem .
The epic hero should be exiled from home -- or simply away from home , such as during war or because he is lost .
The poem would then cover the journey and the eventual return home .
Along the way , the hero should face many obstacles and his journey should cover a vast setting , such as multiple continents or even a galaxy .
The hero should have amazing adventures and show his strength and courage .
After brainstorming some ideas , make an outline of the hero 's journey and use it to craft an outline of the poem .
Remember that epic poems begin " in medias res , " which means in the middle of the action .
Flashbacks can be used to fill in the beginning of the story .
Adopt an Elevated Style
Even if your epic poem does not rhyme or follow a meter , it should use formal language and have an elevated style .
For example , epithets are a popular convention in epic poems .
In " The Iliad " by Homer , Achilles is often described as " swift - footed Achilles . "
Many other epithets are used to describe his speed and agility .
Create epithets for your epic hero and use other formal and stylistic language throughout the poem , such as extended metaphors , similes and high rhetoric .
Adhere to Stylistic Conventions
Epic poems have many other stylistic conventions .
For example , many open with an invocation to a muse for inspiration or to the gods for protection .
You do not have to appeal to either entity .
You can make up your own " muse " or god to appeal to , such as invoking Beyonce , if she is your musical muse .
Epics also include long and formal speeches by the hero and other characters , long digressions from the main story line , and many catalogs , or lists , of people and things .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama plans to order the closing of the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay as early as his first week in office to show a break from the Bush administration 's approach to the war on terror , according to two officials close to the transition .
President - elect Barack Obama is expected to sign an order closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
One of the officials said it would be in keeping with Obama 's campaign promise to shut down the prison through executive order , a move which was also pushed by last year 's Republican presidential nominee , Sen. John McCain , R - Arizona .
" The president - elect has repeatedly said the legal framework at Gitmo has failed to successfully and swiftly prosecute terrorists , " said one of the officials close to the transition , who was not authorized to speak publicly about private deliberations .
Such a move would reassure those concerned after Obama 's recent public comments suggested he may not immediately shut the prison down .
Watch what may delay Gitmo's closing »
" It is more difficult than I think a lot of people realize and we are going to get it done , but part of the challenge that you have is that you have a bunch of folks that have been detained , many of whom who may be very dangerous who have not been put on trial or have not gone through some adjudication , " Obama said on ABC's " This Week " on Sunday when asked whether he would close the prison in his first 100 days .
Obama also said he was trying to develop a process that " adheres to rule of law " but " does n't result in releasing people who are intent on blowing us up . "
" I think it 's going to take some time and our legal teams are working in consultation with our national security apparatus as we speak , to help design exactly what we need to do , " Obama said .
" But I do n't want to be ambiguous about this .
We are going to close Guantanamo and we are going to make sure that the procedures we set up are ones that abide by our Constitution , " he said .
The military prison at Guantanamo Bay is a major issue because for critics of the Bush administration , it has become a symbol of mismanagement and overreach in the war on terror .
At his final White House press conference on Monday , President Bush was asked whether the military prison and harsh interrogation tactics have damaged America 's standing in the world .
iReport.com : What should Obama do first ?
" I strongly disagree with the assessment that our moral standing has been damaged , " Bush said .
" It may be damaged amongst some of the elite .
But people still understand America stands for freedom ; that America is a country that provides such great hope . "

You hear it time and time again : " The French are so rude ! "
Before ever setting foot in France , you hear the horror stories of rude French waiters who turn their nose up at anybody and everybody .
You hear about snooty Parisians who refuse to give directions or just French people in general who turn up their nose at Americans .
Truth is not only are most French people you meet thoroughly civil , outright friendly , and kind , but they will go out of their way to help you .
If you 've ever been to New York City , another city with a reputation for hardened , mean residents , you 'll actually find that New Yorkers bend over backward trying to interpret foreigners who can't speak a whit of English .
It 's the same way in France .
The Stereotype
So when you go to France for the first time , it is almost as if you are expecting and preparing for a rude experience .
You might even be looking for it .
Sure , you will find nasty people there ( and everywhere ) , but it is the exception , not the rule .
Do n't travel with prejudice ; treat everybody as you would at home and you 'll have a great vacation in France .
Funny thing about stereotypes is that they can get comfortable , particularly when you ’re used to them .
Some French even try to fit the stereotype .
For an example , there is a brasserie near the Ecole Militaire in Paris called Thoumieux in the 7th arrondissement ( district ) .
It is quite charming and a great value , all decked out as a Parisian brasserie should be .
It had a tough reputation : waiters barked at you , handed you the menu without a smile , and took your order in wooden silence .
They did this to everyone .
Not just tourists .
It was the modus operandi .
You got used to it and it became a game to try to get the waiter to relax or crack a smile .
It was sometimes successful .
Interestingly , in 2013 , France launched a charm campaign to erase the perception that the French are rude .
Waiters there were trained to say basic greetings like bonjour or bonsoir with a smile and listen to what you were saying .
The experience at Thoumieux changed .
It was n't the same .
Restaurant guests missed their grumpy , but genuine , waiters .
Give Charm to Get It Back
It is no deep secret .
If you want to be treated fairly , kindly , and with respect , then give it in kind .
There are a few tips to follow ( just as you would anywhere else in the world ) .
Make an Attempt in French
Try to attempt to speak French .
Simply saying , " Bonjour ! Parlez - vous Anglais ? " ( pronounced bon-jouha , pah - lay vooz ahn - glay ) can work wonders .
It means , " Hello .
Do you speak English ? "
Many French who would feign ignorance suddenly speak fluent English if you just try .
Put yourself in their shoes .
What would you think if a stranger walked up to you speaking a flurry of French while in your hometown and expected you to reply in their language ?
It can be perceived as rude or presumptuous .
Start With a Greeting
Be sure to greet strangers with " Bonjour " before launching into other requests .
In France , it is considered rude to just walk up and start talking without a greeting first .
Whenever you visit any foreign land , it is important to learn about the cultural differences .
Many times , if a French person reacts rudely it is because you may have done something that is considered extremely rude by their standards .
Know French culture and etiquette ( they invented the word ) before you go to avoid misunderstandings .
Quiet Down
The French are a very hushed people in public ( though when animated or excited by something they can rev up the decibels ) .
For example , imagine the distraction of a group of tourists who barge into a restaurant , loudly shouting at one another , running around the restaurant snapping pictures of patrons , and generally being rude .
This loud behavior is noticeable in France where the people are more low - key .
Loud disruptions like this can ruin a restaurant 's relaxed dinner - time ambiance .

We 're guessing we 'll hear more about this at MWC , but TI just let loose a press release crowing about Archos 's use of the OMAP3 processor in an upcoming " Internet Media Tablet " that runs on Android and also doubles as a phone .
No pictures yet , but the spec sheet makes it sound like a hotrodded Archos 5 : five - inch screen , up to a 500GB hard drive , a battery capable of 7 seven hours of video playback , and Flash support , all in a package just 10 mm ( .39 inches ) thick .
The underlying OS will be Android , but Archos plans to really beef up the media features -- there 's even mention of HD video playback .
That sounds seriously sweet -- if Archos ditches the current mushy resistive screen in the 5 for a capacitive unit , this could be a knockout Android device when it launches in the third quarter .

Dr Merkel has broken with political tradition and demanded that the German pontiff make " a very clear statement " to reject the observations of Bishop Richard Williamson , who told a Swedish TV program he did not believe gas chambers existed in World War II or that six million Jews were murdered in Nazi concentration camps .
In an unprecedented attack on the leader of the Catholic Church , she rejected the pontiff 's statement last week apologising for Bishop Williamson 's comments , saying she did not believe that the clarification was sufficient .
Newspapers in Italy noted that Dr Merkel 's intervention was particularly significant because she could " hardly be described as a left - winger sympathiser " .
Dr Merkel made her comments at a media conference with the President of Kazakhstan , Nursultan Nazarbayev , who is visiting Berlin .
She said : " It seems to me that it is of great significance if the Vatican makes a decision that could diffuse the impression that a denial of the Holocaust is possible .
I demand a detailed clarification on this issue from the Pope and from the Vatican . "
Her comments reflect a growing revolt within the Catholic Church  and more particularly within the German hierarchy  as religious leaders increasingly express their horror at the Pope 's decision to rescind the excommunication of four ultra-conservative bishops to mend a 20 - year schism between religious factions .
Bishop Williamson used his blog site , Dinoscopus , to apologise to the Pope for the anguish he had caused but failed to revoke his observations .
Cardinal Walter Kasper , head of the Pontifical Council for Christian Unity , which oversees relations with Judaism , was reported yesterday to have conceded that the issue had been badly managed .
This follows comments by a group of German bishops who took an unprecedented step to state a " loss of faith in the Pope " in the wake of the annulment of the excommunications .
Cardinal Kasper said he had followed the row " with great anxiety " , and while he did not criticise the Pope directly he blamed " a lack of communication " inside the Vatican for the decision .
His comments signal deepening tension inside the Vatican over Pope Benedict 's close interaction with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith  which he headed for close to two decades  and a lack of discussion with other senior leaders .
Members of the Fraternity of San Pio X first broke with the church in 1988 , when the late French archbishop Marcel Lefebvre illegally consecrated the four bishops without the requisite permission of Pope John Paul II .
The Lefebvrists , who rejected the modernising moves of the Second Vatican Council , excommunicated themselves and this was later formalised by a Vatican decree .
The Pope 's decision to rehabilitate the group is underpinned by the desire to shore up the conservative and traditionalist ranks inside the Catholic Church .
The Fraternity , which claims around a million supporters compared to more than a billion for the official Catholic Church , categorically rejects the validity of any other religions and conducts Mass solely in Latin .
The Pope 's press secretary , Father Federico Lombardi , said the Pope had denounced any denial of the Holocaust several times , including during a visit to the Auschwitz - Birkenau extermination camp in Poland on May 28 , 2006 .
" If you consider all parts of the equation , Zenit ( St Petersburg ) , Arsenal , Arshavin , it was a good decision for everyone , " Hiddink told Reuters in an interview at the national team 's training camp at this Mediterranean resort .
" Zenit did a lot for Arshavin but he paid them back and at his age it was time to make a change .
The move will bring great dividends to Arsenal and Arshavin as well as Russian football as a whole . "
The product of a local youth academy , the 27 - year - old from St Petersburg had only played for Zenit before joining Arsenal last week for a club record fee of 15 million pounds ( $ 21.35 million ) .
Hiddink said Arsene Wenger , the manager of the English Premier League club , called him to discuss the player he eventually signed on a three and a half year contract .
" We talked last week about Arshavin , what he 's like as a player , as a person , " the Dutchman said .
" Arsenal 's playing style , a short - passing , fast game , will suit Arshavin . "
The playmaker was linked with several top clubs in England and Spain after lighting up Euro 2008 with his nifty footwork and helping Russia reach the semi-finals .
TEAM LEADER
Hiddink said Arshavin had matured into a team leader over the past two years .
" When I first met him almost two and a half years ago he , just like most other Russian players , was a very closed person , did n't talk much , " the coach recalled .
" But no matter where I 've worked , whether it 's Russia , South Korea , Australia or Holland , I 've always tried to challenge the players to do more and that was also the case with Arshavin .
" After a certain time he has come out of his shell , has established himself as one of the team leaders . "
Hiddink made Arshavin his skipper in 2007 before stripping him of the captaincy later that year after he was sent off for kicking an opponent in Russia 's final Euro 2008 qualifier in Andorra .
Arshavin was banned for the first two matches of Euro 2008 .
He returned for the final group match against Sweden , helping his side reach the knockout stages .
The playmaker then produced a brilliant display in the 3 - 1 quarter - final win over Netherlands , scoring one of the goals as Russia qualified for the last four of a major tournament for the first time in 20 years .
" He ( Arshavin ) is what you call a game breaker , he can decide the outcome of any match and he perfectly illustrated that in the game against Holland , " Hiddink said .
" I would say those qualities of Arshavin , along with being a very smart and mentally tough player , have convinced Arsene Wenger to sign him . "

The OpenSolaris development community launched version 2008.11 , its second release ever , Wednesday .
The new version boosts hardware compatibility and brings some impressive improvements that illuminate the potential of OpenSolaris as a desktop platform .
It 's still not capable of replacing Linux on the desktop , but it shows promise .
OpenSolaris is Sun 's desktop - oriented open - source distribution of the Solaris operating system .
It is designed with a strong emphasis on ease of use and is intended to provide a fully functional desktop system right out of the box .
It includes the latest software and offers a diverse assortment of applications ranging from development tools to multimedia players .
OpenSolaris emerged from Project Indiana , an effort to reinvent the disparate open - source Solaris bits as a cohesive desktop solution that could be installed from a Live CD .
Led by Debian luminary Ian Murdock , Project Indiana was intended to serve as Sun 's answer to Ubuntu .
Despite the lofty and compelling vision , the project has had difficulty gaining traction outside of the existing Solaris community .
It is still a very young effort and has a long way to go before it lives up to its potential .
Hardware compatibility
We tested the first release , version 2008.05 , earlier this year and encountered several difficulties .
In 2008.05 , the network " auto - magic " system delivered a distinctly unmagical user experience , and there were several other minor hardware compatibility issues that I encountered during my tests .
These problems appear to have been resolved and did not show up in 2008.11 .
Networking worked perfectly right out of the box .
Several new hardware features have been added , including support for suspend / resume , 3D graphics acceleration , SD cards , and improved audio support .
That said , OpenSolaris is far from providing compatibility with the wide range of hardware that is supported by Linux , and these hardware features still only work on a limited selection of devices .
ZFS snapshot visualization
When looked at the first OpenSolaris release , we suggested that its potential for success would largely be based on how well it exposes its unique underlying platform features to end users .
One of the most impressive technologies in Solaris is the open - source ZFS filesystem .
It has a sophisticated storage pooling system and a number of other nifty features , including support for rich snapshotting .
OpenSolaris 2008.11 brings that functionality to the surface with a ZFS snapshot visualization feature that is integrated directly into Nautilus , the GNOME file manager .
We took an early look at this feature several months ago when it was still a work in progress .
To enable support for ZFS snapshot visualization , the user has to click a checkbox in the simple Time Slider Setup tool which is on the Administration menu — no arcane command line steps or configuration file editing is needed .
After it has been turned on , it just works .
You can click the snapshot visualization button in the Nautilus toolbar , and a slider will appear that the user can drag to go back in time and see previous versions of the directory 's contents .
Packaging
The OpenSolaris packaging system , which is called IPS , also got some improvements in this release .
There is a new graphical update manager that will notify users when new software is available .
The package management command line tools feel a lot like APT and works reasonably well .
The graphical package manager is a bit like Synaptic and is also quite good .
A major weak point for OpenSolaris is its limited support for third - party software .
There are some new applications included in 2008.11 and some new software in the system package repositories .
One of the major additions is Tracker , an open - source file indexing and search tool .
Some of the new desktop applications that are available from the repository include the Songbird media player and the Transmission BitTorrent client .
The new version also includes updated versions of some major applications .
It ships with Firefox 3 and GNOME 2.24 .
OpenOffice 3.0 is not included in the default installation , but it is included in the main repository .
Although OpenSolaris includes a lot of useful things , it still only has a slim fraction of the number of packages that are available for the major Linux distributions .
The total number of packages in the main OpenSolaris release repository is 1,500 , but Ubuntu has over 20,000 .
Sun has several strategies for boosting the number of packages that are available for OpenSolaris .
This release introduces several new package repositories that can be used alongside the main repository .
The new " contrib " repository is for community - maintained packages that have n't been approved for inclusion in the main release repository yet .
The new " extra " repository contains proprietary software such as the Adobe Flash player and other applications that can't be freely redistributed .
There is also a new " pending " repository that contains packages that are automatically generated from source code at SourceForge and other locations .
The pending packages are n't intended for production use and can eventually be moved to the main release repository after they are tested by developers .
The relationship between these repositories and the process that is used to vet packages and make them accessible to end users is somewhat complex .
Sun developer Glynn Foster pointed me to an excellent overview that neatly illustrates how it all works .
It 's evident that a lot of solid planning and engineering effort is being poured into solving OpenSolaris packaging problems , and that 's a very good sign .
Developing on OpenSolaris
Right now , most existing Linux users will probably have difficulty adopting the platform because of the gaps in available software .
It 's viability as a development platform will depend entirely on what tools you are using for development .
It ships with Python 2.4 , which is pretty stale by today 's standards , but the main repository provides enough Python library packages to facilitate basic PyGTK + development ( Update : Python 2.5 is available from the repository ) .
Its Ruby stack is very sparse and it lacks some basic components such as IRB and the Ruby GTK + bindings .
The repositories are also missing a bunch of other basic stuff that I require for development , including GVim and Bazaar .
If you are doing any kind of development that reaches outside of Sun 's ecosystem , then you are much better off on Linux .
If you are doing Java development with Netbeans , then the OpenSolaris repository has you totally covered .
I was able to get a basic JRuby project up and running in Netbeans on OpenSolaris with very little effort .
Theming
There are a few things that have n't changed much from the last version that deserve a brief mention .
As I stated in my 2008.05 review , the Live CD installer is really excellent and it provides an experience that is totally on par with Ubuntu .
The look and feel of the system is also still totally great .
The default theme , which is called Nimbus , is elegant and well - designed .
There is also a new alternative dark version of Nimbus that is kind of hot but still in need of further refinement .
There are a few new icons and also new translucent background images for the panels .
The whole environment looks very smooth .
Conclusion
OpenSolaris 2008.11 is a very big step forward for Sun , but the relative paucity of available packages limits its suitability for the average user or application developer .
Sun has some creative solutions to address that problem and clearly has a strong grasp of user expectations .
OpenSolaris is making progress and is steadily becoming a more viable contender on the desktop .
Major new features like the ZFS snapshot visualization that expose some of the platform 's rich underlying functionality are a good sign that the developers are moving in the right direction .
The big question that all of this raises for Linux enthusiasts is obviously " Why should I care ? "
Linux distros already provide pretty broad hardware support and a much bigger selection of packages , so it 's a fair question to ask .
In my view , the advantage is that OpenSolaris provides another choice .
It offers some different technologies , a different community , and a different approach to development .
All of those things bring value to the broader ecosystem of open source software platforms .
I think that it is impossible to overstate the importance of competition as an instrument of progress .
In 1996 Rupert Murdoch hired Roger Ailes , a Republican media consultant , to build a new 24 hour cable news network .
Fox News immediately went to work to disparage Democrats and liberals .
They spent their early years mired in debt , losing $ 80 - 90 million annually .
It was only Murdoch ’s deep pockets that kept them out of bankruptcy .
Still , they had some strategic success as they badgered Bill Clinton with Whitewater and Lewinsky , and they corralled Republican and evangelical voters so that George Bush and Karl Rove could reach them more easily .
However , it was during the Bush years that Fox News began to outperform the cable competition .
CNN , HLN , and the launch of MSNBC diluted the non-rightist audience giving
Fox a plurality of viewers and bragging rights for ratings victories .
Fox enjoyed first shots at interviews and scoops from the administration and Congressional Republicans .
That brought them greater influence and gratitude from the halls of power .
In addition , the White House kept its TVs tuned to Fox , as well as those at Camp David , the Crawford ranch , and even on Air Force One .
Vice - President Dick Cheney even had a travel directive that required that “ all televisions [ be ] tuned to Fox News . ”
Woe to those staffers who failed in that duty .
There may never have been ( and hopefully never again will be ) such a close relationship between a news organization and a presidential administration .
In the end , they were even trading places as if they were merely different departments of the same enterprise :
When presidential advisor Karl Rove moved out of the White House to become a Fox News contributor , Fox anchor Tony Snow moved in to become Bush ’s press secretary .
Going forward , Fox will find themselves on a new frontier .
It is highly improbable that they will be the exclusive broadcaster in the White House of Barack Obama .
Although , I certainly hope that the new administration will pay close attention to the spew emanating from Fox , I do n’t expect them to be in cahoots .
Murdoch and company are definitely going to lose some of their clout .
There will be a new Chairman at the FCC , and a new position for a White House Technology advisor .
These will be knowledgeable and independent people who will serve the public interest – for a change .
Here is a sampling of the views of Fox News , and Big Media in general , from some senior members of the new administration :
President Obama : “ In recent years , we have witnessed unprecedented consolidation in our traditional media outlets .
Large mergers and corporate deals have reduced the number of voices and viewpoints in the media marketplace . ”
Hillary Clinton , Secretary of State Designate : “ There have been a lot of media consolidations in the last several years , and it is quite troubling .
The fact is , most people still get their news from television , from radio , even from newspapers .
If they ’re all owned by a very small group of people – and particularly if they all have a very similar point of view – it really stifles free speech . ”
Eric Holder , Attorney General Designate : “ With the mainstream media somewhat cowered by conservative critics , and the conservative media disseminating the news in anything but a fair and balanced manner , and you know what I mean there , the means to reach the greatest number of people is not easily accessible . ”
More President Obama : “ I am convinced that if there were no Fox News , I might be two or three points higher in the polls .
If I were watching Fox News , I would n’t vote for me , right ?
Because the way I ’m portrayed 24/7 is as a freak !
I am the latte - sipping , New York Times - reading , Volvo - driving , no - gun- owning , effete , politically correct , arrogant liberal .
Who wants somebody like that ? ”
This ca n’t be good news for Fox News .
But the network seems to be aware of the shifting landscape and has been preparing for battle .
They signed new long - term contracts with Ailes , Bill O’Reilly , and Sean Hannity .
They axed Hannity ’s foil , Alan Colmes .
They hired reinforcements like Mike Huckabee , Glenn Beck , and Judith Miller .
Clearly they see trouble ahead and are responding by stocking their armory with ever more weapons of mass deception .
Unfortunately for Fox , forecasts are not rosy for the disinformation station .
They are consistently the slowest growing cable news network , particularly in the all - important 25 - 54 demographic .
They have the oldest skewing cable news audience .
They are facing stiffer competition than ever , with the surging Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow ’s record - breaking debut .
The Fox News ratings crown was once unassailable .
Today , while still maintaining their first place average , they often come in second and occasionally third .
That was unthinkable two short years ago .
As for their future prospects , it is difficult to make a case for Fox to be optimistic .
In addition to their recent ratings woes , they are entering a period wherein the American public may not appreciate a network that is hostile to a new president who is held in high regard .
Obama is beginning his term with an 80 % approval rating .
Of course , that wo n’t last , and Fox will surely seek to shorten Obama ’s honeymoon .
But contrary to some media analysts who suggest that an adversarial relationship with Washington will benefit Fox , the truth is that Fox experienced its strongest growth amidst the friendliness of Bush years .
This suggests that it is not simply drama and controversy that propelled Fox ( although that is their preferred programming model ) , but that having powerful political allies helped them to succeed .
When looked at objectively , that should n’t surprise anyone .
When has having powerful political allies ever been a disadvantage ?
Nevertheless ,
Fox is pursuing the path of most hostility , as evidenced by their new schedule .
For further evidence note the response by Fox News commentators following Obama ’s inaugural speech .
Brit Hume ’s first comments were to find passages that might please the right .
Chris Wallace actually speculated that the flubbed oath of office ( due to Chief Justice Roberts mangling the text ) might mean that Obama is n’t really president ( Let the conspiracy emails begin ) .
Glenn
Beck spent the whole hour of his second show on Fox heaping scorn on Obama .
And while Rush Limbaugh is n’t technically on Fox , he is a charter member of the same ideological fraternity , and he has published a long dissertation on why he hopes Obama fails .
These guys are n’t wasting any time .
This is just a preview of what we have to look forward to .
The influence of Fox News is bound to decline .
The Obama camp would be justified in giving Fox a cold shoulder .
Fox deserves it for their brazen partisanship and for failing the test of responsible journalism .
Other networks should now get some exclusives and scoops .
And the more that this historic administration ignores
Fox , the less relevant they will be .
We will now see Fox revert to the behavior of an injured wild beast that becomes even more ornery and more dangerous .
We see it already .
It ’s important that we keep an eye on this threat , as it is not retreating to its lair .
But it is retreating in the hearts and minds of the American people , and for that we should feel some sense of relief .

Now he uses his big reputation to sell related products like Teaching Sells , Thesis WordPress Theme , Partnering Profits , and Lateral Action .
Timothy Sykes , a penny stock trader , first started his blog to promote his book about trading .
Now he sells stock alerts and DVDs that make him over $ 75,000 every month .
Michael Arrington of TechCrunch first started his blog because he loved analyzing tech startups .
Now he has an established brand and network of tech properties that net him millions of dollars every year .
As you can see , none of these people started off knowing exactly what they could do to make money online .
Instead , each of them started off with a blog and leveraged it to build a profitable business .
4 Reasons Why Your Blog is the Perfect Launching Pad
1. Develop connections with important people
You know how the saying goes , “ it ’s not what you know , it ’s who you know ” .
While I do n’t think this is entirely true , having lots of key contacts and being well - connected certainly gives you an advantage .
For example , if two people were starting movie businesses tomorrow – a former Hollywood film producer and a random Joe Schmoe , who do you think would have the edge ?
The film producer can easily ask friends in the industry for favors while Joe has no one to rely on but himself .
In the same way , starting a blog throws you into the industry that you ’re interested in and helps you to establish key relationships with other people .
Instead of having to rely on yourself , you have influential people to back you up and provide support .
After starting Winning the Web last year , I ’ve gotten the chance to talk to other Internet marketers who I admire and bounce ideas off of them .
There is such a thing as “ blogger bonding ” that will help you to get the attention of the key players in your industry .
For example , I ’m much more likely to promote a blogger friend ’s product than I would a random person’s .
Sure , the random person ’s product could be better , but the trust factor just is n’t there .
Blogging is the ultimate online relationship building tool .
Use it now and you wo n’t regret it later .
2. Build a customer base
How would you feel if I said you could have rabid customers begging to give you money before you even launched your business ?
Would you be interested ?
This is n’t just hype , I ’m telling you what ’s possible with a blog and some hard work .
Blogging enables you to attain leads and develop a loyal customer base before you even launch your real business .
For example , I plan on creating a premium content Internet marketing membership site here on Winning the Web in the next few months .
If I was to start from scratch , it would probably take me a tremendous amount of time and money to acquire new leads and gain customers .
In fact , I probably would n’t be very successful .
However , after blogging for over a year , I now have a solid customer base ( you guys ) of over 2,000 RSS subscribers and loyal readers .
People know what to expect from me and they know me on a more personal level .
There ’s brand recognition so they ’re much more willing to buy ( hopefully ) .
Start a blog and get your ideas out there .
The most important thing you can do while blogging is to establish a strong brand and reputation .
Develop relationships with your readers and keep them coming back for more .
The more leads you have via your blog , RSS feeds , and email lists , the easier it will be for you to expand into new projects .
3. Research your market
You ca n’t own your own McDonald ’s without first eating at one and working at one , right ?
In the same way , a blog gives you a taste of your market – what people want , what people are interested in , and what value you can provide to the industry .
Blogging is a great market research tool that engulfs you in the culture and allows you to experience the needs of your potential customers first hand .
Use your blog to communicate with your readers .
Write posts on related topics and look at your analytics and user feedback to assess what works and what does n’t .
You ’ll learn how the market reacts to certain things and you ’ll learn what kind of value you can bring to the table .
This valuable information will not only help you to run your future business , but it will also give you a better understanding of what type of business to start in the first place .
4 . Get the cash flowing
Other than the lack of “ good ideas ” , the other roadblock that holds people back from starting their online businesses now is money .
You need money to make money , right ?
While it certainly helps , money should n’t be the reason why you ca n’t get started .
A blog costs just a few dollars to maintain every month and is attainable by pretty much anyone with a computer .
All you need is time , and if you ca n’t spare a few hours a day then you really should n’t be thinking about an online business anyway .
When I started Winning the Web in 2007 , it pretty much made me no money .
Now it makes around $ 1,000 every month through advertising deals and affiliate marketing offers .
I then reinvest that money to further promote the blog and work on launching my big money - making projects .
Unlike most other businesses , a blog has extremely low startup costs – and yet has the potential to bring in cash flow that you can use to leverage other sites .
With all of the benefits I just mentioned , starting a blog is really a no brainer especially if you ’re just getting started .
How to Prepare Your Blog For Blast Off
Now that you understand the benefits of starting up a blog before creating any sort of online business , it ’s important that you know how to do it .
What do you need to do to prepare for blast off success ?
1. Stop thinking and build it now – action brings clarity
Stop thinking about starting your online business – planning and contemplating what to do .
While planning is important to an extent , it ’s my belief that action brings clarity .
You never know what will change tomorrow so you have to take action today and implement your ideas .
Experience is simply the best teacher and dwarfs anything you might learn in a book or blog post .
Quit whining and start your blog .
It ’s the first step to a successful business .
2. Participate in the community and make connections
You ca n’t do this Internet marketing thing on your own .
The sooner you realize this , the better off you ’ll be .
A blog is a great vehicle for building relationships and making connections .
Use it to its maximum potential .
3 . Spread your ideas – be known for something
When I say to build a blog , I do n’t mean to copy what everyone else is doing in your industry .
If you want to see success , you have to be unique and spread new ideas to your audience .
People will remember you for them and support you in your new ventures .
A blog without new ideas or unique value is dead .
4. Build a brand
In the past month , I ’ve given you 2 posts about how to build your brand : How to Be a Top 100 Online Marketer in 2009 – 8 Lessons in Personal Branding and How to Build a Brand Today – The Future of Your Online Business Depends on It .
Read through them if you have n’t done so already and put them into practice .
A brand is the most valuable asset you can have and it ’s extremely important if you want to leverage your blog to build a business .
5 . Develop your conversion funnel
Even as you begin writing on your blog , collect as many leads as possible .
Talk to your readers , encourage them to subscribe to your RSS feed , give away a free resource , and build your email list .
Like I mentioned , the more leads you collect over time , the more leverage you ’ll have once you launch a new product .
6 . Always work towards your goal
With blogging , it ’s very easy to settle for what you have .
Once you get advertisers and start making some money , you ’ll inevitably become more comfortable with what you ’re doing .
Your blog essentially becomes your business .
While this does work for some people , you sell yourself short by doing so .
Work towards your goal and have a plan in mind to develop it over time .
Remember that your blog is a means to an end , not the final destination .
7 . Get ready for lift off !
After you ’ve spent some time blogging and plugging yourself into the community , something will click inside your head – a new business idea and a plan of action .
Take it and run with it .
Use your blog to blast off your business .
3 , 2 , 1 … If you work hard and keep at it , it ’s only a matter of time .
How are you using your blog to build your business ?
Is there anything you can add to the post ?

San Francisco Esperantists Unite !
Alright , before anyone laughs at me let me first introduce this by saying that Esperanto is a hobby .
I think it 's a rather fun hobby , however , my interaction with other Esperantists have been limited to Lernu. net and one other person .
I 've always wanted a chance to meet other Esperantists face - to - face , however , it 's a very limited language .
For those of you who are n't familiar , Esperanto is a constructed language intented as an international auxillary language .
That is to say , a language which can be spoken between nations who do not share a common native language .
Esperanto originated from a man by the name lf L. L. Zamenhof , who published a book in 1887 entitled " Unua Libro " ( Trans : First Book ) .
I first discovered Esperanto some years ago through a friend and found that it was incredibly easy .
I started with Lernu and a lot of practice .
Eventually I found that I adored Esperanto and in only about three months ( of near immersion ; speaking frequently with some one face - to - face , writing , reading and listening to Esperanto music ) I went from a complete novice to an intermediate level .
Esperanto is n't for everyone , but if you 're the type of person who is interested in picking up a second or a third language or some one who thought that they were to old for linguistic study , you might find that Esperanto is a good starting ground towards learning that second and subsequently third language .
It 's been shown that there is a benefit to learning Esperanto as an introduction to foreign languages and it can help for learning the fundamentals of linguistic sutdy in order to learn more conventional languages .
Esperanto has grown in popularity and is even offered as a Conversational Espearnto course at Stanford University , which offers free and open classes .
I 've often lamented that I live to far away to attend the classes .
So what 's the plan ?
I 'm going to attempt to start a San Francisco Esperantist group , who meet once a month and perhaps spread the interest of this language .
Why join ?
Why not ?
If you 're hoping to get better at Esperanto , perhaps you could be around other speakers who could help you ( goodness knows I could benefit from some one correcting my grammar every now and then ) or if you 're interested in learning you could hear stories from other Esperantists about how they came about it .
If you 're interested please feel free to contact me by E - mail or follow my SFEsperanto twitter account for some updates and conversation about how this group is going to start and where it will meet .
Remember , tell your friends !

RAFAH , Egypt ( Reuters ) -
An Egyptian border guard and a Palestinian youth were killed during border clashes between Hamas and Egyptian security forces on Sunday in turmoil triggered by Israel ’s assault on Gaza .
An Egyptian security source said forces of the Palestinian Hamas group had also shot an Egyptian policeman in the leg .
The incidents took place near the main border crossing between Egypt and Gaza , where Egyptian riot police fired in the air to try to drive back Palestinians who had managed to penetrate the border wall .
The events are likely to aggravate tense relations between Hamas and the Egyptian government , which says that Hamas is largely to blame for the Israeli onslaught .
Israeli air strikes have killed nearly 300 people in Gaza in two days .
Witnesses said that during the confusion of the assault , dozens of Palestinians crossed into Egypt from Gaza as Egyptian riot police fired in the air .
Reuters correspondent Yusri Mohamed said he had met several Palestinians on the Egyptian side of the border who told him they had slipped across at holes in the border wall .
It was not immediately clear how the holes appeared in the wall but the exodus began within an hour of Israeli air raids aimed at tunnels along the Egyptian border .
An Egyptian security official said later that the authorities had detained about 40 Palestinians who had entered Egypt without going through the usual formalities .
Bursts of gunfire were audible by telephone from Rafah as Egyptian police tried to frighten the Palestinians off .
Gaza hospitals said 10 people were wounded by Egyptian police fire .
Egyptian state television said a border guard officer was killed by fire from Hamas security forces .
In Gaza , a medical worker said that a 21 - year - old Palestinian died of his injuries at a hospital in Gaza ’s Rafah town after being shot in stone - throwing clashes with Egyptian security forces .
Egypt has been cooperating with Israel for months in the blockade of Gaza , restricting the flow of goods and people across the Rafah crossing , Gaza ’s only access point that is not under direct Israeli control .
Egypt reopened the main crossing point on Sunday to let out some of the Palestinians injured in the Israeli attacks .
In January , tens of thousands of Palestinians crossed the border into Egypt after Hamas blasted holes in the wall .
It took the Egyptian authorities days to persuade them to leave .
SIXTEEN BRITISH UNIVERSITIES
OCCUPIED IN SOLIDARITY WITH GAZA : Three Thousand Cheers for Student Protest !
WONDERFUL NEWS continues to spread .

These students are making history , and the near simultaneous wave of occupations , with the number of universities occupied doubling in number over one night ( from 8 to 16 ) , puts to rest any notions of self - absorbed , self - seeking students who have no concern to become active in changing the world .
For that : 3,000 cheers !

Have you seen this video ?
Entitled Peter Schiff Was Right , 2006 - 2007 , it is an amazing , nine - minute compilation that features Mr. Schiff , the president of Euro - Pacific Capital , suffering the slings and arrows of various market gurus like Arthur Laffer , as he bravely predicts — again and again and again — in various television appearances that the housing bubble is going to lead to economic disaster .
One thing that makes it amazing is how unflinching Mr. Schiff is , how unyielding , how matter - of - fact , no matter how scornful and sneering the response from the other talking heads .
Even when they laugh at him , he keeps coming back .
The other thing that makes it amazing , of course , is that Mr. Schiff absolutely nailed the current crisis — and did so many , many months before the rest of us could feel the first tremor .
The video has become one of those “ viral ” events that take place on the Internet as it ’s passed around from one e-mail address to the next .
In fact , I first saw it when one of my brothers sent it to me — a brother who had never before evinced the slightest interest in CNBC or financial gurus .
“ This video is unbelievable , ” he wrote me .
You hear people asking : why did n’t anyone warn us of the coming calamity ?
The answer is that there were plenty of smart analysts , and journalists , who did warn , loudly and often .
But when you are living in a bubble , there is a deep desire to tune out dissenting voices , or to scorn them , as Mr. Laffer does to Mr. Schiff .
The herd mentality is a powerful thing .
I remember during the Internet bubble when my friend , Herb Greenberg , was writing devastating article after devastating article , poking holes in companies ’ financial statements .
Instead of being thanked by readers , he was flamed .
They did n’t want to hear it .
The same is true of another prescient journalist : my former Fortune colleague , Shawn Tully .
I recently asked Fortune ’s managing editor , Andrew Serwer , to send me a list of Shawn ’s stories warning about the housing bubble .
He sent back seven stories , two of which the magazine put on the cover .
The last one was written in August , 2006 .
The first article was written — are you sitting down for this ?
— in December 2002 .
The cover of the magazine ( left ) pretty much hit people over the head with the idea that housing prices could n’t last .
And here is the money quote :
Put simply , U.S. housing prices are stretching the outer limits of what ’s reasonable and sustainable .
Instead of cooling down , prices keep hurtling upward , defying the laws of economic gravity just as grievously as those unmentionable dot - coms once did .
In other words , what looks like a gift to homeowners today is potentially a recipe for disaster later on :
If the boom persists , housing will become so overheated it ’ll pull the entire economy into dangerous , fragile territory .
In a year or two , prices will fall with a thud , unleashing a double - dip recession that will pummel home prices even more .
“ Every day prices rise , the risk gets greater that a bubble will form — and unwind in an ugly way , ” says Mark Zandi , an economist with consulting firm Economy.com .
True , Mr. Tully was wrong in saying the prices would fall “ in a year or two . ”
Instead , it took five years .
But his overall analysis was right , and prescient , and like Mr. Schiff , he never flinched , even as the market continued to defy gravity .
Something to think about the next time you ’re wondering why “ nobody ” saw it coming .
Traditionally , the Boy Scouts of America ask the President of the United States to accept a role as the Honorary President of the organization .
Every president since William
Taft has accepted this title .
The presidents have accepted this role despite the fact that the Boy Scouts actively discriminate against gays and atheists .
If you call yourself either or both of those things , you ca n’t join the group .
( In fact , if Obama had tried to join the Boy Scouts as a child — back before he “ accepted Jesus ” into his life — he could very well have been kicked out . )
A group of 19 non-theistic organizations is now asking Obama to reject the title .
Here is the letter sent to President - elect Obama today :
January 13 , 2009 Dear President - elect Obama ,
In light of your campaign promise to bring the nation together in a spirit of change we need , we , the undersigned nontheist organizations , urge you to take this opportunity to signify that discrimination against atheists , agnostics , humanists , and other nontheists will not be condoned .
Thus we write to urge you to decline the title and role of honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America .
The BSA has acted vigorously in recent years to expel atheist and agnostic members and employees .
This policy expresses the Declaration of Religious Principle , Bylaws of Boy Scouts of America , art .
IX , § 1 , cl. 1 : The Boy Scouts of America maintains that no member can grow into the best kind of citizen without recognizing an obligation to God .
In the first part of the Scout Oath or Promise the member declares , “ On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law . ”
The recognition of God as the ruling and leading power in the universe and the grateful acknowledgment of His favors and blessings are necessary to the best type of citizenship and are wholesome precepts in the education of the growing members .
The BSA has elected to set itself apart as a private organization that may discriminate in ways contrary to the laws and practices required of local , state , and federal authorities .
Accepting the title and role of honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America would thus send the message that institutional discrimination against people who do n’t happen to believe in a god is acceptable .
Many presidents of the United States have taken on the title of honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America .
However , this tradition was established when discrimination against nontheists was , unfortunately , socially acceptable .
Given that nontheists now make up a sizeable minority of the American population — having more numbers than Mormons , Buddhists , Hindus , and Jews combined — the BSA is clearly out of touch with the spirit of pluralism , tolerance , and inclusiveness that compose today ’s American values .
By contrast , in 1993 the Girl Scouts of the United States of America adopted more inclusive policies .
Therefore , please decline the title and role of honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America until such time as the organization reforms its bylaws and practices to be non-discriminatory .
Yours in unity , American Atheists
American Ethical Union
American Humanist Association
Atheist Alliance International
Atheist Nexus
Camp Quest
Center for Atheism
Center for Inquiry
Center for Naturalism
Council for Secular Humanism
Freedom From Religion Foundation
FreeThoughtAction
HUUmanists
Institute for Humanist Studies
International Federation for Secular & Humanistic Judaism
Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers
Secular Coalition for America
Secular Student Alliance
Society for Humanistic Judaism
Good for all of them .
It ’s nice to see a group effort to raise consciousness on an issue most Americans do n’t know about .
In case you ’re wondering why the discrimination against gays is n’t included in the letter , the writers wanted to remain focused on the atheist issue instead of including the broader discrimination .
It was a conscious decision .
Here ’s hoping Obama says no to the BSA .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama sought to strike a delicate balance between hope and reality on Tuesday to reassure Americans mired in economic crisis that they would survive a “ day of reckoning . ”
Riding high in opinion polls as he delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress , Obama was careful to include a sober assessment of the grim economic situation and his efforts to fix it .
But the politician whose memoir was called “ The Audacity of Hope ” and who won the White House in last November ’s election amid chants of “ yes , we can ” was also back in stride , telling recession - weary Americans they can expect better days ahead .
“ While our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken , though we are living through difficult and uncertain times , tonight I want every American to know this :
We will rebuild , we will recover , ” Obama , a Democrat , said in a televised speech five weeks after taking office .
“ And the United States of America will emerge stronger than before , ” he said to loud applause in the packed chamber .
Obama was interrupted by applause more than 60 times as he addressed Congress , where Democrats control both chambers .
His primetime address came against a backdrop of growing anxiety across the country in the face of the worst financial meltdown in decades .
While his public support is strong , Wall Street remains skeptical of his economic remedies .
Jittery investors sent U.S. stocks to a 12 - year low on Monday , but the markets rallied on Tuesday on Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke ’s assurances that the country ’s troubled banks should be able to weather the downturn without being nationalized .
BANKS , AUTOMAKERS
Obama said more money may be needed to fix debt - laden banks and revive the economy , warning that “ while the cost of action will be great , I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater . ”
But he seemed to take a harder line against troubled U.S. automakers , saying that while he supports making the companies more competitive , the government would not protect them from their own bad decision - making .
Trying to show he will make good on his promise of fiscal responsibility , Obama said he had identified $ 2 trillion in budget cuts over the next decade .
Obama , who rolls out his first budget proposal on Thursday , has vowed to halve the $ 1 trillion - plus annual deficit he inherited from Bush by the end of his term .
That may be difficult , critics say , if he moves swiftly on his pledge to undertake a costly healthcare overhaul while the economy is still slumping and tax revenues are down .

But some analysts were cheered by his words .
“ Obama is obviously trying to allay concerns that there will be a budget blowout .
Whether he can deliver it or not is tough to say , but it is the rhetoric that matters , ” said Amy Auster , head of foreign exchange and international economics research at ANZ Bank in Melbourne .
Obama was quick with indirect criticism for his Republican predecessor George W. Bush , citing his administration ’s failure to plan for the country ’s economic plight and bloated debt .
Slideshow ( 29 images )
“ Critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day , ” Obama said .
“ Well , that day of reckoning has arrived , and the time to take charge of our future is here . ”
BREAK WITH BUSH
Underscoring his break with some of Bush ’s more divisive policies that damaged America ’s image overseas , Obama also reiterated that the United States “ does not torture . ”
He has ordered the closing of the internationally condemned Guantanamo Bay military prison where foreign terrorism suspects are held .
He also highlighted a shift in the U.S. military focus from Iraq to Afghanistan , saying he would soon unveil a plan that “ responsibly ends ” the unpopular Iraq war launched by Bush in 2003 .
He offered assurances that his administration would not pursue the go - it - alone approach for which Bush was widely criticized abroad , saying , “ In words and deeds , we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun . ”
He also made an indirect overture to U.S. foe Iran , saying , “ We can not shun the negotiating table . ”
First and foremost , however , Obama pressed the case for his economic approach while laying out a broader agenda , including a much - anticipated push for a healthcare overhaul and a stepped - up U.S. role in the fight against climate change .
He was candid about problems .
But with misgivings among some fellow Democrats that his tone has become too gloomy , he also injected a clear note of optimism .
Obama ’s first weeks in office have been marked by a $ 787 billion economic stimulus package , a retooled financial industry bailout program and a home mortgage rescue plan .
But he has also faced embarrassing miscues in the completion of his cabinet and criticism that some of his early financial proposals have been lacking in specifics .
Taking a page from Obama ’s upbeat tone as a candidate in delivering the Republican response , Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , a rising star in the opposition party and a potential presidential candidate in 2012 , entitled his rebuttal “ Americans can do anything . ”
Jindal insisted Republicans were ready to work with Obama on the economy but also tore into the president and Democrats who control Congress for legislation he said will “ saddle future generations with debt .
This week “ The Stimulus Plan Dating Game ” hits the Senate floor for another rousing round of monetary courtship between
We the Taxpayers and our three contestants , who are vying to lay claim to the Taxpayer ’s Mega - Jackpot .
Before we begin , let ’s meet our three contestants :
Contestant No. 1 : Like most American Taxpayers , Contestant No. 1 started his illustrious career with good intentions , lobbying on behalf of responsible corporations in D.C while simultaneously moonlighting as an ACLU lawyer .
Once swallowed by the D.C. political culture , Contestant No. 1 had no chance of escaping the abyss of greed , unless he was vomited from the underbelly of Greed ’s stomach – which coincidentally brings Contestant No. 1 here today .
Contestant No. 2 : Discovered burning a hole in a pocketbook near you , our second contestant takes pride in his elasticity skills and ability to help Americans slide headfirst into Bankruptcy .
Contestant No. 3 : Although unborn , our final contestant has a great deal at stake here today , since the ultimate burden of this week ’s Mega - Jackpot will fall on his or her shoulders .
Due to communication issues , Contestant No. 3 ’s responses have been recorded by an ultrasound machine , which translates the sonic airwaves into English .
Without further adieu , let ’s begin our first round of The Stimulus - Plan Dating Game :
We the Taxpayers : Contestant No. 1 , if you were an economic stimulus plan , describe to me what our first date would look like .
Contestant No. 1 : First , I would pick you up in our company ’s private jet , hybrid of course , and fly you to an undisclosed location in the Cayman Islands , where I would wine and dine you with the best that American money can buy .
After dinner , we would enjoy side - by - side Swedish Massages , during which you would tell me about all the dream legislation you would like to see Congress enact – with your name on it , of course .
Exhausted from looking so deeply into your eyes and pretending to care , we would head back to our own rental island for a nightcap and romantic evening as I try to lobby you into bed .
We the Taxpayers : Wow , Contestant No. 1 , you really know how to treat a Taxpayer .
So I take it we ’ll be going Dutch ?
( laughs at own joke as audience joins in , laughing at own expense )
The same question goes to you Contestant No. 2 .
Contestant No. 2 : Let ’s just say if you choose me , the sky ’s the limit with your credit line .
And no more annoying late fees , if you know what I mean ( winks at audience , which takes cue and laughs ) .
As if you had rubbed a bottle and wished for me to come out and sweep you off your feet , I will slide into your life and pick you up for a magic credit card ride .
Unlike Contestant No. 1 , I will let you decide where our magic credit card takes us .
With me , you can charge your dreams and watch all your worries slip into the next Congressional Bailout .
We the Taxpayers : Sounds great , but unfortunately I am afraid of heights — ( pauses for comedic effect ) — high Annual Percentage Rates that is ( laughs at own joke as audience joins in ) .
Contestant No. 3 , since you have n’t been born yet and the thought of talking to an incubator over dinner and conversation sounds a little embarrassing , I will ask you a different question .
If my eyes were matching crystal balls and you looked into them , what type of future do you see for us in , say 40 years ?
Contestant No. 3 : ( through translator ) I see China .
Everyone on earth speaks freakin’ Chinese , including you and me and this ultrasound Speak - Easy you sick bastards have jammed down my throat .
I hope I ’m never born , and if I am , I swear to God I will be a Libertarian .
We the Taxpayers : Wow , so young , yet so cynical Contestant No. 3 . I think somebody needs an infusion of Hope ( laughs at attempt to make joke ) .
Thus ends the first round of The Stimulus Plan Dating Game .
Tune in for the next round to see who indeed has the biggest package ?
( laugh track here )
Pin-Striped Pirates
Why does the UK retain a handful of colonies ?
To destroy the world ’s taxation systems .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian , 16th December 2008 .
If you want to know why Britain has never completed the process of decolonisation , look at two lists side by side .
One is the official register of tax havens , compiled by the OECD ( 1 ) .
The other is the list of British overseas territories and crown dependencies ( 2 ) .
Over a quarter of the world ’s tax havens are British property .
More than half of Britain ’s colonial territories and dependencies are tax havens .
Strip out Antarctica , the military bases and the scarcely - habited rocks and atolls , and of the 11 remaining properties , only the Falkland Islands is not a recognised haven .
The obvious conclusion is that Britain retains these colonies for one purpose : to help banks , corporations and the ultra - rich to avoid tax .
These figures scarcely do justice to the UK ’s responsibility for this menace .
The website Shelter Offshore , which helps people to avoid their obligations to society , has just published its list of the world ’s “ top 5 tax havens ” ( 3 ) .
Jersey , Guernsey and the Isle of Man come first .
“ These highly respectable British offshore tax havens , ” the site tells us , “ can be very attractive indeed ” , offering “ superior levels of investor privacy ” .
Privacy is the polite word for the secrecy and obstruction that helped to bring down the world ’s financial systems .
Last month the British government announced that it will introduce new laws to prevent piracy : the armed forces will be allowed to detain ships and arrest suspected robbers on the high seas ( 4 ) .
Yet the same government offers an attractive portfolio of tropical and temperate islands in which pinstriped pirates can bury their treasure .
That comparison is unfair – to pirates .
The freebooters who use these havens are responsible for thousands of times more deaths even than the notorious Abdul Hassan , known on the Somali coast as “ the one who never sleeps ” ( 5 ) .
Because of the secrecy surrounding the treasure islands , no one knows how much money they divert from developing countries .
Christian Aid ’s estimate – of $ 160 billion a year – is the lowest figure ( 6 ) , though 60 % greater than the international aid the poor world receives ( 7 ) .
The Pope suggests $ 255 b n ( 8 ) ; the US research group Global Financial Integrity proposes $ 900 b n ( 9 ) .
In all cases we ’re talking about the means by which hundreds of thousands of lives could have been preserved in the world ’s poorest countries .
But Britain ’s network of tax havens permits multinational companies , dodgy businessmen and corrupt leaders to snatch money from the poor .
Gordon Brown wrings his hands over the plight of the poor , and urges impoverished countries to earn more money through trade .
But by keeping our tax havens open for business , this mumbling Christian hypocrite ensures that even when the poor nations do trade successfully , they are unable to keep hold of the income .
This authorised theft , of course , affects us too .
We are robbed twice by these gangsters : once when they avoid the taxes the rest of us have to pay , again when the tax havens ’ secret banking arrangements cause the crises which oblige us to rescue the banks .
As the Tax Justice Network points out , the banking system collapsed because it became indecipherable .
The banks lost confidence in each other when they could no longer tell who owns what or who owes whom , and could no longer trust each other ’s financial statements ( 10 ) .
Nothing has done more to promote this distrust than the lucrative secrecy the tax havens offer to their clients .
Organised crime also depends on tax havens .
The OECD uses four criteria to determine whether a place is a haven : it imposes no tax , there ’s a lack of transparency , it has laws preventing the effective exchange of information with other governments , and the money which changes hands bears no relation to the business done there ( 11 ) .
The last three criteria are all essential prerequisites for large - scale crime .
In fact it ’s doubtful whether the traditional piracy now flourishing off the Horn of Africa would be possible without the more respectable piracy taking place in the English Channel , the Irish Sea and off the Spanish Main .
Anyone who wanted to stamp out drug smuggling , kidnapping , gun-running and fraud would start by shutting down tax havens .
But the crime havens have become so respectable that even the British government is now depriving itself of revenue .
It has become the major shareholder in the Royal Bank of Scotland , which has offshore subsidiaries in Jersey , Guernsey , the Isle of Man and Gibralter ( 12 ) .
Have the bank ’s new owners , in return for our generosity in bailing it out , demanded that it shuts these operations ?
No .
And that ’s not the worst of it .
The Inland Revenue , responsible for collecting tax in this country , signed a private finance initiative deal transferring its buildings to a company called Mapeley Steps ( 13 ) .
Mapeley Steps , which is registered in one tax haven ( Bermuda ) is owned by Mapeley , registered in another ( Guernsey ) .
Mapeley has boasted of paying no income or corporation tax in any jurisdiction ( 14 ) .
Why does the government keep these havens open ?
There ’s an answer in Geraint Anderson ’s book Cityboy – a crude but gripping exposure by a former research analyst at a City bank .
“ Eighteen years out of power has made these jokers so paranoid about being viewed as old Labour that every time Cityboys and entrepreneurs asked for business - friendly reforms they rolled over and allowed tax and regulatory changes ” ( 15 ) .
There is a standard British procedure for dealing with problems like this : by which I mean problems that generate bad publicity but which you do n’t want to address .
You commission a review and you choose the right man to conduct it .
Confronted with a vocal international campaign and a new US president determined to tackle this issue ( 16 ) , the government has selected a man called Michael Foot ( not the former Labour leader ) .
Until last year , Foot was the inspector of banks and trust companies for the Central Bank of the Bahamas in Bermuda , a British tax haven ( 17 ) .
Though the review was launched only a fortnight ago , he already seems to have decided what it will say .
Speaking about tax havens to the magazine Accountancy Age , he claimed that they had been given a clean bill of health by the IMF , and observed , “ I ca n’t see where the regulation failure is supposed to be . ” ( 18 ) The Tax Justice Network maintains that throughout his long career in Bermuda , at the Financial Services Authority and elsewhere , he has never raised any public concerns about systemic problems in the financial sector ( 19 ) .
The identity of the person the government appoints is an index to the outcome it desires .
Foot sounds like just the man for the job .
Even as it was commissioning this review , Brown ’s government tried to undermine international efforts to address the problem .
Teaming up with that revolting little monarchy Liechtenstein , the UK sought to strike out a paragraph from the Doha trade agreement which aimed to eradicate tax evasion ( 20 ) .
Thanks in part to British lobbying , the draft commitment was substantially weakened ( 21 ) .
Were Britain to release its remaining colonies , they would quickly succumb to pressure from the Obama government and the European countries trying to stamp out international evasion and organised crime .
We hold onto the Falkland Islands for their oil and fish .
We hold onto the other territories for something far more valuable : secrecy .

CEOs feel " entitled "
Posted
Feb .
2 - CEOs are reluctant to give up bonuss and other perks despite the recession because they feel entitled to them , say experts .
Ryerson University ’s Centre of Learning Technology and the Science of Music , Auditory Research and Technology ( SMART ) Lab have been working on the Alternative Sensory Information Displays ( ASID ) project to develop a ‘ musical chair ’ precisely made to induce vibrant emotions to deaf people thanks to music ( ouch , that was a tough one ) .
In other words , the ‘ Emoti Chair ’ as they call it is built to bring musical pleasure to the deaf and the hearing impaired .
The chair has a multitude of build - in speakers and vibrating devices delicately calibrated to “ translate music and sound into movement .
Whether it be rocking or vibrations , the music can be heard through the movement of the chair , expressing to the person sitting , the emotion heard in sound ” .
Music becomes the medium and the vibration became the generated art form ( I remember citing a similar sentence in my post on Daito Manabe ’s facial experiments , also extremely related to that audio - tactile realm of manipulating sounds and music )
The concept in itself is already a beautiful and a revolutionary one , opening our beloved musical world to the hard hearing people , but it is also an intriguing and very interesting means of experiencing music like never before .
Reading testimonials from the deaf people who experienced the chair really got me thinking about how personal and subjective a musical stimulus can be .
Ellen Hibbard , a deaf PhD candidate in Ryerson ’s Communications and Culture program explains : “ The first time I used the chair , I was blown away by the amount of information I could get about music from the vibrations ” .
“ For the first time in my life , I could feel sad or happy because of how the music vibrations felt on my skin .
I never felt those kinds of feelings before when music was played . ”
She even goes on to saying she experienced flashbacks triggered by the vibrations of the music , much like music constitutes an amazing memory buffer for us all .
And here ’s another interesting quote I found by Frank Russo , director of SMART Lab , who took a prototype of the chair to the Bob Rumball Center for the deaf :
“ It seemed that deaf people were able to identify the emotions that a hearing person would .
The people became really animated , they would just dance in the chair and many of these people have been deaf from birth ” .
Beautiful … just beautiful .
Let alone the fact that music is made inaccessible to you if you ’re deaf , so is dancing and singing .
The technology behind these experiments may change that in a not - so - distant - future .
And so to get to the original point of this post , the second ever concert for the deaf ( they had already tried out a test gig I think somewhere ) is taking place in Toronto ’s Clinton ’s Tavern on March 5th , with a series of Canadian performers and bands ( that I ’m discovering while I ’m writing this here article ) such as Hollywood Swank , The Dufraines , Fox Jaws , Dj Stephane Vera and some other acts that you can actually see on this flyer I just found .
I contacted a couple of guys from Hollywood Swank ( the drummer from Hollywood Swank , Carmen Branje is apparently one of the main organizers of the event and has worked on the development of the chairs as a student at Ryerson ) and The Dufraines and here is what they go to say about the gig :
I think its a pretty cool opportunity for us to be involved with the event .
There ’s gonna be a few genre ’s of bands at the show and I guess there will be a number of deaf people there coming up and trying the chair while we ’re playing , so it ’s a cool way to connect with the audience on a totally new and unique level .
Donny from Hollywood Swank MySpace : www.myspace.com/hollywoodswank
As far as playing we ’re amazed .
The concept and the whole idea is crazy and we could n’t be more excited to play .
This is the kind of show that will carry the fondest memories of any show we are likely to play , ever .
Dan from Fox Jaws MySpace : www.myspace.com/foxjaws
So there , for all of you living in Toronto , I would n’t miss out on this , and If ever you go , I ’de love it if you could leave your comments and impressions on this post ( would be great to have it streamed live or something .
I ’ll see if my doggy psychology will help me convince someone ) .

Students at two London universities occupy campuses in protest at Gaza attacks
By Paul Mitchell
17 January 2009
Students at two British universities have carried out occupations in protest at the war in Gaza .
More are being planned on other campuses .
Occupation committee at the London School of Economics
Students at the School of Oriental and Asian Studies in London started their occupation on Tuesday issuing a leaflet explaining that " the current war of Israel against Gaza is yet another manifestation of the injustice which has been occurring un-remarked by the Western press since the establishment of the state of Israel , and the simultaneous expulsion of almost 914,000 Palestinians from their homes in 1948 . "
It condemned Israel 's violent seizures of land and the detention and forced exile of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians since then .
" World leaders have refused to condemn outright the massive overreaction by the Israeli state to the rocket attacks by Hamas ; a manifestation of the frustration and fear of the occupied peoples .
The Israelis are backed by the most powerful government in the world , the Palestinians have nothing to defend themselves but a few simple rockets , stones , and their bodies , " the statement continued .
" That is why we must protest , and why we must make our voices heard using any means necessary ; because this conflict has never been equal .
Because we stand on the side of the oppressed , " the statement concluded .
SOAS student Haroun Lazim explained that the occupation had erupted over three issues — the illegal occupation of Palestinian land and the atrocities being committed in Israel , an exhibition " We Were There " held in the university 's Brunei gallery by the Ministry of Defence ( MOD ) promoting the role played by ethnic minorities in the UK 's colonialist wars and the privatisation of the university facilities .
Haroun said the protesters had issued a set of demands to SOAS director Professor Paul Webley , including the publication of a statement condemning Israel 's actions , the closure of the MOD exhibition and greater student control of the university facilities .
He said that several students had decided to carry out an occupation similar to the one at the university in 2000 protesting against tuition fees because several motions had been passed by the Students '
Union supporting the Palestinians , criticising privatisation and addressing other issues .
The students set up an alternative exhibition to the one organised by the MOD " to display solidarity with the people of Gaza " which was banned to any " uniformed presence " and organised several meetings .
They called " for other students to join us here and in similar demonstrations at other universities . "
Students at the London School of Economics responded to the SOAS call by occupying one of the main lecture theatres .
A statement from the occupation committee said , " LSE is an institution founded on the Fabian values that were the precursor of the human rights agenda of modern politics .
LSE must restate those values and condemn state criminality .
It is not a matter of politics , it is a matter of humanity . "
The statement demanded that the university condemn the attack on Gaza , stop investments in arms companies that supply the Israeli military and increase the number of scholarships available to Palestinian students .
So far the SOAS and LSE authorities seemed to have backed down from any confrontation with the students .
Although LSE director Howard Davies has warned that " were there to be any damage ( which would surprise me ) or disruption of the education of other students , we might have to take a different view , but I am sure that is not in your minds . "
Both institutions have insisted that they will not condemn the Israeli aggression in Gaza .
SOAS 's Webley says that , " it would be inappropriate for the School to make any overtly political statement as an institution . "
Davies insists that , " the School 's Council has reiterated its position ... that the School will not take a position on the Israel / Palestine dispute . "
But as the LSE student statement makes clear " this is in stark contrast to an overtly political statement issued by Davies in May 2007 condemning a UCU ( University and College Union ) resolution concerning the Israeli Occupation , and previous condemnations by LSE of South African Apartheid and the Tiananmen Square massacre in the 1980s . "
Davies says he is quite happy for the LSE to become involved in " legitimate humanitarian charity " and for students to send surplus books and computers students to " deserving institutions " in Palestine .
Students should be wary that their courageous and principled political stand does not become co-opted into a charity exercise and should consider the perspective based on the unity of the Jewish and Arab working classes in the struggle for a Socialist Federation of the Middle East , which is bound up with the overthrow of capitalism across the world .
Swiss police said Thursday they stumbled across a large marijuana plantation while using Google Earth , the search engine company ’s satellite mapping software .
Police said they arrested 16 people and seized 1.1 tons ( 1.2 US tons ) of marijuana as well as cash and valuables worth 900,000 Swiss francs ( $ 780,000 ) .
Officers discovered the hemp field in the northeastern canton ( state ) of Thurgau last year while investigating an alleged drug ring , said the head of Zurich police ’s specialist narcotics unit Norbert Klossner .
The plantation , measuring almost two acres ( 7,500 square meters ) , was hidden inside a field of corn .
But officers using Google Earth to locate the address of two farmers suspected of involvement in the drug operation quickly spotted the illegal crop .
“ It was an interesting chance discovery , ” said Klossner .
Prosecutor Gabi Alkalay told reporters in Zurich that she plans to complete her criminal investigation in February , after which she will formally charge the 16 suspects and ask for prison sentences for all of them .
The gang is alleged to have sold up to 7 tons ( 7.7 US tons ) of hashish and marijuana between 2004 and 2008 , with an annual turnover of 3 - 10 million francs a year , officials said .
Is there anything that Google ca n’t do ?

Charlotte Peters got more than she expected when having Lottery tickets purchased by her late husband checked at the grocery store .
Her husband bought her the ticket the day he died , suddenly .
Peters did n’t look at the ticket until recently , she said .
Expecting she might win a few dollars , Peters was stunned to learn that one of the tickets was worth $ 10,022,823 , making her Connecticut ’s First Lottery Millionaire of the New Year .
“ It ’s certainly more than the $ 2 I ’m used to winning , ” Peters said .
Surrounded by family members , Peters presented her winning ticket to Lottery officials at the gency ’s Rocky Hill headquarters .
She has not yet made plans for the windfall .
Lottery regulations allow jackpot winners 60 days after filing a claim to determine a prize payment option that is best for them .
Winners can opt to receive Connecticut ’s Classic Lotto jackpot prizes in 21 equal annual payments or in a one - time cash lump sum amount .
Peters intends to speak with professional financial planners to help her choose which payment option will be best for her .
If she selects the annuity option , she ’ll receive $ 477,277 ( pre-taxes ) annually for 21 payments .
The choice of a one - time cash lump sum payment will be worth $ 6,048,0777 ( pre-taxes ) .
While Peters ’ winning jackpot ticket was the only one sold for the Dec. 2 Lotto drawing , there were also 17,168 additional winning tickets in that draw , winning prizes ranging from $ 2 to $ 1,302 .
Peter ’s winning Classic Lotto numbers were 02-07-09-11-27-33 .
Prior to Peters ’ Dec. 2 win , Connecticut ’s Classic Lotto ’s jackpot was last won in June 2008 .
I tried to talk to Peters , but she declined further interviews .
IT ’S A LOTTERY WORLD :
Tonight ’s Mega Millions draw is $ 12 million , after someone won $ 46 million last Friday in California .
Wednesday ’s Powerball is worth $ 105 million .
Remember to play a new ticket because the game has changed to a 5/59 , 1/39 pick .
Friday night ’s Euro Millions offers a jackpot of more than 53 million euros .
That ’s more than $ 70 million , U.S .
Good luck everyone .
And welcome to the Powerball family , Florida .
REYKJAVIK , Iceland , Jan. 28 ( UPI ) --
An Icelandic political party says it will name an openly gay government minister to the post of interim prime minister .
The country 's Social Democratic Alliance Party has picked Johanna Sigurdardottir , 66 , to be prime minister in the wake of this week 's collapse of Iceland 's ruling conservative coalition , The Daily Mail reported Wednesday .

Currently Iceland 's social affairs minister , Sigurdardottir , described as a former flight attendant who rose through the political ranks , could confirmed as early as this week by Iceland 's new ruling coalition of the Alliance Party and the Left - Green movement , the newspaper said .
" She is a senior parliamentarian , she is respected and loved by all of Iceland , " Environment Minister Thorunn Sveinbjarnardottir , a fellow Alliance Party member , told the British newspaper .
Sigurdardottir will face a massive job of rebuilding Iceland 's economy , which has been battered the collapse of three major banks saddled by huge debt loads .
The bank failures triggered a plunge in Iceland 's currency , inflation and rising unemployment .

An Illuminating Story 2008 Darwin Award Winner
Confirmed True by Darwin
The gentleman in question illegally opened a major power junction box at the front of his house , intending to hard - wire a cable to his garden shed .
Unfortunately , he attempted to do this rewiring during a major downpour .
The result was all too predictable .
The poor chap was immediately deep fried , and declared a Darwin Award at the scene .
Lessons :
1-- Do n't wire your shed to a local power substation .
2-- Do n't wire your shed to a power substation ... in the rain .
3-- There is such a thing as being too frugal .

Sponsored Feature : Light It Up ! Quake Wars Gets Ray Traced
By Daniel Pohl
[ Ray tracing can offer amazing graphical renderings , but it is often seen as too computationally taxing for real - time use .
In this sponsored article , part of the Intel Visual Computing microsite , Daniel Pohl of Intel 's ray tracing group discusses how his team brought their past successes with the technique to Splash Damage 's multiplayer shooter Enemy Territory : Quake Wars . ]
A scene unfolds in the computer room of a major university .
Those watching sense electricity in the air , the kind of tension that builds before a thunderstorm , as a cluster of 20 networked PCs , each equipped with spanking new dual - socket technology and dual processors , warm to the task assigned to them : distributed ray tracing of the game Quake 3 ( www.q3rt.de).
Though the modest display resolution ( 512x512 ) and a frame rate of 20 frames per second ( fps ) are n't overwhelming by the standards of the day , this does n't diminish the accomplishment in the least .
Special effects never before seen flimmer across the display screen .
The viewers watch with rapt attention and a feeling of satisfaction as the intricately rendered images move about the screen .
Amazingly , this happened in 2004 , a time when most people rejected the concept of real - time ray tracing .
Back to the Future ( 2008 , That Is )
A new research project from the ray - tracing team at Intel advances beyond the 2004 achievements , this time converting the game Enemy Territory : Quake Wars , which was created by id Software and Splash Damage , to use ray tracing .
Read on to learn about the development process that followed , the challenges we had to overcome , and the benefits we ultimately achieved - all of which provide valuable insights into the future of ray tracing .
To pump up your visual adrenaline level , we 've also included numerous images to show the process in action .
By the time you finish this article , you 'll have a better idea of the ways in which ray tracing can quickly and easily render light and shadow .
Starting From Scratch
For this project , we started rewriting the renderer from ground zero .
Because of this , the very first images from the renderer were not of typical ray - tracing caliber , but displayed only the basic parts of the geometry , without any shaders or textures ( Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 . Quake Wars : Ray traced without textures .
Typically , games load their geometry from a variety of different model formats — either created over the in - game map editor or through external modeling tools .
Once it is verified that there are no missing objects , the loading of textures can begin .
Modern games have their own material description language that allows designers to easily modify texture parameters , blend textures , use bump and specular maps , and write small shader programs .
For example , compare the untextured image in Figure 1 with the unlit ( Figure 2 ) and lit ( Figure 3 ) textured images of the same scene .
Figure 2 . Quake Wars : Ray traced with textures ( unlit ) .
Figure 3 . Quake Wars : Ray traced with textures ( lit ) .
Today ’s games all use a rendering technique called rasterization .
Rasterization requires difficult programming work and as many special effects ( such as shadows or reflections ) need to be calculated as approximations over multiple rendering passes and are often stored in resolution - limited textures in between .
These approximations fail in certain cases .
Let ’s look closer at shadows .
With ray tracing , you only need to check if the path from the light to the surface is blocked or not .
This can be easily determined with just a ray ( the so - called " shadow ray " ) .
If the ray from the light source can reach the surface , the point on the surface is lit .
Otherwise , it is in shadow .
The gameplay in Quake Wars : Ray Traced takes place primarily outdoors , where the most important light source is sunlight .
We were able to apply this form of lighting to the scenes quite easily , and the appearance of the shadows is what one would expect .
Transparencies
Instead of employing real 3D geometry , game developers sometimes approximate 3D properties with a 2D quad surface ( or two triangles , as shown in Figure 4 ) and a texture on which transparency values have been applied .
Figure 4 . Example of a partially transparent leaf texture applied to a two - triangle surface .
Creating correct shadows from partially transparent quads is not an easy task for a rasterizer .
The most commonly used algorithms for calculating shadows in rasterization ( called " shadow mapping " — see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mapping) does not deliver additional information that might help in the case of shadows from transparencies .
For that reason , shadows are sometimes baked into textures , and , because of this , they do n’t change when the light position changes ( such as when a scene changes from sunrise to sundown ) .
When using ray tracing , however , the algorithmic solution is simple .
If the shadow ray hits an object , the program can read the transparency value of the texture and continue tracing that ray , when the texture sample is transparent .
This offers interesting special effects , but also creates challenges .
The images in Figure 5 show an animated force - field shader effect that casts a different intense shadow depending on the transparency values of the orange force field .
Figure 5 . Different shadows from different amounts of transparencies .
Another advantage of using a ray tracer for partially transparent objects is that they do n’t need to be sorted by their depth .
This makes it easier for the developer , but there is a downside : increased rendering costs .
Whenever a ray hits such a surface , another ray needs to be shot from that point in the same direction .
If this happens once , the impact is small .
But what happens if you have ten or more of these surfaces in a row ?
This can happen if a tree , for example , consisting of a mix of partially transparent quads , is rendered [ Figure 6 ( a ) and ( b ) ] .
Figure 6 ( a ) .
Tree model consisting of many partially transparent quads .
Figure 6 ( b ) .
Same tree model rendered with textures and transparencies .
Rendering a large number of those trees in the outdoor world quickly became our biggest performance bottleneck .
During several optimization cycles , we came up with many improvements .
The following improvements had the greatest impact on performance .
Avoid shooting a new ray each time after reading the transparency value ; instead , we reused the same ray now originating from the hit position and continued in the same direction afterwards .
Signify whether a texture uses transparencies with a single flag .
If not , there is no need to shoot additional rays through potential transparencies .
The bark inside a tree is an example of an opaque texture mixed in between many partially transparent textures .
Decrease the number of rays that are bundled together .
In many cases , bundling rays with almost the same path can lead to substantial speedups .
However , if one part of the bundle hits another surface then the other one , it produces some reorganization .
In the case of rendering the trees , this overhead can become significant , slowing everything down .
Even after a great deal of tweaking , rendering the trees is still very time consuming .
We visualized the costs of rendering a single pixel in a color scheme where a blue pixel represents a quickly calculated pixel and a red pixel an expensive one ( Figure 7 ) .
An intense red is also more costly than a light red tone .
As can be seen in the figure , rendering the trees is still more expensive than rendering a reflecting water surface or other parts of the scene .
More research needs to be done on rendering these trees to discover if further improvements are possible .
Figure 7 . Performance costs encoded in colors .
Blue takes less time than red .
Adding More Special Effects
In our ray - tracing conversion , once we reached the same quality as the original game , we began adding enhancements and more special effects .
Ray tracing does a very good job with reflections and refractions .
The most common everyday objects in the world that exhibit this behavior are glass and water .
Glass
A large dome exists in the original game .
We changed the surface properties of the dome so that it would appear to be made out of glass ( Figure 8 ) .
Using the refraction index for glass ( which you can find in your favorite physics books ) , we wrote a shader to accurately depict the reflections and refractions .
The code is about 15 lines long in our HLSL - like ray - tracing shading language and generates very pleasing results .
Figure 8 .
Dome appears to be made out of glass after applying a shader .
Water
Rendering water can be accomplished different ways .
We investigated two approaches : water on a 2D surface and water with genuine 3D properties ( Source : Implementation by Jacco Bikker ) .
To render the water in 2D , we used a bump map to simulate waves [ Figure 9 ( a ) ] .
The 3D water image uses a mesh with around 100,000 triangles in several subgrids [ Figure 9 ( b ) ] .
Those subgrids are updated every frame , depending on their visibility .
( During rendering , subgrids that are not visible are ignored . )
The visibility test is performed over rays .
Figure 9 ( a ) .
Water with a 2 - D surface and a bump map .
Figure 9 ( b ) .
Water with a real 3 - D surface .
The Performance Issue
Performance is the main reason why ray tracing is not yet used in mainstream games .
Compared to special - purpose rasterization graphics hardware — such as current - generation GPUs — ray tracing is fairly slow .
Also , a lack of texture units for our CPU - based approach to ray tracing causes significant slowdowns when trilinear filtering is used for all texture samples .
With Intel ’s latest quad - socket systems — equipped with a 2.66 GHz Dunnington processor in each socket — we can achieve approximately 20 to 35 fps at a resolution of 1280x720 .
Nonetheless , this represents a significant improvement over the experiments in 2004 that required 20 machines to render a simpler game more slowly and at a lower resolution .
The greatest performance gains result from research efforts around the world that improve efficiency and the new , many - core hardware platforms that use parallelism to accelerate graphics operations .
The Future of Ray Tracing
As mentioned earlier , creating very realistic shadows in games is not an easy task .
Given the current state of our demo work , only hard - edged shadows are produced .
Modern games tend toward soft shadows , which usually require many more rays .
This important topic deserves more study ; smarter approaches to this task need to be developed .
Also , to obtain higher quality images , better anti-aliasing methods are needed .
Adaptive super - sampling is a smart way of refining the rendering of the scene at those exact places where it will deliver the greatest benefit .
There are experimental implementations , but they need to be tested and tuned for the best results .
With the industry moving from multi-core to many - core ( that is , greater than ten cores ) , improving the algorithms so they can fully use the newly acquired power will be interesting .
Even though Intel ’s upcoming many - core graphics architecture , code named Larrabee , has been primarily developed as a rasterizer card , it will also be freely programmable .
This opens up some extremely interesting opportunities to perform ray tracing with the Larrabee architecture .
Stay tuned for more information about our upcoming ray - tracing projects !

Turley : Most people abroad will view Bush as a war criminal
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Barack Obama has now been inaugurated as president , and the fear expressed by MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow on Monday night that George Bush might issue last - minute pardons of administration officials involved in torture , possibly including himself , has not come to pass .
However , the torture issue itself is not going to go away so easily .
As Maddow also noted , “ The calls for a reckoning are growing by the day — and not just from progressives outside the government . ”
“ Do you think that Obama and his team realized how hot an issue this would become and would stay ? ” Maddow asked Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley .
“ I do n’t think so , ” Turley replied .
“ I do n’t think the people in that building thought it , ” he added , pointing to the Capitol .
“ I mean , that building is where principles go to die .
And they have n’t , because there ’s been this groundswell of people saying , ‘ Look , you might be able to get away with an electronic surveillance program and say that ’s just a crime we ’re not going to allow to be prosecuted , but these are war crimes . , these are a special category . ' ”
“ I think that the new Barack Obama , the President Obama , is going to find it very hard to go round the world and to say that we ’re now again the nation of rules of law , ” Turley suggested , “ if the first act he commits as president is to talk away from a confirmed war crime . ”
“ Are we literally looking at a possibility , ” Maddow asked , “ where administration officials from this [ previous ] administration cannot travel abroad to the other 145 countries that have signed the torture treaty because they might get arrested ? ”
“ Most certainly , ” Turley replied .
“ The status of George Bush is not that different from Augusto Pinochet .
They ’ve both been accused of running a torture program .
And outside this country , there ’s not this ambiguity about what to do with a war crime . …
Most people abroad are going to view you not as former President George Bush , they ’re going to view you as a current war criminal . ”
“ And they ’re going to view us as an outlaw regime for not arresting him on our own soil , ” Maddow remarked .
“ I think so , unfortunately , ” Turley agreed .
“ A lot ’s at stake . ”

On Dec. 26 supporters of Mexico ’s rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army ( EZLN ) began the “ World Festival of Dignified Rage ” in the Federal District ( DF , Mexico City ) .
The series of events marks 15 years since the mostly indigenous group took the world by surprise on Jan. 1 , 1994 with the military occupation of four cities in the southeastern state of Chiapas .
Some 2,500 people reportedly participated in the festival , which moved to Oventic in Chiapas on Dec. 31 and then to the city of San Cristobal de las Casas , which the rebels occupied at the beginning of 1994 .
The festival is to run through Jan .
5 . Speakers include representatives of the New York - based Movement for Justice in El Barrio , the Unemployed Workers Movement of Argentina and the Greek Alana Magazine ; Argentine - born Mexican writer Adolfo Gilly ; former Nicaraguan rebel leader Monica Baltodano , now a leader of the opposition Movement for the Rescue of Sandinism ; Uruguayan writer Raúl Zibechi ; and Bolivian activist Oscar Olivera .
Insurgent Sub - Commander Marcos , the EZLN spokesperson , made his first appearance at the event on Jan. 2 with a speech denouncing President Felipe Calderón Hinojosa ’s militarized “ war on drugs . ”
He charged that Calderón “ decided that instead of bread and circuses for the people , you had to give them violence … since the professional politicians are already providing the circuses , and bread is very expensive . ”
He also criticized the violence of the center - left Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) , which governs the DF .

The Republican Noise Machine does n't need the customary 100 days to size up the new president .
Right - wing commentators barely needed 30 days to come to their conclusion that they hate everything Barack Obama stands for .
In terms of speed and efficiency , the right - wing collection of bloggers , AM talkers , pundits , and yes , newspaper cartoonists , may have set a new land speed record for becoming collectively unhinged , as they wail and moan about how the new Democratic president 's turning America into a fascist state , or communist , or socialist , or whatever other bugaboo claim Glenn Beck and Laura Ingraham are tossing out to viewers and listeners on a daily basis .
{snip}
If we just pause and take one or two steps back from the daily / hourly barrage of hate , it 's obvious that faced with the new Obama presidency , the Republican Noise Machine has already lost all perspective -- has gone totally loco -- and it's only February , a mere month into Obama 's first four years in office .
Who dares to even imagine where the right - wing " conversation " goes from here ?
Secondly , Malkin tried to claim that everyone on the left used the Hitler / Nazi language , and to prove her point she did lots of Googling and posted links to sites that contained that kind of language or imagery .
But one was a photo of anti-Bush graffiti from Argentina , circa 2006 .
What that had to do with Malkin 's claim about American liberals , I 'm still not sure .
And many of the links Malkin posted led to sites I 've never heard of .
She did link to the landmark site Daily Kos , and a search there found lots of dumb , regrettable Bush / Hitler references .
But most of those were from 2006 and 2007 , 60 months after Bush had been in office , and most were by Daily Kos readers , or diarists , not front - page writers .
You 'll note that in her liberals - did - it - too defense Malkin did n't link to images of Markos at Daily Kos with his arms around a Bush - era swastika protester , or Matt Stoller or John Amato or Jeralyn Merritt -- or fill in the blank with any other A - list blogger you 'd like to mention .
Even after eight years of despair ( i.e. botched war , trampled civil liberties , mass incompetence ) , most prominent liberal bloggers never went there with the Bush - Hitler nonsense .
But Malkin , among the most widely read bloggers in the conservative movement , and just four weeks into the new Democratic presidency 's run ?
Hell yeah , she 'll pose with an Obama hater waving around a swastika sign , and then refuse to apologize , claiming the Nazi / Obama analogy was not " completely out of the bounds of public civil discourse . "
Because honestly , who knows more about the guidelines of " public civil discourse " than Michelle Malkin ?

Nobody disagrees that passing an economic stimulus package is the top priority for the incoming Obama administration and the new Congress .
Then what ?
Tighter emissions standards for cars ?
Easing the rules on organizing for labor unions ?
Universal health care ?
Ending the wars ?
Net neutrality ?
The flipside of knitting together a winning coalition of techies , anti-war activists , women , labor unions , young voters and the like is : ( a ) everybody thinks they were most instrumental in sending Obama and more Democrats to Washington , and ( b ) they want Obama and the Democrats to make their policy wish lists reality - first .
Or , at least , right after a stimulus bill is passed .
" But since Obama won by such a wide margin , no one group can claim credit for his victory , " said Scott Lilly , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , a liberal think tank .
Even before it addresses the stimulus package , Congress has to consider nine appropriations bills left from the last Congress , Lilly said .
And , while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi anticipates having a stimulus bill ready for Obama to sign by the Feb .
16 Presidents Day holiday , Lilly , a former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and a 30 - year veteran of Capitol Hill , said " that sounds to me to be extremely ambitious . "
After a stimulus package is approved , the legislative runway will get really crowded .
Health care reform is near the top of many lists , but not all .
The problems facing the country are so severe that Obama is not going to be able to favor one group over another because they were major contributors to his election , Lilly said .
" And there is probably an international situation that will take up a lot of the president 's time and attention after the stimulus gets done . "
Here 's a look at some of the proposals , wish lists and demands that await the president - elect and the 111th Congress :
Anti-war activists
After spending almost eight years toting George W. Bush effigies through the streets , the anti-war movement is confident that Obama will address its issues .
But even before Obama has taken the oath of office , he has already disappointed some .
" Obama has been missing in action on the massacre of people in Gaza , " said Medea Benjamin , co-founder of the anti-war organization Code Pink .
It makes little difference to her that Obama has avoided making broad policy statements before becoming president for fear of giving mixed signals to foreign governments .
" It makes me tremendously worried about what he 'll do when other situations like that come up .
It took him until ( last week ) to say he was concerned , and he did n't even call for a cease - fire . "
Code Pink has compiled a list of " President Obama 's Promises to Keep " from his campaign statements .
Among them :
-- End the war in Iraq .
-- Close the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay .
-- Reject the Military Commissions
Act , which critics say violates the civil rights of people held as enemy combatants .
-- Bar the torture of prisoners of war and enemy combatants .
-- Work to eliminate nuclear weapons .
-- Abide by Senate - approved treaties .
Organized labor
Labor organizations spent more than $ 450 million to send Obama and other Democrats to Washington .
The AFL - CIO alone has compiled a 64 - page list entitled the " AFL - CIO Recommendations for the Obama Administration . "
Top priority - besides jobs in the stimulus package - is the Employee Free Choice Act .
It would enable employees to form a union as soon as a majority signed cards saying they wanted one .
The Service Employees International Union , the nation 's largest labor union , will spend $ 10 million to support such legislation .
Various employer groups are lining up against it .
But would Obama be risking too much political capital early in his term on a politically partisan issue that could galvanize - and revive - conservatives ?
" The Obama transition team absolutely has not communicated that to us , " said Thea Lee , policy director for the AFL - CIO .
Some of labor 's other top wishes :
-- Health care reform .
-- Reverse staffing cuts that led to long Social Security claim backlogs .
-- Extend unemployment benefits .
-- Increase financing for food stamps .
-- Change Bush administration policies on government contract work , worker safety and training to be fairer to workers .
Women
The National Organization for Women has an 11 - page " Feminist Action Agenda for 2009 and Beyond " for the incoming administration and Congress .
" And that was our short list , " NOW President Kim Gandy said .
" After eight years of going backward with the Bush administration , we have a lot of issues that need to be addressed . "
NOW already has a beef with Obama 's stimulus package :
It is too heavy on male - dominated infrastructure - rebuilding - i.e. , construction jobs - Gandy said .
She 'd like to see more stimulus cash spread to what she described as " human infrastructure - rebuilding jobs " such as home health aides , teachers , teacher 's aides and social workers .
Here are a few top items from NOW 's agenda and Gandy :
-- Address the wage gap between men and women .
-- Stop abstinence - only birth control education funding in favor of programs that stress both abstinence and contraception .
-- Assure access to contraception .
-- Establish a Cabinet - level Office on Women that 's analogous to the Office on Drug Control Policy .
Environmentalists
Environmental organizations were some of Obama 's strongest backers , as many were upset by Bush administration positions on everything from climate change to land conservation to water policy .
Shortly after the election , leading environmental organizations , including the Environmental Defense Fund and the Sierra Club , created a new group called Saveourenvironment.org and submitted a list of goals to the Obama transition team .
Among them :
--
Cut the nation 's dependence on oil in half .
-- Move electricity generation to 100 percent from clean sources like wind and solar .
-- Create 5 million new clean - energy jobs .
-- Reduce global warming pollution by at least 80 percent .
In a speech on the economy last week , Obama called for " the creation of a clean - energy economy " that " will double the production of alternative energy in the next three years . "
Without being specific on the number of new jobs this would generate , he said , " We will put Americans to work in new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced - jobs building solar panels and wind turbines , constructing fuel - efficient cars and buildings . "
Techies
The Obama campaign had a special affinity with the online world , as it revolutionized the Internet as a fundraising and organizing tool in a presidential campaign .
The Free Press Action Fund , a media reform organization , has outlined an expansion of the nation 's broadband network - at a cost of $ 44 billion - and compiled a wish list that mirrors those of other online activists :
--
It wants Obama to back his long - stated support for the principles of net neutrality with a law that would " forbid discrimination on the Internet based on the source , destination or ownership of online content . "
--
It wants the Obama administration to champion greater diversity in media ownership .
Changes to current ownership rules could come after the administration appoints a new Federal Communications Commission chairman .
-- San Francisco's Electronic Frontier Foundation has been fighting how the Bush administration has used electronic surveillance of citizens .
It would like to see that practice end .
In a speech last week on infrastructure investments , Obama proposed " expanding broadband lines across America , so that a small business in a rural town can connect and compete with their counterparts anywhere in the world . "
OTTAWA–Arguing that a recession is not the time to cut income taxes , the federal Liberals yesterday served notice on Prime Minister Stephen Harper that he risks defeat if he goes ahead with across - the - board cuts .
Harper , whose minority Conservative government will stand or fall based on what 's in the Jan. 27 budget , has said the economic rescue plan being prepared for the budget must include tax breaks for middle - class Canadians , whose spending can help revive the economy .
The Liberals are opposed to making tax cuts the centrepiece of the budget , and new leader Michael Ignatieff signalled yesterday the party is prepared to dump the Conservative minority if the budget is inadequate .
Ignatieff , installed as leader early last month to replace Stéphane Dion , has shown only lacklustre support for the idea of a Liberal - NDP coalition ( backed by the Bloc Québécois ) to defeat the Tories .
But as he opened a two - day caucus meeting with a rallying speech , Ignatieff warned " if the budget does not respond to the circumstances , if the budget is not equal to the crisis that we all face , we have to vote against ( it ) . "
" This budget has three simple tests that it must pass , " Ignatieff told Liberal MPs and Senators .
" Will it protect the most vulnerable ?
Will it save jobs ?
And most important of all , will it create the jobs of tomorrow ? "
As they position themselves in advance of the budget , the Liberals argue that , while they generally favour income - tax cuts , it 's the wrong approach during the recession .
" We do n't want to see the Prime Minister come up with the kind of broad - based tax cuts that put Canada in a permanent , structural deficit once we recover from this ( recession ) , " Liberal finance critic Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants ) told CTV yesterday as his party gathered in Ottawa for the caucus meeting .
Liberal MP
John McCallum said such cuts are fiscally irresponsible at a time when the Tories have already put Ottawa 's books in a deficit position and there 's no way to ensure tax cuts benefit those who have lost their jobs or otherwise need help during the recession .
" There 's a very good argument to be made that this is not the right time for across - the - board tax reductions , " said McCallum , MP for Markham - Unionville and chair of a party advisory committee on the economy .
Canadians may not spend the money they save through tax cuts , which would deprive the economy of the sought - after stimulus .
It 's generally agreed that U.S. President George W. Bush 's attempt to prop up the American economy last year with $ 131 billion in tax cuts did n't work because taxpayers saved the cash .
The lack of an economic stimulus package in the Conservatives ' Nov. 27 mini- budget led the Liberals and NDP to join forces ( with the support of the Bloc ) in an effort to defeat the Tories and take power with a Liberal - NDP coalition .
In the 308 - seat House of Commons , the Tories have 143 seats .
The Liberals have 77 seats , the Bloc , 49 , and the NDP , 37 .
There are also two Independent MPs .
Harper now promises to use the Jan. 27 budget to bring in an extensive pro-growth economic strategy with so much spending and tax cuts that Ottawa could run a $ 30 - billion deficit this year .
The Liberals want to see increased spending on urban renewal and other programs to stimulate the economy , improvements in the Employment Insurance program to help the jobless , more skills training and more money for social housing .
Ignatieff , who won sustained applause from fellow Liberals yesterday , called for his party to become the " smart , compassionate alternative " to the Harper government .

" There is fear in the land , " said Ignatieff , who has been holding consultations across the country in advance of the return of Parliament next Monday .

A man who stabbed an Emu to death ‘ because he wanted to eat it for Christmas lunch ’ has been fined almost A$ 4,000 ( US $ 2,500 ) for animal cruelty .
An Australian court heard that , two days before Christmas , Patrick James Andrews , 23 , crept into the Emu enclosure at Alexandra zoo in south - east Queensland , where he repeatedly stabbed a 30 - year - old Emu named Mary , before cutting its legs off .
Zoo staff later found the animal dead in its enclosure .
After Andrews pleaded guilty to the animal cruelty charge , magsitrate Graeme Tatnell fined him more than A$ 1,000 and ordered him to pay an additional A$ 2,800 in restitution fees to Bundaberg Regional Council .
In a revealing indication of the state of mind that drove him to carry out such a depraved and senseless act , Andrew was also found guilty of six drug and traffic offences .
However , you have to ask whether such a relatively small fine will constitute an effective deterrent against apalling incidents like this happening again .

New York Post accused of racism over ‘ Obama chimp ’ cartoon
The New York Post has been accused of racism over an editorial cartoon comparing Barack Obama ’s presidency to a mad chimpanzee .
The drawing drew fire from civil rights activist Al Sharpton .
In a statement , Sharpton said : “ The cartoon in today ’s New York Post is troubling at best given the historic racist attacks of African - Americans as being synonymous with monkeys . ”
The cartoon by Sean Delonas is a reference to the police shooting Monday of Travis , a chimp who had gone out of control and seriously injured a woman .
The text in the drawing reads , “ They ’ll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill . ”
“ The Post should at least clarify what point they were trying to make in this cartoon , and reprimand their cartoonist for making inferences that are offensive and divisive at a time the nation struggles to come together to stabilize the economy if , in fact , this was yet another racially charged cartoon , ” Sharpton said .
But in a brief phone interview with CNN , Delonas called the controversy “ absolutely friggin ’ ridiculous . ”
“ Do you really think I ’m saying Obama should be shot ?
I did n’t see that in the cartoon , ” Delonas told the news network .
In a statement , New York Post Editor - in - Chief Col Allan said : “ The cartoon is a clear parody of a current news event , to wit the shooting of a violent chimpanzee in Connecticut .
It broadly mocks Washington ’s efforts to revive the economy .
Again , Al Sharpton reveals himself as nothing more than a publicity opportunist . ”
The worst fear of movie studios has been realized : DVD movie encryption has been broken .
A utility called DeCSS is currently floating around on the Net that will read a DVD movie disc and save the file on a hard disk , minus the encryption .
All that ’s required is a DVD - ROM drive – since CD - ROM drives can’t read the 4.7GB DVD movie discs – and a lot of disc space .
The faster the CPU , the faster it will process the file .
It takes around 10 minutes to process a .VOB file on a 500MHz Pentium III .
The hack opens up illicit online trading of DVD movies , although minus DVD - ROM 's interactive elements and outstanding audio / visual quality .
The utility , written by two European programmers requesting anonymity , uses DVD playback code found in software - based DVD playback utilities , like WinDVD , ATI DVD from ATI Technologies , and XingDVD .
Every player has a DVD copy protection decoder for playback , just like the hardware decoder in DVD players from Toshiba , Sony , and other consumer electronics devices .
One programmer who examined DeCSS said the utility emulates that same playback code .
But instead of displaying the video and audio to screen , it simply saves it back to the disk without encryption , since there is no encryption in playback .
" The bottom line is , if you have a decoder , it has to execute somewhere .
And that 's always been the weak link , where you can get at the encrypted material , " said David Moskowitz , president of Productivity Solutions , from King of Prussia , Pennsylvania .
Getting the decryption code , as it turns out , is relatively easy .
Using an in - circuit emulator – a device used to monitor hardware activity – Moskowitz was able to watch exactly what the DVD hardware does in decrypting the movie on his PC .
" With that information , it 's no big deal to create the [ cracking ] application , " he said .
One programmer who had a peripheral involvement in DeCSS development thinks piracy from this utility is a non-issue .
" There have been DVD ripping tools available for months , " said Derek Fawcus , a programmer in England .
" Among the things you can find are explicit instructions and software for making VCD copies of DVDs .
DeCSS is simply the latest in a line of methods of doing this . "
Some of the DVD decoder assembler code was released on the Internet , and Fawcus rewrote it in C code .
That code was later used in DeCSS .
Once decrypted , the DVD movie files , which have a .VOB extension , are too big to fit on a CD - ROM .
Most .VOB video files are 1 GB in size , and a movie will be in three or four files .
But there are many DVD conversion utilities floating around on DVD ripping sites , like DVDigest .
It has conversion tools , like DVD2MPG and VOBSplit , which can be used to convert a DVD movie into VCD format , which can fit on a CD - ROM disc .
There are even sites dedicated to converting DVDs to VCD format .
This means losing the interactivity of DVD - ROM and its tremendous sound and video quality , but it also means VCDs can be played on CD - ROM drives .
It also makes it easier to trade the movie online .
Movie piracy has been a growing problem on the Internet , with films traded in MPEG and AVI format via Web sites and private file transfer sites .
Movies in MPEG format are around 600 MB in size .
DVD supporters are not thrilled by the development .
" It was like pulling teeth to get the major studios to all commit to standard DVD in the first place , " said Jeff McNeal , webmaster of The Big Picture , a home theater enthusiast site .
" I consider this a disturbing development and only hope that it does n't curtail studio commitment to DVD as we know it today . "
To hear some conservative opponents talk about David Ogden , President Obama 's choice for deputy attorney general , you might have expected recommendation letters to come to the Senate in plain brown wrappers .
" An Obscene Choice : Obama Taps Porn Lawyer for # 2 at Justice , " blares a headline atop the Web site for Fidelis , a conservative group that has waged a PR campaign against Ogden 's nomination .
According to a press release from Fidelis , " President Obama 's Choice for Deputy Attorney General has represented Playboy , Penthouse , the ACLU and others . "
First some background .
Yes , as a lawyer in private practice more than 15 years ago , Ogden once did legal work on behalf of Playboy , Penthouse and other adult businesses .
Ogden was then a lawyer in the Washington , D.C. , office of the law firm Jenner & Block , which had an active constitutional practice representing a number of media clients with First Amendment issues .
In 1986 , Ogden famously represented Playboy ( as well as the American Council for the Blind , the American Library Association and others ) when he successfully argued in federal court that the Library of Congress violated the First Amendment when it refused to fund publication of a Braille edition of Playboy magazine .
The federal government pays to have many periodicals printed into Braille .
Ogden was quoted in the Washington Post at the time hailing the decision as " turning the tide in the censorship battle " and saying that he hoped the printing of Braille editions of Playboy " is not an intolerable burden on the program " but was " the price of violating people 's First Amendment rights . "
Ogden also sought an injunction to prevent the Meese Commission ( a commission on pornopgraphy ) from including Playboy in a potential " black list " of adult magazines .
And he represented a mail - order distributor of adult videos that challenged the constitutionality of a multidistrict prosecution strategy .
The Fidelis Web site documents numerous other briefs Ogden filed in obscenity cases on behalf of Playboy , the ACLU , the Amerrican Booksellers Association and others .
In a news release , Brian Burch , president of Fidelis , said , " Ogden ’s record is nothing short of obscene .
He has represented Playboy Enterprises in multiple cases , Penthouse Magazine , the ACLU , and the largest distributor of hard - core pornography videos .
He has opposed filters on library computers protecting children from Internet smut , and successfully defended the right of pornographers to produce material with underage children .
" David Ogden has collected checks from Playboy and Penthouse to fight reasonable protections for parents and children from pornography .
Ogden even sued the federal government in an attempt to publish Braille versions of Playboy magazine – at taxpayer expense , of course . "
During a hearing on Ogden 's nomination on Feb. 5 , 2009 , several Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee grilled Ogden for nearly two hours about positions he took in some of those cases .
Several asked Ogden about the Library of Congress case .
" I was representing a client as a lawyer in private practice , " Ogden explained .
" A lawyer in private practice does not sit in judgment of his clients .
His job is to present their views as persuasively and appropriately as possible . "
Orrin Hatch , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , challenged Ogden about arguments he once made against a law requiring producers of sexually explicit material to keep records about the identity and age of performers .
" How , " Hatch asked , " can we believe the Department of Justice will properly enforce this law , and if necessary defend its constitutionality when you have said for 20 years that it is unconstitutional ? "
Ogden said the courts have made it clear that the government has the power to require that records are kept , and he said , " I think the law is constitutional as it stands today . "
And he stressed that while he fought for constitutional issues in that case , it should not be interpreted that he believes obscene materials or child pornography should go unpunished or unregulated .
" I want to make it very clear that the laws against child pornography are extremely important laws , " Ogden said .
" I think that child pornography is abhorrent .
I think the efforts to exploit children is abhorrent and deserves the full sanctions of the law .
And that is my strong view . "
Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions noted that Ogden once argued against a congressional attempt to force librarians to put a filter on computers so that children could not view pornography .
Sessions said he understood that lawyers advocate for their client 's position , but he wanted to know what Ogden felt about that personally .
" I think it 's quite important that children be protected from exposure to materials that is obscene to them , " Ogden responded .
" I think that 's a different standard than what 's obscene to adults .
I think it 's appropriate for parents to want to have protections with respect to those materials . "
Republican Sen. Jon Kyl called Ogden 's attention to arguments he made against the conviction of a man found in possession of videos with girls in bikinis , or otherwise scantily clad , striking provocative poses and gyrating suggestively .
A court later ruled the videos were clearly intended to pander to pedophiles .
Ogden filed a brief on behalf of booksellers and library associations arguing that the videos did not constitute child pornography , that the standard ought to be nudity .
They lost .
Ogden said he'd have no problem enforcing the law , and that he would stand up for it if confirmed .
" That was an argument made for a client , " Ogden said .
" As the lawyer for the United States , I will aggressively and appropriately enforce the law of the U.S. to its full letter . "
So that 's a few highlights of Ogden 's representation of the adult business .
Supporters — many of them Republicans — say those cases are hardly career - defining for Ogden .
Rather , they note that while head of the Department of Justice 's civil division , Ogden was part of the team that defended the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 ; and that he helped to defend the Child Online Protection Act of 1998 .
In the hearing on Feb .
5 , Ogden said one of his proudest professional moments came from a brief he filed for the American Psychological Association arguing that child victims of sexual abuse sex ought to be allowed to testify via closed - circuit television due to the psychologically damaging effects of having to testify in person .
For the last eight years , Ogden has worked for the law firm WilmerHale , where he is a partner and co-chair of the Government and Regulatory Litigation Practice Group .
His clients include pharmaceutical , petrochemical , insurance , automotive , airline and media companies .
For a more complete look at some of the work Ogden has done for WilmerHale , check out his page on the company Web site .
Reginald Brown , a former Bush Administration official and current law partner of Ogden , said Ogden 's work for adult businesses has been vastly overplayed .
" He took some positions on behalf of interest groups that obviously the government disagreed with , " Brown said .
" It was by no means a majority of his practice .
The bulk of his practice over the last eight years has been representing various companies — energy companies , pharmaceuticals and even some government agencies .
I would describe it as a wide - ranging commercial litigation practice . "
As for the work for Playboy , Penthouse and other distributors of adult videos , Brown said .
" The extent of that work is greatly exaggerated and is taken out of context .
It 's borderline libelous to suggest that David has a huge practice representing the pornography industry .
That 's not to say he did n't work on the cases cited . "
Said Ben LaBolt , a spokesman for the Obama administration : " David Ogden is committed to fighting for families and children .
That is why his nomination has been supported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , the Boys and Girls Club of America , among others .
While Ogden served at DOJ , he led the U.S. government ’s defense of various antipornography statutes against constitutional attack , arguing forcefully against positions taken in some of those cases by former clients .
He will do so again as Deputy Attorney General . "
We take LaBolt 's point .
And we think when some people hear Fidelis and others refer to Ogden as a " porn lawyer " they may assume that Ogden spent the better part of his career representing the pornography industry .
That 's just not the case .
Ogden 's work with adult - oriented companies came more than 15 years ago , and only reflects a fraction of his body of work as an attorney both in private practice and for the government .
And we appreciate Ogden 's point — made repeatedly in the hearing — that lawyers sometimes take a position on behalf of a client that does n't necessarily reflect the views of the attorney .
Still , it is undisputed that Ogden once did significant legal work on behalf of Playboy and other adult businesses , no matter how many years or clients ago it was .
And so we rate the comment Mostly True .
Bolton have signed Benfica striker Ariza Makukula on loan until the end of the season subject to the granting of a work permit , the club have announced .
The 27 - year - old is a powerful centre - forward who started his career at Vitoria Guimaraes before going on to play for Leganes , Nantes , Valladolid , Gimnastic de Tarragona and Maritimo before moving to Portuguese giants Benfica 12 months ago .
Makukula shot to prominence in Spain and has earned four caps for Portugal , scoring on his debut against Kazakhstan in October 2007 .
The player becomes manager Gary Megson ’s second signing of the transfer window following the arrival of Sebastien Puygrenier from Zenit St Petersburg .
An ex-Marine “ went into combat mode ” against a crazed vandal and beat him senseless when he was attacked at the fancy Upper East Side apartment building where he works as a doorman , according to law - enforcement sources .
Andy Frederick , 48 , was working the overnight shift in the lobby of the building at 44 East 67th St. around 1:50 a.m. on Friday , when he saw Betzelel Levin , 29 , walking by and then heard glass shattering , sources said .
Frederick dashed outside and approached Levin , who allegedly had busted one of the building ’s windows and was about to kick in another .
“ The guy struck [ Andy ] in the chest .
[ Andy ] automatically went into combat mode and used his hands to defend himself , ” said Frederick ’s brother , Mario .
Frederick allegedly pummeled Levin in the face until he incapacitated him .
The doorman , who is studying at Brooklyn College to become a teacher , then dragged Levin inside the building to keep an eye on him while calling 911 .
Levin , who was charged with attempted assault and criminal mischief , was treated and released at New York Hospital , authorities said .

PHNOM PENH , Cambodia , Feb. 17 ( UPI ) --
The first war crimes trial for any Cambodian accused of taking part in the 1970s Khmer Rouge genocide opened Tuesday in Phnom Penh , observers said .
The defendant in the first hearing was Kaing Guek Eav , 66 , who has already admitted guilt in the torture slayings of at least 14,000 people at the Tuol Sleng prison , The New York Times reported .
Known as Duch , he has told investigators his superiors forced him to carry out the atrocities under threat of his own death .

The Times said four senior Khmer Rouge officials who were in a position to give those orders to Duch also are in custody , including the movement 's chief ideologue , Nuon Chea , 82 ; head of state Khieu Samphan , 76 ; former Foreign Minister Ieng Sary , 82 , and his wife , Ieng Thirith , 75 , a member of the Khmer Rouge Central Committee .
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998 .
Under his regime from 1975 to 1979 , at least 1.7 million people were executed or died of overwork and other causes , historians say .
Human rights advocates and legal experts say the hybrid tribunal form of the trials is awkward and is meant to protect the current Cambodian government , the Times said .
“ Khoda ” is a fantastic animated video made as student project by Reza Dolatabadi using 6000 paintings that were specifically created for the 5 minute film .
Each time you pause the video you see a new painting .
What if you watch a film and whenever you pause it , you face a painting ?
This idea inspired Reza Dolatabadi to make Khoda .
Over 6000 paintings were painstakingly produced during two years to create a five minutes film that would meet high personal standards .
Khoda is a psychological thriller ; a student project which was seen as a ‘ mission impossible ’ by many people but eventually proved possible !

You know how the Republicans in the Senate refused to spend $ 30 billion to bring the US auto industry back from the brink ?
It turns out that they were prefectly happy to waste $ 50 billion in taxpayer money on reconstruction boondoggles in Iraq on explicity partisan grounds .
A veteran Republican lobbyist , says the NYT , explicitly appealed to the then head of the Office of Management and Budget :
“ To delay getting our funds would be a political disaster for the President . . .
His election will hang for a large part on show of progress in Iraq and without the funding this year , progress will grind to a halt . ”
So “ a show of progress ” in Iraq was just so Bush could get reelected in 2004 ?
The irony of it is that Iraq turned into a huge catastrophe in 2004 , and the American public reelected Bush anyway .
The scheme should leave banks with more money to lend The Treasury is to announce an insurance scheme for banks next week to try to revive confidence in the industry , the BBC has learned .
It would allow banks who pay a fee to have their bad loans underwritten by the taxpayer up to a certain level .
BBC business editor Robert Peston says the move is designed to avert a further loss of confidence ahead of gloomy results expected from the big banks .
Treasury officials and bank executives have spent the weekend in talks .
The BBC 's business editor said : " It 'll be designed to give banks and their investors a bit more certainty about the losses they 'd face as the recession undermines the ability of many borrowers to repay their debts .
We as taxpayers would n't own the stinky loans - though we would be liable for losses on them over a certain level
Robert Peston 's blog " Our biggest banks would identify their bad loans and foolish investments , then pay a fee to a new state - backed insurer to protect themselves from the losses over a certain level . "
He added the government wants to prevent another " alarming " loss of confidence in the banking system weeks before HBOS and the Royal Bank of Scotland announce " unprecedented " losses .
Britain 's largest banks suffered sharp share price falls last week .
Under the proposals , banks would examine both corporate and private customers looking for potential defaulters .
They would then approach the new state - controlled insurance company , which in return for a premium would provide cover in the event of those customers not paying their bills .
Having insured themselves against potential losses , the banks would have more money to lend because they would not have to set aside vast sums in anticipation of bad debts .
' Real crisis ' Earlier , Prime Minister Gordon Brown said talks with international leaders were ongoing to tackle the global financial crisis caused by the failure of banking systems .
He said in Britain he would adopt measure to help families feel secure about their savings so mortgages can be provided and businesses can get loans .
He also demanded that banks admit how many " toxic assets " they have on their balance sheets .
What happened to the £ 37bn worth of taxpayers ' money that 's already gone into the banking system ?
Vince Cable
Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Mr Brown told the Financial Times the banks had to " come clean " about these bad debts so people could trust them again .
He said : " One of the necessary elements for the next stage is for people to have a clear understanding that bad assets have been written off .
" We have got to be clear that where we have got clearly bad assets , I expect them to be dealt with . "
In the FT interview , Mr Brown refused to rule out further bank nationalisation plans .
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said an insurance scheme may have to be tried .
But he said : " We do need to establish first of all what happened to the £ 37bn worth of taxpayers ' money that 's already gone into the banking system .
" Where did it go ?
Why is n't it coming out in the form of new lending ?
" There is a real crisis at the moment that very large numbers of very good British companies , completely solvent companies , cannot raise credit from the bank .
" They can not be allowed to go down in large numbers taking large numbers of jobs with them , simply because the banks are n't functioning properly . "
BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said amid a deepening downturn the prospect of more taxpayer support to banks may be unpalatable for those facing redundancies in industries which have been starved of credit .

Last Wednesday , Mark and Nicky Webster were told they will never see three of their children again , even though a judge accepted that allegations of abuse could be false .
Their story was the lead item on the following day 's BBC news , and appeared in several newspapers with pictures of the couple and quotes of them saying they felt they had been the victims of a miscarriage of justice .
But as of April , because of a change in legislation being introduced by Jack Straw , the Justice Secretary , the media will no longer be able to identify those involved in cases such as the Websters .
It will also be illegal for any children currently in care to speak out , even if they feel they are being maltreated .
The change , unremarked by the press , comes within an overhaul of the law on the reporting of family courts that has otherwise been widely welcomed by the media .
Currently there is a blanket ban on journalists entering family courts , but in December Straw announced a change to the law that will allow journalists to attend family court hearings .
" A really important veil is being lifted on what happens in these courts " he said .
The change was greeted warmly , particularly by The Times , whose columnist Camilla Cavendish had led the campaign to open up the family courts , for which she won the Paul Foot Award .
But what The Times omitted to mention was a line , slipped in at the end of Straw 's statement , stating his intention to reverse the decision in a case known as Clayton v Clayton .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Simon Clayton is an intense 47 - year - old book - seller from Hay - on - Wye .
In 2003 , he astonished locals in the Welsh border town by abducting his seven - year - old daughter , days ahead of a divorce hearing , fearing he would lose custody to his wife .
He was tracked down to Portugal and brought home under arrest , after which he fought a lengthy custody battle .
When his case was concluded , Clayton found he was legally barred from offering a public explanation for what he had done .
He fought the existing legislation , and in 2006 the Court of Appeal reached a landmark ruling that a parent should be allowed to identify himself and his child and tell his story .
It was decided that a parent 's right to freedom of expression was greater than a child 's right to privacy .
It is because of that Clayton v Clayton ruling that the Websters were able to speak of their distress on Thursday .
" Reversing it will mean that any child or adult who has been in a family court case cannot identify themselves in public , " says Clayton .
" The implication of this for papers is bad – editors are only interested in a story if it has a human dimension , if you can see the people or read about them by name . "
Liberal Democrat MP
John
Hemming agrees : " There are two issues here .
One is that the press will be prevented from reporting cases like the Websters with their names and faces .
The other is that , at the moment , children who are in care are entitled to speak out if they are unhappy , although it does n't happen very often because nobody knows how to do it .
The effect of this change will be to gag them . "
Since Clayton v Clayton there have been no complaints of invasion of privacy .
" Fran Lyon , Angela Canning , Bob Geldof , Jack Frost – there are more than a dozen people who have benefited from being able to go public with their stories , " says Clayton .
" There are thousands of people like the Websters out there who , once their cases are over , will want to log on to a forum and discuss what happened to them and get support .
As of April , it will be illegal to identify yourself in any way that could lead to the identification of the child . "
Similarly , there are occasions when the children may wish to make a public statement .
Clayton is incensed that Straw is claiming to be opening up the family courts while reversing the Court of Appeal 's ruling , and says he has yet to receive an explanation , or any reply , from Straw 's office .
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said : " The Secretary of State has made it clear that any move towards openness in the family courts must be balanced with the welfare , privacy and well - being of children . "
She added that the decision to reverse Clayton had been made following a consultation with a variety of bodies .
For better or worse , the balance has been tipped against openness .
Some say the child must come first , end of discussion .
Others see a sinister attempt to gag those who say the system does n't work .
Cavendish takes a less conspiratorial view , but is nonetheless perplexed about the reversal of Clayton .
" It wo n't cancel out the new legislation but it will make it increasingly difficult to report these cases , " she said .
" I 'm afraid I do n't know why it is happening . "
Humanity has shifted its karma into surpassing gear and political climate change has come to America .
Thanks to a grassroots up - wising , we the people huffed and puffed together in the same direction and the winds of change blew in a breath of fresh air .
And we can all breathe easier .
The vote in November was more than a vote for a new President .
It was a vote for a new precedent – to overgrow the " lowest common dominator " paradigm and take a step towards government of the people , by the people , for the people , where the government does our bidding , not the bidding of the highest bidder and where the Golden Rule can finally overrule the rule of gold .
In the short term , the up - wising has been successful and the American Evolution has begun .
The first big shots have been fired and we are on the road to recovering from an eight - year bout with Mad Cowboy Disease and Electile Dysfunction .
But now , if we want to heal the body politic of conditions like Deficit Inattention Disorder , Truth Decay and the deadliest one of all , an unchecked Military Industrial Complex , we must elect ourselves .
Spiritually , it 's time to quiet our barking dogmas and evolve past the Ten Commandments to an even greater realization – the One Suggestion : " We are all in it together . "
Once a critical mass of us chooses to live by this credo , we can avoid the critical massacre called Armageddon , create Disarmageddon instead , and achieve fulfillment as a species , Humanifest Destiny .
The End of the Age of Nefarious ?
Every journey into the light is preceded by a dark passage , and our entry into the Age of Aquarius is no different .
As predicted in the celebrated quatrain ( " When the goon moves into Lincoln 's house and stupider aligns with Mars , then greed will guide the planet and fear obscure the stars ... " ) , the Age of Nefarious delayed the start of the new millennium .
But now the quatrain is heading down a new track and soular power is shining a light on the endarkened corridors of soulless power .
Just as the eight - year journey that took us from Whitewater to Blackwater was coming to an end , some overzealous Bush - bashers hurled footwear to give the departing regime one final boot .
That was understandable , but unnecessary .
Better we should keep our shoes on and use them to stand together at a time when healing wounds is more important than wounding heels .
Besides , without Bush there could have been no Obama .
His alarming actions awakened more people than Buddha and a body politic in a fear - induced coma miraculously regained consciousness .
And now there is a new President , Barack Hussein Obama .
After eight years of insanity , we can proclaim to the world , " America has a President Hussein ! "
So now , we must face another awesome truth .
We are living in a world gone sane .
Welcome to the sane asylum .
Trickle Down Goes Belly Up
It 's a good thing our political fates are on the upswing , as our economy has taken a sharp downturn .
The house of credit cards economy based on trickle down has gone belly up and we must face another , sadder truth .
Individually and collectively , we 've been suffering from Deficit Inattention Disorder and since we were unable to do the math , we must now do the aftermath .
It 's a buy - o - logical fact .
You can not spend more than you have .
Nature knows this .
We can use no more energy than what we have in reserve .
We cannot charge energy on our Ascended Master Card and repay it next lifetime .
So yes , the casino economy is coming down , but there is an upside to the meltdown .
There is a great opportunity in the crisis .
Consider this .
When the dollar hits zero , we can pay off our entire $ 10 trillion national debt and hardly feel it !
Meanwhile , over the past eight years we have seen the fall of reptilian entities like Enronosaurus Wrecks and most recently a character named Madoff made off with billions .
Our entire economic system has been revealed as an extraordinary ponzi scheme where ordinary people are left holding the empty bag .
Unfortunately , this is nothing new .
It 's the same old needy - greedy where our collective fear of not having enough -- " scare city " -- has empowered those privatizing privateers who are plundering our planet with their mining operations ; that 's mine , that 's mine , that 's mine .
This mining has overmined the planet and undermined humanity .
Hence , the emergency we face right now .
So , what do we do ?
I am glad I asked that question .
We must go beyond the fear - based state of emergency to a state of emergent seeing .
That is where we emerge and see the genuine wealth that is all around us , the virtually infinite energy from Father Sun , the prolific nourishment Mother Earth brings us every season , the love we generate from our hearts and the inventiveness of our minds .
With this realization , we have a one way ticket out of scare city and we enter a state of a - bun - dance .
That is where we get up off our assets , move our buns , face the music and dance together .
In using our resources to create good goods and greater goodness , we can weave a web of mass construction that will make us all interdependently wealthy .

The problem with measuring freedom ...

This :
One major problem with libertarians is the tendency to use right - wing slurs -- for instance attributing a statist position to automatically being socialist or communist .
The real lunatics might call their local paper The Daily Marxist but , of course , politics is more complicated than that .
Statist they may be ; socialist they may not be .
And communist or Marxism is entirely something else .
What people assume is that Sweden is socialist .
That is not technically true .
In some ways Sweden does n't regulate economic issues any more than many other countries .
The Swedish welfare state is not socialist , it truly is a third way .
By not understanding the actual manner in which Swedish statism works our side can sound silly .
It can also mean we are fighting the wrong thing and not watching for the actual programs of the Swedish state .
Sweden did not socialize production .
What their system does is socialize consumption .
That is very different and very insidious .
What this means is that they tax the hell out of individuals ( business gets off light in comparison to individual tax rates ) .
This puts the bulk of your income in the hands of the state .
Then the state sets up programs which will allow you to reclaim your own money along the way .
But to do so you have to adjust your consumption patterns in ways that are approved of by the bureaucrats .
Traditional socialism attempted to control business and production .
The Swedish " third way " controls individuals and their consumption giving business more freedom than they give the individual .
Heritage Foundation , being conservatives , tends to be more biased in a US direction and their numbers always make the US appear much better than the other survey does .
Of course the key to remember is that such surveys only measure some aspects of economic freedom .
And the ranking of the the top is only means the top ten -- much like being the smartest man in Congress does n't actually say anything about one 's intelligence .
One can be in the top ten and still be unfree if all the others are in even far worse shape .
Also such surveys neglect social freedom and foreign interventionism .
The US would rapidly plunge down the list if foreign policy were included .
Ditto for social freedom .
In many ways Canada is more socially free than the US -- they do n't tend to pander to religious fanatics the way Republicans in the US love to do .
The UK ranks far too high when we consider issues like state surveillance of individuals -- where they are actually more tyrannical than Zimbabwe ( which simply can't engage in such work as they do n't have the resources ) .
If we included these other issues neither the US nor the UK would be in the top ten .
Canada might still be there .
Singapore would drop on social freedom .
What is still needed is a combination of these surveys , combining economic freedom with the various surveys on press freedom and censorship , the surveillance state , foreign interventionism and miilitarism , recognition of equal rights for their citizens , etc .
Add in all the measures that libertarians find important and I would guess the US would be well down in the " partially free " category and not far off from being " not free " .

Dog Bleeds to Death After " Routine " Microchip Implant Procedure Grieving owner calls for an end to mandatory microchipping in Los Angeles A fluffy bundle of life , love , and enthusiasm named Charlie Brown was laid to rest last week , the victim of a microchip implant gone horribly wrong .
The long - haired , purebred Chihuahua bled to death in the arms of his distraught owners , Lori and Ed Ginsberg of Agua Dulce , California , just hours after undergoing the controversial chipping procedure .
" I was n't in favor of getting Charlie chipped , but it was the law , " said Lori Ginsberg , citing a Los Angeles county ordinance that requires all dog owners to chip their dogs once they reach four months of age .
Dog owners who refuse to comply face a $ 250 fine for the first offense and up to six months in jail for continued non-compliance .
" This technology is supposedly so great until it 's your animal that dies , " she said .
" I can't believe Charlie is gone .
I 'm just beside myself . "
Dr. Reid Loken , the board certified veterinarian who performed the chipping , confirmed on Friday that Charlie died from blood loss associated with the microchip .
He cited " an extreme amount of bleeding " from the " little hole in the skin where the [ microchip implant ] needle went in " as the cause of death .
He said he was both saddened and puzzled by Charlie 's death .
" I just do n't know what happened to him .
We put the chip in the back in the shoulder blades , the standard place where we put them , and there really are n't any major blood vessels in that area , " he said .
" I do n't think it went in too deep ; it was a pretty routine chipping . "
Dr. Loken suspected the needle may have nicked the muscle around the scapula , causing blood to ooze from the muscle .
However , his efforts to stem the bleeding with pressure bandages were unsuccessful .
The bleeding could not be attributed to a congenital clotting problem , he said , since Charlie had undergone a neutering and tooth extraction without incident just weeks before .
Charlie 's owners were devastated by the loss .
" Charlie loved to play and cuddle .
He brought so much joy and life to our home , " said Lori .
" We loved him and took such good care of him .
He meant everything to us . "
The Ginsbergs were quick to absolve Dr. Loken of responsibility for Charlie 's death .
" He 's a great vet and this was not his fault .
The real blame is with the people who forced us to implant our dog against our better judgment , " they said .
The Ginsbergs plan to petition the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to repeal the mandatory chipping law , and have sought the help of prominent consumer privacy advocate Dr. Katherine Albrecht .
Albrecht is a Harvard - trained researcher who has authored a definitive academic paper citing literature that links microchips with cancer in dogs as well as laboratory animals .
She has also authored an exhaustive , 47 - page FAQ on microchip implants .
Albrecht cites other adverse reactions stemming from microchips in the past .
In one case , a struggling kitten died instantly when a microchip was accidentally injected into its brain stem .
In another , a cat was paralyzed when an implant entered its spinal column .
The implants have been widely reported to migrate within animals ' bodies , and can cause abscesses and infection .
In at least two documented cases , dogs have developed cancerous tumors surrounding or adjacent to microchip implants .
" Tragedies like what happened to Charlie Brown are probably more common than we like to think , " said Albrecht .
" But it takes courageous people like the Ginsbergs to come forward and talk about it . "
Albrecht and the Ginsbergs are calling for a repeal of all mandatory animal chipping laws nationwide , and for the creation of a national registry to document adverse reactions from the chipping procedure .
" It 's horrible to live in a country where your choices are being take away and you do n't get to make decisions about your family and your life anymore , " said Lori Ginsberg .
" Politicians should not take away my right to do what I thought was best for my pet . "
For The Media : Lori and Ed Ginsberg have agreed to speak to the media to help raise awareness of the dangers of pet chipping .

Anyone trying to understand why the credit mess keeps getting messier needs only to have sat through Wednesday 's hearing of the House Financial Services Committee .
The eight bank CEOs were mere props .
The stars were the politicians , who managed to demand more loans for consumers while simultaneously giving lenders new cause to wonder if they 'll ever be repaid .
This gathering of the esteemed Committee on Doubt and Uncertainty occurred as markets desperately need less of both .
Chairman Barney Frank 's hearing was intended to ...
Guess what 's happening in China ?
Beijing 's CCTV headquarters , the Rem Koolhaas building , is at a major fire risk .
Fireworks , from the last day of New Years celebrations here , could be the culprits .

The China Central Television headquarters is a 6.45 million square foot complex that involves twin leaning towers connected by two massive sections in midair .
It 's an amazing feat of engineering , but everyone in Beijing is now worried that it might collapse if the building directly next to it , right now said to be the incompleted Mandarin Oriental hotel , is n't put out quickly ( It 's been on fire for a good three hours now ) .
Right now it 's the Lantern Festival , the 15th day of the first month of the new year on the Chinese calendar , and quite inauspiciously , one of the most important landmarks of new Communist China and the message it 's trying to portray – is this close to getting obliterated .
Probably not surprisingly , I can't find any news of this on local Chinese television ( though some channels over here in Shanghai are mysteriously silent ) .
Rather , I 'm relying on blogs and Chinese twitter feeds for updates .
[ Shanghaiist ]
The video shows the building burning from the first moments after the fire broke out .
From the December Journal of Experimental Psychology :
In Experiment 1 , students received an illustrated booklet , PowerPoint presentation , or narrated animation that explained 6 steps in how a cold virus infects the human body .
The material included 6 high - interest details mainly about the role of viruses in sex or death ( high group ) or 6 low - interest details consisting of facts and health tips about viruses ( low group ) .
The low group outperformed the high group across all 3 media on a subsequent test of problem - solving transfer ( d = .80 ) but not retention ( d = .05 ) .
In Experiment 2 , students who studied a PowerPoint lesson explaining the steps in how digestion works performed better on a problem - solving transfer test if the lesson contained 7 low - interest details rather than 7 high - interest details ( d = .86 ) , but the groups did not differ on retention ( d = .26 ) .
In both experiments , as the interestingness of details was increased , student understanding decreased ( as measured by transfer ) .
Results are consistent with a cognitive theory of multimedia learning , in which highly interesting details sap processing capacity away from deeper cognitive processing of the core material during learning .
For this reason I tend to disagree with most people about who are the best speakers and writers .
Most people prefer those with lots of interesting tidbits ; I prefer those that stay focused on and deliver a key interesting point .

Summary Of The Bush Crime Family * History
For any civilized endeavor to maintain its civility , there must be enforceable laws and / or rules ; without which , there is anarchy .
So , as we find ourselves struggling to regain our lost freedoms , perhaps we should take a strategic review of how we arrived at this alarming state , honestly apprise our current status , and as we depart from yet another major election , cast about for viable options for now as well as the foreseeable future .
Any objective observer with the barest awareness of contemporary history should be able to readily trace the rise of this powerful movement that has taken control of the reins of power in the United States .
The most blatant initial historical record is when Grandpa Prescott Bush and some of his cronies tried to entice General Smedley Butler to muster enough World War I veterans to take over the Presidency of The United States in 1933 .
Then again , in 1942 ( a year after the U.S. joined World War II ) , Prescott Bush and this same cabal -- in their drive toward fascism -- were finally forced by the " Trading With the Enemy Act " to terminate their extensive business dealings with Hitler .
After WWII , this American branch of the Nazis did n't lose the war , they just transformed the battleground .
They expanded their " connections " with Hitler 's intelligence networks from The War into the formation of our own CIA .
It is also this same group that President Eisenhower opaquely identified as the " Military Industrial Complex , " in his dark farewell speech to us .
Later , it was Poppy George H.W. Bush who sat on a boat ( named Barbara ) off - shore and directed the Cuban Bay Of Pigs fiasco .
As a direct consequence of that largely unsolicited action , John Kennedy banished him and his CIA brothers from his administration , albeit only temporarily , as George H.W. Bush , then an active CIA agent , was later photographed in Dealey Plaza that sunny November day in 1963 .
From FDR to today , the Bush Crime Family and their fixated core of corporate fascists have , using unbridled corporate power , been tightening their grip on the throats of the American political , legal , economic and media systems -- as the following excerpt from the Democratic Underground so well outlines :
" A Pocket History of the Bush Organized Crime Family Crime Line
Hitler 's " Angel " -- Prescott Bush and his Wall Street cronies helped finance and arm the Third Reich . *
Some continued trading with the enemy even after Germany declared war on America .
Bay of Pigs -- Bush the Oilman and his Cuban and Mafia friends raise hell in Miami , New Orleans and Houston .
Nice fellahs .
LBJ called their organization " A regular Murder Inc in the Caribbean . "
22 November 1963 , Dallas* -- George DeMohrenschildt the " White Russian geologist " is friends with both Lee Harvey Oswald and George Herbert Walker Bush .
Small world , as the coincidences get bigger .
Almost 40 years later , FBI memos surface that detail how George Herbert Walker Bush fingered a young conservative the day of the assassination and " Mr. George Bush of the Central Intelligence Agency " cleared the anti-Castro Cubans in Miami days later .
Vietnam -- OK for poor kids to fight an illegal war started over the phony Gulf of Tonkin Incident , just as long as " W , " the drunken coke - whore dim son , " destined " to become preznit some day , or the rest of his rich frat brothers do n't have to go .
Meanwhile Poppy 's rich friends became very , very , very rich .
Watergate --
Nixon was willing to throw anyone and everyone to the wolves -- except George Herbert Walker Bush and " The Texans " because " They 'll do anything for our side . "
Gee . Would " murder " qualify as " anything . "
Think so , especially seeing how Nixon got the ziggy and Bush ended up in the clear .
October Surprise --
Carter probably would 've beaten Reagan , but Bush and his buddies in INTEL and the military - industrial complex cut a deal with the Ayatollah to hold the hostages clear through the election .
On inauguration day , they got to leave Tehran .
A couple of weeks later , Israel starts sending US - supplied weapons .
It proves so " profitable , " that Ollie North cuts out the Israelis and decides to sell them US - direct .
Reagan survives assassination attempt -- Just a couple of months after Reagan is sworn in , Reagan is ALMOST taken out and Bush stood ready to take charge .
His son Neil was ready to have dinner that night with John Hinckley 's brother , Scott .
Odd how these " One Degree of Separation " coincidences always happen to Poppy .
INSLAW / Promis --
The turd Ed Meese and cronies stole software that enabled the Justice Department to track criminal prosecutions , had their INTEL buddies add a trap door , and then sold it around the world , making it possible to track what every BFEE - connected dictator or friend from Saddam to d'Aubission is up to -- in Freedomª 's name .
Iraq - gate / Banca Nazionale del Lavoro arms --
Just how do you think Iraq managed to run its war against Iran for all those years ?
Saddam had to be getting juice from somebody , so they found a low - level banker in Miami to take the fall .
US taxpayers floated Saddam $ 5 billion in loans .
Meanwhile the Iran - Iraq war is prolonged by years and several hundreds of thousands of lives are lost .
BCCI International Money Laundering for Terrorists & Intelligence Community --
The terrorists ' favorite bank , used by among others Abu Nidhal , Osama bin Laden , Ollie North , CIA , SIS and KGB .
The Reagan and Bush administrations and friends on both sides of the aisle in Congress did all they could to keep it open .
John Kerry got it shut down .
Savings & Loan Scandal --
Legalized robbery in the form of " loans " made to the politically connected , Mafia and INTEL - huggers .
Odd how even Neil Bush , who made millions while Silverado , the S&L he helped direct , lost billions in bad loans to Bush cronies , never spent a day in jail .
Kid from Detroit steals a pair of shoes from the mall and it 's OK to shoot him dead .
Meanwhile , after the bailout " fixes " everything , Poppy 's very , very , very rich friends become ultra-rich .
Iran-Contra -- Neo-con Michael Ledeen , Munacher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi bend over backward to sell arms the Ayatollah and use the profits to arm the terrorist Contras .
Most of the players should be in prison , but , thanks to Poppy 's pardon , remain free to roam the streets , let alone corridors of power , and continue the terror .
Arbusto , HARKEN , Spectrum - 7 , Aloha --
Every company the crazy monkey 's ever touched , he 's run into the ground .
Yet Poppy 's family and friends , including James R Bath , the bin Mahfouz and bin Ladens , always help him out .
No wonder the dim bulb went off thinking of ENRON , Kenny Boy and all the possibilities .
Gulf War I -- Poppy Bush gives April Glaspie the signal to greenlight Saddam's " border dispute " and push into Kuwait .
No wonder Saddam felt betrayed when Cheney ordered the extermination of tens of thousands of fleeing Iraqi conscripts heading north on the " Highway of Death . "
Meanwhile , Poppy 's ultra-rich friends become ultra - ultra - ultra rich .
Selection 2000 Shreds US Constitution --
After fixing things up so that 70,000 likely Democratic votes and voters are turned away or disenfranchised , the 2000 Florida Presidential " election " results in a " tie . "
Associate Justice Antonin Scalia gets the idea that maybe the GOP - packed Supreme Court should grant petitioner George W Bush 's request for taking the Oval Office , anyway .
Someone on DU wrote : " You do n't steal elections to do good things . "
Prophetic words , those .
ENRON Energy Policy -- Sneering Dick Cheney meets with Kenny Boy Lay to discuss ways of helping ENRON rip - off California and the rest of America .
There were others there , like Chevron and EXXON , because they need oil , too .
Besides , the ultra- , ultra- , ultra - rich can never have enough .
9 -11 -- After ignoring the warnings of outgoing President Bill Clinton , former National Security Advisor Sandy Berger , anti-Terror Chief Richard Clarke , and Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet , George W Bush ignores a report titled " Bin Laden Determined to Strike in the U.S. "
A month later , 3,000 innocent people are murdered .
Two ways of looking at this one : 1 . ) Criminal Negligence , at best ; 2 . ) Treason , most likely .
Gulf War II -- George W Bush , Sneer , and most of " the bureaucracy " make a case for going to war in Iraq , stating there are clear - cut connections between 9 - 11 * and Saddam Hussein , who planned to use his arsenal of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons on America .
( So far , the only bioweapon used on America was Anthrax that came from a US Army lab grown from a batch of the University of Iowa Strain . )
Anwyay , it 's not really odd to see how attacking Iraq was the Administration 's number 1 priority , according to former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and anti-Terror Chief Richard Clarke , from January 2001 .
The reason ?
There 's money to be made there and power to be gained at home . " ( end of excerpt )

So much for a historical perspective ; where do we currently stand ?
Well , our political , legal , governmental , military and medical systems as well as our unions have all been thoroughly compromised .
Financially , since we are deeply in debt ( mostly to China ) " they " are selling off our corporate and country assets and now simply " appropriating " cash to pay off their bad gambling debt to the tune of over $ 850 billion in a " Bailout , " our Federal Reserve Banking and tax systems are beyond any controls , the demoralized and frightened middle class is being rapidly dissolved , our worldwide reputation is sullied more than at any time in our history and the value of the dollar continues to fall .
Our infrastructure and environment are deteriorating while corporate and political corruption are rampant , bigotry and racism -- while receding -- still covertly abound , our traditional news sources have become cheering profit centers for the administration and our voting processes are , at best , unreliable .
Not the healthy picture of progress and hope that used to be the norm , prior to the sixties -- before someone started killing off the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr.
--
This may sound like a broken record , but the recent election is truly going to be critical to the survival of our democratic way of life -- and thus the world .
Perhaps we should begin to think of the individuals that supported the Bush administration as bloated , self - absorbed and out - of - control addicts , in need of intervention .
Now , in an intervention , the first thing that has to happen is that the addict must be subjected to the facts of reality until their wall of denial is first exposed and then accepted .
The initial indication that that has occurred is when the addict admits that there is a problem and then becomes actively motivated to do something about it .
It appears that the 2008 election demonstrated that a growing majority of Americans think things are broken and want a change .
Now , is the time to educate and motivate our fellow citizens to seek out and regain their lost sense of morality .
The next step -- and this is at the heart of the matter -- is what can / should be done to correct our dire situation .
It is going to take some very strong , passionate , wise , emotional and motivating leadership .
Emphasis here should be on " motivating , " because our next leader (s ) must circumvent the biased media outlets while resisting the temptation to allow older , more corrupt influences , to regain control .
Elaborating on a phrase from the beginning of this statement , " ... there must be enforceable laws and / or rules ... "
ESPECIALLY in our electoral and financial systems .
Even though Rove and his ilk may seem to have left Washington , we must n't let our guard down .
They are still practicing their nefarious deeds , somewhere .
Keep in mind that the thing about laws and rules is that they are usually created , modified and put into effect AFTER the fact .
Also , be aware that it is VERY difficult to resist control when you do n't have the money to buy food , shelter , or clothing -- much less the weapons of resistance .
If Obama is able to follow through with just a bare majority of his campaign promises , perhaps we can still miss taking a bullet , this time .
However , let this be a major lesson -- fascism and democracy do n't mix ... so we had better RAPIDLY fix our democracy / Congress while we , hopefully , still can !
Finally , should we work our way out of this madness , one of our first imperatives , as we repair the damage done , should be to prosecute ALL of the criminal acts that this ruthless group of international thugs has committed .
This statement is not made with a sense of vengeance , but with an eye toward setting such a strong example with these individuals that they , and their minions , will forever give up on any future attempts to corrupt this , our enlightened struggle for universal , renewable , human freedom .

Biometric systems have been touted as the next big thing in computer security for the past several years , despite the fact that some of them — fingerprint scanners , for example — have proven to be incredibly easy to bypass , requiring little more , in some cases , than some scotch tape and a bit of patience .
Facial - recognition scanners have been a hot commodity on laptops of late , but researchers scheduled to present at the ongoing Black Hat DC conference this week have demonstrated that current implementations have flaws of their own .
The researchers were able to bypass Lenovo 's Veriface III , Asus ' SmartLogon V1.0.0005 , and Toshiba 's Face Recognition 2.0.2.32 , even with each program set for maximum security .
Information on exactly which programs were bypassed by which methods is presumably contained within the team 's full documentation , which is not available as of publication time .
According to Dark Reading , a variety of attack vectors ultimately proved successful , including photo substitution ( using a photo of the actual owner ) as well as brute - force attacks in which multiple images of different people were presented to the scanner .
The latter technique apparently requires at least a moderate period of time to execute ; the attacker has no way of knowing in advance which photo(s ) will prove capable of bypassing the security sensor .
Based on their findings , the security team recommends that the applications be overhauled .
One of the team members presenting at Black Hat , Nguyen Minh Duc , had harsher words for the various affected OEMs .
" There is no way to fix this vulnerability , " Dark Reading reports Duc saying .
" Asus , Lenovo , and Toshiba have to remove this function from all the models of their laptops ... [ they ] must give an advisory to users all over the world : stop using this [ biometric ] function . "
Duc 's criticism seems unduly alarmist , though the fact that images that have been digitized and printed can be used to fool the sensor is a further weakness in these systems .
Biometric scanners in their current form are far from perfect , but then again , most users choose passwords that can be brute - forced within minutes .
Just as any given computer user could theoretically choose a 24 - digit sequence of randomized characters for a password , a laptop OEM could probably pair an ultra- high resolution camera with an exacting set of guidelines to create a detection system that could pick up on whether or not you had clipped your nose hairs this morning .
The problem with 24 - digit completely random character strings as passwords is that they 're hard to remember , and the problem with ultra - high resolution scan that 's then compared against a pre-saved RAW image is that the camera would be unforgiving and it might take ten minutes to login .
In order to make a comparison and login quickly , a scanner must therefore be calibrated to accept a significant degree of " error " when performing an analysis against its baseline image .
As image comparison technology improves and the quality of built - in cameras increases , facial scanners will probably become harder to fool .
Alternatively , it may be possible to " train " them to hone in on particular facial features : the shape of a person 's smile , the amount of space between their eyes ( or the shape of the eyes themselves ) , and any other distinctive / striking mark or shape might be integrated into a computer 's identification protocol when determining if you are really you .
Even in these cases , however , it would still be theoretically possible to fool the scanner .
It may be true that biometric scanners are being mismarketed , but the relevant standard should be whether these newfangled options provide a level of protection that 's at least as good as a standard login / password .
If we 're honest with ourselves and admit that normal computer users pick passwords that provide them with a level of security equivalent to that which the Maginot Line provided France , it 's clear that the bar is one notch above sitting on the floor .
Biometric sensors need to be improved and they probably need to be combined with other methods of authentication ( biometric or otherwise ) in order to be completely effective , but I 'm not convinced Asus , Lenovo , and Toshiba should all collectively dump their services .
Kudos to Asus , by the way , for providing far more information on its SmartLogon service than I was able to quickly locate at Lenovo or Toshiba 's sites , but the company hears a knock for claiming : " In case you are wondering , ASUS notebooks with ASUS SmartLogon with face recognition technology can distinguish people from pictures . "
Of the three , only Lenovo 's copy implies that users may still want to use other secure verification methods ; VeriFace " lets you use the unique features of your face to add a new level of security to your system . "
Asus and Toshiba both explicitly position their biometric authentication systems as a replacement for other security options .
Alternatively , we could ditch all this amateur stuff and go straight for retina scans and blood samples .
At least if we went this route we 'd quickly identify any Changelings or broken ladders in our midst .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
So many Atlanta firefighters called in sick Sunday that five understaffed fire stations closed for the day , according to the city 's fire chief .
Chief Kelvin Cochran told CNN affiliate WGCL that 27 firefighters called in sick , more than double the usual number .
Atlanta fire union President Jim Daws said a hiring freeze and city - imposed work furloughs as the city tries to cut costs have left firefighters " beaten down and run-down . "
But Davis said he did not think the situation Sunday was an organized effort .
Watch local resident express concern »
The Fire Department has been on a four - day work week since December , according to the department 's Web site .
The site lists 40 stations in the department .
The fire chief said he did not think firefighters were trying to make a political statement , and he pointed to a possible Super Bowl effect on employees calling in sick .
" Historically , payday weekends and Super Bowl Sunday also contribute to absenteeism , " Cochran told WGCL .
Some residents in areas where fire stations were closed Sunday said they were nervous .
" It 's nothing less than governmental malpractice on the part of Atlanta 's elected officials , " said 26 - year - old resident Dan Dean .
A dispatcher with the department said calls had been routine Sunday .

Arctic Sea Ice Increases at Record Rate
Guest Post by Jeff Id on February 3 , 2009
Something I ’ve been interested in for the last several months is sea ice data .
What makes it interesting is that as I understand it , models demonstrate the poles should be most sensitive to global warming leading the planet temp , especially in the Arctic .
Recently I have been able to process the monthly and daily gridded arctic data as provided by NSIDC .
The daily values allow a better analysis of trend than can be provided by the monthly data .
If you ’re like me you recall the claims of fastest melt rate ever were made about 2007 , I fully believed them , because the graphs showed a much more negative value than in the previous 30 years as shown in Figure 1 below .
This effort was originally intended to investigate how bad the melt rate was in comparison to the natural variation , I did n’t get that far yet .
Accessing and processing the gridded data was critical to the analysis , so I spent the time reading the literature and writing code .
Having full access to the NSIDC data allows some interesting analysis , they do an excellent job on their site .
There are two primary algorithms used for processing ice data NasaTeam and Bootstrap .
The descriptions of the data state the difference between the two is very small and the sets are interchangeable except that bootstrap is recommended for trend analysis in research publications .
Bootstrap is only provided in monthly data format while NasaTeam is provided in both monthly and daily provided you ’re willing to download over 1G of data , write code to process it , refit the land and missing data mask and sum the results .
I am .
Also , NasaTeam provides a near real time version of the polar ice data which has a different land mask and has n’t been processed for missing data .
This data is n’t as clean but I wanted to use it .
I applied the same land mask as the rest of the series to insure that there was a consistent baseline for trend analysis .
The missing data from Jan 2008 onward created noise in the series which I simply filtered out using a 7 day sliding window filter .
The mask looks like this Figure 2
The brown is land , black edges on land are coastline and light blue is the satellite data not measured .
This mask is applied consistently through the entire data series .
There was some question about masking on one of my other posts at WUWT where visually the land area seemed to change size , in the case of the NSIDC data they apply masks consistently except for the satellite hole and the near real time data .
The NasaTeam version of the arctic ice data looks like the plot below for 2009 ( note the small size of the satellite data hole ) .
This graph was created in R using the actual Nasa Team masks and data .
I used the worst case land and polar masks to adjust the entire dataset to eliminate problems with consistency .
Figure 3
Of course it ’s an interesting picture , but what I wanted to know when I started this post was how bad was the worst melt rate in history and what is the actual melt area .
In the plot below the arctic is losing sea ice at a rate of only 56 K km ^2 / year .
Of course sea ice area went up in the Antarctic during the same time frame though .
Note the strong recovery in 08 of Figures 1 and 4 , which actually exceeds values of most of the record , matching data back to 1980 .
Much of this is first year ice so the melt in 08 was expected to be a new record .
If you recall , in 2007 and 08 we were treated to headlines like this , which most of us accepted with a shrug .
I processed and analyzed the NasaTeam land area and missing data masks spending hours understanding different variances they list on their own website .
After nearly everything I could find ( except satellite transitions errors ) was corrected ( a different post ) and corrections for variance in the measured pixel size , the final result in 30 day trends of arctic sea ice looks like the graph below ( Figure 5 ) .
This graph is a derivative of the ice area plot .
The maximum peaks and valleys represent the maximum rates of change in 30 day periods through the ice record .
Looking at this plot of the 30 day slopes of actual NASA gridded data , the maximum ice melt rate occurs in 1999 and in 2004 not in 2007 .
Surprisingly the maximum ice growth rates occur in 2007 and 2008 , I do n’t remember those headlines for some reason .
Do n’t forget when looking at the 2008 – 09 peak , the data is preliminary and has n’t been through the same processing as the other data .
From looking at the unprocessed data I doubt it will change much .
Certainly the 30 year arctic trend in ice area is downward , even the most committed global warming scientist has to admit this happens regularly in climate along with regular 30 year uptrends .
The questions are , did we cause it or not , and was CO2 the instigating factor .
The rapid recovery of ice levels has to have some meaning regarding the severity of the problem .
This goes directly in the face of accelerated global warming and the doom and gloom scenarios promoted by our politicians and polyscienticians .
Why are my conclusions different from the news reported records ?
I think it ’s likely due to the fact that the scientists used the monthly data which is processed using a weighted filter of the daily data that incorporates a longer time frame than a single month .
This means their use of the monthly data to establish a monthly trend was in error and the real record down trends were actually set in 1999 , 2003 and 1984 .
While the record uptrends were in 2007 , 2008 and 1996 .

You keep using this word ; I do n’t think it means what you think it means .
— The Princess Bride
So everyone knows that UTF - 8 encodes Unicode code points into eight bits , and UTF - 16 encodes Unicode code points into 16 bits ( or , two bytes ) , right ?
I mean … ” UTF - 8 ″ has the answer right there in the name , does n’t it ?
Nope .
unicode.org
The chart above reveals a misconception about Unicode : the “ 8 ” in “ UTF - 8 ” does n’t actually indicate how many bits a code point gets encoded into .
The final size of the encoded data is based on two things : a ) the code unit size , and b ) the number of code units used .
So the 8 in UTF - 8 stands for the code unit size , not the number of bits that will be used to encode a code point .
unicode.org
As the chart indicates , UTF - 8 can actually store a code point using between one and four bytes .
I find it helpful to think of the code unit size as the “ granularity level ” , or the “ building block size ” you have available to you .
So with UTF - 16 you can still only have four bytes maximum , but your code unit size is 16 bits , so your minimum number of bytes is two .

The Ultimate Alternative Energy
Contrary to the common misconception , we have no energy shortage .
In fact , we have more energy available than we could ever use .
If not for the anti-nuclear movement , the funders of terrorism would not be awash with petrodollars and our economy would be significantly stronger .
Unfortunately , rock musicians and actors had more influence on energy policies than scientists like Petr Beckmann , whom I was lucky to have as a friend .
Dr. Beckmann was a Czech refugee from Nazism who spent much of his career in America promoting nuclear power .
Until he died , Beckmann was treated as some sort of demon by the environmental movement .
No longer .
Today , even green leaders are admitting the folly of rejecting this cheap , clean and safe ( when compared rationally with other energy sources ) technology .
If there were justice , Beckmann would have statues erected in his honor .
The green turnaround on nuclear power is particularly relevant now .
President - elect Obama has picked several global warming activists to serve as top officials .
The most important is Harvard physicist John Holdren .
As presidential science adviser , he could have a significant impact on energy policy .
His career , in fact , has focused on climate change , next - generation nuclear energy and nuclear disarmament .
From the perspective of an investor , what does this mean ?
Among other things , it could rapidly accelerate the transition from the current generation of nuclear power plants to the next .
I would , incidentally , never invest in a technology simply because it has political support .
Ethanol , for example , had lots of it .
It was never a good idea , though , and is finally being recognized as such .
Nuclear power as we know it today is obsolete .
Current light water reactors use uranium - 235 .
This fuel is not only expensive , but its byproducts create problems .
They are difficult politically to handle and can be used to create nuclear weapons .
Those byproducts are , ironically , the reason we initially adopted uranium - 235 .
America needed the materials for nuclear weapons .
Power plants using uranium - 235 provided them .
Regulators , naturally , favored the technology despite the fact that there were superior fuels – especially thorium .
Thorium is not only far more abundant than uranium - 235 , but thorium reactors do not produce waste materials useful in nuclear weapons .
In fact , the wastes are far less hazardous and much cheaper to deal with .
Thorium reactors are safer in general to operate , producing little radioactive threat outside their shielding .
They cannot , in fact , experience a catastrophic meltdown .
This is a much bigger deal than it appears on the surface .
Fuel costs , though much lower for thorium , do n’t play much of a role in total nuclear power costs .
In his book The Nuclear Energy Option , Bernard Cohen estimates that safety measures to counter meltdowns account for about 75 % of current plant costs .
As thorium plants can’t melt down , energy costs would be significantly lower .
Additionally , thorium reactors can be almost any size .
Prototypes have been made small enough for military aircraft .
This makes them economically viable in developing countries without the additional cost of large - scale electrical infrastructure .
Thorium reactors would also be easier to sell internationally because they cannot be used to manufacture nuclear weapons .
The shift to thorium would facilitate economic , environmental and nonproliferation causes .
So why are we still building plants that burn uranium - 235 ?
This is one of the hazards of government involvement in the sciences .
Once grants and regulatory attitudes that favor a technology are in place , they are huge barriers to competitors .
A free market would favor thorium over uranium anyway .
Coincidentally , Obama ’s administration could significantly reduce barriers to thorium energy production .
I ’m looking hard now at several ways to take advantage of this development .
There is one potential wrench in these works , though .
It ’s nuclear fusion , and it could change everything .
The fuel for fusion is essentially free , so the cost of power generation is a matter of capital costs and maintenance .
I ’ve been a skeptic about the economics of fusion , but that has begun to change .
It appears that early research grants may have derailed and forced out more promising and cheaper fusion technologies than those favored by various governments ’ research efforts .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- A Manhattan jury awarded $ 2.33 million to a man who lost his leg after drunkenly stumbling onto the path of an oncoming subway train .
Dustin Dibble fell on New York subway tracks , was hit by a train and had his leg severed in 2006 .
Dustin Dibble , 25 , landed in the subway tracks after a late night watching a hockey game at a bar with friends April 23 , 2006 .
A downtown N train ran over him , severing his right leg .
According to Dibble 's lawyer , Andrew Smiley , NYC Transit rather than Dibble bore primary responsibility for the accident because the subway driver had time to stop the train but did not .
Smiley added that Dibble 's drunkenness did not excuse the driver , who said in a court deposition that he mistook Dibble for an inert object .
" They do n't get a free pass as to why the person was on the tracks .
They are trained to be able to look out for people on the tracks ... and people are known to be intoxicated by night , " the lawyer said .
Dibble 's blood - alcohol level at the time of the accident was .18 , according to his lawyer , more than twice the legal limit had he been behind the wheel of a car .
The jury ruled Tuesday that Dibble was 35 percent responsible for the accident , so his monetary compensation was also reduced by 35 percent -- from $ 3,594,943 to $ 2,336,713 .
The deficit - plagued MTA plans to appeal the decision , according to spokesman James Anyansi .

As the founder of Lares , a Colorado - based security consultancy , social - engineering expert Chris Nickerson is often asked by clients to conduct penetration testing of their on - sight security .
Nickerson leads a team which conducts security risk assessments in a method he refers to as Red Team Testing .
Watch Nickerson and his team pull off a diamond heist in this video .
Nickerson and crew recently took on such an exercise for a client he describes as " a retail company with a large call center . "
With some prep work , Nickerson says the team was able gain access to the company 's network and database quite easily .
Read on to find out how they did it , and what lessons you can take away for shoring up your organization 's defenses .
( To learn more about social engineering techniques , also see Social Engineering : Eight Common Tactics . )
Chris Nickerson :
On - site security vulnerability testing requires the most memory and intelligence gathering because you need to start off by gaining information on your target .
When I 'm doing my information gathering , I like to find holiday or time - relative events .
In this particular exercise , there was a large horserace going on in the area .
In the town where the company was located , it was the big thing to go to this horse race .
Everyone in the city and around it geared up and left the office to go to it .
That was a perfect time for me to come in and say I have an appointment .
I said I had to meet with someone we 'll call Nancy .
I knew Nancy was n't going to be in the office because on her MySpace profile it said she was getting ready to go to the race .
Then her Twitter profile said she was getting dressed to go to the event .
So I knew she was n't in the office .
Before I went to the office , I went to a thrift shop and got a Cisco shirt for $ 4 .
Then I went in and said " Hi . I 'm the new rep from Cisco .
I 'm here to see Nancy . "
The front desk attendant in this situation said " She 's not at her desk . "
I said " Yeah .
I know .
I 've been texting back and forth with her .
She told me she is in a meeting and the meeting is going over . "
This was right around lunch time and I said " Since I 'm waiting , is there anywhere around here where I can go get some food ? "
I knew full well that after surveying the area the closest thing was about five miles away because they were sort of out in the sticks .
The receptionist said " Four or fives miles down the road there is a McDonalds .
But we have a nice cafeteria here .
If you want , you can just eat in there . "
Being allowed to go to the cafeteria gave me full access to the facility because the only thing that was guarded was the door .
The cafeteria lead right into the rest of the building .
So I went into the cafeteria and ate .
While I was there , I did USB key drops .
I put files on them with names like ' Payroll ' or ' Strategy 2009 . '
The USBs had rootkits on them .
Many contained an autorun rootkit .
Others had Hacksaw , which is a little piece of tech that you can use with a U3 drive .
You plug it into a machine and , if the machine has auto run on the CD - Rom running it , it will just start dumping all the passwords , usernames , all that .
It will also put a hook into the machine to start emailing that information out to an email account that you give it to contact .
So , even after I left , I could still be filtering information .
It only takes about 30 seconds to enable itself .
When I do this kind of exercise , I put USBs in areas that people are in where they might forget something :
The bathroom , for instance , on the sink .
Another good area is near the coffee machine .
Areas where people naturally put things down where they might not remember to pick it back up .
I 've never done USB key drops without success .
Meanwhile , I had another one of my guys go in through the smoking door in the back .
He hung out , waited , had some cigarettes with people who came out to smoke on break , and when they were done , the door opened and he just cruised in .
Yet another exercise to prove it really does n't take much to get inside .
Eventually , once he was in , I had him come and get me in the cafeteria .
That was so it appeared on the security tapes as though someone was coming to get me out of the cafeteria to escort me to whatever meeting I was going to attend .
We went through and found inside of this giant 100,000 - square - foot cube farm a few seats that were wide open and just sat down .
There was no one around us .
So , we started pulling keys .
We used things like Ophcrack to start cracking Windows passwords and dump them into Linux .
We started putting our machines on the networks so we could start doing pen testing and hacking active servers in the environment .
We put up things like WRT 54G routers : the little blue Linksys wireless units .
We took those , stuck them under a cube , put Unix on them and opened WRT .
That made it so I had a wireless access point I could hit not only from the parking lot , but it also beacons and calls home so I had a Unix box that sits inside their network .
A short time later , a full team of people came in .
A lot of the work that was done at this facility was shift work , and it was shift change time .
Because we did our homework right , we were at the two of three cubes that were vacant so there were no conflicts or questions .
Everyone sat down around us .
I announced myself as the Cisco engineer who was working on the phone system .
Many of them responded with jokes and said things like " Honey , please do n't fix it .
I do n't want to take any calls today . "
One thing I have learned is that cookies are the keys to everyone 's heart .
When I 'm doing the type of exercise where I 'm posing as a tech , or a VAR , I like to bring cookies .
I did for this exercise and I started passing out cookies to everyone in the area .
We were all laughing , having a great time .
Meanwhile , we were in the middle of hacking their entire network .
In the end , what we exposed for the client was the vulnerability of their physical access and we showed them some of the blended techniques we used to get in .
We were able to demonstrate how , with social engineering , we were able to hack the SQL Server and dump the whole data base of everybody 's account information .
This kind of breach could have cost them multiple billions of dollars .
And we had access to all of it because of these vulnerabilities .
We wore button cams and hat cams so they could watch how it was done .
Companies need to run a general social engineering awareness campaign .
You need to tell employees what to look for and how to look for it .
Companies need to teach employees that it's not that the company does n't trust the people within the organization , it 's that there are people out there trying to do this every day .
It is just a good awareness technique to do it .
If someone is coming to work on your environment , you should probably know who they are .
If you think of your company like your home , you do things differently .
You are not going to just let someone walk into your house .
That is the kind of philosophy companies need to inject into corporate culture .
Picked to direct the Wall Street bailout : Who is Neel Kashkari ?
By Alex Lantier
8 October 2008
On October 6 US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson named Neel Kashkari to head the Treasury 's new Office of Financial Stability ( OFS ) .
The OFS is charged with paying out $ 700 billion to Wall Street banks and other financial firms in exchange for their failed mortgage - backed assets , under the terms of the bailout signed into law by President Bush on October 3 .
Kashkari's identity is thus a matter of considerable public interest .
Only 35 years old , Kashkari joined the Treasury in 2006 " as a Senior Advisor to US Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson , " according to his official Treasury Department biography .
At the time , Paulson was giving up his job as CEO of Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs to join the Treasury .
The biography continues , " Prior to joining the Treasury Department , Mr. Kashkari was a Vice - President of Goldman Sachs & Co. in San Francisco , where he led Goldman 's IT Security Investment Banking practice , advising public and private companies on mergers and acquisitions and financial transactions . "
Despite his high rank , Kashkari has only a few years of experience in finance .
After initially studying aerospace engineering at the University of Illinois , he worked at defense firm TRW on contract projects from the US space agency NASA , before switching careers and attending the Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia .
He joined Goldman Sachs after graduating from Wharton in 2002 .
Once at the Treasury , Kashkari helped prepare the recently passed bailout .
The Wall Street Journal wrote , " Mr. Kashkari was part of the Treasury team that negotiated the asset - repurchase program with Congress [...]
He was also one of the originators of the plan .
Last year , he and Phillip Swagel , assistant secretary for economic policy , crafted a proposal called ‘ break the glass ' -- referring to the emergency nature of using such a tool -- which envisioned Treasury buying bad loans and other assets . "
Kashkari's history highlights the extraordinary influence of Goldman Sachs , a firm that stands massively to benefit from the bailout its former executives have organized at the Treasury .
Not only does Goldman now have the option of unloading its failed mortgage - backed assets on the Treasury , but it stands to make large sums from carrying out the actual transactions of the bailout program itself .
On October 7 , the New York Times wrote that Kashkari 's office was moving to " outsource almost the entire [ bailout ] project . "
It continued : " The Treasury said it intended to hire one company as a ‘ financial agent ' to set up the basic system , which would include running the auctions , keeping track of the various portfolios , and overseeing all the operational issues . "
The OFS will also ask " experienced investment managers " to value and sell the failed assets -- and these managers will come from firms that are " either sellers or buyers of mortgage - backed securities . "
The deadline for the Treasury to accept firms ' bids for the " financial agent " position is today , and the Treasury will announce its choice on October 10 .
Goldman Sachs ' competitors have leaked objections in the press to the role of an ex-Goldman Sachs executive as the arbiter of this scramble for lucrative government contracts .
In its article on Kashkari , the Financial Times wrote , " The prominence of Goldman alumni within the administration has raised eyebrows at competing Wall Street banks , which have become concerned about what some privately see as Goldman 's disproportionate influence over policy . "
While echoing some of these complaints , the media has suggested the government was taking corrective measures .
Thus the Wall Street Journal commented , " Treasury is trying to determine how to handle conflicts of interest as a result of the program , especially with regard to the asset managers it hires .
Anyone with direct experience of these mortgage assets will likely work for a firm with a financial stake in the same assets . [...]
While it is unlikely that all conflicts will be eliminated , Treasury wants to find a way to manage conflicts using strict guidelines , according to people familiar with the matter . "
It is , of course , impossible to eliminate or control conflict of interest in the OFS program , because the entire bailout project -- whereby the financial industry dictates the terms under which it receives $ 700 billion from the US Treasury -- is in and of itself a gigantic conflict of interest .
In pushing the bailout , its supporters -- particularly Democratic congressional leaders and presidential candidate Barack Obama - claimed there would be " transparency " and " oversight " safeguards .
The nomination of Kashkari , however , exposes the fact that the financial elite will direct the entire process on behalf of its own interests .
<-- Part 1 : Imminent Danger of U.K Bankruptcy
Bankrupt Britain
Part 2 : U.K Government Destroying Britain to Help Banks ?
by Chris Tew , February 4 , 2009
Numerous economists , businessmen and investors warn of impending U.K bankruptcy .
Yet practically 100 % of the U.K government supports some form of bank bailouts , drastically increasing the risk of the U.K going bust .
U.K Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , has introduced approximately £ 900,000,000,000 in various bank bailout schemes with the worrying prospect of even more bailouts on the horizon .
This is despite growing warnings of the U.K government being unable to finance this highly expensive scheme .
This is the biggest gamble of tax payers money ever made by the British government , if it fails individual tax payers stand to each lose thousands .
A recent news broadcast discusses the latest bailout plans :
Bank Bailouts Almost 100 % Supported by Government Despite Bankruptcy Criticism
Despite criticism from other parties most of the government has supported bank bailouts in some form or other .
When bank bailouts were initially introduced David Cameron , the leader of the opposition , backed the idea .
Also the Liberal Democrats also back the idea of bailouts under the guise of ' Removing bad assets from banks ' balance sheets ' .
This means practically 100 % of the U.K government have supported bank bailouts in some form or other .
Niall Fergusen is one of a number of economists and financial commenter 's that predict the British government is pushing the U.K into bankruptcy and / or refute funding bank bailouts .
This includes :
Many believe that the level of debt the U.K banks have brought on themselves cannot be taken on by the U.K government .
In other words they believe that despite the bailouts , the banks will go bust anyway , as will the British government in trying to prop them up .
Now even David Cameron warns of U.K bankruptcy while Gordon Brown argues the idea is " ridiculous " .
If it is true that the U.K government bank bailouts are not going to be enough to save the banks , then I can only conclude our politicians are either inept or have some other agenda .
What Is Gordon Brown 's Master Plan ?
It is easy to call a politician stupid but that 's somewhat illogical , especially given Gordon Browns especially strong academic record .
It is likely that Gordon Brown is fully aware of the viewpoint of U.K bankruptcy before the recession , after - all the opposition has pointed it out to him .
If Gordon Brown is aware that the bank bailouts could cause Britain to go bankrupt , and assuming the many doom - mongerers are right , then what is Gordon Brown 's master plan ?
I see 3 possible agendas that Gordon Brown might have :
1. Brown Wants Britain to Join the Euro ?
It has already been said that if Britain goes bust then joining the Euro would be a route out of the mess , especially if sterling collapses .
Gordon Brown has previously spoke about a new ' Global Europe ' and a ' New World Order ' .
Is this talk of a ' Global Europe ' a hint the Gordon Brown wants to see the U.K join the Euro ?
Meanwhile ...
However , Gordon Brown has previously stopped the U.K going into the Euro against Tony Blair 's wishes according to the BBC biography :
" Blair saw it as his destiny to take Britain into the single European currency but Brown , who was less enthusiastic , managed to seize control of the policy .
He turned it into an economic - rather than a political - decision by announcing five economic tests which had to be passed before he would recommend that the issue should be put to a public referendum .
He would later hail it as one of his best decisions . "
Whether joining the Euro is Gordon Brown 's hidden agenda or not , the destruction of the British pound to force the U.K to adopt the Euro will undoubtedly filter real wealth away from many U.K citizens .
2. Brown Loves Bankers

Gordon Brown has discussed his anger with banks and his commitment to helping the working people of Britain .
Yet the banks are benefiting from government money , while the prospect for the average citizen still remains uncertain .
Banks continue not to lend yet continue to get tax payers money thrown at them through bailout schemes , loan guarantee schemes and bad asset removal schemes to encourage banks to lend .
Lets look at the great deal banks are getting :
Banks love bailouts :
Bailouts are great for banks because they got to take huge risks which in the short term allowed them to make record profits , with bankers getting huge bonuses .
Now the excessive risk taking came back to haunt them , wiping out their profits and making the banks insolvent .
In a free market the banks would go bankrupt and be eaten up by new companies and competitors that would replace their role in the market .
It 's simple : badly run businesses fail and those that work well survive and prosper .
However , the banks are protected from paying the ultimate price of bankruptcy because they are bailed out by the tax payers .
This allows the banks to take as much risk as they like , make huge returns in the short term , and if everything goes wrong later they can start all over again with someone else 's money .
Banks love loan guarantees :
Loan guarantees are great because a bank can loan money and if it fails then the tax payer foots most of the bill , yet if the loan gets repaid the bank makes a profit .
A win-win for the bank , and a lose - lose for tax payers .
The fact that the tax payer has to back the loan with real money and the banks back it with ' created ' money does n't come into question
A bank looking to maximize profits would use the loan guarantee on the riskiest loans putting the tax payer at greater risk , while continuing to lend very cautiously to the safer borrowers .
The problem of risky lending caused this mess , and now the government wants to encourage it with the risk now falling immediately on the tax payer .
Bad Asset Removal is the Icing on the Cake :
Bad assets refers to bad loans , which means loans that are unlikely to be paid back .
These bad loans in the U.K have been estimated to run to over £ 1 trillion .
The U.K government is proposing buying these bad assets to encourage the banks to lend .
This therefore allows banks to sell bad debt to the tax payer , as if it was good debt , through a government scheme .
Let me explain further .
If company A was selling a debt to company B , then company B would be getting the debt now repaid to them , plus interest .
So company B would pay roughly how much they would earn from the debt to company A , minus an amount that accounts for the potential that the debt will not be paid back .
If the risk of the debt not being paid back is very high then company B will pay a lot lot less than the complete repayment amount because the debt is so likely to go bad .
It was the realization that a lot of these debts being re-sold were not going to be paid back which was a major trigger for the credit crisis .
If these £ 1 trillion of debts were worth any money somebody somewhere would have bought them already , but nobody wants to for a very good reason : the majority of the debts will unlikely be repaid .
But there is still one buyer left ... the tax payer , who is essentially buying nothing of value , and hence simply giving away their money to the banks , in a government initiative to get the banks lending .
So these bad asset removal schemes are essentially a guise for tax payers ( both businesses and consumers ) to GIVE money to the banks , so they can then loan money from the banks !
Confused why this is a logical strategy ?
Me too !
No Punishment , but Rewards :
Gordon Brown announced his anger towards irresponsible bankers and stated that they should be punished .
" I am angry at irresponsible behavior , " he told GMTV .
" Our economy is built around people who work hard , who show effort , who take responsible decisions , and where there is excessive and irresponsible risk - taking , that has got to be punished . "
Despite this strong statement his his spokesman defused the idea of retrospective punishments stating : " The key issue is that we reform the financial system now , going forward . "
To the best of my knowledge no official punishments have been made against these irresponsible bankers .
Occasional isolated cases of top bankers quitting under pressure have recently occurred , but even in these cases ' golden goodbyes ' and pension schemes see bankers leave with millions .
It is odd that a company effectively bankrupt can afford to pay its failed management , which have been forced to step down , millions of pounds .
The large majority of bankers involved in creating the boom still have their jobs and received bonuses while tax payers continue to bail them out of bankruptcy .
While being a banker might mot be listed among the most high paying jobs , it has certainly been one of the most lucrative careers available , especially in the UK where endless tax breaks have been given to bankers and hedge fund managers allowing them to pay anything between 0 - 10 % tax .
It is no wonder that protests followed a week after Gordon Brown announced his fruitless anger towards irresponsible bankers :

Tax payers are GIVING money to the banks ,
so they can loan more money from the banks .
Evidence Gordon Loves Banks ?
Image source : Flickr
The generous bailout schemes point to the conclusion that the government has some hidden reason to be so kind to banks at the expense of tax payers .
But what benefit would Gordon Brown get from this ?
There are many answers to that question all surrounded with speculation and many entering the realms of conspiracy .
A popular theory being that Gordon Brown is part of an illuminati , that oppresses the world through debt slavery .
Putting conspiracy theories aside we can turn to Gordon 's old partner and ex-Prime minister , Tony Blair , to get an idea of what might be in store for Gordon 's future :
Tony Blair now works for the bank J.P. Morgan and Zurich Insurance earning an estimated £ 7 million a year .
Tony Blair 's former chief of staff also joined a bank .
The banking industry is proving to have an incestuous relationship with the government and this should not be ignored .
It seems that no matter what , the banks always win .
3. Gordon Brown Wants the Government to Own Banks
Image source : Channel 4
Back in 1975 Gordon Brown wrote :
" The public control of industries is essential to the provision of social needs and services , the priorities being building and construction , food and food processing , insurance and pensions ; the industries essential to the planning of services vital to the economy - the priorities being energy as a whole , land , banking and foreign trade ... industries whose monopolistic position threatens the ability of society to plan its own future . "
This essentially translates to a young Gordon Brown believing that every major area of industry and commerce should be government controlled , essentially saying that the growth of monopolistic companies ( such as banks ) are damaging to society .
He therefore suggests government control over the main areas of industry .
The main potential risks in this strategy would be that the government would not act responsibility in the interest of the public , and that the public companies would become unproductive without the corrective force of free markets and the perpetually rewarding stream of tax revenue .
Could Gordon Brown be That Crazy ?
Is Gordon Brown planning to bust the economy to force the U.K to join the Euro ?
Is Gordon Brown risking UK bankruptcy to benefit himself in a long - term personal agenda with banks ?
Or is Gordon Brown risking a bust Britain to achieve a lifetime ambition to get banks under government control ?
There is of course the potential explanation that Gordon Brown has no hidden agenda , he is making what he believes to be the best decisions for the U.K economy and that the U.K is not likely to go bankrupt .
However , with the threat of ' Bankrupt Britain ' becoming more real and garnering wider support I believe the answers to questions such as these need much greater scrutiny .
Yet the topic of ' Bankrupt Britain ' has barely been mentioned in the U.K news .
In fact I was astounded to see how this topic has been avoided by the larger news organizations in the U.K while it is so fundamentally important to the people of Britain .
Part 2 : Why are British People Being Kept in the Dark ?
Science is Based on Empirical Observations
Evolution is just a process by which change occurs in nature .
The process of evolution was deduced by interpretation of evidence that holds up to empirical scrutiny .
Evolution is like many other natural processes which are deduced by interpretation of evidence .
A couple of other processes we have deduced from evidence found in the natural world are erosion and eutrophication .
Evolution has no moral bias , any more than erosion or eutrophication do .
Evolution is an explanation of a process which takes nothing into account but the physical evidence and only that evidence which holds up to careful scrutiny .
The process by which scientific theories are arrived at and supported has much in common with crime scene investigation .
Data surrounding the thing being investigated is collected and examined as scientists compare it to other known quantities and try to puzzle out how the event happened .
Any evidence which does n't hold up to rigorous empirical investigation is discarded .
The theory of evolution is a similar set of deductions used to postulate what may have happened to cause the existence of myriad life forms on our planet .
Like a crime scene investigation , none of the evidence was purposely left for the investigators .
In the case of evolution , the events or circumstances happened so long ago and on such a slow scale that by the time we began investigating it , much of the evidence was dust .
Our " crime scene " was old , contaminated , and had millennia of wear and tear before we even realized we ought to be looking at it .
A group of crime scene investigators might not piece together the exact story of what happened with 100 % accuracy .
Perhaps Mrs. Potter did n't kill her husband with a napkin holder in the basement and stuff him in a dryer , maybe he was n't dead when she stuffed him in the dryer but died inside it of the wounds Mrs. Potter inflicted with a napkin holder .
However , the basic facts are correct - it was Mrs. Potter who killed Mr. Potter and she did use a napkin holder to fatally wound him and did stuff him in a clothes dryer .
The same lack of 100 percent accuracy of every tiny detail that may have occurred applies to the natural scientists that have pieced together and interpreted the evidence to suggest evolution via mutation and natural selection over the course of millions of years .
However , neither group would " take the case to trial " if the evidence was n't compelling .
My point is that evolution is n't a philosophy , it is n't a religion , it is n't a disproof of the existence of God ; it has no moral bias .
Evolution does n't make people into atheists any more than climate changes , global warming , or sedimentation do .
Evolution is simply a reasonable , scientific deduction based on analysis of the evidence available .
I have no understanding why people have chosen to feel threatened by evolution - it's as bizarre as feeling threatened by erosion or euthrophication or any other natural process .
Last.fm did not turn over user data after U2's unreleased album leaked onto the Internet late last week , according to both the RIAA and the music site itself .
According to a rumor circulating over the past couple of days , the record industry was up in arms after U2's No Line on the Horizon popped up on P2P and filesharing sites , resulting in the RIAA allegedly demanding — and getting — records from Last.fm to see which users were and scrobbling tracks from the album .
The CBS - owned Last.fm was happy to fork it over , or so the story goes , but both Last.fm and the RIAA deny any such thing happened .
( " Scrobbling , " for those of you not in the know , is when you set up your media software to report to Last . fm what you 're listening to .
The data is shared with friends and the public should you so choose . )
Word got out last week that U2's upcoming album , which is n't slated for release until March 3 , had been accidentally posted for sale by the UMG - operated getmusic.com.au .
Before the label was able to pull the tracks off the site , they had spread like wildfire across the Internet — CD - quality and DRM - free .
Considering U2's extreme paranoia about leaks — the band reportedly refuses to send out samples to industry people ahead of release and instead insists on secret , in - person listening parties — this particular series of events was almost amusing .
According to the unnamed source behind the rumor , when Last.fm was allegedly asked to hand over the user data , no one was told exactly what it was to be used for until later .
Needless to say , the rumor sparked a bit of a panic among the Last . fm community , as such data would not only identify which users had downloaded the unreleased tracks , but could possibly be shared with the RIAA 's partners .
However , Last.fm staff member Russ Garrett posted in a discussion thread on Last.fm with " a full and categorical denial " of the report .
" We 've never had any request for such data by anyone , and if we did we would n't consent to it , " said Garrett .
The RIAA has finally chimed in as well , categorically denying that any such request was ever made .
" [ We 're ] not sure where that rumor came from , " RIAA spokesperson Cara Duckworth told Ars on Saturday .
" It 's not true . "
So , everyone can calm down and go back to their regularly scheduled programming .
The incident does show , however , that users are sensitive to their privacy being respected when it comes to usage data , even if they are choosing to share it themselves .
Block , Hazlitt , DeLong , Me , and the Noble Lie By Bryan Caplan
Walter Block has written a new intro to Henry Hazlitt ’s Economics in One Lesson :
Writing this introduction is a labor of love for me .
You know how women sometimes say to each other “ This dress is you ! “ ?
Well , this book is me !
This was the first book on economics that just jumped out and grabbed
me .
I had read a few before , but they were boring .
Very boring .
Did I
mention boring ?
In sharp contrast , Economics in One Lesson grabbed me by the neck and never ever let me go . [… ]
There is nothing that pleases a teacher more than when that expression
of understanding lights up a student ’s face .
The cartoons depict this
phenomenon in the form of a light bulb appearing right above the
depiction of the character .
Well , let me tell you : I have gotten more
“ ahas ” out of introductory students who have read this book than from
any other .
I warrant that there have been more conversions to the
free - market philosophy from this one economics book than , perhaps , from
all others put together .
It is just that stupendous .
In writing this intro , Block has confirmed Brad DeLong ’s worst fears :
Hazlitt does n’t recognize any of these ifs .
And that is what makes his book very dangerous indeed to a beginner in economics , because the ifs
are , all of them , important qualifications and caveats .
I gather that
Tyler read it relatively early , and I am amazed that he has escaped
with so little permanent neurological and ideological damage .
If I know Walter , he ’ll be delighted to confirm Brad ’s fears – and frankly , I largely take Walter ’s side on this .
Brad ’s worried that people will ignore the ifs ; I ’m worried that people wo n’t understand that the ifs themselves require “ important qualifications and caveats . ”
As I write in my book :
Even
among economists , market - oriented policy prescriptions are often seen as too
dogmatic , too unwilling to take the flaws of the free market into account .
Many prefer a more “ sophisticated ”
position : Since we have already belabored the advantages of markets , let us not
forget to emphasize the benefits of government intervention .
I claim that the qualification needs qualification :
Before we emphasize the benefits of government intervention , let us distinguish
intervention designed by a well - intentioned economist from intervention that
appeals to non-economists , and reflect that the latter predominate .
You do not have to be dogmatic to take a
staunchly pro-market position .
You just
have to notice that the “ sophisticated ” emphasis on the benefits of
intervention mistakes theoretical possibility for empirical likelihood .
Under the circumstances , it ’s usually best to teach Hazlitt “ straight ” to intro students – not , contra Levy , as a “ noble lie , ” but as a solid first approximation to economic truth .
Today we have four new photos from upcoming big screen “ Dragonball Evolution ” adaptation featuring a look at
James Marsters
( Piccolo ) ,
Eriko Tamura ( Mei ) and Joon Park ( Yamcha )
Dragonball Evolution
” is adapted from the manga created by ; the work was also turned into a Japanese anime series that played all over the world .
It tells the story of an alien sent to destroy Earth , who has a change of heart and decides to join the humans in their fight against various aliens and bad guys .
Justin Chatwin is starring as the hero Goku , while James Marsters will play the villain Piccolo in the sci- fi adventure .
Dragonball is directed by James Wong ( Final Destination , Jet Li’s The One , Final Destination 3 ) , with a script written by Ben Ramsey ( The Big Hit , Love and a Bullet ) .
The film stars Justin Chatwin as Goku , James Marsters as Piccolo , Emmy Rossum as Bulma , Chow Yun -Fat as Master Roshi , Jamie Chung as Chi Chi , and Park Joon as Yamcha .
The Houston Press reports that final arguments are being held in the criminal assault trial against Dymond Milburn who was 12 years old when four Galveston police officers ( David Roark , Justin Popovich , Sean Stewart , and Sgt. Gilbert Gomez ) allegedly beat her up with a flashlight and threatened to shoot her puppy , while she was in her yard attending to tripped circuit breaker .
Background :
One morning a couple of years ago , Dymond was in her yard , resetting a circuit breaker at the request of her mother .
Four plainclothes Galveston police officers were driving by in an unmarked van , responding to a call that three white prostitutes were working Milburn 's neighborhood .
The police spotted Dymond ( who is black ) , jumped out of the van and announced that she was under arrest for prostitution .
Dymond grabbed a tree and called for her father .
The police officers allegedly beat Dymond so badly that she had to be hospitalized ( for black eyes as well as throat and ear drum injuries ) .
Three weeks later , police showed up at Milburn 's school and arrested her for assault .
Hence , the trial against her .
Here 's a previous post on Boing Boing with more information , including links to court documents and other articles .
For the life of me I do n't understand why the national media has n't jumped all over this story .
Final Arguments Expected In Trial Of Galveston Girl Mistaken For Hooker
Girl police allegedly mistook for hooker on trial in Galveston
Dear God , let ’s just kiss the US economy goodbye .
It may take a few years before the loyalists and permabulls throw in the towel , but the handwriting is on the wall .
The Obama Administration , if the Washington Post ’s latest report is accurate , is about to embark on a hugely expensive “ save the banking industry at all costs ” experiment that :
1 . Has nothing substantive in common with any of the “ deemed as successful ” financial crisis programs 2 .
Has key elements that studies of financial crises have recommended against 3 .
Consumes considerable resources , thus competing with other , in many cases better , uses of fiscal firepower .
The Obama Administration is as obviously and fully hostage to the interests of the financial services industry as the Bush crowd was .
We have no new thinking , no willingness to take measures that are completely defensible ( in fact not doing them takes some creative positioning ) like wiping out shareholders at obviously dud banks ( Citi is top of the list ) , forcing bondholder haircuts and / or equity swaps , replacing management , writing off and / or restructuring bad loans , and deciding whether and how to reorganize and restructure the company .
Instead , the banks are now getting the AIG treatment : every demand is being met , no tough questions asked , no probing of the accounts ( or more important , the accounting ) .
Why is this a bad idea ?
Let ’s turn to a study by the IMF of 124 banking crises .
Their conclusion :
Existing empirical research has shown that providing assistance to banks and their borrowers can be counterproductive , resulting in increased losses to banks , which often abuse forbearance to take unproductive risks at government expense .
The typical result of forbearance is a deeper hole in the net worth of banks , crippling tax burdens to finance bank bailouts , and even more severe credit supply contraction and economic decline than would have occurred in the absence of forbearance .
In case you had any doubts , propping up dud asset values is a form of forbearance .
Japan had a different way of going about it , but the philosophy was similar , and the last 15 year illustrates how well that worked .
What we have from Team Obama is a bigger abortion of a “ throw money at bad bank assets ” plan that I feared in my worst nightmare .
And ( when we get to the Post preview ) , they have the temerity to invoke triage to make what they are doing sound surgical and limited .
Those who remember the origin know that triage means focusing on the middle third of the wounded on the battlefield : abandoning the goners to die , leaving those wounded but stable to fend for themselves for the moment ( they were in good enough shape to wait to be transported or hold on to be treated later ) .
The middle third , those in immediate danger but who might nevertheless be salvaged , get top priority .
The concept of “ triage ” recognizes that resources are limited , tough decision need to be made , and some are beyond any hope .
But in Team Obama Newspeak , triage means everyone can be saved because resources are presumed to be unlimited :
The basic problem confronting the government is that banks hold large quantities of assets that they value on their books for much more than investors are willing to pay …
Yves here .
The spin is so thick I have to interject after one sentence .
Note how the problem is that the investors do n’t want to pay enough , not that the assets are in most cases fetid ?
Back to the article :
Since the early days of the financial crisis , officials have struggled to unwind that knot .
If the government buys the assets at prices that banks consider fair , the Treasury would take a huge loss when it ultimately sells the assets for much less .
If , instead , the government insists on paying market prices , the banks may not survive their losses .
Yves here .
See how saving the banks in their current form is presumed to be necessary ?
This is the phony policy constraint that is leading to all the distortions .
The savings and loan crisis ’ Resolution Trust Corporation is touted as a good “ bad bank ” model ( it ’s far from the only one ) .
But guess what ?
It got those bad assets from banks that died .
That little detail seems to be neglected in modern accounts .
Back to the article :
Instead of taking a single approach , the Obama administration plans to divide assets and other loans into three categories , each with its own solution , according to sources familiar with the discussions , speaking on condition of anonymity because the details are not finalized .
The government would buy and hold on to those assets whose falling prices are putting banks under the most pressure .
Officials want to limit these purchases because of the vast expense .
The centerpiece of the plan would be a guarantee to limit losses on a second group of troubled assets that can be kept by the banks because they have more stable prices .
And it would allow banks to retain and profit from their healthiest assets .
Beyond these initiatives , the government also is likely to inject more capital into troubled institutions .
Yves again .
This sounds completely arbitrary , despite the pretense of faux science .
Do they want to buy the assets most underwater ?
The assets most at risk of further price declines ?
The assets with that are the hardest to value ( like lower rated CDO tranches ? ) .
It may simply be that the Post reporter does n’t appreciate the issues at work , but I wonder if the extreme vagueness reflects instead failure to come to grips with the real objectives ( which means Wall Street will be able to manipulate them ) or that they do n’t want the public to know what is going on ( per the persistent stonewalling of efforts to find out what securities the Fed has bought and taken as collateral ) .
As John Paulson pointed out , a lot of poor quality paper is trading .
The idea that it is illiquid is a myth .
The problem is not a lack of price discovery , as the discussion above pretends , it ’s a lack of investor willingness or ability to take losses .
And readers have said if a particular piece of paper does n’t fetch a bid , that ’s because its real value is not materially above zero .
But per above , that ’s the sort of dreck that Team Obama would buy .
And what , pray tell , is the point of the guarantee ?
The loss exposure on a guarantee ( versus a purchase ) at the same nominal price is the same , although the initial cash outlay is considerably different .
Ah , but if the paper is guaranteed , then your friendly bank welfare recipient can bring the junk to the Fed and get nice cash back .
So we the taxpayers are going to eat a ton of bank losses that should instead be borne first by stockholders and bondholders
This program should be labeled the Pimco bailout plan , since the giant bond fund holds a lot of bank debt .
That shows what a fiction Obama ’s populism is .
It ’s mere posturing and empty phrases .
Look at where the dough goes , and it is going first and foremost to the big money end of town .
Now I do not labor under the delusion that there are cheap or easy ways out of our financial sinkhole .
People are suffering , and we are only partway through the process of contraction and writeoffs .
I heard of a suicide today , a jewelry dealer who was $ 400,000 in debt ( also owed a lot of money but unable to collect ) who threw himself off 10 West 47th Street ( from someone else in the building , this is no urban legend ) .
A tragedy , and a visible one , and there is plenty of less acute but no less real trauma afoot .
But Team Obama is taking the cowardly approach of distributing the costs among the most disenfranchised group in the process , namely the taxpayer , when there far more obvious and logical groups to take the hits .
Shareholders and bondholders bought securities KNOWING there was the possibility of loss .
A lot of big financial institutions have been on the ropes for over a year .
A security holding is not a marriage .
When conditions change , prudent investors reassess and adjust course accordingly .
If anyone is long a lot of dodgy bank paper now , they have only themselves to blame .
Any why are rank and file bankers still exempt from pay cuts when the workers in another failing US industry , autos , expected to take big hits ?
This is the most roundabout and probably the most costly way to not solve this problem .
Another warning from the IMF paper :
All too often , central banks privilege stability over cost in the heat of the containment phase : if so , they may too liberally extend loans to an illiquid bank which is almost certain to prove insolvent anyway .
Also , closure of a nonviable bank is often delayed for too long , even when there are clear signs of insolvency ( Lindgren , 2003 ) .
Since bank closures face many obstacles , there is a tendency to rely instead on blanket government guarantees which , if the government ’s fiscal and political position makes them credible , can work albeit at the cost of placing the burden on the budget , typically squeezing future provision of needed public services .
The most amazing bit is the government acts as if it has no leverage .
Look how Paulson sent teams in to inspect the accounts of Fannie and Freddie and put them into conservatorship .
The reason it is obvious that this program is a crock is that it has been cooked up in the complete and utter absence of any serious due diligence on the toxic holdings of the big banks .
As we discuss in a separate post , the one punitive element , executive comp restrictions , are mere window - dressing .
Welcome to change you can believe in .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama said on Wednesday his administration would have to make tough decisions soon on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , after convening his first meeting of U.S. military chiefs .
“ We are going to have some difficult decisions that we are going to have to make surrounding Iraq and Afghanistan most immediately , ” Obama told reporters after his first session with the Joint Chiefs of Staff since taking office eight days ago .
Obama has pledged to build up U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan while working toward an accelerated withdrawal of forces in Iraq , a war that polls show most Americans oppose .
“ Obviously , our efforts to continue to go after extremists who would do harm to the homeland is uppermost on our minds , ” Obama said , signaling his strategy of focusing more on Afghanistan , a departure from the Bush administration ’s emphasis on Iraq .
Obama ’s first presidential visit to the Pentagon to confer with top generals was intended to build upon a White House meeting with U.S. commanders on Iraq and Afghanistan last Wednesday , his first full day in office .
But his Defense Department visit was low key compared to his high - profile appearance at the State Department last week soon after he was sworn in , a possible signal of his intention to stress diplomacy over military power in world affairs .
Pulling troops out of Iraq was a cornerstone of Obama ’s campaign for the presidency , during which the war was a top concern of voters until it was eclipsed by the faltering economy .
Obama said before taking office that he wanted U.S. combat forces out of Iraq within 16 months of starting his term .
His ability to make good on that promise could hinge on whether violence in Iraq keeps declining and Iraqi security forces keep improving their capabilities .
Cohen has already played two concerts in Victoria this year
Singer Leonard Cohen has donated A$ 200,000 ( £ 90,000 ) to aid victims of the Australian bushfires .
Cohen is currently touring across Australia , performing his final concert on Tuesday in Melbourne .
The star 's tour promoter said Cohen hoped the contribution would go some way to aiding those in need .
More than 181 people have died and nearly 1,000 homes have been destroyed in the bushfires which have ravaged the state of Victoria .
" Leonard has loved his time in Australia on this tour and is shocked and deeply saddened by the news of the fires , " tour promoter Michael Gudinski said .
He added the star and his touring party wished to extend " their heartfelt sympathies to those that have suffered the loss of loved ones or their homes through this terrible tragedy " .
A charity bucket collection will also be conducted at Cohen 's concert at the Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday night .
It is the 73 - year - old singer 's third concert in the state during the current tour , previously playing at Rod Laver Arena last week and Rochford Wines in the Yarra Valley in January .
MD5 Hack Interesting , But Not Threatening
A few days ago at the Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin , researchers presented a paper in which they had used an MD5 collision attack and substantial computing firepower to create a false SSL certificate using the RapidSSL brand of SSL certificate .
In the intervening time we have seen a great deal of confusion and misinformation in the press and blogosphere about the specifics of this attack and what it means to the online ecosystem .
 We applaud security research of this sort and are glad that white hat researchers like these make a point of investigating online security .
Fortunately , VeriSign was able to move very quickly to remove this vulnerability . 
I hope that this column can clarify many of the issues .
The research revealed a potential attack that required the issuance of new certificates .
As explained in SecurityFocus :
The group of researchers took advantage of RapidSSL 's fast issuance of certificates .
Their attack consisted of creating two certificates and ensuring that the certificates had the same MD5 hash  what is known as a collision .
The two certificates consisted of a Web site certificate for a legitimate site and an intermediate certificate authority ( CA ) certificate that normally identifies a trusted issuer of certificates .
Because RapidSSL has an automated script that issues MD5 - signed certificates and assigns a sequential serial number and guessable expiration date to the certificates , the researchers were able to fill in the fields of the certificate with the appropriate information and use a distributed computer made up of 200 PlayStation 3 game machines  equivalent to 8,000 standard desktop computers  to calculate the data needed to make the two certificates have identical MD5 hashes .
Each attempted attack took less than two days .
The research results are interesting and underscore that certificate authorities ( CAs ) must move away from the MD5 hash algorithm .
The presenters of the paper , however , stressed that it took them a long time and a great deal of computational power to succeed in their collision attack .
Considering that it took the original researchers four tries over at least a month to successfully accomplish their attack against the RapidSSL brand , were fully confident that no malicious organization had the opportunity to use this information against RapidSSL , or any other certificate authority authorized by VeriSign .
A significant problem with the disclosure of this attack was that we were not given any information on the research prior to its unveiling in Berlin .
VeriSign executives and developers viewed the Web stream of the researchers  presentation live from the conference .
Once we were aware of the specifics of the attack , we rendered it ineffective about four hours later .
All VeriSign SSL products on all brands are now immune to this attack .
This attack took advantage of several clever bits of hacking to achieve its effect , including the aforementioned highly computational attack on the MD5 hash .
As it happens the most expedient and safest method of mitigating the attack was to switch it out for SHA - 1 .
We had been planning this migration to occur on RapidSSL in January 2009 anyway , so we had a high degree of confidence in accelerating that deployment .
Other defenses also would have rendered this attack ineffective , including changing RapidSSLs serial number generation and issuance timing in order to make them less predictable .
In the spirit of defense in depth , we re instituting those changes as well .
We have been in the process of migrating off MD5 for years and will continue on our scheduled plan to discontinue use of MD5 on end -entity certificates by the end of January 2009 .
It takes some time to phase out a widespread technology platform in a way that isnt unfairly damaging to the businesses , processes , and individuals that rely on it .
Many have criticized existing certificate authorities for continuing to support and issue MD5 - signed certificates .
While I cannot speak for other CAs , VeriSign has been working more than two years to migrate the RapidSSL product line to the more secure SHA - 1 hash algorithm .
VeriSign acquired GeoTrust in September 2006 , at which point we obtained the RapidSSL product line .
That was our first opportunity to begin to learn this technology and its platforms and customers .
When you absorb a large , established business , a great deal of learning needs to take place , involving much more than a single hash algorithm .
There are literally thousands of equivalently important matters to look into , the status of most of them not obvious .
Every part of the organization and its people and processes requires investigation , including practices , physical security , authentication standards , process controls , audits , and even the likes of nomenclature and corporate culture .
A good analogy would be if you moved to a new country where they spoke a language you never had heard before and your assignment was to learn the local cuisine and write a cookbook .
Before you can even begin working on the cookbook , you have to learn how to speak to people , where the food markets are , and what foods people consider delicacies and what they do n't .
VeriSign similarly went through a learning process involving every aspect of the business across dozens of product lines , thousands of partners , and hundreds of thousands of established customer relationships .
This process identified a series of changes we wanted to make .
We put together a prioritized migration strategy that accounted for a series of factors such as security risk and other potential harms to operators of sites and their customers .
We have been continuously executing on that plan since the acquisition , and were soon to complete the portion of that plan involving the MD5 phase - out .
While VeriSign has the power to revoke any and all certificates it issues , doing so can be expected to negatively impact their users in a very real financial sense .
VeriSign has been running broad scale public security infrastructures for over a decade , and we have established processes for upgrading standards and technologies that are safe , reliable , and seamless to almost everyone involved .
These processes ensure that the ecosystem keeps running and that it keeps running safely .
As of today , no action is required by individual site operators .
No existing certificates are affected by this attack and the vulnerability has been rendered ineffective for all RapidSSL Certificates moving forward .
In addition , because Extended Validation ( EV ) SSL Certificates utilize the latest hash algorithm , they are not affected by the just - revealed attack on MD5 vulnerabilities .
These security researchers specifically stated that EV SSL Certificates were safe from this attack .
They stressed the need for consumers to move to EV - compatible browsers to get the most benefit from extended validation .
As mentioned earlier , we have been engaged in a massive MD5 migration effort for a number of years now and are very near its conclusion .
As it is , the overwhelming majority of VeriSigns certificates are off MD5 today , and the rest are soon to follow .
While we can't comment on SSL certificates from other CAs , in general , the industry is managing out MD5 , and we consider it unlikely that other CAs will be potential attack vectors in the future .
We applaud security research of this sort and are glad that white hat researchers like these make a point of investigating online security .
Fortunately , VeriSign was able to move very quickly to remove this vulnerability .
We have taken the further step of offering to replace , free of charge , any MD5 - hashed certificate .
Until further notice VeriSign is suspending its normal replacement fees for these certificates .
Because this replacement is not necessary to ensure the continued security of sites , we are not requiring the replacement of such certificates , as we have previously with the likes of weak Debian keys .
