It has been just over a month since the last time the Sri Lankan conflict was featured here .
In that time , government forces have put further pressure on the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , and hundreds of thousands of civilians in the north of the country have been trapped in a war zone .
Press coverage is still very limited , and conflicting stories are the norm , with LTTE representatives claiming the ethnic Tamil civilians are staying willingly , fearful of government forces , and the Sri Lankan government claiming the civilians are being held against their will by the LTTE .
According to the UN , over 6,500 civilians have been killed , thousands more injured , and a stream of over 100,000 refugees has recently left the LTTE stronghold , and the Sri Lankan government has halted the use of heavy - caliber weaponry .

How the Web and the Weblog have changed Writing by Philip Greenspun in May 2009 Site Home : Writing : One Page
Publishing from Gutenberg ( 1455 ) through 1990
the five - page magazine article , serving as filler among the ads the book , with a minimum of 200 pages
New Yorker
Filler Example : The Steve Ward Diet
Steve noted that this could also be called the " Bang - Bang Servo Diet " but that would likely be confusing to non-engineers ( see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang-bang_control).
Steve 's diet is probably more effective than most popular diets .
How come he is n't a bestselling diet book author ?
How do you turn an idea that can be explained in one paragraph into a diet book that people will buy ?
Printing that one paragraph really large would take up one page .
Then you 'd have a few example graphs , each with a personal story of someone for whom the Steve Ward Diet worked .
Now we 've got 10 pages .
We still need 190 pages .
So we add recipes for near - zero calorie foods : steamed broccoli ; raw celery ; lettuce au radis ; etc .
Eventually we have something that can be sold for $ 12.95 in a bookstore , but is it better than that one paragraph description ?
Harry Greenspun , M.D. , one of America 's most brilliant doctors ( according to our mother ) , offers his own diet : " Do n't eat anything that a Caveman would n't have eaten ; humans have not had enough time to adapt biologically to the agricultural revolution . "
What does that mean ?
" You can eat meat , vegetables that you pick up from the ground and fruits that you pick out of a tree .
Do n't eat pasta , bread , corn , potatoes , and other products of modern agriculture . "
For Dr. Greenspun to get this idea to the public through commercial publishing channels would require him to add 200 pages of elaboration that would not make the diet more useful .
Perhaps it could be a 20 - page diet , but the market for pamphlets is very limited , and 20 pages is too long for a magazine sold in supermarkets .

How about a collection ?
If an author writes enough essays , eventually they can be collected into a 200 - page book and distributed commercially .
Many authors are experts on only a single subject and should not be encouraged to continue scribbling .
Publishing from 1990 to 2000 : World Wide Web
supports any length of essay , including 20 - or 30 - page essays that previously had no home
allows anyone to publish , even on topics with very limited potential readership , due to zero marginal cost of distribution
allows authors with no funds or technical skill to publish , by filling out forms on , for example , GeoCities ( 1994 )
allows readers to find relevant material at the " instant of curiosity " ( Webcrawler search engine ; 1994 )
Building a 35 mm Digital SLR System ( 18 pages ; way too long for any photography magazine ; to be useful in a magazine , would need to be reprinted every month )
Cirrus SR20 review ( 25 pages ; helps people avoid wasting $ 300,000 ; only a few hundred of these airplanes are sold each year ; flying magazines run 5 - page articles at most )

What was missing ?
How would a reader consume one - paragraph ideas ?
Wait until an author had developed a few dozen and published a page of collected thoughts ?
Return periodically to an author 's site to see if there were any new paragraphs added ?

The first blogger ?
Meditations
Do not disturb thyself by thinking of the whole of thy life .
Let not thy thoughts at once embrace all the various troubles which thou mayest expect to befall thee : but on every occasion ask thyself , What is there in this which is intolerable and past bearing ?
For thou wilt be ashamed to confess .
In the next place remember that neither the future nor the past pains thee , but only the present .
But this is reduced to a very little , if thou only circumscribest it , and chidest thy mind , if it is unable to hold out against even this .
This was preserved because the author had been Emperor .
How much ancient wisdom was lost because the common Roman citizen lacked TCP / IP ?
[ By 1700 BC , the Minoans were trading with Spain , had big cities with flush toilets , a written language , and moderately sophisticated metalworking technology .
Had it not been for the eruption of Thera ( on Santorini ) , it is quite possible that Romans would have watched the assassination of Julius Caesar on television . ]
After Marcus there have been quite a few folks whose collected short thoughts have interested readers , but in very few cases have those thoughts been made available in a timely manner .
Favorite things about the Weblog
good support for one - paragraph ideas
great repository for personal thoughts , if only so that the author him or herself can go back later to review
content over form ;
Webloggers generally use a standard style and do n't play with colors and formatting the way that GeoCities authors used to
distributed comment system ; no need for the entire conversation to be on one server
RSS feeds and aggregators

MSNBC ’s Joe Scarborough thinks it ’s a mistake to abandon President Bush ’s harsh interrogation techniques like waterboarding that many consider to be torture .
Scarborough points to a Washington
Post poll that says about half of Americans support the use of torture in some cases .
Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski notes that Obama administration officials say that intelligence can be gathered without using torture .
“ What Robert Gibbs is saying on ‘ Meet the Press ’ yesterday , was that they do n’t know whether other means may be able to get the same information , ” she said .

“ I ’m not .
Go ahead .
Take that chance , ” scoffed Scarborough .
“ Sometimes you have a reason to be fearful , ” he said .
“ There is irrational fear and then rational fear .
If you live in a neighborhood where people ’s homes get broken into and people get shot and killed at night and their items get stolen , and you ’re fearful that may happen to you , that ’s not irrational .
That is fear and you will support a stronger police presence in your home .
If this country got attacked the way it did on September 11th , 2001 , it is not irrational for Americans to fear it might happen again when you have al Qaeda wanting to do nothing but kill all of us , destroy our cities . ”

When it was announced that the renowned Iranian film director Abbas Kiarostami was to direct a production of Mozart 's Cosi Fan Tutte in London , it was anticipated to be one of the highlights of English National Opera 's season .
Mr Kiarostami , 68 , a man credited with being the father of modern Iranian cinema , was also due to lecture at the British Film Institute , where he already holds a fellowship .
But yesterday it emerged that he became so fed up with the disrespectful and time - consuming way he was treated when applying to the British embassy for a temporary work visa , he gave up as a matter of principle .
The opera is due to open in three weeks .
The ENO said that the Iranian director 's associate director Elaine Tyler - Hall would take over .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Kiarostami , who has been to Britain on many occasions and insists that he has no problem visiting France and Italy , said he had found the new system " unduly time - consuming and hugely complicated " .
The Ambassador in Tehran , Simon Gass , tried to intervene at the last minute but by that stage Mr Kiarostami had lost the will to continue .
" [ The ENO ] respected my position and my principles in spite of the obvious fact that it was putting them in a very precarious and disagreeable position .
I have to confess that this gives me hope – the world is still a liveable place malgré tout , " he said from his home in Tehran .
" It is very sad that such a widely admired artist as Abbas will not be coming to London , " said John Berry , artistic director of the ENO .
A spokesman for the BFI , which is releasing Mr Kiarostami 's latest film Shirin next month , added : " It is regrettable when somebody of his stature is made to feel like his presence in this country is not desirable .
It is such a great shame and a very sad day for culture in Britain when one of the world 's greatest artists of his time is not able to come and present his work . "
While Mr Kiarostami's case has proved the most high profile , he is just the tip of an iceberg of artists , academics and business people who feel they have been effectively snubbed by British embassies abroad .
Many feel frustrated by the new visas which require all entrants to provide fingerprints and travel for interviews with British embassy staff .
The Independent has received countless letters from British residents complaining that legitimate attempts to bring colleagues or friends into the UK have been greeted by a tortuous process and often what appears to have been an arbitrary refusal with no redress .
" It is not just rudeness but there is a general assumption that if you are from a poorer country , you will overstay .
It is insulting to people who have no reason to stay , " said Kahiye Alim , managing partner of the immigration specialists Talk Visa LLP .

Keith Best , of the Immigration Law Advisory Service , said it had become harder to get visas with the introduction of a points system and the fact that people now had to travel to distant regional centres to apply .
" I am afraid we perform very , very poorly compared to others .
My understanding is you can go to the US embassy in the morning and walk out that day with a student visa . "
A spokesman for the UK Border Agency said that fingerprint visas were a " crucial part " of securing the border and that the system was strict but " also speedy " .
" Fingerprint visas mean we can check everyone who wants to come to the UK against immigration and crime databases .
These checks are a crucial part of securing the border and they are not something we will apologise for – they have already detected at least 5,000 false identities . "
Letters to the editor :
How our readers raised the alarm
Dr Jan Culik , a university lecturer , whose daughter is living in St Petersburg , said her Russian partner was initially refused a tourist visa despite providing countless documents and financial assurances .
" You may conclude that no - one in the UK is interested in how arrogantly and inefficiently the British diplomatic service behaves to non-British citizens .
Even if we accept thiese kind of double standards , one thing is surely unacceptable and newsworthy – the British diplomatic service is grossly inconveniencing UK citizens themselves who , when they live abroad , have contacts and need to take them to the UK for a visit .
It is absolutely incomprehensible why the UK authorities are behaving like a police state . "
Dr Nick Maurice , director of Building Understanding Through International Links for Development , said its work was being hampered by the attitude of staff in visa offices .
" Our work is increasingly in jeopardy because of the difficulties our partners are facing getting into the United Kingdom to share their lives , their faiths , their skills and their cultures with young people in our schools and with us in our homes and communities . "
* Margaret Fox , whose son is living in Shanghai , said his Chinese wife was turned down twice for a visitor 's visa and treated with contempt .
" We live in a caring , law - abiding community where your word is still your bond and it is a shock when your family is ignored by an arrogant government department which should be trying to serve your wishes with consideration and respect . "

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
The troubled Blackwater era ends in Iraq on Thursday as another firm takes over the once - dominant company 's security services contract in Baghdad .
A helicopter for the private security firm then known as Blackwater flies over Baghdad in October 2003 .
Triple Canopy , a Herndon , Virginia - based company , picks up the expiring contract of the security firm formerly known as Blackwater Worldwide , which changed its name to XE a few months ago .
The U.S. State Department decided not to renew XE 's contract in January .
" When the U.S. government initially asked for our help to assist with an immediate need to protect Americans in Iraq , we answered that call and performed well , " XE spokeswoman Anne Tyrell said in a statement Wednesday .
" But we always knew that , at some point , that work would come to a close . "
The end of the contract followed the Iraqi government 's refusal to renew the firm 's operating license because of a September 2007 shooting in which Baghdad says security guards -- then employed by Blackwater -- killed 17 Iraqi civilians .
As part of a contract to protect American diplomats and other employees around the world , the State Department hired Blackwater for a multiyear assignment in Iraq , renewable annually .
XE , one of three security firms working for the United States in Iraq , had one of the biggest contracts there , providing security for the sprawling U.S. Embassy in Baghdad .
" We are honored to have provided this service for five years and are proud of our success .
No one under our protection has been killed or even seriously injured , " Tyrell said .
Many XE employees are expected to go to work for Triple Canopy , which already had a State Department contract in Iraq .
Its new contract increases its share of the security work .
DynCorp International also has a State Department contract for work in Iraq .
Losing the contract is considered a huge blow to XE .
While the company is privately held , the Iraq contract has been estimated to make up a third to a half of its business .
XE has about two dozen aircraft in Iraq as well as 1,000 personnel .
XE 's statement acknowledged that the company 's Baghdad " task order " ends Thursday but was mum on any other roles it still might have in Iraq .
" Any specific questions on the contract and how it will now be fulfilled should be directed to the State Department , " Tyrell said .
Despite the loss of the embassy security detail , XE continues to hold other contracts with the State Department to protect American diplomats elsewhere in the world .
The company 's founder , Erik Prince , resigned as head of the business in March .
In January , five former Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from their involvement in the September 16 , 2007 , incident in a Baghdad square .
A sixth former security guard has pleaded guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter .
Blackwater said its employees were returning fire after armed insurgents attacked them , but an Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation .
The Iraqi government said 17 civilians were killed , although the indictment alleges 14 died .
The company does not face any charges .
But the Baghdad incident exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life .
The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act .
The act was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services " in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas . "
Last year , the State Department renewed Blackwater 's contract over strong objections from the Iraqi government .
Starting January 1 , the Iraqi government has mandated that all contractors obtain Iraqi licenses to operate .

President Hugo Chávez might have many critics , but he can also count on legions of passionate supporters – many of them poor – who say he's the first leader to take their problems seriously .
One such supporter is Nancy Monsalve .
The middle - aged community worker , who has lived all her life in the tough Caracas barrio of 23 de Enero , says life under Mr. Chávez has improved significantly .
" I complained against the system because we were repressed , " she says of life before Chávez came to power in 1999 .
Ms. Monsalve says there were often curfews imposed by the National Guard in her neighborhood , a poor slum in the western reaches of Caracas and one of the strongholds of support for Mr. Chávez 's leftist movement .
" There were curfews , " she says .
" You could n't go out after 6 in the evening to go shopping .
We were censored 100 percent .
You could n't say what you thought because automatically you would be thrown in jail . "
When Chávez was swept to power by the 1998 elections , Monsalve says that the marginalized poor communities could relate to his ideology .
" Ordinary people like us , who were in disagreement with what was going on , identified closely with the process led by Chávez 's government , " she says .
" We now feel free to say ' It 's good , or it 's bad . '
Now , the National Guard looks at us with respect and dignity .
That kind of thing has changed in the last 10 years . "
Since 2006 , she has volunteered as treasurer of a community council , an initiative implemented by Chávez to discuss and fix local problems .
Twenty - three elected members of the council , representing 650 families , communicate with departments of the government to address the neighborhood 's most pressing needs .
The group has already received funds to replace the corroded iron pipes that deliver potable water into their homes with plastic tubes .
Another change has seen natural gas piped directly into the community 's kitchens .
Monsalve is also a member of the community bank , a scheme that allows communities to administer microloans to small businesses .
" If someone wants to create a sewing cooperative , the bank lends them money to buy machines and we take account of their income and who works there .
We stipulate the payment norms , " she says .
" If a state bank came to do this , the policies of the bank would make it unviable because of interest rates . "
The community bank lends money at variable interest rates of 6 or 7 percent , which is far below what private banks offer , and also gives businesses a three - month breathing space to allow themselves to become established .
Monsalve disputes critics ' claims that Chávez 's social initiatives are unsustainable and are creating a dependency on the state .
She cites the microloan program as an initiative that is creating long - lasting employment .
" It 's not that ' Father Chávez ' is always going to give us handouts .
If we want to live better we have a responsibility to do it ourselves , " she says .
Chávez 's social initiatives have made him popular in her barrio , she says , " You can feel a passion for the revolution here .
There 's a lot of ' red ' people here – people who are with the government . "
The EXACTO ( EXtreme ACcuracy Tasked Ordnance ) rifle will conceivably be able to fire accurately at far longer distances than are possible now by combating weather with self - guiding bullets .
Yes , you read that right .

The Pentagon has been working on the .50 caliber EXACTO for about a year already , and its main focus is to overcome climate conditions to stay accurate over a longer range .
Here 's some jargon they 've used to describe the kind of tech that might do such a thing :
Fin-stabilized projectiles , spin-stabilized projectiles , internal and / or external aero-actuation control methods , projectile guidance technologies , tamper proofing , small stable power supplies , and advanced sighting , optical resolution and clarity technologies .
Advertisement
Basically , we 're talking about bullets that can adjust to weather conditions in mid-air , either through external control or the abilities of the bullet itself .
Currently , snipers are really only accurate up to about 800 meters .
Beyond that , it gets much harder to reliably hit a target :
At 2,000 meters , snipers can probably hit the side of a barn , but a head shot is n't too likely .
This rifle could change all of that , and more importantly , lead to even more badass pirate takedowns than we 've seen already .
And we 're all about the pirate takedowns .

From WikiLeaks

EDITORIAL ( WikiLeaks )
We 're arresting you for speeding .
What 's the speed limit , officer ?
The speed limit is secret .
Cartoon by Cathy Wilcox
Shortly after 9 pm on Tuesday March 24 , Wikileaks related buildings in Dresden and Jena , were raided by 11 plain clothes German police .
Why ?
Over the last two years , Wikileaks has exposed detailed secret government censorship lists or plans for over eight countries , including Thailand , the United Arab Emirates , Australia , and Germany .
Although Wikileaks ' main site has been censored by the Chinese Public Security Bureau since early 2007 , last week saw the site placed onto a secret list of sites " forbidden " by the Australian Media and Communications Authority , or ACMA .
The pro-censorship governments exposed by Wikileaks can be divided into three broad categories :
Countries with a mandatory censorship system in place : Thailand , the UAE , and Lebanon ( films ) .
Countries proposing a mandatory censorship system : Australia and Germany .
Countries in which the internet censorship system is an unregulated agreement between several large ISPs and the police : Norway , Denmark and Finland .
Australia and Germany are the only liberal democracies proposing a mandatory internet censorship regime .
All of the schemes operate , or are proposed to operate , through multi-million dollar national networks of censorship machines .
The machines spy on the nation as each citizen attempts to read on the internet , and compares requested pages to those listed on a secret government " blacklist " .
If the page is on the blacklist , the government forcibly prevents the citizen from viewing the information by intercepting his or her internet communication and diverting it to a machine controlled by the censorship system .
This machine is often configured to record the identity of the person attempting to access the forbidden information .
If the page is not on the blacklist , the government grants permission for the citizen to view the page .
Although originally marketed , in all countries , as a way of combating child pornography , the blacklists obtained by Wikileaks show that the systems have already been corrupted into censoring other content , including political content .
For instance , the secret blacklist for Thailand censors thousands of sites per year deemed to be critical of the Thai Monarchy , from academic books and YouTube to the Economist magazine and Wikileaks itself .
Similarly , the blacklist for Australia contains an anti-abortion site , fringe religions , a dentist clinic , gay sites , gambling sites , islamist sites , euthanasia activist sites , an astrologer 's blog , misclassified material , and , like Thailand , Wikileaks itself .
Even the Australian government 's " Minister for censorship " , Senator Stephen Conroy , has admitted that fully half of the sites on the secret list are unrelated to child pornography .
As newspapers and other publications migrate to an exclusive life on the internet , such totalizing censorship systems are able to instantly snatch " pages " from the laps of citizens across an entire nation , interdicting communications between publisher and reader , and the new civil discourse between readers and each other .
The scale , speed and potential impact of this centralized intervention has no historical precedent .
Secret national censorship systems are dangerous and unaccountable .
They are an afront to natural justice , due process and the balancing power of the fourth estate .
They must be , and will be , stopped .
The Australian Government has stated it plans to increase the size of its blacklist list by 10 fold , from roughly 1,200 blocked pages to over 10,000 , although the plan is now seems unlikely to pass the Australian Senate after the revelations of the last month .
* * * * *
To make what has happened clear to those who understand traditional book censorship , we provide the following simple analogy :
Within the libraries and book catalogues of Germany and Australia there are books ( web pages ) forbidden by the state .
The government of Australia has compiled a secret list of books it forbids .
About 1,200 books are on the list .
Not even authors or publishers whose books are placed on the list are told their book has been banned .
Germany plans to adopt and expand a version of the Australian scheme .
Under the plans of the German and Australian governments , every attempt to borrow a book ( read a web page ) will be checked against the secret " forbidden books " ( forbidden web pages ) list .
If a book is on the list , the attempt to borrow it is noted down in another secret list and permission is refused .
If the book is not on the blacklist , permission is granted .
The list of forbidden books ( the blacklist ) is a forbidden book .
The lists of books forbidden in other countries are also forbidden books .
Any book that mentions the title ( URL ) of a forbidden book is itself a forbidden book .
An international investigative newspaper ( Wikileaks ) reveals key internal documents on the censorship expansion plans for Germany , Australia and other countries .
For Australia this expose includes the lists of forbidden books and the presence of clearly political books on the list .
The newspaper warns that Australia is acting like a " democratic backwater " and risks following the censorship path of Thailand .
The article and lists , and then the entire newspaper secretly added to the list of publications banned by Australia .
The Australian " Minister for censorship " , Senator Stephen Conroy , states " Any citizen who distributes [ the blacklist ] is at serious risk of criminal prosecution " .
The Minister threatens to refer the leak to the Australian Federal Police .
That same week , the newspaper releases three more articles on censorship and updates the lists of forbidden books .
Two buildings related to the newspaper in Germany are then raided by 11 plain clothed police .
The police demand the keys ( passwords ) to a protected room ( server ) containing the newspaper 's printing press so they can disable it .
The newspaper staff refuse to comply -- both the keys and the press itself have been sent to Sweden , a country with stronger legal protections for journalists .
The German police then seize what they believe to be the newspaper 's archives ( a hardrive ) and a typewriter ( laptop ) " for evidence " .
* * * * *
The story might end there , but 12 hours after the police raid , on Wednesday the 25th of March , the German Cabinet announced the completion of a proposed law for a nationwide , mandatory censorship system -- to be pushed through before national elections in September , 2009 .
For every noble human desire , in this case , the strong protective feelings most adults have towards children , opportunists such as Senator Conroy and his German equivalent , CDU Minister Ursula von der Leyen , stand ready to exploit these feelings for their own power and position .
Von der Leyen apparently hopes to raise her profile before a national election by promoting a national censorship " solution " to child pornography .
But forcibly preventing the average parent from seeing evidence of what may be an abuse against a child is not the same as stopping abuses against children .
Absense of evidence is not evidence of absense .
Censoring the evidence promotes abuses by driving them underground , where they are difficult to track .
Such schemes divert resources and political will away from proven policing solutions which target producers and consumers .
Children depend , even more than their parents , on the quality and viability of government .
An assault against those systems and ideals which keep government honest and accountable - public oversight , natural justice , and protection from state censorship - is not just an affront to Enlightment ideals , but an assult on the long term interests of children and adults alike .
The March 24th raid is not the first time the German state has attempted to censor Wikileaks ; back in December 2008 , Ernst Uhrlau , former police chief and current head of the BND , Germany 's equivalent to the CIA , threatened to prosecute the site unless it removed a BND dossier on corrupt officials in Kosovo and other information .
The dossier was not removed .
There is no evidence that the police action and the BND incident are related , but the situation , together with a recent Bundestag inquiry documenting illegal BND spying on the German press , does not paint a flattering picture of the state of German government .

( CNN ) --
The White House indicated Wednesday that a report and a photo from the controversial low - altitude New York flyover by a 747 plane used as Air Force One could be released soon .
A 911 caller on the day of the flyover said , " There 's a plane falling .
There is a big aircraft falling like 9/11 . "
Earlier , White House officials had said that there were no plans to release photos to the public .
But the tone seemed to change on Wednesday .
" The report , I believe , will be concluded at some point this week .
We 'll release its findings and release a photo , " White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said during his daily press briefing .
The review , led by Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina , will focus on " why that decision was made and to ensure that it never happens again , " Gibbs said .
The flyover , officials said , was a training mission -- it was also a government - sanctioned photo shoot .
Military officials also estimate that the mission and the photo shoot , aimed at updating file photos of Air Force One -- cost $ 328,835 in taxpayer money .
But they said " the hours would have been flown regardless , and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission . "
The photo shoot , which President Obama said he was " furious " with , happened on April 27 .
The image of a low - flying plane accompanied by an F - 16 fighter jet sent some New Yorkers into the streets and into a panic -- reminding them of the tragic 9/11 attacks on the city .
Building evacuations also took place across the Hudson River in Jersey City , New Jersey .

White House Military Office Director Louis Caldera later apologized for the flyover .
Witnesses reported seeing the plane circle over the Upper New York Bay near the Statue of Liberty before flying up the Hudson River .
Watch the plane fly over Manhattan »
A YouTube video showed people standing in a parking lot , watching the plane approach .
As it nears , they begin to run .
" Run , run ! " said one person .
" Oh my God , " cried another .
A 911 call , released later by the Hudson County Sheriff 's Department in New Jersey , illustrated the fear and panic felt by residents since the 9/11 attacks .
" There 's a plane falling .
There is a big aircraft falling like 9/11 , " a man says to the operator .
" Everybody is running and people are crying and panicking . "
CNN iReporter Tom Kruk , who saw the plane and took a photo , called the sight of the aircraft low in the sky " unsettling . "
Mayor Michael Bloomberg was visibly angry last week .
" I 'm annoyed -- furious is a better word -- that I was n't told , " he said , adding that the decision by the White House Military Office and Federal Aviation Administration to withhold details about the flight were " ridiculous " and " poor judgment . "
But according to Air Force Capt .
Anna Carpenter , local law enforcement agencies and the FAA had been notified of the exercise .
New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne confirmed that department had been alerted about the flight " with directives to local authorities not to disclose information about it . "
That decision riled local media .
" Given that we are not big on reminders of 9/11 , we could have done without the whole thing .
But the FAA outdunced itself by asking the NYPD to keep the photo op a secret , as if no one would look up and say , ' What the hell ? ' " the New York Daily News said on April 28 .
The New York Post , in its editorial on the same day , said : " The FAA had long preferred to keep passengers ignorant of these dangers .
Better to have people panic , it seems , at the sudden sight of low - flying aircraft over Lower Manhattan .

Someone needs to straighten out these folks -- quick . "
The controversy had some questioning President Obama 's declaration of a new era of openness , who on January 21 , said : " The old rules said that if there was a defensible argument for not disclosing something to the American people , then it should not be disclosed .
That era is now over . "
So why , exactly , did n't that initially apply to the photos ?
An advocate for government disclosure said it should , and that it's " silly " and " absurd " to withhold them .
Watch more on the photo flap »
" These are public records because they were done on government time , with government resources , and government personnel , " said Patrice McDermott of openthegovernment.org .
In New York , news that the photos might not be released reignited public outrage over the incident .
" It does n't seem right , " said Kurt Wallin from New Jersey .
" If we spent the money to have these photos taken , they should be available for the public to see . "
Emily Ritter from Park City , Utah , added : " I feel like maybe they 're covering it up because it 's been seen in a bad light already ... maybe they are still worried about their image and do n't want to be seen in a bad light . "

Administrators for the collapsed whitegoods supplier Kleenmaid have recommended putting the company into liquidation .
The Queensland company , which once had 20 outlets across Australia , went into voluntary administration last month .
Founded by a washing machine repairman 25 years ago , the company has been found to have debts in excess of $ 100 million .
Joint administrator John Greig from Deloitte says no creditors - including former employees , customers , suppliers or banks - are likely to get their money back .
Mr Greig says 4,500 customers have been left in the lurch .
" We consider that the Kleenmaid group has been insolvent from around about June 2007 , if not earlier , " he told ABC Radio 's The World Today .
" Unfortunately , the outcome for creditors is likely to be particularly bleak in the sense that we are estimating that there will be no funds or any dividend available to creditors of any kind in across the whole Kleenmaid group . "
He says Deloitte has not received any proposal for a deed of company arrangement from the directors .
" That being the case , we can only recommend and have recommended that the companies in the group should be wound up at the forthcoming creditors meeting in Brisbane next Monday , " he said .
He says the company 's level of debt is far worse than first thought .
" Initially in the few days after our appointment , we were indicating that the creditor position was in the order of $ 70 million to $ 80 million , " he said .
" We have now found that it is slightly in excess of $ 100 million . "
Millions owed
The collapsed Sunshine Coast company , owned by brothers Andrew and Bradley Young , now owes customers a total of $ 27 million for deposits made on kitchen appliances they never received .
Major creditors , primarily Westpac , are owed $ 29 million .
Suppliers in places including the United States and Europe are owed $ 16 million .
A total of 150 former Kleenmaid employees are also out of work and out of pocket to the tune of $ 3 million .
Mr Greig says it is thought the company has been trading while insolvent for quite some time .
" Whilst our investigations have been exhaustive , as administrators it is only preliminary in the time that we have had to do it , " he said .
" There is much further work that a liquidator would do if appointed at this second meeting , but certainly what we have seen is obviously from a balance sheet point of view , this substantial deficiency of $ 82 million which is , as I said , that deficiency has been around for some time .
" It was also stress from creditor demands and so on that go back to that period as well .
So there are some of the issues that we have identified in our investigations . "
Consequences
He says the Young brothers could face serious consequences if it is proven the company traded during insolvency .
" Potentially what can happen is that they can be held to be personally liable themselves for the debts of the group that were incurred during that period of insolvent trading , " he said .
" That is the one outcome , and if the issue is considered to be serious enough by the regulators , meaning ASIC , then there could also be criminal prosecutions in relation to insolvent trading . "
JERUSALEM , Jan 5 ( Reuters ) - People in Gaza were in dire need of food and medical supplies , aid agencies said on Monday , but Israel 's ground assault and air raids were hampering relief efforts .
Freezing cold is compounding the misery of children caught in the conflict .
And body bags for victims are in short supply .
" The situation in Gaza since the Israel Defense Forces launched their ground offensive on Saturday night has become both chaotic and extremely dangerous , " the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a situation report .
Air raids had damaged hospitals , water supply systems , government buildings and mosques but it was difficult for ICRC staff to move around to assist , it said .
About 530 Palestinians have been killed , at least a quarter of them civilians , since Israel launched its offensive on Dec. 27 to curtail Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza .
Ground troops invaded the enclave , home to 1.5 million Palestinians , on Saturday night after a week of bombardments from the air and from naval vessels .
Hospitals were inundated with Palestinian wounded , the ICRC said .
Fresh supplies were urgently needed , including painkillers and anaesthetics but also body bags and sheets to wrap corpses .
The hospitals were relying on generators for electricity because of damage to the main power system but they can break down at any time .
An ICRC surgical team was due to move into Gaza on Monday to help surgeons after waiting for several days in Jerusalem for permission from Israeli authorities .
" We are seriously concerned about the reports we are receiving with regard to civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects , " said Pierre Wettach , ICRC chief for Israel and the Palestinian territories .
Work on the ground was also perilous for medics .
Three paramedics and three volunteers have been killed so far and planes have bombed the Health Care Union in Gaza City and destroyed four ambulances , Palestinian medical officials said .
The Palestinian Red Crescent said the combat had prevented ambulance staff from responding to many calls .
On Sunday , a pregnant woman in Zeitoun in northern Gaza had to be taken to hospital on a donkey cart but did not make it in time .
The baby was stillborn and she suffered a ruptured uterus .
Save the Children staff began to deliver food aid to families on Sunday but air assaults and ground fighting made it dangerous for staff , the agency said in a statement .
" The situation has reached a critical level for children who are exposed to and experiencing violence , fear and uncertainty , " Save the Children emergency team leader Annie Foster said .
Some families fear to leave their houses while others are being forced to flee them .
The winter cold was also a danger to children as electricity cuts have mean many homes lack heating .
" Families must leave windows open at night so that they will not be broken by percussive shocks or flying debris from the ongoing bombardment .
This means that children , the majority of them poor and malnourished , are essentially spending the night exposed to the elements , " Foster said .
Israel has accused Hamas of sheltering among the civilian population and using sites such as mosques and schools as military posts .
It has allowed some convoys of trucks with food and fuel to enter the blockaded enclave .
At least three children were among a dozen Palestinian civilians killed on Monday .
Since the fighting began , 59 children have been killed , Palestinian health officials say .

Sox Jump on Twins in Afternoon Romp
BLOOMFIELD , Conn . 
“ Hi ya , young fella . ”
Babe Ruth greeted Arthur Giddon as he did most 13 - year - olds , even those in uniform .
Giddon chatted with the Babe for a moment but tore himself away because he had a job to do .
It was 1922 , and as a Boston Braves bat boy , Giddon had to break out the bats , polish some spikes and otherwise outfit his players for that afternoon ’s game at Braves Field .
Eighty - seven years later , on Saturday , Giddon will reprise his role for his now - beloved Red Sox  as a special 100th birthday present , he will serve as the team ’s honorary bat boy prior to the game against the rival Yankees .
The same hands that delivered bats to Billy Southworth and softened Rube Marquard ’s glove will do the same for Kevin Youkilis and Jon Lester .
Now at bat boy for the Red Sox : No. 100 , Big Pappy .
“ I ’m going to do whatever they tell me to do , like any good bat boy , ” Giddon said in his home in Bloomfield , a suburb of Hartford , before referring to the Boston leadoff hitter Jacoby Ellsbury .
“ I ’m hoping that after Ellsbury gets the first hit I can go out and grab his bat , but I do n’t think they ’re going to allow me to do that . ”
Sure enough , liability issues will keep Giddon , however sprightly and willing , from serving as a bat boy during the game .
But the Red Sox and Manager Terry Francona are delighted to have him help out during batting practice .
Airline pilots are to become the first group to refuse to take part in the national identity scheme when compulsory trials start at Manchester and London City airports this autumn .
The British Airline Pilots ' Association ( Balpa ) , which represents more than 80 % of commercial airline pilots , is to mount a legal challenge to Home Office plans to use " critical " airside workers as the first compulsory " guinea pigs " for the scheme .
MPs are shortly to be asked to approve the powers to compel the pilots and other airside workers at the two airports to register for the national ID card scheme as part of their " pre-employment " checks .
The £ 30 fee is to be waived as an incentive for them to sign up .
The pilots ' union has protested to ministers that the £ 18 m scheme cannot be regarded as voluntary when they are being told they will not qualify for an " airside pass " without them : " ID cards will have absolutely no value as far as security is concerned .
This is nothing other than coercion and promises that ID cards would be voluntary have been broken , " Jim McAuslan , Balpa general secretary , has told ministers .
" We will resist . "
These behind the scenes preparations and the recent signing of two 10 - year contracts worth £ 650 m to get the ID cards programme under way undermine recent speculation that the cabinet is considering axing the scheme as part of the general Whitehall spending squeeze .
The speculation took off when a suggestion by David Blunkett , the former home secretary , that the ID card programme should be repackaged as a biometric passport scheme to reassure the public was misintepreted as him turning against the idea .
But the details of the two contracts awarded in the last few weeks show just how far the ID cards scheme has become embedded in the introduction of " biometric " passports .
For 80 % of British citizens their identity card will be their passport .
The Home Office describes the two contracts as " bringing the largescale deployment of ID cards a step closer " .
The first contract , worth £ 385 m and awarded to a US computer company , CSC , will cover processing applications for passports and ID cards and dealing with any subsequent changes in personal details .
The second contract , awarded to IBM , and worth £ 265 m , is to build and run the database that will store the digital fingerprints and facial images for the ID scheme and the new generation of passports .
The decision to combine what the Home Office calls the core elements of the ID cards programme and the modernisation of the passports means it will be difficult for any incoming government after the general election to cancel the ID scheme separately .
Two further contracts will be awarded this year for the design and production of identity cards and the next generation of passports to be introduced from 2011 .
Video : Bear rescue
Abused bear in China ( Image : Sipa Press / Rex Features )
See a gallery of images of bear rescue and rehabilitation at a Chinese centre
JASPER is an Asiatic black bear , also known as a moon bear because of the yellow crescent on his chest .
In 2000 he came to the Animals Asia Moon Bear Rescue Centre in Chengdu , China , from a bear farm .
When Jasper arrived his rescuers had to cut him out of a tiny “ crush cage ” that pinned him down so the farmer could extract lucrative bile from his gall bladder .
Bear bile is used in traditional Chinese medicine and fetches a tidy price .
In China , the wholesale price is around 4000 yuan ( approximately $ 580 ) per kilogram ; each bear produces up to 5 kilograms a year .
But it comes at terrible cost .
Jasper spent 15 years in his cage .
Other bears spend up to 25 years in cages no bigger than their bodies , barely able to move .
Bears are milked for bile twice a day .
In China , farmers use a crude catheter inserted into the gall bladder or a permanently open wound .
In Vietnam , they use long hypodermic needles .
Over the past 10 years , Animals Asia has rescued 260 bears from Chinese bear farms .
These are the lucky ones .
The official number of farmed bears in China is 7000 , but Animals Asia fears the real figure is closer to 10,000 .
Despite its obvious cruelty , bear farming is legal in China .
While CITES , the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species , lists Asiatic black bears at the highest level of endangerment , China grants them only …
( OrganicJar ) Green tea has been consumed for more than four thousand years and is possibly the closest thing to a miracle drink .
It has numerous properties that render it extremely beneficial for the human body and many research studies have shown drinking green tea lowers cholesterol , decreases and inhibits cancer cells , reduces appetite and strengthens the immune system .
Here are just some of the many amazing benefits of drinking green tea .
EGCG , a compound in green tea , inhibits an enzyme required for cancer cell growth and can kill cultured cancer cells with no ill effect on healthy cells .
Green tea has been shown to reduce the risk of esophageal cancer , breast cancer , colon cancer , prostate cancer and cervical cancer .
Its high concentration of antioxidants help lower LDL cholesterol ( bad ) , raise HDL cholesterol ( good ) and improve the overall cholesterol ratio .
Properties in green tea are very effective in breaking down plaque on artery walls and preventing the formation of blood clots .
This helps prevent atherosclerosis , particularly coronary artery disease .
Polyphenols and polysaccharides found in green tea assist in lowering blood sugar and help prevent the development of type 1 diabetes and slow the progression once it has developed .
Regular consumption of green tea helps in boosting fat oxidation and metabolism , by speeding up your body 's calorie burning process .
Its antibacterial and antiviral properties help fight skin problems , including acne .
Applied directly to the skin ( or consumed ) it helps block sun triggered skin cancer .
It improves your teeth by reducing and preventing decay .
It is also a natural antiseptic that relieves itching and swelling .
Its large amount of antioxidants fight the free radical damage to brain nerves seen in Alzheimer 's and Parkinson's .
Do n't forget that green tea must be consumed only when it is freshly brewed , otherwise most of its therapeutic properties and nutritional values will be lost .
That 's why bottled green tea is considered to have very little amount of therapeutic resources .
Generally , green tea must be steeped for about 3 - 4 minutes and adding a squeeze of lemon helps keep the nutritional properties from breaking down too fast .
Try some green tea for your health !

US airstrikes kill scores of civilians in Afghanistan
By Bill Van Auken
6 May 2009
On the eve of a tripartite summit in Washington which the Obama administration has organized with the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan , reports from Afghanistan indicate that US air strikes in western Farah province have killed and wounded scores of civilians , many of them women and children .
Villagers from the remote Bala Baluk district near the Iranian border put the death toll as high as 150 , according to local government officials .
According to accounts from the region , US forces battling insurgents who had moved into the area called in air strikes .
A bomb struck mud -brick houses in the village of Gerani , where civilians had taken refuge from the fighting .
A provincial council member in Farah province , Abdul Basir Khan , told the Associated Press that villagers had brought truckloads of mangled corpses of bombing victims to the provincial capital to prove that women and children had been slaughtered in the US attack .
The official said that villagers had gathered in front of the local government office , crying and shouting .
" It was difficult to count [ the bodies ] because they were in very bad shape , ” said Khan , adding , “ Some had no legs . ”
Villagers told him that 150 people had been killed , he said .
“ These houses that were full of children and women and elders were bombed by planes , ” Mohammad Mieem Qadderdan , a former top regional official who had witnessed the carnage , told the media .
“ It is very difficult to say how many were killed because nobody can count the number .
People are digging through rubble with shovels and hands . ”
The spokesman for the US occupation forces in Afghanistan , Col. Greg Julian , acknowledged that US forces had fought a battle in the area and reported that wounded Afghans had sought medical treatment at a military base in Farah .
“ We offer our condolences to those affected by today 's operations and will immediately investigate the claims to determine what happened , ” he said in a pro forma statement .
Qadderdan said that the death toll was “ worse than Azizabad , ” referring to a US air strike last year that killed at least 90 Afghan civilians , two - thirds of them children , in the western province of Herat .
He estimated the death toll in this latest air strike at “ more than 100 ” and said that ten houses had been destroyed .
In the Azizabad incident , US warplanes targeted a large crowd that had gathered near a local airfield to commemorate the 40th day since the death of a local leader .
The US military initially claimed that all those killed had been participating in a meeting of Taliban militants .
Reports and photographic evidence from the scene , however , exposed this claim as a lie .
The civilian death toll was confirmed by the Afghan government , the United Nations and human rights groups .
In the wake of the mass killing in Azizabad , Afghan President Hamid Karzai attempted to assuage popular anger in Afghanistan and deflect it from his own puppet regime by denouncing the killings and demanding that the American military stop targeting civilians .
For its part , the Pentagon vowed to exercise greater care .
General David McKiernan , senior US commander in Afghanistan , issued a directive to US forces last September calling for American forces to be more discriminatory in the use of firepower .
At the same time , however , the US commander blamed the insurgents for the killings carried out by the US military , claiming that they purposely “ mixed in with the population . ”
This is the same charge leveled by every army engaged in a colonial occupation and counterinsurgency warfare to justify mass killings .
The reality is that the insurgents are drawn from the population , living among and drawing support from it .
The directive did nothing to halt the bloodletting .
According to a report issued by the United Nations in February , the number of civilians killed in Afghanistan rose 40 percent to a record 2,118 last year .
Many of the dead were victims of US air strikes , which are regularly called in by American ground units that find themselves outmaneuvered by Afghan fighters , who enjoy the advantage of battling in their own land .
Karzai , speaking before the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington on Tuesday , made a general reference to civilian casualties , but said nothing about the latest bombing .
He counseled that the success of the US intervention in Afghanistan depended upon “ making sure absolutely that Afghans do n't suffer — that Afghan civilians are protected . ”
“ This war against terrorism will succeed only if we fight it from a higher platform of morality , ” he said in his speech .
“ We must be conducting this war as better human beings . ”
Such appeals for “ morality ” serve merely as a cover for what is universally acknowledged among Western military circles to be preparations for a major escalation of the killing in Afghanistan .
The Pentagon is in the midst deploying another 21,000 troops to the occupied country as part of a “ surge ” ordered by the Obama administration that will more than double the number of US troops to 68,000 .
As British Brigadier David Hook , the deputy commander of the NATO - led force in the south of Afghanistan , told the Reuters news agency last week , “ It 's going to be a bloody summer , ” as the US forces begin combat operations in the region .
Hook also predicted a spike in casualties for the US - led occupation forces .
A total of 1,140 US and other NATO troops have been killed in Afghanistan since the beginning of the war in October 2001 .
Nearly 400 fatalities have been recorded since the beginning of last year , as resistance to the occupation and armed attacks on foreign troops have risen sharply .
While escalating the US intervention in Afghanistan , the Obama administration is also exerting growing pressure on the government of Pakistan to suppress Islamist insurgents in its North West Frontier Province and Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) .
This is apparently going to be the main thrust of the meetings between Obama , Karzai and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari , which begin tomorrow .
On the eve of these meetings , Richard Holbrooke , the US special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , indicated that Washington would demand an escalation of the military operations being conducted by the Pakistani army in the border region .
“ We need to put the most heavy possible pressure on our friends in Pakistan to join us in the fight against the Taliban and its allies , ” Holbrooke told the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tuesday .
“ We cannot succeed in Afghanistan without Pakistan 's support and involvement . ”
The Pakistani military has launched a new offensive in the northwestern Swat Valley , calling on the residents to flee the area before the fighting erupts .
In February , Islamabad essentially ceded the valley to the Taliban and agreed to the imposition of Islamic sharia law as part of a peace deal that Washington condemned as capitulation to the Islamists .
The move by the Taliban to take over Buner , a district just 60 miles from Islamabad , triggered a response from the army , acting under pressure from Washington .
The Pakistani military used helicopter gunships , jet fighters and commando units in an attempt to drive the armed Islamists out of the area .
Government officials estimate the renewed confrontation in the Swat Valley could drive another half a million Pakistanis from their homes into already crowded and under - equipped refugee camps .
The Taliban , however , is reportedly continuing resistance in Buner and has established firm control over the Swat region .
Previous attempts by the Pakistani military to wrest control of the area from the insurgents ended in failure , giving rise to the peace agreement .
A bill submitted to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Monday calls for tripling US aid to Pakistan to $ 1.5 billion annually for the next five years .
The legislation , titled the “ Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 , ” conditions the aid on the Pakistani military taking concerted action to prevent “ terrorist groups ” from operating inside the country and specifically to prevent the Taliban from finding safe haven on Pakistani soil for operations inside Afghanistan .
The escalation launched by the Obama administration is aimed at salvaging the imperialist project initiated under Bush : the assertion of American hegemony in the strategic region of Central Asia .
Its effect is the further destabilization of the entire region , creating the conditions for even greater military catastrophes .
It ’s most obvious with non-native speakers of English .
Despite knowing more about English grammar than most native speakers and having a broad recognition vocabulary , they often continue to struggle to construct a workable English sentence .
Why ?
Here are some excerpts from a 1985 Donald Hall essay in Newsweek titled “ Bring Back the Out - Loud Culture . ”
“ When we stopped memorizing and reciting literature , our ability to read started its famous decline .
It was the loss of recitation – not its replacements ( radio , film , television ) – that diminished our literacy . ”
“ If when we read silently we do not hear a text , we slide past words passively , without making decisions … . ”
“ In the old Out - Loud Culture , print was always potential speech ; even silent readers too shy to read aloud , inwardly heard the sound of words .
Their culture identified print and voice .
Everyone ’s ability to read was enhanced by recitation .
Then we read aggressively ; then we demanded sense … ”
“ As children speak poems and stories aloud , by the pitch and muscle of their voices they will discover drama , humor , passion and intelligence in print . ”
As children – and adults – speak poems , stories , essays , and even well - written news articles and business reports aloud , they also hear the natural syntax , phrasing , and rhythm of English .
They learn it as music , and just as song lyrics float around in the mind ready to be called upon when needed , this memorized syntax and phrasing will sit upon the tongue when we write .
Most people think reading is the best training for writing , but we write with our ear , not our eye .
We voice our sentences onto the page , and the more we train our ears , the better – clearer , more powerful , more dramatic , more musical – our sentencing will be .
Reading silently can help us become better editors , help us spot what looks wrong on the page .
But as Donald Hall suggests , most silent readers “ slide past words passively . ”
They pick up some meaning from the words ( rarely demanding sense ) but hear none of the power or nuance or even basic correctness .
They do n’t hear what sounds bad and what sounds good .
That ’s why so much business and government writing is so awful .
It is n’t that the writers are n’t educated or do n’t care enough to take the time to do a good job .
They simply do n’t have a trained ear .
Wrote Russell Baker in How to Punctuate , “ When you write , you make a sound in the reader ’s head .
It can be a dull mumble – that ’s why so much government prose makes you sleepy — or it can be a joyful noise , a sly whisper , a throb of passion . ”
If you ca n’t hear it , you ca n’t write it .
Even native - speaking adults can improve their ear for the music of English .
It ’s never too late .
To train your ear , pick the best examples of the type of writing you want to do and read them aloud .
Hear the music — the richness and variety in the sentencing .
Then start reading all sorts of things aloud , and hear the difference .
Hear and see the tangled , twisted sentence .
Hear and see the difference between dull and dramatic repetition .
Then read your own writing aloud .
Beyond helping us write sentences that are more natural , musical , and correct , reading aloud helps us “ read aggressively and demand sense . ”
Only then will we begin to write the same way , examining our sentences to ensure the words work together efficiently to make sense .
This clarity is all the more important today as busy writers communicate in short emails , brief blogs , and 140 - character Twitter bursts , while busy readers attempt to consume far more than they can stomach in a day .
Whether you ’re goal is correctness , clarity , or power , reading aloud will help .

The number of viable web browsers in the Linux ecosystem has declined in recent years , but it still has more than a dozen viable options .
However , given the centrality of a browser to the modern computing experience , your mileage with the most common browsers depends on the Linux distribution and your preferred use cases .
We highlight nine of the best and worst browsers in alphabetical order by product name .
Some browsers are tied to specific window managers .
The performance of your Linux distribution may vary for these browsers .
01 of 09 Brave What We Like Excellent design aesthetic .
Focus on end - user privacy and security .
What We Don't Like
The company 's roadmap for ads feels like it 's capitulated to the ad industry .
Unclear that browser - based micropayments will substitute for site ad revenue .
A relatively new browser with open - source credentials and a slick design , Brave offers an ad - free and tracker - free browser experience .
Highly compliant with standards , the most interesting aspect of Brave is its focus ( with its Browser Attention Token and funding model ) on paying sites for content .
With Brave Wallet , you fund a digital wallet to anonymously tip publishers that are signed up with Brave .
You can also offer monthly contributions out of your wallet .
Brave intends for this kind of behavior to substitute for display - ad revenue for sites that are genuinely popular with readers .

02 of 09 Chrome What We Like Officially supported by Google .
Well - integrated with the Google application ecosystem .
What We Don't Like Offered through RPM and DEB packages only , and in 64 - bit versions only .
Installation can be tricky .
The license agreement is n't aligned with FOSS principles .
The Google Chrome browser works as well on Linux as it does on other platforms .
If you 're all - in with the Google ecosystem , installing Chrome is a no-brainer .
If you like the underlying engine but not the business model , the Chromium open - source project may be an appealing alternative .
However , Chrome is only half - heartedly developed for Linux .
Google officially releases two 64 - bit binaries in RPM and DEB packages .

03 of 09 Chromium Bogdan Vija / EyeEm / Getty What We Like Open - source root for browsers like Chrome .
Continuously updated .
What We Don't Like More complicated installation procedure .
Not as fully featured as Chrome .
Chromium is the open - source browser engine at the heart of browsers like Google Chrome and , soon , Microsoft Edge .
However , it 's less often used as a daily browser ( except by tech - savvy developers ) and instead as a platform for future development .
Nothing precludes you from installing Chromium .
Some Linux distributions include versions of Chromium in their app repositories .
However , Chrome and Chromium do not enjoy feature parity .
Google adds extra capabilities into Chrome that it does n't add to Chromium , including some video - rendering tools .

04 of 09 Firefox What We Like Fast and full - featured .
Optimized for Linux .
What We Don't Like Occasionally delays start - up with update checks .
The user interface design is clunky but improving .
For most Linux power users , Firefox is the browser of choice .
It 's fast and full - featured , standards - compliant , and welcomes a rich ecosystem of browser extensions and themes .
Plus , the sync utility keeps different Firefox installations synchronized , including mobile versions .
If you need a regular daily browser , Firefox is an excellent choice .

05 of 09 Konqueror What We Like Built into KDE .
File system browsing .
What We Don't Like Barely maintained .
Increasingly unable to work with emerging web technologies .
Once upon a time , Konqueror was the go - to browser on Linux .
In recent years , however , the browser is n't as popular with Linux users .
Although it 's still available on KDE - based distributions , the browser can't quite keep up .
Nevertheless , it 's a decent go - to if you need to check a simple site in an alternative browser or to explore the contents of your file system .
Download Konqueror
06 of 09 Lynx What We Like Text only , so no ads or trackers .
Fast and efficient for keyboard - based browsing .
What We Don't Like
Only one active browsing window at a time .
Modern sites do n't render well in text - based browsers .
In the earliest days of the World Wide Web , the default method of browsing the web involved a text - based browser .
Most people do n't use tools like Lynx anymore , but the browser is still actively developed .
It 's a great resource for people accustomed to working in plain text .
The only caveat is that modern sites tend to render in a goofy fashion .
For example , a WordPress site with a sidebar might show all the sidebar content and then show the page or post content .
The problem is n't so much with Lynx or its siblings , as it is with evolving site - design standards that promote aesthetics over semantic rigor .

07 of 09 Opera What We Like Innovative approach with its VPN .
Does n't look or act like a Chrome or Firefox clone .
What We Don't Like Less - developed extension ecosystem .
Ships as 64 - bit RPM and DEB packages only .
Among the up - and - comer browsers , Opera has found a soft spot with power users .
It 's full - featured , with an emphasis on connectivity , and has a VPN .
The default left sidebar opens features like personalized news , Facebook Messenger , bookmarks , the Speed Dial , and similar tools .
The Flow feature syncs with mobile Opera to promote seamless hand - offs of data between devices .
Opera is a good , stable browser that has n't found the market share it deserves .

08 of 09 Vivaldi What We Like Insane amount of customization .
Extra tools like a Notes feature add to the browser 's overall utility .
What We Don't Like Imperfect standards implementation ; some sites freeze in Vivaldi that do n't freeze in other browsers .
Powerful customization tools do n't come with bumper guards .
Experienced users will thrive , but inexperienced users may be frustrated with the proliferating options .
Vivaldi is like Opera .
It 's a great browser that does n't have a large market share , although both enjoy a devoted following of power users .
Vivaldi's claim to fame is its insanely high degree of customization .
Things like the toolbar can move around the browser window .

Recent events in Pakistan have shaken up the international community .
The Obama administration , which had been promoting its idea of building up Pakistan by throwing $ 15 billion at it over the next few years , was rudely awakened by the Pakistan government 's deal with Taliban allowing them virtual control over the Swat valley .
The blows kept on coming , with suicide attacks in different parts of Pakistan , some of them blatantly on the security forces of the country .
The culmination of all of these was the news that the Taliban had started occupying and claiming regions of the Buner district , only a hundred kilometres from Islamabad .
Now , international reaction has been limited to asking Pakistan to rein in Taliban and take all the necessary military action against it .
Till now , Pakistan has just been making peace deals and effectively ceding territory to Taliban , without undertaking any military confrontation .
Analysts believe that the Pakistani Army is unwilling to do so because they dont know how to fight this guerilla warfare .
In all their period of existence , they have been trained to fight a conventional war against India .
Fighting a counter - insurgency is not their cup of tea .
Another possible reason could be the army doesnt want to fight its own people .
The Pakistani Army gets about 30 % of its soldiers from the Pashtun tribal areas .
Almost all of its Frontier Guards come from these areas .
These soldiers may be unwilling to pick arms against their own people .
Third possible reason is that the Army doesnt see this as a war IT needs to fight .
The army has become wary due to almost a decade of fighting a war that it never wanted to fight in the first place .
This , to them , was and is an " American war " .
This , coupled with the high anti-American sentiment in Pakistan and the whole of the Muslim world , makes it enormously difficult for the Army to lauch a full fledged operation against the Taliban .
So there are reports that the Taliban may be retreating from the Buner district .
This happened after another rounds of dialog between General Ashfaque Kiyani and Sufi Muhammad , the cleric from the Swat Valley .
No war , no force used here , just talks .
I really do not think this peace is real or is going to last for long .
Buner is part of the Malakand province , which is a very hilly region .
The region has a terrain very similar to the Swat valley , and is ideal for fighting a guerilla war , which the Taliban has become an expert in .
Now , Taliban vociferously claims that it wants to make the whole of Pakistan a Sharia state , but thats not realistically possible .
The might of the Pakistani army is no match for Taliban , more so in the flat plains of Punjab .
Hence , it can never cross over beyond Buner , lest the Pakistani army might launch a full fledged attack as a final act of desperation .
The logical thing for Taliban to do is fortify its own territory , a territory it is familiar with , where it is comfortable fighting .
And the entire territory of the Malakand region perfectly fits those criteria .
It is highly unlikely that Taliban will actually leave Buner .
And even if it did , it needs to be realised that Buner is just one of the district in the region .
Several other districts bordering the Swat district have reported Taliban presence .
It is going to extremely difficult , almost impossible , to get rid of the Taliban in these districts in the near future .
While signing the Swat peace deal , the Pakistani government virtually handed over the region to Taliban on a platter .
The only solution now is to strengthen the frontiers of whatever remains and ensure the violence doesnt spread to the south , to cities like Peshawar .
It also makes sense in this case to rethink the aid given by the US Government to Pakistan .
A majority of this aid was supposed to go the strengthen the infrastructure of the border regions , more specifically the FATA and the NWFP .
Since the NWFP is controlled by Taliban and since Pakistani government has no control over the region , it is senseless to waste all that taxpayer money on that region .
Taliban is like a cancer , or a virus , if you will .
A cancer is much more manageable when it is contained and benign .
The moment it becomes metastatic , it becomes nearly impossible to control .
Taliban has now not only spread in the NWFP , but it also has presence in major Pakistani cities and the ability to conduct bomb blasts there .
It is slowly morphing into a metastatic cancer .
It is very necessary here to contain Taliban as quickly as possible by establishing a Line - of - Control between NWFP and the rest of Pakistan , and here is where the argument of Partition of Pakistan again comes in .

Police are searching for a gang of radical environmental activists after a series of attacks on 4x4 vehicles .
The gang , who claim to have targeted up to 80 vehicles across South Manchester , let down tyres and leave notes accusing the owners of adding to global warming and increasing the chances of road deaths .
In the last week tyres on 20 vehicles were slashed or deflated in the Ladybarn and Withington of the city .
This follows similar attacks on 11 cars last month .
Police classify the deliberate acts as criminal damage .

A statement from the activists said tyres were deflated rather than slashed .
It added : " Given the threat of climate change and the Government 's inaction , direct action such as this is , unfortunately , necessary .
Large SUVs ( Sports Utility Vehicles ) emit substantially more greenhouse gases . "
The statement also said accident victims were six times more likely to die if hit by an SUV rather than a smaller car .
Owners of SUVs – dubbed Chelsea tractors – have been branded irresponsible by environmentalists , for their vehicles ' size and fuel consumption .
Critics say the large four - wheel drive vehicles were originally intended for use by farmers on rough terrain in the countryside .
But they have become popular with middle - class families living in cities and are used for school runs and shopping trips .
Patricia and Waris Ashraf had a tyre let down on their Mercedes ML outside their house in Whalley Range , making their daughter Natasha , 16 , late for an A - level exam .
A victim from Chorlton , who would not be named , said : " What concerns me most is that we have a child seat in the back of the car .
They must have seen that , which suggests they do n't care who they affect . "
Doug McMillan , whose tyres were attacked in Parrs Wood , Didsbury , last week , said : " If they ever did have a noble , credible cause , they have blown it because they have reduced themselves to the status of common criminals .
They are vandals , nothing else . "
A member of the group calling himself James said : " These vehicles are totally unsuitable for the city , they 're dangerous , polluting and an unnecessary status symbol .
They should not be on our city roads . "
Detective Inspector Damian Moran , from Greater Manchester Police , said : " Those responsible might believe they are making a point , but this behaviour is criminal .
" It is mindless vandalism with no regard for the distress and nuisance caused to decent members of our community and will not be tolerated .
" If anyone knows anything or has seen anything suspicious during those two nights that might help us catch those responsible , please contact me . "

Transcendentalism Of The Beatles : The Ideas Of The Beatles

protest against the state of culture and society in the 1800’s .
These Transcendentalist had new forms of principles that they followed ( like like the ideas of nature , individualism , and self reliance ) and they based their live off of these ideas .
The Beatles had connected to these same ideas through their many songs and albums for over a decade .
This band formed in the 1960 ’s in Liverpool England , they built their fame by starting out playing at clubs and bars around Liverpool .
There were four people
In a recent court battle , among other things L'Oreal argued that eBay could prevent the sale of counterfeit items through its site and was therefore jointly liable for offenses committed by its users .
The UK High Court disagreed and ruled in eBay 's favor .
We take a look at the case through a BitTorrent prism .
On Friday the High Court ruled that online auction site eBay is not liable when fake beauty products are sold to the public by its users via the site .
Justice Richard David Arnold ruled that eBay could not be held liable for trademark infringements committed by its users , dealing a further blow to cosmetics company L’Oreal who had hoped to put an end to the activity in the UK after failing to do so last week in the French courts .
Since there appear to be some parallels with this case and the various BitTorrent sites and their users , we thought we ’d take a closer look .
This is n’t an in - depth legal analysis , but a look at the case as a layman , through a Mininova - shaped file - sharing prism .
Clearly some of eBay ’s users were committing trademark infringement by selling counterfeit L’Oreal products , as much was never denied by eBay .
It could also be argued that many users of torrent sites are breaching the copyrights of various companies when they engage in illicit file - sharing of their products .
The focus of the L’Oreal case was how eBay should deal with these infringements .
Usually a brand owner would see the fake items for sale on eBay and make a request for the auction to be removed , which eBay would have no problem with .
Equally , if a copyright holder sees a torrent on Mininova ( or any other BitTorrent site ) that could lead to a copyright infringement of its products , they can contact the site and have it removed too .
But for trademark and copyright holders , this takedown proces can prove to be a time consuming task .
As soon as one auction is investigated and shut down , more take its place .
Similarly , as soon as one torrent is removed , users upload more to replace it .
The whole process has the permanence of spinning plates , something which copyright and trademark holders are n’t happy with .
In the case of eBay , L’Oreal tried to get the court to do something about this situation , arguing that the online auctioneer could stop the listing of fake products on its site , something akin to a ‘ trademark infringement filter ’ .
They argued that that in its absence , eBay was jointly liable for the trademark infringements of its users .
Over in The Netherlands , anti-piracy outfit BREIN feels that Mininova should take a similar approach by filtering out copyright works pro-actively , something which it hopes to force on the site through the courts , despite some voluntary overtures by the site recently .
Unfortunately for L’Oreal , they failed to convince the UK High Court that eBay should be responsible for policing its auctions , with the judge confirming that it is the responsibility of the brand owner to monitor and report suspect auctions in order to have them removed .
This type of system has parallels with current DMCA - style takedown requests used to remove infringing content from torrent sites .
Had eBay failed it could have been forced to introduce proactive new measures to stop or at least massively hinder the sale of trademark - infringing goods via its site .
The company must be breathing a collective sigh of relief that it will not be expected to be judge , jury and responsible for every auction listed on its site , and the activities of its users .
Although siding with eBay , Judge Arnold made some suggestions of actions the auction site could take to deal with future sales of counterfeit goods .
One of these non-binding measures included logging the names and addresses of sellers .
He noted that although eBay could probably do more to stop these infringements , it does not necessarily follow that it is legally obliged to do so .
So what will happen when the Mininova case goes to court in June – will it be forced to do what eBay avoided and pro-actively remove infringing items from its index ?
Will Mininova ’s eBay - style “ notice and takedown ” policy be enough or will it be required ( or not ) to do more ?
Stay tuned …

There 's a phrase for something which most people believe , even if they 've never consciously considered it : " zero sum game , " and it refers to the idea that in life , just as in the game " Monopoly , " one can only gain stuff ( hotels , railroads , dinner , sex ) by getting that stuff from ( or before ) some other player , as there is only a given amount of stuff to go around .
Somehow or other this appears to be an obvious truth , so obvious that one would have to be an idiot to even question it .
But , if you will , let me throw out some pictures for your enjoyment .
First we might look at the " Garden of Eden , " which even if it did not exist , will still provide an excellent example .
Here you have a man and a woman and some serpents and apple trees and probably flowers ( it is a garden , after all ! ) and streams , hills , valleys , meadows , clouds and sunshine .
Regardless of the specific details , I imagine that anyone will agree that on some level or another , that early existence on this planet was much simpler than it is now , and that the picture we 've seen is likely near enough to that reality for the sake of argument .
Okay ?
Now let 's consider Hong Kong .
( Whew !
That was a rush , was n't it ? )
And Omaha .
Prague .
And so on .
What diversity !
Let me ask you . . . if life is a zero sum game , if all of the stuff that 's here has always existed and is just being rearranged by trading amongst the players , where was all of this stuff when Adam and Eve were frolicking in connubial bliss ( lucky them ) ?
Oh , it was all here , you may say , but it was just in different forms then .
The cars were still minerals in the rocks and sap in the tire trees , and the computers were in dinosaur - juice pools deep in the earth .
It was all there , do n't you see ? . . .
Well , yes I do .
But let me ask you -- how well do you think Eve was able to blog with her friends with all of those computer molecules stuck in that black ooze ?
You know the line about beauty , how it's in the eye of the beholder ?
Well the exact same truth pertains to wealth .
To the Canadian having a mid-winter escape party with Hawaiian shirts and ukulele music , spiced up with pi'a coladas , a coconut is an extravagant party favor .
To the South Sea islander napping beneath his tall fronded tree , it 's just another god damned coconut .
He might even pay you to get rid of them so they do n't fall on his head .
That pool of bubbling crude which was such a mess for early farmers to deal with when it oozed up on their property is something altogether different to someone who has a factory capable of making polystyrene out of it .
With polystyrene you can make Styrofoam coolers and keep your food from spoiling for days , long enough to transport it to places where the natives have never even seen an oyster before .
So you are dealing with the same molecules from the same dead dinosaurs ( or mineral processes or whatever ) but you have now put them together in combinations which never existed before and put them to new uses for which no one even knew they wanted them until they 'd had their first inland oyster feast .
What does " wealth " mean ?
Wealth is not stuff for the sake of stuff .
Just ask the South Sea islander who 's just been beaned by a falling coconut .
No , wealth is having stuff that makes your life better .
Igloo coolers , beer , being able to comment on your friend 's blog with your computer , feeding your children healthy , fresh fruits in the middle of the winter in a snug and warm home .
This is wealth .
Wealth is not money .
Wealth is the ability to have the things which make your life better , whether that is medicine ( and her favorite doll ) for your sick child , or a cigar and a good hooker .
And the thing that is so important to recognize is that , just like beauty , it is in the eye of the beholder .
If your beloved is sick , or sad , or hungry , no amount of cigars and hookers will equal wealth to you , even if they are bathing in one of Trump 's penthouse hot tubs .
Of course your daughter 's latest must - have - doll is of no value or interest to the young type - A male who 's just made the biggest deal of his life and is looking to celebrate .
No value whatsoever .
Adam .
Remember Adam ?
( It 's a song about Adam ! )
Can you see that this world , made from the same molecules and atoms as Adam walked around in , is much wealthier today than it has ever been ?
And no , I 'm not ignoring the environmental problems and other harms that exist , but really , could Adam 's world have supported even a small portion of the current world population ?
Even forgetting about flush toilets and refrigerators .
There is n't any way , would n't you agree ?
Wealth is not a fixed thing .
Do you see what I mean now when I say that wealth is not a zero sum game ?
We humans create wealth ( and we can destroy it ) .
Some animals do as well , of course , but in nowhere near the scale of the human animal .
Birds build nests , beavers build dams , and so on .
We build farms and windmills , solar panels and fine restaurants .
( Do n't forget the hot tubs and cigars ! )
And the key to all of this wealth is trading with others to get what you want while at the same time giving them what they want .
It is in this way , the idea that both sides of a voluntary transaction come away richer for having made the trade , that the wealth of the world has grown from a few apple trees to Hong Kong and pristine nature preserves , punk rock and ballet .
The same amount of atoms and molecules exist as before , but what makes more wealth is the fact that more people have more of the things that they want , that they value .
( Personally , I can do without more opera .
But that 's just me . )
In case I 've not filled in all the sky in this painting I have on the easel , think about how voluntary trade can make both the coconut farmer and the Silicon Valley entrepreneur wealthier at the same time .
Each trades what he values less for what he values more , and each comes away better off for having made the trade than beforehand .
And in its own small measure , that single trade has made the world a small bit wealthier as well .
The key element that makes this all work it this : it must be voluntary trade .
Somehow many people seem unclear on this point and they try to make decisions for others , attempting to force the world to be better off than it is now -- through taxes or other forms of directed interactions -- but stop for a moment and look at this .
Voluntary means just that .
It does n't mean you have to do this or I 'll shoot you .
Or , " You have to do this or else , but it 's your choice , ha ha ha ! " Nope .
Voluntary means that it is something that you freely choose to do out of your own desires .
Now , as to why this is important in creating wealth , look at it this way :
If you and I each trade things we have for things other people have , like let 's say I trade you a good orange and you trade me a good orange .
Well , has either of us gained in the transaction ?
No .
In fact , because we each wasted a bit of our time and energy in the process of trading our oranges with each other ( economists call these things " transaction costs " ) , we 've actually both been made a tiny bit poorer by coming out ' the same ' on the trade .
So it is not trade that makes us wealthier , it is free trade .
It seems to me that no one would willingly , voluntarily , go to all of the expense of making a trade in which he did not gain in some way .
So , sort of by definition , any voluntary trade is one which benefits the person trading .
What is the magic here ?
It 's quite simple when you look at it .
Only when a trade is voluntary -- free - - on both sides , will the net wealth of both parties , and the world as a whole , be larger as a result .
If either one of us is not going to be better off by making the trade , then that one is not going to make the trade .
It 's that simple .
No one else but you yourself can say at any given moment what it is that you value the most highly .
For me it may be having my historic district reflect the charm of a day I dream of in which the world was a better place , and so I 'm willing to put some of my labor or money to work on landscaping the park or my street .
But for you , perhaps your son or wife has a serious disease and regardless of your love of the neighborhood and even your respect for what I 'm trying to build , regardless of these things , your medical expenses trump all other concerns at present .
Can you see how , no matter how well intentioned an historic - district tax or regulation might be , there is no way it can increase the wealth of the individuals involved or the world as a whole ?
For if I wanted to put my money to the same use as the people who passed the tax , I will do that anyway , and we 'll all be better off for it .
The simple fact that I am being taxed to do something means that there is something else that I value more at that moment .
Your taxing me will end up at the very least decreasing my wealth by the amount of the tax ( something I value less ) , rather than spending that money on my wife ( or whatever I may value more ) .
I say " at the very least , " for it is highly likely that we 'll both be worse off , for your world will be poorer as a whole , even if you specifically are better off in the moment .
Why ?
I will be more resentful of the money spent , for one thing , and an unhappy camper is not a productive member of society .
Over time each depletion of wealth makes the world a poorer place for all of us , so that even though there may still be rich and poor ( and you may be one of the rich ) , those rich will be wealthy only in comparison with the poor , but not in comparison with how wealthy they could have been if the general wealth of the world had been allowed to grow as fast as it might -- each person being able to choose , trade by trade , day by day , the best choice for him and his family and loved ones ( even if they 're hookers ) .
The point that I 'm trying to describe is that any choice that is not a free choice makes all of us a bit poorer in the end .
There are no excuses and no exceptions , for no one can know what is most important to a person better than that person himself .
If you force me to do something against my will , you have made me worse off .
Can there be any doubt of this ?
The point of all of this is that simple economics reveals that government destroys wealth rather than creating it .
It can be no other way .
It is only through voluntary trade that both parties come out better off than they were before .
Anything else is either a wash or a net loss .
So anytime you hear someone say that this law or that law , this tax or another , one regulation or a whole book of them , will make the world a better place , just remember this : if it were going to improve the lives of all concerned , they would not have to be forced into doing it , they would already have done it by now !
To govern means to control .
And we can see now that to control means to make worse off , to force one to make a choice one would otherwise not have made .
There is no excuse whatsoever for the use of force to achieve a better world .
None .
It just does not add up .
It is through asking one simple question that we can answer whether or not something is the best way to move forward in our lives :
Is it voluntary ?
( If not , it 's a reduction in wealth .
I do n't care what fancy claims someone may make . )

World Economics : The Most Simple of Calculations

There was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that was n’t , or could n’t have been , gained from regular tactics .
In addition , I saw that using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions  all of which are still classified .
The short sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods , the nature of the threat , the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists , and due process .
Image Credit ...
Wesley Bedrosian
Defenders of these techniques have claimed that they got Abu Zubaydah to give up information leading to the capture of Ramzi bin al - Shibh , a top aide to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , and Mr. Padilla .
This is false .
The information that led to Mr. Shibh ’s capture came primarily from a different terrorist operative who was interviewed using traditional methods .
As for Mr. Padilla , the dates just do n’t add up : the harsh techniques were approved in the memo of August 2002 , Mr. Padilla had been arrested that May .
One of the worst consequences of the use of these harsh techniques was that it reintroduced the so - called Chinese wall between the C.I.A. and F.B.I. , similar to the communications obstacles that prevented us from working together to stop the 9/11 attacks .
Because the bureau would not employ these problematic techniques , our agents who knew the most about the terrorists could have no part in the investigation .
An F.B.I. colleague of mine who knew more about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed than anyone in the government was not allowed to speak to him .
It was the right decision to release these memos , as we need the truth to come out .
This should not be a partisan matter , because it is in our national security interest to regain our position as the world ’s foremost defenders of human rights .
Just as important , releasing these memos enables us to begin the tricky process of finally bringing these terrorists to justice .
A brown snake begins to removes itself from the red belly black snake that had ' eaten ' it
Updated
A brown snake begins to removes itself from the red belly black snake that had ' eaten ' it minutes before on the back lawn of a house in South Gundagai , NSW , late December 2008 .
Photographer , Tony Barton , said he initially thought someone had killed the snake and it was a practical joke .
Then , not long after he saw the red belly black eat the brown , it opened its mouth and " I spotted this beady eye and the head of the brown snake in its mouth .
It then fastened onto the black 's lower jaw and pulled itself completely out . "

Have you ever wondered , why traditional breakfasts of many world ’s cultures include boiled or scrambled eggs , omelets , various stratas , fritattas or other egg dishes ?
Egg is a really useful food , which can provide us with a daily dose of high - quality proteins , as well as with 14 essential nutrients and 9 essential amino acids .
Eating eggs on a regular basis is known as an effective way to stimulate detoxification , satisfy the hunger for longer time and lower the risks of having some chronic diseases .
However , recently American scientists found out that eating 2 eggs every morning ( as a part of a low - calorie diet ) can substantially boost a healthy weight loss in all overweight adults .
The results of this interesting study were published in the International Journal of Obesity in August 2008 .
According to the research carried out in 2007 - 2008 by a group of the specialists at Pennington Biomedical Research Center , by eating 2 eggs for breakfast as a part of low - calorie diet , overweight people can enhance their weight loss up to 65 % .
The experiment involved 152 subjects ( age 25 - 60 years ) with high BMI .
They were assigned to 4 groups , 2 of which were prescribed to eating a 2 - egg breakfast every morning , and the other 2 were prescribed to eating bagles breakfast of the same total energy ( kcal ) .
After 8 weeks of the study , it was found out that all the members of the group , who were prescribed to eating 2 eggs every morning in conjunction with a reduce - calorie diet :
managed to lose 65 % more weight than the members of other experimental groups ;
managed to achieve 61 % greater improvement of their Body Mass Index ;
reported about experiencing higher energy levels .
“ People have a hard time adhering to diets and our research shows that choosing eggs for breakfast can dramatically improve the success of a weight loss plan .
Apparently , the increased satiety and energy due to eggs helps people better comply with a reduced - calorie diet , ” Nikhil V. Dhurandhar , Ph.D. , the lead researcher of the group comments on the experiment .
According to the conclusions of the research , eggs should be included to a weight management program as an effective nutritional supplement to enhance weight loss .
However , eating eggs on a regular basis is not associated with weight loss if not supported by an energy - deficit diet .

NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit resumed driving Saturday after several days of mysterious problems .
Spirit failed to report in to engineers at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , Calif. , late last month , prompting a series of diagnostic tests this week to hunt the glitch 's source .
The aging Mars rover did not beam home a record of its weekend activities and , more puzzlingly , apparently failed to even record any of its actions on Sunday , mission managers said .
Mission leaders do n't know what happened .
But engineers gained confidence from diagnostic activities last week evaluating how well the rover senses its orientation , according to a statement released today .
Spirit drove about 30 centimeters ( 1 foot ) Saturday , during the 1,806th Martian day , or sol .
The rover team had commanded a longer drive , but Spirit stopped short after its right - front wheel , which no longer turns , struck a partially buried rock .
The rover drivers prepared commands yesterday for the next drive in a slightly different direction to get around that rock .
A diagnostic test on Sol 1805 provided an evaluation of how accurately Spirt 's accelerometers sense the rover 's orientation or attitude .
The testing was a follow - up to Spirit 's mistaken calculation of where to expect to see the sun on Sol 1802 .
The sol 1805 results indicate the accelerometers may have a bias of about 3 degrees .
This would explain why Spirit pointed a camera about three degrees away from the sun 's actual position on Sol 1802 .
However , the Sol 1805 test also showed that Spirit 's gyroscopes are operating properly , which convinced engineers that the rover could safely resume driving .
Only the gyroscopes are used for orientation information during driving .
Diagnostic tests last week also checked possible explanations for behavior for one period of activity on Spirit 's Sol 1800 , when the rover did not save information into its non-volatile flash memory , so the information was lost when the rover next powered down .
" We may not find any data that will explain what happened on Sol 1800 , but there 's no evidence that whatever happened then has recurred on subsequent sols , " said Jacob Matijevic of the rover engineering team at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena .
One possibility is that a cosmic - ray hit could have temporarily put Spirit temporarily into a mode that disables use of the flash memory .
The team intentionally used that mode -- relying only on volatile random - access memory -- during recovery from a memory problem five years ago on Spirit .
Spirit is just north of a low plateau called " Home Plate . "
It spent 2008 on a north - facing slope on the edge of Home Plate so that its solar panels stayed tilted toward the winter sun for maximum electrical output .
Spirit drove down off Home Plate on Jan. 6 , 2009 .
It subsequently checked whether a patch of nearby soil , called " Stapledon , " had a high concentration of silica , like a silica - rich patch of soil Spirit discovered east of Home Plate in 2007 .
The earlier discovery was interpreted as evidence left by a hot - spring or steam - vent environment .
Examination with Spirit 's alpha particle X - ray spectrometer confirmed silica at Stapledon .
This indicates that the environment that deposited the silica was not limited to the location found earlier .
10 Ways to Change the World through Social Media
Citizen journalism , open government , status updates , community building , information sharing , crowdsourcing , and the election of a President .
[ Editor ’s note : This is first guest post from Max Gladwell . ]
Our children will inherit a world profoundly changed by the combination of technology and humanity that is social media .
They ’ll take for granted that their voices can be heard and that a social movement can be launched from their laptop .
They ’ll take for granted that they are connected and interconnected with hundreds of millions of people at any given moment .
And they ’ll take for granted that a black man is or was President of the United States .
What ’s most profound is that these represent parts of a greater whole .
They represent a shift in power from centralized institutions and organizations to the People they represent .
It is the evolution of democracy by way of technology , and we are all better for it .
For most of us , social media has changed our lives in some meaningful way .
Collectively it is changing the world for good .
Given the pace of innovation and adoption , change has become a constant .
Every so often we find the need to stop and reflect on its most recent and noteworthy developments , hence the following list .
Please note this is not a top - 10 list , nor are these listed in any particular order .
It ’s also incomplete .

You can also join the Social Actions Community , which is powered by Ning … which now boasts more than one million individual social networks .
2. Twitter with a Purpose : This list could be exclusive to Twitter .
The micro- blogging sensation was featured on our first two lists ( a three - tweet ) , and it ’s certain to be a fixture .
From Tweetsgiving , the virtual Thanksgiving feast , to the Twestival , which organized 202 off - line events around the world to benefit charity : water , it ’s become the de facto tool for organizing and taking action .
Tweet Congress won the SXSW activism award , and celebrity Tweeps Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Rose Tweeted their two million followers about ending malaria .
Max Gladwell recently initiated the # EcoMonday follow meme as a way to connect and organize the Green Twittersphere .
3. Visit White House 2.0 : Inside of its first 100 days , the Obama administration has managed to set the historic benchmark for government transparency and accountability .
The President ’s virtual town hall meeting used WhiteHouse.gov to crowdsource questions from his 300 million constituents , complete with voting to determine the ones he ’d have to answer .
All told , 97,937 people submitted 103,978 questions and cast 1,782,650 votes .
The White House continues to raise the bar with its official Facebook , MySpace , and Twitter channels .
In so doing President Obama is not just setting the standard for state and local government in the U.S.
He ’s establishing the world standard .
The Obama administration is spreading democracy not by force but through example .
Because you do n’t have to be an American citizen to be a friend or follower of White House 2.0 .
4. Claim your Zumbox :
What happens when all mail can be sent and delivered online to any street address in a paperless form ?
That ’s the big question for Zumbox , which has created an online mail system with a digital mailbox for every U.S. street address .
And while the answer to that question remains to be seen , it promises to be as liberating as it is disruptive .
A key quality for Zumbox is that it ’s closed system much like that of Facebook , only instead of true identity it ’s true address .
This will enable people to better connect with their communities including their neighbors , local businesses , and the mayor ’s office .
The primary agent of change , though , might not be that this uses street addresses but that it enables direct and potentially viral feedback , which is a virtue that e-mail and the USPS do not offer .
The first methods are to request exclusive paperless delivery and to block a sender , but others are certain to evolve such as real - time commenting and ways to share mail with friends , family , and colleagues .
Welcome to Mail 2.0 .
( Disclosure : Zumbox is a client of Rob Reed , the founder of Max Gladwell . )
5. Host a Social Media Event :
This is the year of the social media event .
No meaningful gathering of people is complete without an interactive online audience , especially when it ’s so easy and cost effective to pull off .
Essential tools include a broadband connection , laptop , video camera , projector , and screen .
Add people and a purpose , such as entrepreneurship .
Promote it through social media channels , and you have a social media event .
A recent example in the green world is the Evolution of Green , which was hosted by Creative Citizen , a green wiki community .
It celebrated the launch of a new Web property , EcoMatters , while also establishing a new Twitter tag .
By posing the question , “ How can we go from green hype to green habit ? ” and including the # GreenQ hashtag , it sparked a conversation between attendees and the Twittersphere in real time .
Thus was born a new mechanism for getting answers to green questions via Twitter .
6. Travel the World : More than anyone else , Tim O’Reilly knows the potential for social media to change the world .
In his opening keynote at this year ’s Web 2.0 Expo , he called for a new ethic in which we do more with less and create more value than we capture .
This provided the context for SalaamGarage founder Amanda Koster , whose presentation followed O’Reilly ’s .
The idea is that social media has enabled each of us to have an audience .
Whether through Twitter , Flickr , YouTube , or a personal blog , each of us can have influence and reach .
What ’s more , it can be used for good .
SalaamGarage coordinates trips for citizen journalists ( that means you ) to places like India and Vietnam in conjunction with non-government organizations like Seattle - based Peace Trees .
The destination is the story , as these humanitarian journalists report on the people they meet and discoveries they make .
Their words , images , and video are posted to the social web to gain exposure and because these stories just need to be told .
7. Build It on Drupal :
You may not have noticed , but the open - source Drupal content management system ( CMS ) has quickly become the dominant player on the social web .
While we still prefer WordPress as a strict blogging application , Drupal has emerged as the go - to platform for building scalable , community - driven Web sites .
It powers Recovery.gov , a key part of President Obama ’s commitment to transparency and accountability .
PopRule uses it as a social news platform for politics .
And Drupal will soon become the platform for Causecast , a site where “ media , philanthropy , social networking , entertainment and education converge to serve a greater purpose . ”
This is especially significant because Causecast CEO Ryan Scott is transitioning the site off of Ruby on Rails because Drupal has proved more efficient , user friendly , and cost effective .
( Disclosure : Max Gladwell founder Rob Reed is co-founder of PopRule . )
8. Green Your iPhone : Looking for an organic diner within biking distance that has a three - star green rating ?
There ’s a app for that .
It ’s called 3rd Whale , and you can download it for free .
( Except that the star rating is actually a whale rating . )
Complete with Facebook Connect , this iPhone app locates green products and businesses in 30 major North American cities .
It uses the iPhone ’s dial function to select a category ( food ) , sub -category ( restaurants ) , and distance ( walking , biking , or driving ) .
In Santa Monica , this might give you Swingers diner for its selection of veggie and vegan fare .
You could then get directions from your current location using the iPhone ’s built - in Google map , rate your experience on the three - whale scale , and write up a quick review .
3rd
Whale recently released a new feature that integrates green - living tips , which can show how much energy or waste you ’ll save by taking a given action .
9. Unite the World Through Video : Matt ’s dancing around the world video inspired many to tears .
Today , more than 20 million people have viewed his YouTube masterpiece , where he performs a kooky dance with the citizens of planet earth .
The most recent example of this approach is Playing for Change , which connects the world through song .
The project started in Santa Monica with a street performance of the classic Stand By Me and expanded to New Orleans , New Mexico , France , Brazil , Italy , Venezuela , South Africa , Spain , and The Netherlands .
The project was superbly executed via social media , complete with a YouTube channel , MySpace , Facebook , and Blog .
It ’s received tremendous mainstream media exposure and also benefits a foundation of the same name .
10 . Rate a Company :
The conversation about corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) takes place across the social web on blogs , Twitter , and YouTube , but a central hub for this information and opinion is still to be determined .
SocialYell seeks to address this by building an online community around the CSR conversation , where users can submit reviews of companies together with nonprofit organizations and even public figures like Michelle Obama .
The major topics are the Environment , Health , Social Equity , Consumer Advocacy , and Charity .
The reviews are voted and commented on by the community in a Reddit - like fashion with both up ( Yell ) and down ( shhh ) voting .
The site is relatively new and still gaining traction , but there ’s no question that a resource like this is needed to shine a bright light on CSR and and other related issues .
11 . Publish a collective , simultaneous blog post on a universal topic :
As Nigel Tufnel might say , this list goes to eleven .
Let the # 10 Ways conversation begin …
Final note :
This is Max Gladwell ’s third list of “ 10 Ways to Change the World Through Social Media . ”
The first was posted a year ago today on Sustainablog.org , and the sequel followed five months later .
If a single headline can capture the Max Gladwell raison d’etre , this is it .

White House Cheat Sheet : Wanda Sykes , Rush Limbaugh and the Politics of Humor
Comedian Wanda Sykes was the entertainment at the White House Correspondents Dinner .
( Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP / Getty Images )
UPDATE , 2:20 p.m. : White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said moments ago that he had not spoken with President Obama about Wanda Sykes ' jokes about Rush Limbaugh but added : " I think there are a lot of topics that are better left for serious reflection rather than comedy .
I think there 's no doubt 9/11 is part of that . "
ORIGINAL POST
In politics , as in life , there is a fine line between stupid and clever -- to paraphrase the great philosopher ( and lead vocalist of Spinal Tap ) David St. Hubbins .
The question percolating in Washington as a new week starts is whether comedian Wanda Sykes 's shots at conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh at the White House Correspondents Dinner were the former , the latter or somewhere in between .
Sykes , who provided the comic relief at the annual gathering of politicians and the reporters who cover them , had already skewered President Obama before turning her attention to Limbaugh .
She suggested Limbaugh 's much - repeated insistence that he hoped Obama would fail in office was equivalent to " treason " before adding :
" Maybe Rush Limbaugh was the 20th hijacker but he was so strung out on Oxycontin he missed his flight .
. . .
I hope his kidneys fail . "
" Too much ? "
Sykes asked , when the lines drew a mixture of laughter and boos .
That was the question debated throughout Washington on Sunday -- whether Sykes had crossed an imaginary line with her attacks on Limbaugh , turning a fun night into a harder - edged partisan affair .
Democrats in attendance -- and that was the majority of the crowd given the new administration -- largely wrote off Sykes 's Limbaugh comment to the sort of good - natured ribbing that is part and parcel of the event .
Several Republicans the Fix spoke with , however , were far less sanguine about Sykes .
" Sykes was funny , toeing the line with her comedy the entire time until she brought up Rush , " said Matt Mackowiak , a GOP consultant who attended the dinner .
" It 's one thing to say he is guilty of treason , another to say that he sounds like Osama Bin Laden , was the 20th hijacker on 9/11 , and that you hope his kidneys fail .
I thought it was over the line and marred her otherwise good performance . "
Another GOP strategist who spoke only on the condition of anonymity said that Sykes 's remarks about Limbaugh were " way beyond the pale " adding : " In essence she was saying , ' He 's an anti-American terrorist and I hope he dies . '
It 's hard to see how that 's in good fun . "
Limbaugh himself did not return an email from the Fix seeking comment but it's hard to imagine that he wo n't address the issue in some way , shape or form on his radio show today .
( Limbaugh may also want to take note of the fact that former vice president Dick Cheney said Sunday he'd rather have El Rushbo in the GOP than former Secretary of State Colin Powell .
OUCH . )
Is this all much ado about nothing ?
Maybe .
But , remember back to 2006 when Stephen Colbert used his speech at the Correspondents Dinner to deliver a smackdown of President George W. Bush and the press that covered him -- a moment cast by many liberals as an early clarion call for the sort of change Obama ran on and won with two years later .
Given that , there is clearly potential for Sykes ' speech to echo well beyond the walls of the Washington Hilton .
The question is whether anyone -- Limbaugh , GOP politicians etc -- will fan the flames over the next 24 to 48 hours .
And , if so , does Sykes ( or do any prominent Democrats ) hit back ?
What To Watch For :
=
Monday Fix Picks : Was the Fix's White House Correspondents Dinner a success ?
Nuff said .
1. President Obama begins to move on health care today .
2. Dan Balz on why the GOP needs more Jack Kemps .
3. Nate Silver on social and economic conservatives ( with cool graphics ) .
4 . More than 2,500 swine flu cases now in U.S. .
Does anybody care ?
5. Trekkies Unite !
Crist To Announce Tomorrow : Florida Gov. Charlie Crist will go public with the long awaited announcement that he will run for the Senate tomorrow , according to a source briefed on his thinking .
Crist 's announcement will set off a game of political musical chairs with the offices of state attorney general , chief financial officer and maybe even a House seat or two left open when the music stops .
Crist will enter the Senate primary against former House speaker Marco Rubio as the solid -- if not prohibitive -- favorite given his statewide name identification and strong popularity ratings .
Rubio is seen as the preferred candidate of former Gov. Jeb Bush ( R ) although it remains to be seen how much ( if anything ) Bush will do for Rubio either publicly or behind the scenes .
Rep. Kendrick
Meek is the favorite for the Democratic nod although he would start a general election against Crist as an underdog .
A Kentucky Primary Brewing : Sen. Jim Bunning ( R - Ky . ) continued his string of strange pronouncements over the weekend by announcing at a Republican gathering that he would be seeking a third term in 2010 .
" The battle is going to be long , but I am prepared to fight for my values , " Bunning said at the Lincoln Day Dinner Saturday night .
Bunning 's announcement comes as Secretary of State Trey Grayson , who recently formed an exploratory committee with Bunning 's blessing , has reconsidered his pledge not to challenge the incumbent in a primary , according to a Kentucky Republican familiar with his thinking .
" Senator Bunning may say that he is running but anyone who has watched his performance over the past several months understands that he is unlikely to be the GOP nominee and is incapable of holding the seat , " said the source .
In addition to Grayson , state Senate president David Williams is also said to be considering the race .
Democrats have a primary of their own with Lt. Gov. Dan Mongiardo and state Attorney General Jack Conway set to square off .
Rogers to Gore Group : Brian Rogers , one of the bright young stars who came out of Sen. John McCain's ( Ariz . ) presidential campaign , has signed on as research director for the Alliance for Climate Protection -- the group started by former vice president Al Gore .
Rogers is n't the only one of McCain 's top communicators crossing party divides ; Jill Hazelbaker , who oversaw the communications department for the presidential bid , is now serving in the press shop for New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg 's ( I ) reelection bid this November .
Pennsylvania Plans :
With former governor Tom Ridge out of the running for Senate next year in Pennsylvania , will Republican recruiters cede the nomination to former Rep. Pat Toomey ?
Not yet .
State and national Republicans are treating the race like an open seat and are still looking for alternatives to Toomey -- although the names are few and far between .
Rep. Jim Gerlach ( R ) is interested in running statewide but it's hard to see how he could beat Toomey in a primary given his moderate voting record .
Some Republicans hold out hope that former U.S. attorney Pat Meehan will reconsider his plan to challenge state Attorney General Tom Corbett for the gubernatorial nomination and instead run for Senate but that seems like a long shot .
The most likely scenario remains Toomey as the GOP nominee for Senate next year .
Best iPhone Apps : Darkroom ( the Fix could have used the camera - steadier while tweeting the Correspondents Dinner ) , Papijump and White Pages .
Say What ? :
" Well , he 's not charming in the same sense that [ former president ] Clinton is . " -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R - Ga. ) on the current president during an interview with " Fox News Sunday . "

Republican Senator Judd Gregg was Obama ’s first choice for the Secretary of Commerce post , and Gregg was actually considering joining the Obama team , until he found out that control of the US Census was being stripped from the Commerce Department and placed under the direct control of White House Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel .
Then , the same week that Americans learned that they were “ domestic terrorists ” — at least according to Obama ’s new DHS ( Department of Homeland Security ) , — if they own a bible , a pocket Constitution or guns , and still believe in Life , Liberty and Freedom , – they also learned that Obama ’s Census Bureau had hired thousands of new temporary employees , equipped each with a handheld GPS computer and sent them out to mark GPS coordinates for every residential front door in America .
Oddly , it was this same period that news was breaking of an international flu pandemic , suspected of being a weaponized strain of the virus never before seen , – and that Obama ’s team still sees no need to close the US - Mexican border , despite the cross continental spread of a deadly illness now claiming American lives .
Now , if any one of these events happened alone , one might not get too excited .
But when a string of such events happen all at once , one begins to question the string of freedom and life threatening coincidences …
I ca n’t resist the urge to question the authority and purpose behind such a BIG BROTHER initiative , when the official Census itself is not due to be taken until 2010 …
No imagination is required to think up a whole laundry list of evil that could be done with a nationwide GPS grid of coordinate ’s markers painted on every private home across the country .
But I was having trouble thinking up one good reason for it , even one legitimate use that would justify what must be a very expensive undertaking .
According to one of the Census workers , who spoke with me on condition of anonymity , they must GPS mark the coordinates “ within 40 ft of every front door ” in America and they are supposed to complete that mission nation wide , within 90 days , by the end of July 2009 .
The workers were not told why they were GPS marking every front door .
But a supervisor is sent out to follow them door - to - door , to make certain that no door is left unmarked .
Every door will be marked by one employee , and then checked by a follow - up supervisor .
So , I had to ask , why ?
Why does the Obama administration need or want the latitude and longitude coordinates for every home in America ?
Why the rush to GPS paint every home in the next 90 days ?
Why must the marker be within 40 ft of every front door ?
For what possible purpose does the Fed need GPS coordinates for every home , and under what authority do they have the right ?
Census workers , whom I asked , had the same holy - crap look on their faces that I had by then …
ACORN signed on as a national partner with the U.S. Census Bureau in February 2009 to assist with the recruitment of the 1.4 million temporary workers needed to go door - to - door to count every person in the United States — currently believed to be more than 306 million people .
But the count does n’t take place until 2010 …
This is April 2009 .
Obama ’s interest in an ACORN controlled 2010 Census , for the purpose of redistricting to the advantage of Democrats before the 2010 mid-term elections , comes as NO shock from a regime known for their heavy handed Rules for Radicals political strategies .
But what does this have to do with GPS marking every home in the country ?
[ efoods ]
The 2 % of Americans , who have served military duty at some point in life , are very familiar with the most common use of GPS target painting .
The other 98 % of Americans might want to pick up a book on the subject , such as The Precision Revolution : GPS and the Future of Aerial Warfare …
Their Authority ?
RightSoup.com has just about the only online report available on the matter , and they report , “ Why does the government ( and ACORN ) need to have the GPS coordinates of your FRONT DOOR ?
Your house is probably on Google Maps already .
But the front door ?
Sounds like a jackboot convenience to me .
This is a developing story , and several reports of those who have already been visited by the GPS squad can be found in this forum thread . ”
If you challenge Census Bureau employees about the GPS marking of your private residence , you will be handed a preprinted explanation referring you to Sec. 223 , Title 13 , U.S. Code , Chapter 7 , Subtitle 2 , which explains the penalties for refusing to provide names and statistics of occupants when asked for by a census taker .
This only applies when they are taking a census , ( which will not be taken until next year ) , and the penalty for refusing to answer questions for a census is up to a $ 500 fine .
However , since the actual Census is not due to be taken until 2010 , nobody is asking for any information today .
They are only GPS marking your front door today , and Sec. 223 , Title 13 , U.S. Code , Chapter 7 , Subtitle 2 provides the Fed NO authority to GPS paint your front door .
Best I can tell , the Fed has NO authority whatsoever , to paint the front door of every private residence in America .
Still , that is exactly what they are doing .
Now , the trillion dollar question is , why ?
A State of Emergency
From Wikipedia – The Posse Comitatus Act is a United States federal law ( 18 U.S.C. § 1385 ) passed on June 16 , 1878 after the end of Reconstruction , with the intention of substantially limiting the powers of the federal government to use the military for law enforcement .
The Act prohibits most members of the federal uniformed services from exercising nominally state law enforcement , police , or peace officer powers that maintain “ law and order ” on non-federal property ( such as states and their counties and municipal divisions ) within the United States .
In short , the statute generally prohibits federal military personnel and units of the National Guard operating under federal authority , from acting in a law enforcement capacity within the United States .
As members of the military are sworn to protect and defend the Constitution and the American people against all enemies , both foreign and domestic , a federal order to do the exact opposite , and take aim at American citizens , would be a clear violation of the US Constitution and the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , unless …
US Military personnel are trained to follow orders .
But they are also obligated to refuse any order deemed “ unlawful . ”
In order to make such an order appear “ lawful , ” the federal government would first have to declare a national “ state of emergency , ” such as in the case of an international pandemic , which can be demonstrated to threaten the health and well - being of American citizens .
Following a state of emergency declaration , a federal order for Martial Law would be expected , to allegedly provide law enforcement and security for citizens .
This type of scenario can be followed by a presidential order to quarantine , disarm and contain American citizens in the name of national security , all of it , having the appearance of being “ lawful . ”
Is this what is happening ?
Connecting the Dots
Alone , individual events look concerning , but not conspiratorial .
What about when you place the pieces of the puzzle together and take a look at the entire picture developing ?
Under this “ theory , ” how does the GPS marking of every private residence in the nation fit into the picture ?
I wish I knew … but I do n’t !
What I do know is this …
Coincidences of this number and magnitude do n’t happen .
They certainly do not happen all at the same time , within hours or days of each other , out of the wild blue tin-foil hat heaven …
I also know that people had better start asking the right people the right questions and demanding answers fast .
Begin with asking the mainstream press why there has been no public notification of the federal governments GPS marking your front door ?
Then , I suggest contacting your local Census Bureau office immediately , and demanding an explanation as well as advice as to what law gives them the right to GPS paint every front door in America ?
I ’d also recommend sending a copy of this column to your state and federal representative , demanding that they put a stop to it or explain why it ’s necessary , and what law gives them the right ?
Unfortunately , we live in a moment of history when real events are much stranger than nutty conspiracy theories .
The people have every right to know what is happening .
But unless you demand to know , nobody ’s talking !
Bill Clinton sold US nuclear technology to Red China for a mere $ 300,000 in campaign contributions .
The event landed Chinese bagman Johnny Chung in prison , but put Hillary Clinton in the US Senate , and now at the helm of the US State Department .
Highly secured government servers are hacked daily .
Soon , hackers will be able to grab a nation wide GPS grid map , marking the front door of every home in America .
How much is a GPS grid of every American household worth to the enemies of America , both foreign and domestic ?
I ’d estimate , PRICELESS !
There is a foul odor resonating from the current regime in Washington DC and most Americans can smell it .
Can most Americans gather the strength to do something about it ?

You could just as easily have Apple be the big guy behind the entertainment industry .
Though , then we will get into debates on how much of an improvement that would truly be .
It is an interesting dichotomy our love / hate relationship with the entertainment industry .
We love their products ( why else would we steal them ? - and yes , I meant to use the word " steal " ) , yet we hate how they expect us to pay whatever they think it is worth .
Ultimately it is a decision between paying what they want or free , and most of us do a pretty good job of walking that line fairly ( or , what we think is fair ) .
Still , every attempt the industry makes to shut down our free options is met with political cartoons , among other things .
Here 's hoping that the entertainment industry starts treating us like customers again .

Because of my eBay business , I ship a LOT of packages every month .
I pack and prepare them ; while Steve weighs them , posts them , and drops them off at the post office each morning .
We have watched postage prices climb numerous times throughout the eleven years we have been at this .
Come Monday morning , May 11th , a stamp hike will take effect yet again .
This is the fifth time the price of a letter stamp has been increased in the last ten years ; climbing from .33 cents in 1999 to .44 cents in 2009 .
The USPS says that the postage increase is essential , as they just ended the fiscal second quarter on March 31 with a net loss of $ 1.9 billion .
Postmaster John Potter said that “ the economic recession has been tough on the mailing industry , and we have seen an unprecedented decline in mail volumes and revenue . ”
In the second quarter , the Postal Service said that its mail volume totaled 43.8 billion pieces , down 7.5 billion pieces , or 14.7 % , compared to a year earlier .
To save a little money , be sure to stock up on Forever stamps before Monday .
A Forever stamp is a perpetual stamp that never expires of declines in value and is valid for first class postage no matter what the rate .
You can learn more about the price increases here .
Students Helping Honduras is busy this Spring holding fundraising events across the country .
I was able to attend one of the events this past weekend at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg , Virginia .
The fundraising event was a volleyball tournament .
The funds raised through the event are going to be used to build a library at the village of Villa Soleada in El Progreso , Honduras .
The facility , designed by engineers and architects from the Building Goodness Foundation , will give more than 2,000 people in the region a safe place to study and access books for the first time .
The event had all of the elements to be successful .
The elements included entertainment , food , team competition , great volunteers and fun .
They also met their goal by raising more than $ 25,000 .
These students are making a difference in the lives of other people and in the life of a community .
How are you making a difference ?
For the first time , a robotic system has made a novel scientific discovery with virtually no human intellectual input .
Scientists designed " Adam " to carry out the entire scientific process on its own : formulating hypotheses , designing and running experiments , analyzing data , and deciding which experiments to run next .
" It 's a major advance , " says David Waltz of the Center for Computational Learning Systems at Columbia University .
" Science is being done here in a way that incorporates artificial intelligence .
It 's automating a part of the scientific process that has n't been automated in the past . "
The demonstration of autonomous science breaks major ground .
Researchers have been automating portions of the scientific process for decades , using robotic laboratory instruments to screen for drugs and sequence genomes , but humans are usually responsible for forming the hypotheses and designing the experiments themselves .
After the experiments are complete , the humans must exert themselves again to draw conclusions .
Meanwhile , some software programs can analyze data to generate hypotheses or conclusions , but they do n't interact with the physical realm .
Adam is the first automated system to complete the cycle from hypothesis , to experiment , to reformulated hypothesis without human intervention .
Adam 's British designers , led by Ross King at Aberystwyth University in Wales , acknowledge that the robot 's discoveries have been " of a modest kind " thus far .
Its proving ground as a scientist has been the genome of baker 's yeast , a popular laboratory species .
Baker 's yeast is one of the best understood organisms , but 10 to 15 percent of its roughly 6,000 genes have unknown functions .
The scientists hoped Adam could shed light on some of these mystery genes .
They armed Adam with a model of yeast metabolism and a database of genes and proteins involved in metabolism in other species .
Then they set the mechanical beast loose , only intervening to remove waste or replace consumed solutions .
The results appear Thursday in Science .
Adam sought out gaps in the metabolism model , specifically orphan enzymes , which scientists think exist , but which have n't been linked to any parent genes .
After selecting a desirable orphan , Adam scoured the database for similar enzymes in other organisms , along with the corresponding genes .
Using this information , it hypothesized that similar genes in the yeast genome may code for the orphan enzyme .
The process might sound simple — and indeed , similar " scientific discovery " algorithms already exist — but Adam was only getting started .
Still chugging along on its own , it designed experiments to test its hypotheses , and performed them using a fully automated array of centrifuges , incubators , pipettes , and growth analyzers .
After analyzing the data and running follow - up experiments — it can design and initiate over a thousand new experiments each day —
Adam had uncovered three genes that together coded for an orphan enzyme .
King 's group confirmed the novel findings by hand .
Waltz thinks Adam will inspire other scientists .
" They 'll realize they can automate more of the process than they currently have .
They can explore a wider range of possibilities without doing it all by hand . "
King is already expanding his Robot Scientist fleet by producing Eve , which will autonomously design and screen drugs against malaria and schistosomiasis .
" Most drug discovery is already automated , " says King , " but there 's no intelligence — just brute force . "
King says
Eve will use artificial intelligence to select which compounds to run , rather than just following a list .
If robotic scientists made their way into other labs , their human counterparts would not be out of a job anytime soon .
If anything , they may find their work more exciting .
" There may be teams of humans and machines , " says King .
" Robots will be doing more and more of actual experimental work and simple cycles of hypothesis generation .
Humans would migrate to more strategic and creative positions .
How can we waste trained post - docs by making them pipette things in labs ?
It 's crazy . "
But with advances in artificial intelligence , it 's conceivable that the role of robots would , in the more distant future , creep deeper into the human realm , progressing from lab technician to lab head .
Robots may even be capable of performing supposed acts of genius , such as Einstein 's conception of special relativity .
" There is n't any intrinsic reason why that would n't happen , " says King .
" I think there 's a continuum between the really basic types of science that you 'd get from Adam , and the things I can do , and then Einstein - type science .
A computer can make beautiful chess moves , but it 's not doing anything special .
It 's just doing more of the same thing .
In my view that 's what 's going to happen in science . "
King may already have a head start : Deep Blue could never have beaten Garry Kasparov without engineer Feng - Hsiung Hsu moving the pieces on its behalf .

NANTES , France ( Reuters ) - Close to 200 prisoners will cycle around France next month , watched by scores of guards on bicycles , in the first penal version of the Tour de France , authorities said Monday .
The 196 prisoners will cycle in a pack and breakaway sprints will not be allowed .
They will be accompanied by 124 guards and prison sports instructors .
There will be no ranking , the idea being to foster values like teamwork and effort .
“ It ’s a kind of escape for us , a chance to break away from the daily reality of prison , ” said Daniel , a 48 - year - old prisoner in the western city of Nantes , at the official launch of the event .
His last name was not given .
“ If we behave well , we might be able to get released earlier , on probation , ” he told reporters .
The prisoners ’
Tour de France will take them 2,300 km ( 1,400 miles ) around the country , starting in the northern city of Lille on June 4 and stopping in 17 towns , each of which has a prison .
However , participants will sleep in hotels .
The finish line will be in Paris , following Tour de France tradition .
“ This project aims to help these men reintegrate into society by fostering values like effort , teamwork and self - esteem , ” said Sylvie Marion of the prison authorities .
“ We want to show them that with some training , you can achieve your goals and start a new life , ” she said .
Kissinger Tells President Medvedev ... ' By September Weâll Have CONFISCATED ALL PRIVATELY OWNED GUNS ...' ( Updated May 25 , 2009 )
A " fast and dirty " analysis of the spread of swine flu thus far has led researchers to believe that the virus will eventually turn into a true pandemic infecting about a third of the world 's population -- but they hasten to add that the analysis also suggests that the flu does n't have a devastating death rate .
Lead researcher Neil Ferguson , a member of the World Health Organization 's emergency committee for the outbreak , says :
" This virus really does have full pandemic potential .
It is likely to spread around the world in the next six to nine months and when it does so it will affect about one - third of the world 's population .
To put that into context , normal seasonal flu every year probably affects around 10 % of the world 's population every year , so we are heading for a flu season which is perhaps three times worse than usual " [ BBC News ] .
The analysis , published in Science , also roughly estimates that the flu has a fatality rate of .4 percent , meaning that it kills 4 people out of every 1,000 infected .
That makes the swine flu virus
about as dangerous as the virus behind a 1957 pandemic that killed 2 million people worldwide .
But it 's not nearly as lethal as the bug that caused the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic [ ScienceNOW Daily News ] .
Seasonal flu has a fatality rate of less than .1 percent , and kills more than 250,000 people each year .
While global hysteria regarding swine flu has subsided somewhat , confirmed cases continue to mount .
Yesterday , the World Health Organization said that swine flu has been confirmed in 4,694 people around the world , with the bulk of the cases in North America .
Sixty - one people have died , including 56 in Mexico , three in the U.S. , and one each in Canada and Costa Rica , health officials said .
The U.S. confirmed 2,618 cases in 44 states , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ Bloomberg ] .
One mystery is why the virus seems to cause more severe symptoms in young people : U.S. health officials say the median age of people hospitalized with swine flu is 15 years old .
Researchers say that could be a troubling sign that young and healthy people are more vulnerable to the virus -- but in a contradictory finding , researchers have also found that many of the people who have died from swine flu had preexisting health problems .
One possible explanation , says Ferguson , is that flu viruses that resemble the current swine flu virus may be
commonly seen in normal seasonal flu epidemics .
Adults are more likely to have encountered those viruses and developed immunity to them , and it may be that in some cases this immunity is enough to provide protection against swine flu [ Nature News ] .
While the findings of this first analysis are far from definitive , they do suggest that world health officials should quickly decide whether to start production of a swine flu vaccine , which could be ready before autumn comes to the northern hemisphere , possibly sparking a new outbreak .
" One of the key decisions which has to be made this week by the world community is how much do we switch over current vaccine production for seasonal flu to make a vaccine against this particular virus ? " [ BBC News ] ,
says Ferguson .

Useless FACT
The delusive NAVTEQ navigation system ads may drive you into serious troubles .
Added by GordonAten on May 24 , 2009 | Visited by 5624 | Voted by 58 persons
About half a year ago I have bought a new DVD navigation system for Land Rover / Range Rover from NAVTEQ company .
Though I had already a DVD navigation for Western Europe in my car , I fell prey to its ads that this new disc contained navigation for many East European countries , including Moldova and Ukraine .
A few weeks ago I made a car trip through those two countries .
The extent of my disappointment with the NAVTEQ navigation in Ukraine and Moldova is bordering with a complete anger about the way some of those companies are fooling the customers .
Why mentioning two whole countries , if there were only a few main roads in the system ?
One might get into serious troubles in those countries if he�d have been blindly guided only by such an incomplete navigation .
I lost my way a few times in Ukraine , so I had to apply to the old fashioned paper maps and follow the car�s compass for general directions .
A few precious hours thrown out of the window , not mentioning the cost of the DVD itself .
I hope writing the truth about this product would help other potential buyers avoid my mistake and so far stay away from this unfairly marketed service .

According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke , most researchers believe exposure to some kind of toxin or toxins in the environment triggers the development of Parkinson ’s disease ( PD ) — the degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that impairs motor skills ( including walking ) , speech and other functions .
Pesticides have long been on the list of possible suspects as a PD - causing toxin .
But a new study just published in the American Journal of Epidemiology by University of California at Los Angeles ( UCLA ) scientists appears to be the “ smoking gun ” that places pesticides at the top of that list .
They found that exposure to a combination of two widely used pesticides increased the risk of Parkinson ’s disease by an incredible 75 percent .
In previous animal studies and cell cultures , researchers have shown pesticides spark a neurodegenerative process that leads to Parkinson ’s disease .
The UCLA scientists , however , are the first to provide evidence for a similar process in humans .
They came up with their alarming results by analyzing an epidemiological study of Central Valley , California , residents .
The region is one of the nation ’s top food - growing regions and crops like potatoes , dry beans and tomatoes have long been routinely sprayed with fungicides , herbicides and pesticides .

For their study , the UCLA researchers enrolled 368 longtime residents of Central Valley who had been diagnosed with Parkinson ’s and 341 other PD - free residents as a control group .
Their analysis found that people who lived within 500 meters of fields sprayed with two pesticides , maneb and paraquat , between 1974 and 1999 had an extraordinary 75 percent increased risk for Parkinson’s .
What ’s more , people who were diagnosed with PD by the age of 60 or younger were found to have been at much higher risk because they had been exposed to maneb , paraquat or both in combination between 1974 and 1989 , during the time they were children , teens or young adults .
In these people , early pesticide exposure had increased their risk for the disease by four to six times .
“ The results confirmed two previous observations from animal studies .
One , that exposure to multiple chemicals may increase the effect of each chemical .
That ’s important , since humans are often exposed to more than one pesticide in the environment .
And second , that the timing of exposure is also important , ” UCLA scientist Beate Ritz , professor of epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health , said in a statement to media about her research team ’s findings .
She added that this is the first epidemiological study to provide strong evidence that maneb and paraquat work together to become highly neurotoxic in humans and greatly increase the risk of PD .
What makes this particularly concerning is that the UCLA data “ suggests that the critical window of exposure to toxicants may have occurred years before the onset of motor symptoms when a diagnosis of Parkinson ’s is made , ” Dr. Ritz said .

Time Warner 's board has approved the split from AOL
US media giant Time Warner says its board has approved plans to spin off its AOL internet division as a separate company by the end of this year .
Time Warner will buy the 5 % of AOL it does not already own from Google , then offer the firm to its own shareholders .
AOL and Time Warner combined in 2001 in what has become one of the least successful mergers in history .
Time Warner said last month it was planning to spin off some or all of AOL as internet advertising slumped .
In March , former Google advertising executive Tim Armstrong was recruited to head AOL with the possibility of leading a separation .
Google is among the companies that has grown to dominate online advertising at the expense of the once powerful AOL .
" We believe AOL will have a better opportunity to achieve its full potential as a leading independent internet company , " said Time Warner chief executive Jeff Bewkes .
AOL bought Time Warner in a $ 147bn ( £ 92 bn ) deal that has come to symbolise the excesses of the dotcom boom .
At the time , much of AOL 's revenue came from dial - up internet access , which peaked in 2002 and has been in decline ever since .
Kangaroos of the Middle East Article by Dr. Richard Paley
Middle Eastern Kangaroos :
Learn more about kangaroos at Conservapedia
Did Kangaroos once live in the Middle East ?
Like most people who have been indoctrinated by the secular media , your answer to this question will probably be :
" No , of course not !
Kangaroos live only in Australia . "
But is that really true ?
Let us think about this a little more deeply using a proper Biblical perspective .
Ask yourself these questions :
Do you believe that the Bible is the inerrant Word of the Lord ? ( " Yes . " )
Do you believe that the Lord brought the flood waters to the Earth and that all animals wherein the breath of life resided save those which Noah brought aboard his Ark were destroyed ?
( " Of course , that follows from your first question since the Bible tells us that this is what happened . " )
Do you believe that kangaroos were amongst those animals aboard the Ark ?
( " Yes .
Even though they were not explicitly mentioned in the Bible , they have the breath of life and so clearly two of them must have been aboard the Ark .
How else would they be alive today ? " )
Do you believe that , after the flood waters asswaged , the Ark came to rest in the Middle East ?
( " Yes .
The Bible says it came to rest on Mount Ararat , and while the exact location of Ararat might still be the subject of debate , it is clear from the later descriptions of Noah 's generations that it must be somewhere in the Middle East . " )
Do you believe that the animals aboard the Ark exited it from where it rested , and that they must have spent some period of time in the Middle East ?
( " Yes .
The Bible states that the animals went forth out of the Ark , and they must have spent time there either when taking up residence or in traversing the region to get somewhere else . " )
So then , did kangaroos once live in the Middle East ?
( " It is clear that they must have .
There is no other sound , Biblical explanation ! " )
The Postdiluvian Earth : Prior to and just after the Flood , the Earth 's continents were joined in a super - continent today called Pangaea ( Greek for " all Earth " ) .
Evidence for this comes from the jig - saw shape of the continental plates as well as Biblical evidence .
The Bible tells us that when God created the Earth it was without form ( Gen 1:2 ) , meaning that the land was n't yet broken into distinct continents and was one amorphous mass .
Also ,
God tells us that He gathered the waters under Heaven unto one place ( Gen 1:9 ) , meaning the single Ocean surrounding the super - continent .
Animals leaving the Ark immediately after the Flood would have had easy access to migrate to all the lands of the Earth .
( There is also an alternative theory that some kangaroos and other baramins destined for Australia " rafted " across the Tethys Sea on floating mats of vegetation ripped up by the Flood .
However , this is still controversial . )
Pangaea gradually started to break apart after the Flood , most likely due to the effects of rapid soaking and drying of the land .
As you can see , the logic is inescapable -- Kangaroos must have once lived in the Middle East .
Any claim that they did n't must then be treated as refuted .
But still there are questions that are left to be investigated .
For instance : why are there no kangaroos left in the Middle East ?
how come we do not hear of kangaroos in the histories of the region ?
and how did the kangaroos get to Australia ?
First , let me point out that the word " kangaroo " was coined by the Australian Aborigines after both they and the kangaroos had migrated to the Australian continent ( which , at the time , was still indirectly connected to the Middle East , see inset ) .
The word kangaroo means " I do n't know " in Aboriginese .
The story goes that when the first modern Europeans arrived in Australia , they saw a large hopping animal and asked one of the natives what it was called .
" Kangaroo [ I do n't know ] , " he responded .
It is understandable that he could n't name the animal since his people had lost all knowledge of their Biblical heritage and thus would not have known the name given to the animal by Adam ( Gen 2:19 ) .
Obviously , the peoples of the Middle East would not have called these animals by the name " kangaroo " , and so the naive assertion of Biblical skeptics that since the word " kangaroo " is absent from the ancient Middle East so too must the kangaroo be , is patently absurd .
That kangaroos are not mentioned in the Genesis account of the Flood , either by name or description , is unsurprising due to the great number of kinds of animals that were in the Ararat area at the time .
What 's a kangaroo or two among a great throng of pandas , mastodons , velociraptors , and giraffes ?
It is also likely that the kangaroos only spent a relatively short time living in the Middle East , needing to leave with greater haste than other animals in order to reach their appointed destination before the breakup of Pangaea ( see next section ) .
However , evidence of the kangaroo's migration through Europe can be found in the reports of satyrs .
Satyrs , which many believe to have been strictly demonic in origin due to the goat like features attributed to them by Pagans , were actually a conflation of demons and kangaroos by the ignorant Pagan natives of Greece .
It is easy to see that the well - known features of satyrs -- two - legged , upright stance with elongated metatarsi ; hirsuteness ; a tail ; long , pointed , horn - like ears ; long or bearded face -- closely coincide with the general kangaroo body form .
The more goat - like attributes , such as cloven feet , were no doubt due to confusion in the wine - addled minds of Dionysian cultists between kangaroos and the demons that the cultists consorted with , which manifested in goatish forms .
Furthermore , satyrs are mentioned in the prophesies of Isaiah as properly translated in the KJV , and thus we do find kangaroos in the Bible .
Isaiah prophesies the destruction of Babylon , warning that it will not be inhabited , but that " satyrs shall dance there " ( Isa . 13:21 -- note that " dance " here is economically translated from the Hebrew raqad , which has a fuller meaning of " to skip / spring about or to leap " ) .
This prophesy proves that at least some kangaroo stragglers could still be found in the Middle East up to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC .

Migration of Kangaroos & Other Marsupials :
Kangaroos were not the only marsupial kinds that once lived in the Middle East just after the Flood .
In fact , they all did , along with all the other animal kinds that we see today .
The current bio-distribution is due to migrations outward from Mount Ararat and subsequent local repopulations and micro-evolving ( i.e. degenerating ) inside of the kinds .
Why did marsupials all go to Australia ?
The Lord wanted the animals of the Ark to spread all over the Earth and repopulate it ( Gen 8:19 ) , but to have them all just spread willy - nilly would have caused chaos .
Clearly ,
God must have guided groups of animals to assigned areas of the globe , thereby facilitating a quick and efficient repopulation .
Marsupials were assigned Australia , and so that is where they went .
They did n't stay in the Middle East because that area was assigned to other kinds .
Why did the Lord choose Australia for all the marsupials ?
Only
He can know His own mind on that subject .
However , not all marsupials made it to Australia before it broke away from Pangaea around 2000 BC .
The stragglers -- mainly the slow , dim - witted opossum kind -- can still be found in North and South America , bearing witness to the great postdiluvian marsupial migration .
( Those unfortunate to have been stuck on Antarctica when it broke off and moved to the extreme South most likely froze to death .
)
A naive question that a Biblical skeptic will often ask is : " How could Koalas have lived in the Middle East if there were no eucalyptus trees there ? "
The answer to this is simple when we remember that the Lord 's creations were created before the Fall and that their current physiological state is the result of the degeneration ( due to the effects of entropy ) of their original , more informationally - complex genes .
In the Garden of Eden , koalas ate of all the trees ( save the Tree of Knowledge , of course ) not just eucalyptus trees .
The two koalas who were aboard the Ark must have not yet degenerated to being only able to subsist on eucalyptus and this state of affairs must have happened after they migrated to Australia .
Early Middle Eastern koalas would have been happy to munch away on figs or the like .

This story was updated at 1:02 p.m. EDT .
Astronomershave caught their sharpest look of a double star system deep in the heart ofthe Orion nebula .
The resultis an ultra-clear glimpse of Theta 1 Orionis C , a mismatched pair of stars lockedin orbit around one another about 1,350 light - years from Earth .
Oncethought to be a single star , Theta 1 Orionis C is the brightest and mostdominant stellar system inside the dense star - forming region of Orion ?s beautifulTrapezium Cluster .
Infrared views of the system ultimately showed its dualnature , which shines through with renewed clarity in the new image .
Researchersused the European Southern Observatory ?s Very Large Telescope Interferometer ( VLTI ) , which combines data from multiple telescopes into one image , to makethe new observation .
The Chile - based observatory yielded a photograph with a resolution of about 2 milliarcseconds .
That ?s about the equivalent of how a car on the moon wouldlook to a human staring at it from the surface of the Earth , or the view from ahypothetical space telescope with a 426 - foot ( 130 - meter ) main mirror .
Forcomparison , the main mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope isabout 7.8 feet ( 2.4 meters ) wide .
? Ourobservations demonstrate the fascinating new imaging capabilities of the VLTI , ? said study co-investigator Gerd Weigelt of the Max - Planck - Institute for RadioAstronomy .
?
This infrared interferometry technique will certainly lead to manyfundamental new discoveries .?
In additionto the new image of Theta 1 Orionis C , Weigelt and colleague Stefan Kraus foundthat the stars orbit each other once every 11 years .
The smaller of the pair isabout nine times as massive as the sun , while its larger partner weighs in at whopping38 solar masses .
Solar windfrom the paired stars shapes the disks of protoplanetary dust of other nearbystars , researchers said .
The new images and data will help astronomers betterunderstand howmassive stars form within the Orion nebula , they added .

My 6 - old - son , “ Soren ” , lost his first tooth .
When the tooth first became loose , he told my wife , “ You know Mom , I do n’t believe in the tooth fairy . ”
Soren has long prided himself in his insights ( do n’t know where he gets that ) .
“ Really ? ” my wife responded , “ Why is that ? ”
“ Well , ” Soren sincerely replied , “ what would a fairy do with all those teeth anyway ? ”
My wife smiled and that was the end of his insightful dispelling of yet another childhood myth — or so we thought .
Soren ’s tooth came out a few days later but apparently , just before loosing the tooth , he had a chat with his baby - sitter ( our next - door - neighbor ) .
The baby - sitter excitedly rejoiced with Soren about his loose tooth and ask how much money he gets from the tooth fairy .
That was all Soren needed .
Soren now again believed in the tooth fairy when he realized , with tooth in hand , that he could actually get money in exchange for this now useless tooth .
Children are able to sacrifice rationality and embrace myths as long as the trade - off is worth it .
Humans seem to be born with this simple economic tendency .
People are willing to sacrifice rationality and believe all sorts of myths if the act of believing can guarantee them friends , club activities , moral - teaching mechanisms , existential peace - of - mind , a girl - friend , political - legitimacy , respect - in - the - town and the like .
Religions which make the trade - off of rationality worth it are religions that survive .
The Tooth Fairy lives !
Soren got a dollar for his tooth .
Interestingly , Soren was crying before going to bed the night of the exchange .
I asked him why and he said , “ I am sad that the tooth fairy is taking my tooth . ” I said , “ Why do n’t we put a note with the tooth and ask the tooth fairy to bring your tooth back some day . ”
Soren smiled and jumped out of bed to write the note .
The next morning Soren was happy to get his dollar and even more surprised that the tooth fairy took his note .
It seems like Soren may also want his rationality back at the end of his childhood .
In the meanwhile , his childhood myths serve their purposes .
And in adulthood Soren will have yet further chances to grab bigger & better myths !
Finally , please do n’t get me wrong folks , “ rationality ” is often over - rated .
For many folks , the benefits of sacrificing reason far outweigh the costs .

More than 13 million Americans were jobless in March as the nation 's unemployment rate rose to 8.5 percent , its highest level since 1983 .
A Labor Department report issued Friday said employers cut 663,000 jobs last month , continuing a series of losses that have erased 5.1 million payroll positions in what is now the longest recession since World War II .
Friday 's report bodes ill for California , where the unemployment rate hit 10.5 percent in February .
The March jump at the national level means California 's rate will rise when state officials issue their update later this month .
In addition to counting how many Americans were out of work in March , the Labor Department also tallied the number who were forced to work part time or were too discouraged to look .
This second figure , sometimes called the underemployment rate , was 15.6 percent , the highest level since this count began in 1994 .
The dismal jobs report follows what had been hopeful signs that the economy was starting to mend .
Orders at U.S. factories rose in February , as did consumer spending , the economy 's driving force .

The Communist Party has always had a surprisingly large role in Japan
The protesters gathered in a park in the shadow of corporate headquarter skyscrapers , a short walk from Ginza , Tokyo's most upscale shopping district .
Hundreds strong , they included workers already laid off as the global downturn battered Japan 's economy , and those who feared they might be next .
The demonstrators set off on a march towards Japan 's Diet building - or parliament - carrying red flags .
" I support the Communist Party because it 's the one that thinks about workers first , " said one man .
" We 're demonstrating to get better rights for the temporary workers , " said another .
" The Communist Party is the only party that gets really serious about problems like this . "
Fists in the air Lined up on a set of steps near the Diet , wearing suits , red sashes and beaming smiles were officials from the Japanese Communist Party .
They joined the protesters chanting and raising their fists in the air .
The Communist Party has always had a surprisingly large role in Japan , the world 's second biggest economy .
But while it had been fading towards irrelevance , now as the recession bites it is on the rise again .
The party already has more than 400,000 members and people are joining at the rate of 1,000 a month .
In comparison , the membership of the Liberal Democratic Party , the largest member of the governing coalition , is twice the size .
But its numbers are declining .
" Many people are beginning to think : ' Is Japanese capitalism OK as it is ? ' " said Akira Kasai , a Communist member of the Diet 's House of Representatives .
" Living standards are going down .
The gap between rich and poor is growing . "
Lost generation Communist ideology has been spread in Japan in unusual ways .
There was a book , Kanikosen - The Crab Factory Ship , which raced back up the bestsellers ' lists .
A classic tale of proletarian fishermen uniting to rise up against their bosses , it had been almost forgotten since it was written in 1929 .
Some new followers discovered Communism on the internet Publishers have also produced a manga , or comic , version of Das Kapital , Karl Marx 's treatise on how capitalism would collapse under the weight of its own contradictions .
One new Communist Party member we met in a restaurant found out about Marxism on the internet .
" I got interested in Karl Marx a few years ago , " she said .
" In capitalism now we are controlled by the capitalists , or capital .
But I think in communism society we can think about whole of the society and decide our economic activities in democratic way . "
The woman , 34 , did not want to be identified for fear her employers , whom she claimed disapproved of the Communists , would find out .
But she had told her family .
" My parents were very surprised that I joined the party , " she said .
" They are not supporters of the Communist Party .
They do n't understand correctly , I think . "
The woman said she was a member of a " lost generation " - people who came into the employment market during Japan 's long stagnation in the 1990s and could not find proper jobs .
As the economy picked up at the start of this century , employers picked graduates untainted by years of drifting .
Job insecurity Now Japan 's economy , which relies for growth on sales abroad of cars , electronics and machinery , is struggling again .
Exports have fallen by nearly half compared to a year ago , and industrial production has dived .
The traditional Japanese dream of a job for life has been further undermined by reforms of the labour market in 2004 that allowed manufacturers to take on temporary workers .
The first stage is to solve problems of labour and living standards according to people 's demand
Akira Kasai
Communist politician
About a third of the workforce is now on short - term contracts and their jobs are the most threatened .
Communist members of parliament make much of their efforts to get workers a better deal by holding talks with company managers .
Unions are helping some to take their employers to court claiming wrongful dismissal .
Not even the Communists themselves expect to win power soon .
But they won nearly five million votes in the last election for the more powerful lower house of the Diet , and that was before the downturn .
They are hoping to do better when the Japanese next go to the polls later this year .
" Of course the final goal is a socialist , communist society in Japan , overcoming capitalism , " said Akira Kasai .
" But before that we are taking a step - by - step approach .
The first stage is to solve problems of labour and living standards according to people 's demand . "

“ Value ’ ’ is the watchword for travel this summer , as the topsy - turvy global economy , weak consumer demand and excess inventory in the travel industry has led to all kinds of travel deals .
Of course , finding them — and timing them — can be tricky , which is why two more watchwords for travel in the summer of 2009 are key : ‘‘ fast ’ ’ and ‘‘ flexible . ’’
The best bargains go to nimble consumers who are , for example , ready to travel on short notice and on off - days like Tuesdays and Wednesdays , when jetliners are less apt to be packed and the airlines need to fill seats .
The Road Less Traveled
Flexibility may also include traveling to destinations that may seem counter - intuitive .
Take Mexico .
Mexico shows signs of pulling out of its flu crisis and should n’t be too crowded or expensive for the next several weeks , if not longer .
Taking Advantage of a Strong Dollar
Other international summer hot - spots include the United Kingdom , where the British pound , which was trading at $ 1.80 on the U.S. dollar a year ago , now trades at $ 1.50 , and Canada , whose dollar has also slipped against the greenback .
Canada is happily gearing up for next year ’s Winter Olympics in Vancouver and Whistler , but those lovely destinations are fun in summer , too , with ample opportunities for boating , hiking , alfresco dining and cruise - ship excursions before the snowflakes fall .
Play in the U.S.A .
The big bargains for domestic U.S. travel include perennially popular places such as Las Vegas and Hawaii .
With hotel occupancy rates scraping 50 % , high - end hotels and resorts are offering deals .
Honolulu ’s swanky Kahala Hotel and Resort offers a fifth night free and complimentary buffet breakfast for two adults and two children , from $ 515 per night — not cheap , but good value for a family of four .
This and similar deals have blackout dates and other hitches , so be attentive to detail when booking .
But they are still deals .
Hotel Bargains
Most name - brand hotels wo n’t lower rack - rates for fear of tarnishing their lustrous names .
But their summer packages are de facto discounts .
Even 5 - star brands like Ritz - Carlton and Four Seasons have been hit hard by the recession .
Rooms in luxury establishments are sometimes available at low rates through opaque Web sites such as Priceline.com , Lastminute.com and Hotwire.com .
The downside is you do n’t know what hotel you ’re booking ; the upside is you may be delighted when you find out .
Hotel groups ’ own Web sites sometimes have the best deals .
The stylish boutique hotel operator Kimpton Hotels is offering rooms from $ 129 a night plus a $ 25 daily dining credit at its new Hotel Palomar in Atlanta .
Fly for Less
Airlines , too , are rolling out deals .

CIA Says Pelosi Was Briefed on Use of ' Enhanced Interrogations '
By Paul Kane
Intelligence officials released documents this evening saying that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) was briefed in September 2002 about the use of harsh interrogation tactics against al - Qaeda prisoners , seemingly contradicting her repeated statements over the past 18 months that she was never told that these techniques were actually being used .
In a 10 - page memo outlining an almost seven - year history of classified briefings , intelligence officials said that Pelosi and then - Rep. Porter Goss ( R - Fla . ) were the first two members of Congress ever briefed on the interrogation tactics .
Then the ranking member and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , respectively , Pelosi and Goss were briefed Sept. 4 , 2002 , one week before the first anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
The memo , issued by the Director of National Intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency to Capitol Hill , notes the Pelosi - Goss briefing covered " EITs including the use of EITs on Abu Zubaydah . "
EIT is an acronym for enhanced interrogation technique .
Zubaydah was one of the earliest valuable al - Qaeda members captured and the first to have the controversial tactic known as water boarding used against him .
The issue of what Pelosi knew and when she knew it has become a matter of heated debate on Capitol Hill .
Republicans have accused her of knowing for many years precisely the techniques CIA agents were using in interrogations , and only protesting the tactics when they became public and liberal antiwar activists protested .
In a carefully worded statement , Pelosi 's office said today that she had never been briefed about the use of waterboarding , only that it had been approved by Bush administration lawyers as a legal technique to use in interrogations .
" As this document shows , the Speaker was briefed only once , in September 2002 .
The briefers described these techniques , said they were legal , but said that waterboarding had not yet been used , " said Brendan Daly , Pelosi 's spokesman .
Pelosi 's statement did not address whether she was informed that other harsh techniques were already in use during the Zubaydah interrogations .
In December 2007 the Washington Post reported that leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees had been briefed in the fall of 2002 about waterboarding -- which simulates drowning -- and other techniques , and that no congressional leaders protested its use .
At the time Pelosi said she was not told that waterboarding was being used , a position she stood by repeatedly last month when the Bush - era Justice Department legal documents justifying the interrogation tactics were released by Attorney General Eric Holder .
The new memo shows that intelligence officials were willing to share the information about waterboarding with only a sharply closed group of people .
Three years after the initial Pelosi - Goss briefing , Bush officials still limited interrogation technique briefings to just the chairman and ranking member of the House and Senate intelligence committees , the so - called Gang of Four in the intelligence world .
In October 2005 , CIA officials began briefing other congressional leaders with oversight of the intelligence community , including top appropriators who provided the agency its annual funding .
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , a prisoner - of - war in Vietnam and an opponent of torture techniques , was also read into the program at that time even though he did not hold a special committee position overseeing the intelligence community .
A bipartisan collection of lawmakers have criticized the practice of limiting information to just the " Gang of Four " , who were expressly forbidden from talking about the information from other colleagues , including fellow members of the intelligence committees .
Pelosi and others are considering reforms that would assure a more open process for all committee members .

PHP type comparison tables
The following tables demonstrate behaviors of PHP types and comparison operators , for both loose and strict comparisons .
This supplemental is also related to the manual section on type juggling .
Inspiration was provided by various user comments and by the work over at » BlueShoes .
Before utilizing these tables , it 's important to understand types and their meanings .
For example , " 42 " is a string while 42 is an integer .
FALSE is a boolean while " false " is a string .
Note : HTML
Forms do not pass integers , floats , or booleans ; they pass strings .
To find out if a string is numeric , you may use is_numeric ( ) .
Note : Simply doing if ( $x ) while $x is undefined will generate an error of level E_NOTICE .
Instead , consider using empty ( ) or isset ( ) and / or initialize your variables .
Note : Some numeric operations can result in a value represented by the constant NAN .
Any loose or strict comparisons of this value against any other value , including itself , but except TRUE , will have a result of FALSE .
( i.e. NAN != NAN and NAN !== NAN ) Examples of operations that produce NAN include sqrt( - 1 ) , asin( 2 ) , and acosh ( 0 ) .
Comparisons of $ x with PHP functions Expression gettype ( ) empty ( ) is_null ( ) isset ( ) boolean if ( $x ) $ x = " " ; string TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE $x = null ; NULL TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE var $ x ; NULL TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE $x is undefined NULL TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE $ x = array ( ) ; array TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE $ x = array ( 'a ' , ' b ' ) ; array FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = false ; boolean TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE $x = true ; boolean FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = 1 ; integer FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = 42 ; integer FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = 0 ; integer TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE $x = - 1 ; integer FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = " 1 " ; string FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = " 0 " ; string TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE $x = " - 1 " ; string FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = " php " ; string FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = " true " ; string FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE $x = " false " ; string FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE
Loose comparisons with == TRUE FALSE 1 0 - 1 " 1 " " 0 " " - 1 " NULL array ( ) " php " " " TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE 1 TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE 0 FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE -1 TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE " 1 " TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE " 0 " FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE " - 1 " TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE NULL FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE array ( ) FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE " php " TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE " " FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE
Oopsie , I guess we really can't count this as a mark for " out of the mouth of babes " , but Liz Cheney , perhaps inadvertently , admitted that part of the reason we 've seen Dick Cheney more in the last two months than we did in the eight years of the Bush administration is that he is very nervous that there will be investigations and prosecutions in his future :
( M) any in the media have asked why Cheney — someone who had avoided the media at all costs during his eight years as vice president — would be airing his opinions in such a forceful and public way .
Indeed , Cheney himself has answered this question , claiming he is speaking out because he believes that torture and other Bush administration anti-terror policies — many of which Obama is abandoning — were “ exactly the right thing to do ” and that “ there is n’t anybody there on the other side to tell the truth . ”
In turn , media figures have answered the question in much the same way .
“ I think he genuinely believes we are threatened now more because of what Obama is doing , ” MSNBC ’s Pat Buchanan has said .
CNN ’s David Gergen said , “ I think Dick Cheney almost has a Churchillian view of this , and that is somebody has got to stand up and be the voice in the wilderness . ”
But while the narrative of Cheney ’s motives focuses mainly on the righteous , it has all but ignored the selfish — that Cheney is trying to muddle the public debate with the goal of reducing public support for a criminal inquiry into the torture regime that he authorized .
Last night on CNN , however , Cheney ’s daughter Liz revealed that fear of prosecution is indeed a motivating factor in the former vice president ’s current media campaign : L. CHENEY : I do n’t think he planned to be doing this , you know , when they left office in January .
But I think , as it became clear that President Obama was not only going to be stopping some of these policies , that he was going to be doing things like releasing the — the techniques themselves , so that the terrorists could now train to them , that he was suggesting that perhaps we would even be prosecuting former members of the Bush administration .
Sad that this " Get Daddy Out Of Jail Free " ploy seems to have all the news outlets lapping it up with nary a word on what the motives might be for a former Vice President to break with protocol and criticize a sitting President ( and by doing so , implicitly admitting that Cheney - - not Bush - - was in charge ) .
Can you imagine how the right wing noise machine would have gone into overdrive if Clinton had started criticizing Bush for not taking the al Qaeda threat seriously at the beginning of his presidency ?
By all reports , that 's what happened .
Richard Clarke was demoted , his reports ignored , and then 9/11 happened on their watch .
And now terrorism has increased worldwide four - fold .
However , even with this miserable track record ( kept from the public by these media outlets eager for a Cheney appearance ) , Cheney thinks his opinion has any value to the discussion ?
Heather has put up the larger Anderson Cooper interview at VideoCafe .
Steve Benen wonders if there is n't a more pecuniary motive to Cheney 's sudden appearances ( twelve in nine and a half days over four networks ) .
Of course , Liz Cheney may also be trying to establish herself as a credible candidate in 2012 too :
In the spring of 2007 , Friends of Canadian Broadcasting , the well - known broadcasting advocacy group , began to post videos and podcasts of Parliamentary committee proceedings on their website .
When officials at the House of Commons caught wind of their activities , they promptly sent a cease and desist letter , demanding that the videos and podcasts be removed from the Internet .
A lawyer for the House of Commons argued that posting excerpts from committee proceedings could be treated as " contempt of Parliament . "
The group responded that they did not want to remove the videos , but would be willing to follow a reasonable procedure to obtain the necessary permissions .
That response did not sit well with the Chairs of the Finance and Canadian Heritage Standing Committees , who upon learning that the group was offering webcasts and downloads of their proceedings , asked the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs ( SCPHA ) to examine the issue to prevent further infringement .
My weekly technology column ( Toronto Star version , homepage version ) notes that the idea that videos of committee hearings constitute proprietary content that when used without permission raise the potential for allegations of contempt of Parliament or copyright infringement will undoubtedly come as news to many Canadians .
Using these excerpts in YouTube videos , webcasts , or podcasts has emerged as an important and powerful tool for business and consumer groups to educate the public on policy issues and legislative proposals .
Yet House of Commons lawyers maintain that many of these activities violate the law and have sent notice and takedown demands to YouTube seeking the removal of videos that include House of Commons and committee proceedings .
These include clips that involve satire and parody , since they are seen to " distort " the video itself .
SCPHA hearings held earlier this year revealed that Canada 's elected officials safeguard Parliamentary video with very restrictive licencing requirements that are generally limited to use in schools or for private study , research , criticism or review .
Relying on crown copyright , the policy states that any other use – including any commercial use – requires the express prior written approval of the Speaker of the House of Commons .
This stands in sharp contrast to the United States , where the default presumption is that such videos are in the public domain and can be freely used without permission .
House of Commons lawyers portrayed that approach as representing an extreme position .
To their credit , most of the MPs on the Committee recognized that changes to the policies in the YouTube era are needed .
However , MPs from the three opposition parties expressed some reluctance to mirror the U.S. approach , fearing that some videos taken out of context could be " terrifically damaging . "
Bloc MP
Claude DeBellefeuille raised the possibility of lawsuits to enforce the copyright and noted that " we will have to establish rules so that we have some recourse and that remarks can be withdrawn after they have been broadcast and pointed out . "
Conservative MP
Scott Reid came closest to recognizing the problems associated with retaining certain restrictions , warning against policies that provide that videos are " usable for certain purposes but not for the purposes that lie at the heart of what this speech is for . "
Instead , he argued that using video excerpts for either favourable or critical purposes would be appropriate .
The Committee ultimately adopted a liberalized policy that permits non-commercial , accurate reproduction without prior permission .
Commercial uses still require prior approval , while " distorting " a video for parody , satire or political comment purposes may still fall outside the licence and lead to demands for its removal .
The new policy is a modest improvement , but it fails to fully realize the potential of public political participation through online video .
SMTPAppender for log4j is a type of appender which sends emails via an SMTP server .
It ’s very useful for applications released in production where you ’d definitely need to know of all application errors logged .
Of course every caring developer should look at the server logs every now and then , but if you ’ve got hundreds of them ( applications ) then it becomes a full time job in itself .
Sometimes a fresh release of a high traffic website may produce hundreds or thousands of ERROR level log events .
Many times this may be something minor which is being logged deep inside your code .
Until the bug is fixed and a new release is deployed , your inbox and the mail server may suffer heavily .
What follows is an extension of SMTPAppender which limits the amount of emails sent in a specified period of time .
It features sensible defaults which of course can be configured externally via the log4j configuration file .
package com.cherouvim ; import org.apache.log4j.Logger ; import org.apache.log4j.net.SMTPAppender ; public class LimitedSMTPAppender extends SMTPAppender { private int limit = 10 ; // max at 10 mails ... private int cycleSeconds = 3600 ; // ... per hour public void setLimit ( int limit ) { this .
limit = limit ; } public void setCycleSeconds ( int cycleSeconds ) { this .cycleSeconds = cycleSeconds ; } private int lastVisited ; private long lastCycle ; protected boolean checkEntryConditions ( ) { final long now = System.currentTimeMillis( ) ; final long this Cycle = now - ( now % ( 1000L*cycleSeconds ) ) ; if ( lastCycle!=thisCycle ) { lastCycle = this Cycle ; lastVisited = 0 ; } lastVisited ++ ; return super.checkEntryConditions ( ) && lastVisited < =limit ; } }
The configuration would look something like this :
log4j.appender.???=com.cherouvim.LimitedSMTPAppender log4j.appender.???.limit=3 log4j.appender.???.cycleSeconds=60 log4j.appender .???.BufferSize=25 log4j.appender .???.
SMTPHost=${mail.smtp.host} log4j.appender .???.From=${mail-sender} log4j.appender .???.
To=${sysadmin.email} log4j.appender .???.
Subject=An error occured log4j.appender.???.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout log4j.appender.???.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} %- 5 p ( % F : %L ) - %m%n log4j.appender .???.threshold=ERROR
The above configuration will limit the mail dispatch to only 3 emails per minute .
Any further errors in that minute will not be emailed .
The limit and cycleSeconds setting lines can be omitted and the defaults will be applied .
Happy logging !
NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) -- Around 1.2 million children are believed to be involved in prostitution in India , the country 's federal police said Monday .
Ashwani Kumar , who heads the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) , told a seminar on human trafficking , that India occupied a " unique position " as what he called a source , transit nation and destination of this trade .
India 's home secretary Madhukar Gupta remarked that at least 100 million people were involved in human trafficking in India .
" The number of trafficked persons is difficult to determine due to the secrecy and clandestine nature of the crime .
" However , studies and surveys sponsored by the ministry of women and child development estimate that there are about three million prostitutes in the country , of which an estimated 40 percent are children , " a CBI statement said .
Prostitution in pilgrim towns , exploitation through sex tourism and pedophilia are some of the " alarming trends " that have emerged in recent years in India , it noted .
Authorities believe 90 percent of human trafficking in India is " intra - country . "
The Los Angeles City Council approved a package of gun control laws Wednesday , placing new requirements on ammunition sellers and banning the sale of military - style ammunition in the hopes of further reducing the city ’s gun and gang violence .
The measures ban the sale of .50 - caliber ammunition , capable of penetrating a car ’s engine , and would require the city ’s ammunition vendors to be licensed , to sell ammunition face - to - face instead of over the Internet and require gun dealers to report a full accounting of their inventory twice a year to the Police Department .
The council passed laws prohibiting the installation of secret compartments for guns in cars and allowing the city to permanently seize vehicles used by certain gang members during a crime , which was proposed by City Atty .
Rocky Delgadillo .
The council also approved an ordinance that would allow landlords to evict tenants who are convicted of illegally possessing weapons or ammunition within 1,000 feet of the rental property .

A lawyer for the National Rifle Assn. said his client probably would file suit to block some of the measures .
Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , who helped develop the ordinances with Councilman Jack Weiss and other members , praised the package at a news conference before the vote .
“ We use this to stop a vehicle , ” Bratton said , holding up a .50 - caliber bullet longer and thicker than a finger .
“ Unless you are out trying to kill Godzilla , and I think the last time we saw Godzilla was in the 1950s , there is no need for this type of weapon ” unless it is in the hands of the military or law enforcement , he said .
Villaraigosa dismissed questions about whether the ammunition restrictions would have a practical effect since buyers could simply purchase the bullets over the Internet or in cities where the laws do not apply .
Advertisement
“ Part of what we ’re doing here is leading the way , ” Villaraigosa said , stating that the measures are another tool to fight gun violence and that he hoped other cities and President - elect Barack Obama ’s administration would follow suit .
“ This is the most far - reaching effort of any big city in the country .
. . .
This is n’t about symbolism ; it ’s about results . ”
The council approved the measures unanimously .
But C.D. Michel , a Long Beach attorney who represents the National Rifle Assn. and the California Rifle & Pistol Assn. , said his clients were likely to sue over the new laws governing ammunition sales and vendors because they either conflict with or are duplicated by state law .
Michel , the law partner of city attorney candidate Carmen A. Trutanich , also questioned the effectiveness of the ammunition measures , noting that there are only a handful of gun vendors left in the city and buyers could go elsewhere .
Advertisement
“ A lot of these do n’t really do what the sound bite would portray them as doing , ” said Michel , who accused Weiss of pushing the measures to get publicity for his own campaign for city attorney .
“ It ’s about trying to look like you ’re doing something when you ’re not really doing anything .
. . .
My clients will just just challenge the ones that are illegal in court . ”
Weiss , who introduced four of the ordinances and is chairman of the city ’s public safety committee , addressed the possibility of legal challenges by the NRA at the news conference .
“ I think the message from everyone up here to the NRA is pretty simple : Make our day .
We will fight you in court .
We will win , ” Weiss said .
Weiss has criticized Trutanich ’s associations with the NRA , which is likely to be an issue in the city attorney ’s race .
After several council members received a letter from Michel on the letterhead of the Trutanich - Michel firm challenging several proposed gun and ammunition ordinances , Weiss called on his opponent to “ fire the NRA as a client or quit the race for city attorney . ”

Weiss ’ campaign also circulated a news article to reporters in which Trutanich refers to the NRA as his client .
But when Weiss raised the issue in early December , Trutanich released a statement stating that the NRA is not his client , he is not a member of the organization and he disagrees with many of the NRA ’s positions .
His campaign manager said he was misquoted when he referred to the NRA as a client in the August news article .

For some time , Javascript and Objective - C were the only languages for the iPhone platform , but recently others languages have joined the group .
With Mono's Ahead of Time compilation , it 's possible to get compiled .NET languages to run on the iPhone .
In April RhoMobile released Rhodes , which allows to build smartphone applications , for the iPhone and other systems
We talked to John M McIntosh about what was involved in getting Squeak to run on the iPhone and what programming model is used for writing applications .
InfoQ :
It seems like you 're basically using Squeak to serve up an HTML / Javascript based GUI which is run in the iPhone 's browser control .
Is this correct ?
It 's more complex than just using a webview , for example the Wiki text entry feature of WikiServer has to bring up a multiline text view , then bring up the standard keyboard , and a keyboard control bar that let 's you enter special characters and signal cancel or done .
Although the Wiki information is presented using a Web view we have four different screens we manage thru the UIKIt .
Since you have to have custom Objective - C classes to do this work and compile the VM you can choose to do some of the work in Smalltalk and some in Objective - C. Technically you could do * all * the work in Smalltalk but there is some performance issues with doing that and there is no real benefit .
Because the UI is unique to the iPhone you need to separate out the visual layer from the domain model , basic MVC logic .
In fact WikiServer started out as a headless application with a control screen , then someone asked can't we edit the contents directly on the device ?
However we have not taken the approach of building a generic UI layer and enabling platform specific implementation , that would be much more work .
But I should point out http://news.squeak.org/2009/01/08/squeak-goes-to-mars where Esteban Lorenzano has been building a Cocoa UI framework with intent of porting to the iPhone , and I 'll note other Smalltalk system like Cincom 's Visualworks use native widgets , but enabling that is a huge endeavour which we are not undertaking at this time .
InfoQ : What do you use for the web app ?
Seaside ?
Seaside for serving the webpages , then UIWebView which is the UIView using Mobile Safari to render the pages .
In theory any modest size seaside app could run on the iPhone .
InfoQ : Can you use Squeak images on the iPhone ?
Can you modify and persist them as on other systems ?
Do you get the same startup behavior as on , say , desktop systems ?
The basic software at isqueak.org lets an iphone developer build a squeak vm that uses an image of his choice .
The image requires some updates to bring in the multi- touch logic , and the Objective - C bridge .
You then touch interact with the Squeak desktop , and yes optionally you can save an image .
Our Swirl application
http://www.mobilewikiserver.com/Swirl.html
Shows the Squeak desktop , with touch disabled , and we use UIKit Alert dialogs to prompt for information .
Our Fraction application
http://www.mobilewikiserver.com/Fraction.html
Much like WikiServer has it has two UIKit screens and touch interaction are sent to a calculation engine which has no knowledge of the UI , it accepts keystrokes and updates a text string .
InfoQ :
The current apps seem to have about 16 / 17 MBs in size .
Is it possible to optimize that ?
SqueakDocs and ST80 Docs are much bigger than that since they are compressed and include the text source code for the April era Web based Squeak and Pharo development images .
Once installed on the iPhone they need about 54 mb of Flash memory .
This is different than ram size were it appears we need about 10 MB to load the VM and Mobile Safari ( without Safari it 's a few MB ) , then the image , so they have about a 35 MB ram footprint .
WikiServer out of the box requires much less ram memory , 14 MB , but that is a result of careful tuning .
InfoQ : What 's the difference between the Pharo and Squeak versions ?
The Squeak version is the developer image for web based development as found via links from squeak.org .
We added in the logic from WikiServer to support the web view , the status , and info screens .
Other than our additions , and a few minor changes to improve startup time there is no difference between it and the image you would download for your desktop .
The Pharo version is a production of the Pharo team which wants to make a image which has more of a business focus than an educational focus , so much of Morphic and eToys is stripped out , and they have a more active update stream and proactive approach to bug fixing at the moment .
InfoQ :
Is it possible to bring the size of the images down by stripping out unneeded stuff or is this already a stripped version ?
I 'll talk in detail about this issue at : http://www.esug.org/Conferences/2009/Current+List+of+Talks/Smalltalk+on+iPhone
The base Pharo image is about 22 MB , we removed 12 MB of code to make WikiServer use about 10.5MB .
Swirl which does n't include Seaside is about 6 MB .
It 's possible to reduce that further , and we would like to exploit the work Craig Latta is doing on very small images
http://netjam.org/projects/spoon/
We also exploit the virtual memory manager on the iPhone and only swap in pages to ram that actually are required for execution .
For WikiServer it appears about 4MB of image data is not required for execution of the application .
The commercial Squeak - based applications are available in the Apple AppStore , WikiServer ( NOTE : ITunes Link , there is also a Mobile Wiki Server website ) and SqueakDocs using Squeak ( NOTE : ITunes Link ) and SqueakDoc using Pharo ( NOTE : ITunes Link ) .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Advertisements for The Boston Globe boast that a single news story can “ take you away . ”
But after Friday , the newspaper itself may be taken away and shut down after 137 years of publication .
The headquarters of the New York Times is pictured on 8th Avenue in New York , April 30 , 2008 .

The New York Times Co , which bought the Globe for $ 1.1 billion in 1993 , threatened at the start of April to shut the money - losing , award - winning broadsheet unless the paper ’s 13 unions agree by Friday to $ 20 million in concessions .
As the deadline approaches , the future of one of America ’s most acclaimed regional newspapers looks unclear , illustrating deepening problems for an industry that has few answers for an accelerating , long - term shift of advertising to the Internet .
Names of potential buyers have surfaced only to disappear nearly as quickly , some worrying about finding a profitable financial model for a newspaper that won 20 Pulitzer Prizes and dominates news coverage in the six - state New England region but has faced steep drops in circulation .
“ It ’s like trying to catch a falling knife , ” said Jack Connors , the former head of Boston ad agency Hill Holliday who was part of an attempt to buy the paper several years ago .
“ I ’m not a buyer ” because of the Globe ’s uncertain financial situation , he added .
“ I do n’t know whether there ’s an economic reason to own it . ”
The Globe was on track to lose $ 85 million this year unless changes are made , according to the Times Co .
That follows losses of $ 50 million last year , red ink that is buffeting the Times Co , which ended 2008 with $ 1.1 billion in debt .
When the Times bought it , the Globe was one of the most profitable newspapers in the United States .
But many U.S. newspapers have lost 20 percent or more of their advertising revenue as readership shifts to online news .
The Globe ’s average weekday circulation , for example , fell 14 percent to 302,638 for the six months to March 31 from a year earlier , according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations .
The Globe has described plans to improve revenue by raising prices and through new digital advertising efforts .
But if it were closed , it would be the most prominent of the big city American newspapers to shutter , including EW Scripps Co ’s Rocky Mountain News and the print edition of Hearst Corp ’s Seattle Post - Intelligencer , which were shut this year .
“ It would be a terrible loss , ” said lifelong Globe reader Kathryn Kirshner , a psychologist in Brookline , Massachusetts .
“ It covers Boston and New England news in a profoundly important way , uncovering things that are bad and would n’t be covered . ”
Massachusetts senators Edward Kennedy and John Kerry and nine of the state ’s 10 members of the House of Representatives sent a letter this week to Times chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. , urging that a solution be found to prevent closing the Globe .
A Globe spokesman was not immediately available for comment .
POTENTIAL BUYERS
Principal Boston Red Sox owner John Henry , a prominent hedge fund manager often mentioned as a possible suitor , is not in talks for the Globe , the baseball team said on Thursday , adding that neither Red Sox Chairman Tom Werner nor any team affiliates are in discussions to purchase the paper .
A source familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier in the week that Henry is looking at taking control of the Globe as part of a deal to buy the Times Co ’s 17.75 percent stake in New England Sports Ventures , which owns the Red Sox .
Henry owns most of New England Sports Ventures .
Thursday ’s Red Sox statement did not address if the parties could be interested in a future deal .
Some suggest the Times Co ’s threat may be a negotiating tactic to win lasting cost-cuts at the paper as the Times strives to shed debt .
Negotiations for a buyer , some suggest , could begin if the Times Co wins union concessions , which could include pay cuts of as much as 20 percent , removal of seniority rules and lifetime job guarantees , and millions of dollars in cuts to company contributions for retirement and health plans .
“ I ’d be interested in buying the paper , ” said Christopher Egan , managing member of Carruth Capital , a Westborough , Massachusetts real estate and investment company , and son of Richard Egan , co-founder of data storage giant EMC Corp .
“ There ’s value in the Boston Globe brand , in the Sox and the website , ” he said , referring to the newspaper ’s Boston.com .
However , he added that “ I have no guess what it ’s worth ” and said he has n’t reviewed the books or been approached by any representatives .
“ I do n’t think the New York Times knows what it wants to do with it yet .
They ca n’t sell it without restructuring the union contracts , ” he said .
Egan , who calls himself a “ former Globe employee ” for having delivered the paper as a boy , previously explored buying New England radio and television stations .
Inside the Globe newsroom , staffers are anxious about the negotiations .
“ We ’re all worried , and we all want what ’s best for The Globe , ” said business reporter Jenifer McKim .
Union officials declined to comment for this story .
If the Globe survives , its owner face the same stubborn questions dogging publishers worldwide , such as whether readers will ultimately pay for news online -- a business model that has its share of skeptics .
“ If that happens someone else will find a way to provide that news for free , ” said Jonathan Marcus , a former editor of Boston Magazine who teaches journalism at Boston College .
“ Once a newspaper begins to charge for content , people will begin to read another newspaper .
And once all the newspapers begin to charge for content , someone else will find a way to furnish content for free . ”
TRIPOLI ( Reuters ) - A Libyan Islamist whose fabricated testimony about al Qaeda was used by the United States to justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq has killed himself in his Libyan jail cell , a Libyan newspaper reported on Monday .
Human rights groups in the West demanded an immediate investigation into the death of Ali Mohamed Abdelaziz al Fakhiri , 46 , also known as Ibn Sheikh al - Libi and a key figure in U.S. intelligence reports on al Qaeda before the war .
“ ( Fakhiri ) who is known as Ibn al Sheikh al - Libi , was found dead after he committed suicide , ” Oed newspaper said on its website , adding that Libyan authorities were investigating the case .
Captured by U.S. - led forces in Pakistan in the weeks after the September 11 , 2001 attacks , Fakhiri later made up a story about links between al Qaeda and Iraq to avoid torture while in the custody of a third country , according to a 2006 U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee report .
U.S. media have reported that Fakhiri provided the account to interrogators in Egypt , where he was sent by the United States in January 2002 .
Egyptian officials were not immediately available for comment .
Fakhiri was later returned to U.S. custody and withdrew his accusations about ties between Iraq and al Qaeda in January 2004 , the U.S. committee report said .
The committee found that in the run-up to the Iraq war the U.S. intelligence community based assessments about possible Iraqi training of al Qaeda largely on evidence from Fakhiri .
INVESTIGATION CALLS
Oed reported that Fakhiri was extradited by the United States to Libya in 2006 , when Tripoli authorities sentenced him to life imprisonment .
The paper said he had been an inmate at Guantanamo Bay .
A Pentagon spokesman said neither his name or alias appeared on the Pentagon ’s list of detainees held there .
The paper said he had left Libya in 1986 to travel to Morocco , Mauritania and then to Saudi Arabia where he was recruited in 1990 to join Islamist militants in Afghanistan .
Fakhiri later became the head of a military camp in Afghanistan training Islamist militants from Arab countries .
He was caught by U.S. - led forces as he was crossing the Afghan border into Pakistan .
The paper did not say which prison Fakhiri died in .
But Human Right Watch researcher Heba Morayef told Reuters in London that she saw Fakhiri on April 27 during a visit to the Libyan capital ’s main Abu Salim jail .
She said Fakhiri appeared for just two minutes in a prison courtyard .
He look well , but was unwilling to speak to the Rights Watch team , she said .
“ Where were you when I was being tortured in American prisons ? ” she quoted him as saying .
She added : “ We are asking for a prompt and transparent investigation into his death . ”
In London , Reprieve , an organization of human rights lawyers said it was alarmed by the report of Fakhiri ’s death .
“ Reprieve demands the truth about the reported death of Ibn Sheikh al Libi , the ‘ informer ’ whose statements -- obtained by torture -- were used to justify the Iraq war , ” it said in a statement .
The paper said former friends of Fakhiri cast doubt on his reported suicide , arguing that the former mosque preacher from the coastal Ajdabiya town knew suicide was prohibited by Islam .
NO BULL : Dave Taylor , left , and Glen Johnson , discuss how to remove the dead beasts from the Dairy Flat farm they lease .
Seven bulls ‘ exploded ’ and caught fire after powerlines fell on a Dairy Flat farm , north of Auckland , on Tuesday .
Dave Taylor , who leases the 60.7 hectare Wilks Rd farm , says he lost a $ 2000 friesian breeding bull and six other meat bulls of the same breed worth about $ 500 each .
" I got a call from my dad , who was driving along the motorway , to say cows were exploding .
I found seven dead and on fire in the paddock , " he says .
Mr Taylor says he jumped the fence to see what was wrong because he did n’t know what had happened .
But then he realised he was trapped in the paddock as the fences and gates were " fizzing and hissing " because the fallen lines were still live .
Mr Taylor says he was lucky because he and workmate Glen Johnson may have jumped the fence without touching the wire .
Both were wearing rubber gumboots that would have provided some insulation from electric shock .
" Glen and I came down to the farm and jumped into the paddock when we saw other cattle coming towards the line and tried to scare them away , " says Mr Taylor .
Three bulls were electrocuted when the lines fell , and another four were killed when they walked into the live area .
A hedgehog was also killed .
" The wires came down and the animals got fried .
I could feel the power ticking on the ground , " says Mr Johnson .
" Another bull was shocked but was still alive when we got there .
It was stumbling around and could n’t get up , so we propped him up and this morning he ’s walking around . "
He got his power company to turn off the power , but says they wo n’t fix the problem .
" The power company does n’t want to know .
They say the farmowner is liable for the lines across the farm . "
The fallen private lines come from Bayes Coachlines and cross the paddocks to a cowshed .
A wooden bracket holding up the lines near the cowshed appears to have rotted and snapped , he says .
" The lineman said it ’s up to the owners to maintain the lines .
The meter reader comes fairly often and did n’t say anything about the state of it , " says Mr Taylor .
The dead friesians were worth about $ 5500 , plus there ’s the cost of removal and burial by digger , replacing the lines and buying new stock .
Mr Taylor says he probably will have to call in an independent contactor to do the job at his own expense .
" And a few days earlier I was told my power rates were going up as well . "
They are investigating the situation with their power and insurance companies .
A similar incident happened to Kumeu ’s John Bridgford about five years ago .
Two horses worth about $ 15,000 were electrocuted when lines fell on his farm as a result of corrosion to a crossbar bolt .
Realising fences were electrified , he called police to help stop people risking their lives by going to investigate , and got the power turned off .
Mr Bridgford says he had a " big fight " with his power company about the incident before the firm reimbursed powerpole repairs and burial costs .
The company would n’t pay for the horses .
After the incident , many neighbours had powercables checked , Mr Bridgford says .
Some found faults and had them repaired by contractors , he says .
Put Steven Trefonides in a room full of his own pictures , and you can feel it :
They start to talk to him , and he starts to hear them .
The 82 - year - old artist , who has lived and worked in Boston for over 50 years , takes on the manner of a diviner , picking up vibrations , subterranean whispers .
He 's telling you , the interloper , about each picture ; but after a while you start to feel redundant .
His manner is concentrated , alert , and improvisational , exactly like an interpreter's .
Gesturing at a vague shape in one painting he 'll say , " That 's a snake .
No , an elephant .
An alligator " - without any fear of inconsistency .
Of a drawing he made in the '60s , with various figures , a mysterious lake , and a colored rainbow , he says : " It 's that feeling you get when you say goodbye - or hello - after a long time .
You get an ache in your stomach : Am I here or not here ?
It 's a feeling picture .
" I do a lot of pictures based on feelings , " he adds .
Fortunately - or unfortunately - it 's rather easy to put Trefonides in a room full of his own pictures :
His beautiful Brookline Village home , which he shares with his wife , Phyllis , is filled with them .
A downstairs studio and an upstairs attic are crammed with canvases of all shapes and sizes ; drawers in the hallway are piled with works on paper .
Trefonides , it turns out , does not have a dealer .
Asked why , he says , without bitterness : " No one 's asked me .
Almost every gallery I was interested in was n't interested in me . "
The situation seems strange , not only because of the quality of Trefonides 's work , but because he has been a well - known and popular figure on the Boston art scene for decades .
He had a studio on the corner of Newbury and Dartmouth streets , above Joseph 's restaurant ( now Joe 's American Bar and Grill ) , for 26 years .
He had a retrospective at the Fitchburg Art Museum in 1958 and one at the Fuller Art Museum ( now the Fuller Craft ) in 1968 .
He also won the St. Botolph Club 's artist of the year award in 1980 .
But that was all a long time ago .
" He has people who are loyal , " says his friend Ben Watkins , a photographer and former director of the Society of Arts and Crafts .
" He 's very generous .
He 's also a very resourceful and avid seller . "
Now somewhat frail , Trefonides has warm dark eyes that convey a hint of mischief .
Not exactly reticent , he 's nonetheless economical in what he has to say , and he has a tendency to toss in subversive or self - deprecating comments with a poker face .
( But there 's plenty on a comedian 's jokes about Limbaugh and Hannity at the White House Correspondents Dinner )
UPDATED : 24 hours later , WaPo & UPI finally jump in with some decent coverage ...
Brad Friedman Byon 5/11/2009 , 2:06 pm PT
[ Ed Note : See bottom of article for several late updates . ]
So , it 's been about 16 hours since we covered indie journalist / historian / blogger Andy Worthington 's detailed report on the the reported suicide of the man who falsely " confessed , " during torture , to a false tie between Iraq and al - Qaeda .
The forced confession was subsequently used by the Bush Administration ( Bush himself , as well as Powell and others ) as justification for the war on Iraq .
That , despite the fact that Ibn al - Shaykh al - Libi recanted his story not long thereafter , as long and widely reported .
As of this moment , not a single mainstream U.S. newspaper or broadcast outlet has reported on the story .
Is it not notable ?
Or are our newspapers just dead set on ensuring their irrelevance by continuing to not report on news that actually matters , no matter how widely it 's being reported in other parts of the world ?
A search of " al - Libi " at Google News , at this moment , lists five stories in all , with The BRAD BLOG 's coverage as the top story on the matter .
The one , late , mainstream - ish entry is the coverage , finally , from Reuters filed one hour ago .
And it 's pathetic .
Simply pathetic ...
Their lede : " A Libyan Islamist whose fabricated testimony about al Qaeda was used by the United States to justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq has killed himself in his Libyan jail cell , a Libyan newspaper reported on Monday . "
They go on to say that al - Libi , also known as Ali Mohammed Abdelaziz al Fakhiri :
... later made up a story about links between al Qaeda and Iraq to avoid torture while in the custody of a third country , according to a 2006 U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee report .
U.S. media have reported that Fakhiri provided the account to interrogators in Egypt , where he was sent by the United States in January 2002 .
Egyptian officials were not immediately available for comment .
Egyptian officials were not available for comment ?
How about U.S. officials , such as Bush and Powell who each used the false tie --- supplied by al - Libi following torture , as it's been well reported , as opposed to " to avoid torture " --- in public speeches to justify the war .
Did Reuters bother to try to get comment from them ?
Or would that be inconvenient in continuing to avoid the well - reported facts that al - Libi 's forced " confessions " were made following torture , after the U.S. renditioned him from Guantanamo to Egypt , where they knew he would be tortured ?
Reuters continues :
Fakhiri was later returned to U.S. custody and withdrew his accusations about ties between Iraq and al Qaeda in January 2004 , the U.S. committee report said .
No doubt , the 2006 U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee report , widely regarded as a whitewash for the Bush Administration before the Republicans were booted from the majority , may say that al - Libi merely " withdrew his accusations . "
But , as Worthington 's report explained last night , Newsweek 's 2007 coverage , which did note Bush / Powell 's use of al - Libi 's false information , found that ...
" he initially told his interrogators that he ' knew nothing ' about ties between Baghdad and Osama bin Laden and he ' had difficulty even coming up with a story ' about a relationship between the two . "
The Newsweek report explained that " his answers displeased his interrogators - who then apparently subjected him to the mock burial .
As al - Libi recounted , he was stuffed into a box less than 20 inches high .
When the box was opened 17 hours later , al - Libi said he was given one final opportunity to ' tell the truth . '
He was knocked to the floor and ' punched for 15 minutes . '
It was only then that , al - Libi said , he made up the story about Iraqi weapons training . "
Was none of that mainstream reportage , the veracity of which has not been challenged , as far as we know , not worth including in Reuters coverage of this matter ?
Not the fact that he explained to debriefers that he was essentially buried alive for 17 hours and then punched for 15 minutes before offering the " made up story " about Iraq training al - Qaeda in the use of non-existent WMD ?!
Reuters continues its useless coverage :
The committee found that in the run-up to the Iraq war the U.S. intelligence community based assessments about possible Iraqi training of al Qaeda largely on evidence from Fakhiri .
Could any of this possibly be more sugar - coated ?
Only the last graf of the report offers anything that might be useful in advancing this story beyond Worthington 's far - superior coverage from last night :
The paper [ Libya 's Oed ] said former friends of Fakhiri cast doubt on his reported suicide , arguing that the former mosque preacher from the coastal Ajdabiya town knew suicide is prohibited by Islam .
Want actual coverage of this story ( and all the rest of the stories that matter ) ?
Compare the Google News search to the Google Blog search , where you 'll find links to Worthington 's original coverage , " bmaz " at emptywheel , John Amato 's at Crooks & Liars , Nick Baumann at MoJo Blog , and many more .
Or compare it to a Google News search for " Sykes Limbaugh " or " Sykes Hannity " ( more than 1000 " news articles " found for each ) .
Other than that , we just can't understand why the U.S. corporate mainstream media is having such trouble surviving .
UPDATE : The UK's Telegraph jumps in with coverage , noting :
Al - Libi recanted the story in January 2004 , although George Tenet , the former director of the CIA , wrote later : " The fact is , we do n't know which story is true , and since we do n't know , we can assume nothing . "
" We can assume nothing " ?
Since when , George ?
Seems like you allowed Dubya and Powell to " assume " plenty when they used al - Libi 's initial confession , no ?
BTW , the Telegraph goes on to report :
Clive Stafford Smith from Reprieve , said : " We are told that al Libi committed suicide in his Libyan prison .
If this is true it would be because of his torture and abuse , if false , it may reflect a desire to silence one of the greatest embarrassments of the Bush Administration .
" Reprieve has been exploring tentative contacts with al Libi , and his death may have been a result of the pressure to allow him to speak openly about his torture . "
UPDATE 9:52 pm PT : Okay , finally some U.S. outlets are jumping in to tell this story , both quoting from a Human Rights Watch press release issued tonight calling on Libya to investigate the circumstances of al - Libi 's death after he was renditioned by the CIA .
UPI posts a squib ( second story down at link ) appx " two hours ago , " according to Google News on the al - Libi death .
While short , at least it far exceeds , in quality , the Reuters report .
It includes reference to Powell 's use of the false material gained from al - Libi under torture , and also notes :
" The death of Ibn al - Sheikh al - Libi means that the world will never hear his account of the brutal torture he experienced , " Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch , said .
" So now it is up to Libya and the United States to reveal the full story of what they know , including its impact on his mental health . "
...
HRW called on Libya to disclose what it knows about al - Libi 's treatment in U.S. and Egyptian custody .
And , as the first U.S. newspaper to run anything on the reported suicide of al - Libi , Washington Post 's Peter Finn filed a not - bad report a few hours ago as well .
Finn includes [ emphasis ours ] :
When President George W. Bush ordered the 2006 transfer to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , of high - value detainees previously held in CIA custody , Libi was pointedly missing .
Human rights groups had long suspected that Libi was instead transferred to Libya , but the CIA had never confirmed where he was sent .
" I would speculate that he was missing because he was such an embarrassment to the Bush administration , " said Tom Malinowski , the head of the Washington office of Human Rights Watch .
" He was Exhibit A in the narrative that tortured confessions contributed to the massive intelligence failure that preceded the Iraq war . "
...
Libi angrily rejected speaking to the researchers [ from HRW , who found him in Libya 's Abu Salim prison on April 27th ] , saying , " Where were you when I was being tortured in American prisons ? " according to [ HRC's Heba ]
Morayef , who described the encounter in a phone interview .
...
Libi was among dozens of former " ghost prisoners " who were in American custody overseas but whose disposition has never been officially released ...
The Obama administration recently announced that it was decommissioning the CIA 's global network of secret prisons , which have been mothballed since 2006 , but human rights activists say the U.S. government should still provide the ICRC with an accounting of where it sent every prisoner it once held .
Intrepid reader ,
Last week , I blogged about the possibilities of swine H1N1 to graft other genes onto its genetic construction .
I have mentioned my concern that swine H1N1 could , in fact , easily pick up the amino acid combo which , in the aggregate , represents the Tamiflu Resistance Gene .
I also alluded to the potential for swine H1N1 to take a victory lap around the world and reassort with our old friend H5N1 .
Now I mentioned this only in passing .
The reason should be obvious : A number of persons believe this whole H1N1 thing is either a gross overreaction by public health professionals , and / or a ploy by the Obama Administration to advance its public health agenda .
It is neither , although every time I hear an Obama official even mention health care " homes " in the same breath as H1N1 , I cringe , because they need to put the Rahm Emanuel playbook down ( " Rule 1 : Never allow a crisisto go to waste " ) during this entire evolving event .
It is important to know that the Obama Administration is essentially running the Bush playbook on the management of this epidemic , and they have acknowledged as much and have been publicly grateful for its existence .
So far , I have not seen any major mistakes , mea culpas or blown calls in the response to this unfolding situation out of Washington , excepting the Vice - President - in - charge - of - embarrassing - gaffes and soon to be Lame Duck , Joe Biden .
And even he was saying what everyone else was thinking , I suppose .
Still , as a recovering politician myself , I am amazed at this guy 's lack of an " internal quip governor " ( think NASCAR restrictor plate ) and how Obama allowed him to get on the ticket .
But I digress .
Back to the issue at hand , namely reassortment .
Bloggers have been understandably reluctant to stray too far into joining swine H1N1 with avian H5N1 .
But when the world 's leading influenza expert -- the " Pope of Influenza , " Dr. Robert G. Webster of St. Jude in Memphis -- comes out and says what everyone else in Flublogia is thinking , I think it warrants a good blog .
Dr. Webster has dedicated his entire adult life to the understanding of influenza .
He has learned much , but each answer generates a whole new set of questions .
He , Edwin Kilbourne , John Oxford , and the late Graeme Laver stand as the true giants of modern influenza research .
Upon their footpaths walk Kawaoka , Peiris , Webby ( like Peiris , a protege of Webster ) and others .
Kawaoka has taken some ribbing from this Blogger in the past , but let me assure you he knows his stuff and the world is a better place with him and all his skills on board .
When Webster talks , or even speculates , it is by definition informed , and we should do the old E. F. Hutton commercial and listen .
Today , an AP article -- one of the best - researched I have read in quite some time -- speaks of the opportunity for swine H1N1 to reassort with avian H5N1 and produce -- something .
One treat is that it quotes from three of the best - known names on the influenza front , which is always fun .
I will give the article and its link later .
What I want to talk about now is the situation in Egypt , and why the Egyptian government made the controversial move to slaughter all its pigs virtually overnight .
Something feels Biblical in that decision , you know .
It was met with hostility and violent demonstrations across the nation .
Only Christians eat pork there , and the hogs slaughtered were destined only for Egyptian Christian dinnertables .
But I believe the Egyptian government had its own experience and that of Indonesia on its mind when it made the decision .
The Egyptian government has been looking for a reason to wipe out the hog population since 2008 , because there was and is growing concern that Egyptian pigs had become reservoirs for H5N1 .
Search " Egypt " on my blogsite to find everything of consequence that has happened in that country , flu - wise , since 2006 .
I 'll wait .
Especially read my January , 2008 blog here .
It has a pretty graphic , too .
OK , welcome back .
You should have seen the blog post fromEgyptian blogger Zeinobia , whose blog from January 2008 -- yes , I said January 2008 -- was an eerie foreshadowing of our current situation .
Short form :
The Egyptian government is scared to death that H1N1 will come around and reassort with H5N1 , which they believe to possibly be endemic in their pig population .
And if you look at the continuing increase in suspected and confirmed Egyptian H5N1 human bird flu cases , I think you 'd agree there is much to be concerned about .
Likewise , the situation in Indonesia and in China also involoves informed speculation on behalf of animal and human influenza researchers that H5N1 may have made a small foothold in the hog populations there .
Especially Indonesia , which remains Bird Flu Central for human cases and potential pandemic explosion , despite the competition from ongoing Egyptian human infections .
Researchers already know that some 20 % of the stray cat population in Indonesia has H5N1 antibodies .
Likewise , some hogs in Indonesia have tested positive for H5N ! antibodies .
From the Website FluWiki , from2006 :
Cat H5N1 sequences in Indonesia are apparently more similar to H5N1 sequences from humans than either are to H5N1 sequences from birds .
What is the most logical interpretation of these results ?
I submit that there may be a mammalian reservoir for H5N1 in Indonesia and other countries and that H5N1 is under selection to adapt to mammals in this reservoir .
Further , at least some of the human cases may be due to mammal - to - human infections .
( See also Dr. Jeremijenko ’s post at 23:14 in this thread , and here and here ) .
In the recent large cluster of human cases in Indonesia , no infections of poultry were found in close proximity to the village where the outbreak occured .
However , pigs with antibodies to H5N1 were found in this region reference .
H5N1 infections in pigs would be particularly worrisome as these animals could serve as mixing vessels for the formation of a human - adapted H5N1 strain .
( bold mine )
That is what everyone is worried about .
That is the Elephant in the Room .
That is why no one in Geneva , Atlanta or anywhere else is overreacting about this swH1H1 epidemic .
Now it is time to bring in the AP story .
Here it is , in its entirety .
MEXICO CITY – Bird flu kills more than 60 percent of its human victims , but does n't easily pass from person to person .
Swine flu can be spread with a sneeze or handshake , but kills only a small fraction of the people it infects .
So what happens if they mix ?
This is the scenario that has some scientists worried :
The two viruses meet — possibly in Asia , where bird flu is endemic — and combine into a new bug that is both highly contagious and lethal and can spread around the world .
Scientists are unsure how likely this possibility is , but note that the new swine flu strain — a never - before - seen mixture of pig , human and bird viruses — has shown itself to be especially adept at snatching evolutionarily advantageous genetic material from other flu viruses .
" This particular virus seems to have this unique ability to pick up other genes , " said leading virologist Dr. Robert Webster , whose team discovered an ancestor of the current flu virus at a North Carolina pig farm in 1998 .
The current swine flu strain — known as H1N1 — has sickened more than 2,300 people in 24 countries .
While people can catch bird flu from birds , the bird flu virus — H5N1 — does not easily jump from person to person .
It has killed at least 258 people worldwide since it began to ravage poultry stocks in Asia in late 2003 .
The World Health Organization reported two new human cases of bird flu on Wednesday .
One patient is recovering in Egypt , while another died in Vietnam — a reminder that the H5N1 virus is far from gone .
" Do not drop the ball in monitoring H5N1 , " WHO Director - General Margaret Chan told a meeting of Asia 's top health officials in Bangkok on Friday by video link .
" We have no idea how H5N1 will behave under the pressure of a pandemic . "
Experts have long feared that bird flu could mutate into a form that spreads easily among people .
The past three flu pandemics — the 1918 Spanish flu , the 1957 - 58 Asian flu and the Hong Kong flu of 1968 - 69 — were all linked to birds , though some scientists believe pigs also played a role in 1918 .
Webster , who works at St. Jude 's Children 's Research Hospital in Memphis , Tenn. , said bird flu should be a worry now .
Bird flu is endemic in parts of Asia and Africa , and cases of swine flu have already been confirmed in South Korea and Hong Kong .
" My great worry is that when this H1N1 virus gets into the epicenters for H5N1 in Indonesia , Egypt and China , we may have real problems , " he told The Associated Press .
" We have to watch what 's going on very diligently now . "
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are extraordinarily busy trying to understand the swine flu virus itself , and have n't had time to break off staff to look at the possibility of a swine flu - bird flu mix , spokesman Dave Daigle said .
Malik Peiris , a flu expert at Hong Kong University , said the more immediate worry is that swine flu will mix with regular flu viruses , as flu season begins in the Southern Hemisphere .
It is unclear what such a combination would produce .
But he said there are indications that scenario is possible .
Peiris noted that the swine flu virus jumped from a farmworker in Canada and infected about 220 pigs .
The worker and the pigs recovered , but the incident showed how easily the virus can leap to a different species .
" It will get passed back to pigs and then probably go from pigs to humans , " Peiris said .
" So there would be opportunities for further reassortments to occur with viruses in pigs . "
He said so far bird flu has n't established itself in pigs — but that could change .
" H5N1 itself has not got established in pigs , " he said .
" If that were to happen and then these two viruses were both established in pigs in Asia , that would be quite a worrying scenario . "
Michael Osterholm , an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota who has advised the U.S. government on flu preparations , said while flu experts are discussing the scenario , he has yet to see specific evidence causing him to think it will happen .
" Everything with influenza is a huge guessing game because Mother Natureholds all the rules , and we do n't even know what they are , so anything 's possible , " he said .
" We do n't have any evidence that this particular reassortment is that much more likely to pick up H5N1 than any other reassortment out there . "
" We do n't have to put these things together , " he added .
" This is not chocolate and peanut butter running into each other in the dark hallway . "
But there is in fact discussion of putting them together — in a high - security laboratory — to see what a combination would look like , according to Webster .
Similar tests have been done at the CDC mixing bird flu and seasonal human flu , resulting in a weak product , he said .
Daigle , the CDC spokesman , said the agency wants to look at the question in the future .
Webster has done groundbreaking work on both swine and bird flus in his 40 - year career , and has followed the evolution of the current swine flu strain from a virus that sickened a handful of people who worked with North Carolina hogs into a bug that has spread from person to person around the world .
He is closely involved in the global effort to analyze what the virus might do next .
It has killed 42 people in Mexico and two in Texas , but so far has not proven very deadly elsewhere , leading to some criticism that the World Health Organization 's warnings of a potential pandemic have been overblown .
Webster said underestimating the swine flu virus would be a huge mistake .
" This H1N1 has n't been overblown .
It 's a puppy , it 's an infant , and it 's growing , " he said .
" This virus has got the whole human population in the world to breed in — it 's just happened .
What we have to do is to watch it , and it may become a wimp and disappear , or it may become nasty . "

So there you go .
I hope wimp , but no one knows what it will do eventually .
However , it is this worry that , I believe , has led the Egyptian government to do what it could not do last year ; namely , slaughter the mixing vessels of influenza .
They do not want the Next Pandemic to start on their doorstep .
In that regard , and now knowing what you know , let me ask you :
Have they made the correct decision ?
A recent study of adult neural stem cells suggests a new route for research and development of treatments for neurodegenerative disease in elderly patients .
Within the last 20 years neuroscientists have shown that new neurons are generated in the brain throughout the lifespan .
This finding opened a new area of research aimed at understanding if adult neural stem cells can be used in therapies for neurodegenerative diseases .
A challenge with this approach is that there are fewer neural stem cell in the aged brain and the loss of stem cells occurs at just the time when neurodegenerative diseases are most common .
But a new study is providing important information that neural stem from an aged brain still have the capacity to mature into functional neurons .
A team of researchers from the Wallenberg Neuroscience Center in Lund Sweden led by Dr. Zaal Kokaia examined the properties of neural stem cells at different stages of the lifespan .
In an elegant set of experiments they characterized changes in key genes that effect the ability of neural stem cells to proliferate and mature into functional neurons .
The research group confirmed that there are fewer neural stem cells in the aged brain .
It is both the environment in the aged brain and changes in the stem cells that reduce their ability to generate new neurons .
Stem cells from the aged brain express less of important neural stem cell markers , key transcription factors , and neurogenic factors .
But all is not lost .
The neural stem cell that remain in the aged brain can produce functional neurons if the cells are cultured outside of the aged brain environment .
Furthermore , the new neurons functioned just like those from younger brains .
Dr. Kokaia 's research provides an important new finding about the capacity of adult neural stem cells to proliferate and mature into new neurons .
Embryonic stem cells give rise to the largest number of functional neurons and will continue to be the most suitable for transplant purposes .
This study shows that neural stem cells from aged brains can produce functional neurons , giving new hope that adult stems cells can be used to treat neurodegenerative disease in the elderly .
For more information about Dr. Kokaia 's research you can look at his website .

There has been a lot of buzz flying around Windows 7 since its public beta release earlier this year .
Team Fusion released a Practical Guide to Windows 7 on Mac with VMware Fusion when the Windows 7 public beta was released earlier and lots of users took advantage of the opportunity to check out the forthcoming version of Windows .
In fact , I have been running my day to day work life out of a Windows 7 Public Beta VM using Mirrored Folders and Shared Applications since the beta was released and it has been working really well with a couple of known caveats that we mentioned at the time .
Today , Microsoft released a public release candidate of Windows 7 .
We have installed Windows 7 RC on a number of Macs from a first generation MacBook Air to a higher end MacBook Pro and Windows 7 RC is really responsive with the default VMware Fusion settings on all Macs we have tried .
Personally , I am excited to see the improvements in my day to day use of Windows 7 at work .
More important , I am excited that the Windows 7 Release Candidate is the easiest way for you to try out Windows on your Mac for FREE ( at least until the beta expires ) .
That ’s right , you can download Windows 7 Release Candidate through July 1st and it ’s free to use until it expires on June 1 , 2010 .
While VMware Fusion wo n’t formally support Windows 7 until it is released later this year , the Windows 7 Release Candidate works really well in VMware Fusion 2.0.4 based on our initial testing .
Getting Up and Running with Windows 7 in VMware Fusion
Windows 7 Release Candidate , both 32 - bit and 64 - bit editions , is not officially supported with VMware Fusion 2 today , but the VMware Fusion features you rely upon including Drag and Drop , Unity , Shared Applications , and more all seem to work really well so far .
The caveats we mentioned for the Windows 7 Public Beta around 3D , Shared Folders , and Mirrored Folders are NO longer an issue with the Windows 7 Release Candidate .
We plan to fully support Windows 7 after it is officially released with a future release of VMware Fusion .
See below for some guidance on how to set things up for best success .
NOTE : If you have an existing Windows 7 Beta virtual machine or Windows XP virtual machine , you CANNOT upgrade them to Windows 7 RC according to Microsoft .
You will need to create a new Windows 7 RC virtual machine .
Download the Windows 7 Release Candidate
First , download the Windows 7 Release Candidate ISO from Microsoft ’s Windows 7 site and get yourself a release candidate product key .
You can use 32 - bit or 64 - bit , but the world is moving to 64 - bit for better performance , so this example will assume you are using the 64 - bit edition of Windows 7 .
Just download the Windows 7 ISO to your desktop .
Creating Your Windows 7 Virtual Machine
First , you ’ll create a new virtual machine , the same as you ’ve done before via “ File > New ” :
Next , we ’re going to point the New Virtual Machine Assistant at the Windows 7 Release Candidate ISO you just downloaded .
Typically , if you just insert a Windows install disk , VMware Fusion automatically recognizes what OS is in it , but in this case , we have to point it at the ISO .
Click “ Continue without disk . ”
Then , choose “ Use operating system installation disk image file ” :
Just select the ISO in the dialog that pops up :
Windows Easy Install will parse the disk image as Windows Vista ( either 32 or 64 bit , depending on which ISO you downloaded ) .
Accept the Vista default option .
Next , enter the serial key that was provided to you by Microsoft , and paste it into the Windows Product Key entry in Windows Easy Install .
At this point , you should see your final configuration setup , with 1 GB of RAM assigned , and a virtual hard disk that will expand up to 40 GB ( but will start much smaller ) .
Click “ Finish . ”
Once you hit “ Finish , ” Windows Easy Install will be off and running , installing Windows 7 .
You ’ll see some reboots , and VMware Tools will install automatically .
After that ’s all finished , you should be able to play around with Windows 7 as you would expect .
While the Windows 7 Release Candidate works well in our limited testing so far , it is not a supported configuration today , so there could be bugs you encounter until we have full support in a future VMware Fusion release with the final shipping Windows 7 software .
Tweaking Windows 7 for the Best Experience
Securing Windows
One of the most used VMware Fusion features is Unity 2.0 , which includes Mirrored Folders so that Windows applications work like Mac apps and they work with your existing files and folders stored in your Mac
THE High Court has agreed to hear a challenge to the legality of the Federal Government 's proposed $ 900 tax bonus to 8.7 million taxpayers .
The case has been brought by a law lecturer and former National Party office holder , Bryan Pape , a champion of states ' rights .
The High Court will hear the case on March 30 and 31 .
The Government plans to begin paying the bonus , part of its $ 42 billion economic stimulus package , in April .
The court has been advised by the Australian Taxation Office that , if it is to stop printing cheques , it needs to be told by the close of business on April 2 .
RPS is very pleased to have been one of the first websites in the world to see Mafia II running .
We took a trip to 2 K Czech , in their Czech Republic headquarters , and saw how the game is coming together .
So far , so good .
They were allowed to continue with our blessing .
Below are detailed impressions of the game at this stage in development , along with five brand new screenshots ( click on them for the full versions ) .
Mafia II is authentic .
Authentic to its 1940 /50s setting , and authentic to its origins .
It ’s been seven years since Mafia .
That might normally be an enormous gap between sequels , if it were n’t for the affection with which the original is remembered .
It was a bold game , developed alongside GTA III , but taking open world gaming in a very different direction .
What ’s perhaps most fascinating about what we learned when visiting 2 K Czech ’s headquarters is how defiantly Mafia II intends to pursue that direction , rather than reinventing the game as yet another GTA clone .
Heavily focused on the story , despite far more side quests and interactive locations in the brand new city , Empire Bay , the team proudly explain its linear nature .
This is about telling one powerful story .
This is n’t to say that the city is n’t going to be dramatically more involved .
Throughout twenty neighbourhoods , shops , mechanics and many other locations can be visited , with clothing bought , cars tweaked , and sights seen .
Empire Bay , inspired in parts by New York , Chicago and San Francisco , is intended to be the most interesting aspects of the best American cities distilled into one enormous area .
Set a decade on from the end of Mafia , the Second World War is over , and America is going through the transition of the lean 40s into the flourishing 50s .
This is a whole new story , with a new cast , in a new city .
Apparently allusions to the original Mafia will be made , but only as slight treats for fans , rather than involved plot points .
( You have to wonder if Empire Bay just might be the place witness protection relocated Tommy Angelo to – it ’d be splendid if you could find his white picket fence - surrounded house . )
So once again the city will evolve with the passing of time , but in a superbly involved way .
Cars will change on the streets as the years go by , but so will interiors .
You play Vito Scalleta , who is frequently accompanied by his childhood best friend , Joe .
Throughout the game you ’ll visit Joe ’s apartment , which changes as the years go by to the reflect the tastes ( and tastelessness ) of the era .
It begins quite plain , sensible , orderly , and littered with women ’s underwear .
( We presume from his ladyfriends , rather than a special secret surprise about Joe himself . )
By the boom of the 50s it ’s a garish mess of neon kitsch , his kitchen looking like a diner .
Littered with women ’s underwear .
Studio tours are often a slightly awkward obligation when visiting a developer .
You ’re there to see the game in action , interview people involved , and complain about the sandwiches .
Traipsing through the corridors of a development studio is generally polite handshakes and concerns that you ’re disturbing someone who ’s in the middle of crunch , as they show you how they designed the teapots .
I was humbled by my tour of 2 K Czech , when the sheer scale of Mafia II became clear .
Eight people work just on the AI .
Eight .
Let ’s talk about the AI for a moment .
You ’ll know if you ’ve played open world games that the pedestrians tend to be either set decoration or targets for the psychopathic .
In Mafia II the pedestrians have a choice of how to think .
In fact , 2 KC refer to them , and indeed rival gangsters , police and any other NPCs , as having “ brains ” .
There ’s the individual brain , and the team brain , and their actions are decided by a combination of the two .
So , say there ’s a dead body lying in a park .
Any number of pedestrians may be around , but their team brain will choose which runs up to investigate .
The others will be assigned different behaviours , maybe to panic , stand and watch .
But if a police officer is around , this changes , the team brain deferring to authority with the policeman approaching .
He may respond by trying to investigate the crime .
Or maybe you ’re trying to fight four or five gangsters in the park .
Their team brain will allow them to work together , choosing positions , cover and targets , even flanking you .
But if one finds himself in individual danger , his own brain will overrule the team , and he ’ll act to preserve himself .
If his hit points are low , he ’ll make a run for it .
It also plays a part in melee combat , so if you ’re fighting three people at once , only one will attack while the other two cheer him on .
The team brain also defines police responses to crimes they witness .
They wo n’t only react to your felonies , but those of anyone else on the streets .
A gangster may decide to jack a car , and if spotted a pursuit could begin in which you have no involvement .
Mafia ’s police force was famously picky .
Catching you driving at 41 mph , they ’d eventually send the entire city ’s units after you in a ludicrous misdirection of resources .
2K Czech promise this is much improved , although insist that the police will still react to speeding .
Just perhaps not quite as forcefully , and relative to the nature of the crime .
There ’s another smart way of getting out of police trouble .
Bribery .
The option will be available when being given a ticket , and later in the game when you ’re rich and influential enough , you could pull over to a phone booth and give the police headquarters a ring , tell them to call off the chase .
With so much focus on story , there ’s a reasonable question to ask about how a Czech - based development team can create such an American - centric tale .
It turns out by doing an extraordinary amount of work .
The original script , written by respected Czech author , Daniel Vavra , was 600 pages long .
Three or four times longer than your average film .
This was first translated into English by what we ’re told was an extremely competent translator .
And then it was polished once again by 2 K ’s American voice director , Jack Scalici , who just happens to be an Italian American New Yorker .
This same process was repeated for any changes made , ensuring that the script was authentically accented , authentic mafia dialogue from New York .
Frustratingly little is being said about what the story ’s about at this point .
In fact , almost nothing is known , beyond it being about Vito ’s journey from humble working man to flush mafia success .
With such an emphasis put on this aspect by the developers , it ’s a shame that we were n’t given some teasers , but presumably that ’s still to come .
There is , however , much to say about the depth of detail going into everything else .
The music comes from their own composer ( who baulked another trend of the studio tour by making the visit to the music department a highlight , as he performed some beautiful in - game music for us live on his keyboard ) , and will be recorded by the no less than the Prague Philharmonic .
There ’s also a massive collection of licensed music from the era for in - car radio , which will apparently alter its playlist to suit the time of day .
The city changes in more ways than one .
Not only will the architecture update as time moves forward , but you can exact your own change upon it in real - time .
Objects are destructible in a splendid way .
During a shoot - out in a bar , we watched with amazement as wood splintered exactly where it was hit – something all objects will apparently reflect .
Flammable materials will catch light when you throw a Molotov cocktail at them , and the heat fire generates will even cause nearby tyres to burst .
If you loved smashing phone booths in the first Mafia , then the entire city should become a lunatic ’s playground .
In an effort to eradicate the open world ’s silliest element , there ’s to be a ton of pedestrian designs .
There are ( so far ) 250 non-essential NPC character faces , each designed to look distinct and realistic .
2002 ’s Mafia set the bar for character faces , and from the brief glimpses we had , Mafia II looks certain to step up the game once again .
2K Czech have their own motion capture studio , which is but a small part of the effort that ’s going into the cutscenes .
The motion capture actors were even given real weapons ( something a developer wryly mentioned would n’t have been possible in other European countries ) to ensure their movement was affected by the weight of each gun correctly .
Perhaps my favourite of this extraordinary details dedicated just to cutscenes is the way the dialogue was recorded .
Using established actors in LA , they had them – and this is something we ’ve been begging developers to do for years – record their conversations together .
So rather than the traditional stilted awkwardness of in - game chatting , the conversations will flow naturally , people ’s intonation matching their companions ’ .
Even better , they made sure every actor came back for a second session to get pitch perfect lines .
Like the AI , there ’s an entire section of the studio dedicated to those solely working on the cutscenes .
Fans of the original Mafia will remember how these were a league ahead of their peers back then , and it seems likely other games are going to be embarrassed into improving by the results here .
We watched a truncated version of a mission , apparently running to about an hour in the game , but lasting twenty minutes in this demo , in which Vito and Joe break into a skyscraping office complex .
They first steal janitor uniforms to pass security , make their way to the rooftop after being let through vital doors to clean up a mess , and kill everyone working up there .
Then using the window cleaning platform , lower themselves to the level on which their target works .
Clearing the rooftop took a splendid gunfight , but we were told later that a diplomatic option would have been possible too .
Using branching dialogue , you can talk your way around situations , either inflaming things to start a fight , or smooth - talking your way to a peaceful route .
While you ’ll obviously have plenty of obligatory shoot - outs , other parts will let you negotiate according to your chosen approach .
Once on the right floor they plant a bomb and make their slow , winding escape .
Except the bomb goes off too early , and the target is n’t killed .
This leads to an extremely ferocious shoot - out , during which Joe gloriously throws one man through a window , while Tommy guns exchange roaring fire .
Take a look at the video at the bottom of the page for some clips of this , showing off the sense of panic , and some of the destructible scenery .
Throughout all this there were a number of perfectly performed cutscenes , setting the mood and showing off the stellar acting .
There ’s a concern , however : they were pretty frequent , and if this were the case throughout it could take control away from the player too often .
It ’ll be interesting to see how these are balanced .
The Illusion Engine has taken 2 K Czech three years to build ( the name a nostalgic nod to the developers ’ previous title , Illusion Softworks , before they were affiliated into the 2 K ‘ family ’ ) .
It ’s part of the reason why it ’s been so long since the original game – the technology did n’t exist to create their ambitions , so they set about making sure it did .
Along with the destructible materials mentioned above , there are many other specific factors that make it sound pretty special .
There ’s the weather effects , which will do more than look pretty .
If it ’s raining , or snowing as it is at the start of the game , then driving is affected .
The cars will obviously be a whole lot more easy to control than Mafia I ’s ‘ 30s wobbly boxes , but handling will change when the road is slick .
There ’s about fifty cars in the game , based on real world vehicles but not licensed .
There ’s a good reason for this – they can break .
And licensors do n’t tend to like it when you show how their cars fall to bits .
Each bit of the car can be damaged , dented or broken off .
Perhaps the most important element of the Illusion Engine is the complete absence of loading .
Now , we ’ve had this promise before from others , but 2 KC are adamant it ’s true this time .
The entire city will manage all its buffering in the background , offering a seamless drive , but even missions will load without your knowing .
This is all part of their effort to keep you in the cinematic experience as much as possible .
While there will be a HUD , and indeed a proper minimap this time , such things are optional .
There some concessions to the modern gamer .
Health will be regenerating , which may cause a few to raise eyebrows at the emphasis on realism elsewhere ( talking of which , they promise that hitting an enemy in the head will kill him in one shot , which will be worth a thousand percent on its own if true ) .
And unlike Mafia I , there are difficulty levels to make things more accessible .
The Illusion Engine was built from the ground up to work across all three platforms , 360 , PS3 and PC , each able to live up to its full potential rather than limited by the restrictions of the weakest , but obviously there ’s a desire to improve upon the rather poor efforts made when Mafia was ported to Xbox and PS2 .
Concerns about the game being simplified for a console audience do n’t seem appropriate from what we ’ve seen ( and such concerns are as patronising to the console audience as ever ) .
There are absolutely no plans for any form of multiplayer .
This is a development team who are obsessively focused on the single player , and we were told that the time required to get this to the standards they ’re aiming for , anything multiplayer would end up being half - arsed .
The degree of authenticity , both to the times in which the game is set , and to the legacy of one of the most engaging stories in gaming , looks like it could set Mafia II up for great things .
Certainly the sheer volume of detail should be fascinating , and if the story lives up to their claims , it could be special .
It ’s still a long way off , not likely to appear before the end of the summer , and possibly deeper into Autumn .
It will live and die on its story , no matter how impressive the details may be , and this far it ’s the one thing we know nothing about .
That we do know about , however , looks mighty impressive .
The administration has argued that military detainees in Afghanistan may not challenge their detentions in American courts .
A federal judge ruled last month that some Bagram detainees captured outside Afghanistan had the constitutional right of habeas corpus , citing a Supreme Court ruling .
But the new administration has appealed .
Captain Black ’s involvement in the Bagram detainee ’s case began in January , while the American officer was attending a meeting of village elders and leaders .
He was approached by relatives of an Afghan named Gul Khan , who they said had been snatched by American troops in September and imprisoned at Bagram Air Field , north of Kabul .
The military apparently believed Mr. Khan was a Taliban leader named Qari Idris .
But local Afghan officials told Captain Black it was a case of mistaken identity .
Captain Black , believing that he was fulfilling a policy of the American counterinsurgency by trying to hear out locals with grievances , applied his police training to the evidence he heard .
“ Upon speaking to multiple village elders , family members , the police chief and the subgovernor , I am convinced that the individual in question is not the person that the government claims , ” he wrote in January to Clive Stafford Smith , a human rights lawyer he had met three years earlier during a posting to Guantánamo .
“ I am a police officer in the United States , and there is a mass of evidence that this individual does not need to be held . ”
Mr. Stafford Smith , who has agreed to represent Gul Khan pro bono through his brother Kala Khan and is filing a writ of habeas corpus in federal court , provided a copy of the correspondence .
Image Relatives of Gul Khan , an Afghan detainee , have insisted that he has no connection to the Taliban .

It is impossible to be certain that Mr. Khan has no ties to the Taliban , who have been known to threaten villagers to lobby for captured fighters ’ release .
In a case last year , such efforts led to the pardon of an insurgent leader from northwest Afghanistan who immediately took up arms and killed a dozen members of the Afghan forces ; he was killed by an American airstrike in February .
Research findings indicate negative parental and social attitudes contribute to higher rates of suicide and substance abuse among gay , lesbian and bisexual youth .
Support and acceptance , and even neutrality by parents , can lead to reduced rates of suicide among vulnerable teens and young adults .
Parents ’ attitudes and behaviors toward their gay , lesbian , and bisexual offspring are key determinants of their children ’s risks of suicide , subtance abuse and depression , according to a new study published in the journal Pediatrics .
Findings from the study were featured in a story by National Public Radio ( NPR ) health reporter Joe Shapiro on December 29th , 2008 .
The findings dovetail with a period of raging social debate on gay rights , and suggest the large economic , social , and personal costs associated with ingrained stigma and discrimination .
As a group , gay , lesbian and bisexual teens and young adults have
higher rates of suicide and substance abuse problems than their
heterosexual peers .
The study in Pediatrics , conducted by a team of researchers led by Caitlin Ryan , director of Adolescent
Health Initiatives at the Cesar Chavez Institute at San Francisco State
University , found that rejection by one or both parents and efforts to change sexual orientation were significantly associated with higher risks of suicide and poorer health outcomes among this population .
Findings were based on an analysis of in - depth interviews and surveys conducted with 224 white and Latino
self - identified lesbian , gay , and bisexual young adults , ages 21 to
25 . Interviews were coupled with quantitative methods
to measure the type and frequency of parental and caregiver reactions
to a lesbian , gay , or bisexual sexual orientation , retrospectively during adolescence .
The researchers also included measures of 9 negative health indicators ,
including mental health , substance abuse , and sexual risk .

This study establishes a clear link between specific parental and caregiver rejecting behaviors and negative health problems in young lesbian , gay , and bisexual adults .
Lesbian , gay , and bisexual young adults who reported higher levels of family rejection during adolescence were 8.4 times more likely to report having attempted suicide , 5.9 times more likely to report high levels of depression , 3.4 times more likely to use illegal drugs , and 3.4 times more likely to report having engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse compared with peers from families that reported no or low levels of family rejection .
Cultural norms also clearly played a major role :
The researchers found that Latino men reported the highest number of negative family reactions to their sexual orientation in adolescence .
Researchers gauged levels of rejection by examining behaviors such as whether parents
tried to get their child to change their sexual orientation or tried
to stop them from being with other gay kids .
Conversely , those whose parents remained neutral or were supportive fared far better .
This shows , Ryan told NPR , that :
A little bit of change in rejecting behavior [ by parents ] ,
and [ having parents who are ] a little bit more accepting , can make a
significant difference in the child ’s health and mental health .
Parents ’ perceptions of their own behavior and actions did not reflect an understanding of the effects such rejections have on their children .
Ryan told NPR that :
Parents thought that by trying to change them that would make them
happy , but instead it put their children at great risk .
When we shared that with parents , they were shocked .
Reflecting these findings , the researchers called for educational , counseling and training support for parents and caregivers of gay , lesbian and bisexual youth .
Providers who serve this population should assess and help educate families about the impact of rejecting behaviors .
Counseling families , providing anticipatory guidance , and referring families for counseling and support can help make a critical difference in helping decrease risk and increasing well - being for lesbian , gay , and bisexual youth .
Similar findings have been found by other researchers .
Effie Malley , a senior prevention specialist at the federally - funded Suicide Prevention Research Center in Newton , Mass , has done her own research according to NPR and released another study this month that shows gay teens have very high rates of suicide attempts .
She says parents matter — and so do peers , teachers and society .
What I ’d like to see down the road is that parents and people who work with families counseling them would really take to heart Ryan and her co-authors ’ research about not trying to change who the parents are or their beliefs , but just to help them to recognize the words they use and the actions that are harmful to their kids and to stop using those behaviors .
These findings underscore two further points .
The first is that sexual and reproductive health education and services that include unbiased , factual and non-stigmatizing information on sexual orientation are critical aspects of basic preventive health care–whether provided in schools , in community settings , or through other means–and must be addressed as part of the discussion on the kind of health care system we want–in the broadest sense–so that we can both prevent and mitigate the effects of stigma and discrimination on public health .
The National Institutes of Mental Health reports that the costs of untreated depression alone in the U.S. population are astronomical .
In a 2006 analysis , Drs. Phillip Wang and Ronald Kessler of Harvard University note that :
Depression exacts economic costs totaling tens of billions of dollars
annually in the United States , mostly from lost work productivity .
To the extent that factual sexual and family life education programs remain contested and we delay implementation of effective programs , gay , lesbian , and bisexual teens will be disproportionately affected and the personal and medical costs for them , and the social and economic costs for the United States , will be that much higher .
The second is that these findings could not be more relevant to the current public debate around religious fundamentalisms and evidence - based approaches to sexual health and rights .
Religious and political leaders who continue to treat sexual identities other than heterosexuality as " outside the norm " contribute to a climate in which shame , marginalization and discrimination persist in many quarters .
This climate in turn raises the costs in individual lives and for the public writ large in terms of higher rates of isolation , depression , substance abuse and suicide among vulnerable children , youth , and young adults .

A passenger bashed by a Connex train driver had taunted the driver and assaulted him before the driver struck back , accordinig to a rail source who saw complete CCTV footage of the event .
The source , who today gained access to the footage , said it showed the passenger approach the train driver and say something to him , prompting the driver to get out of his cabin .
and
The passenger then appears to either headbutt the driver or spit in his face - the footage is not clear enough to show exactly what happened .
The driver then flings the passenger to the ground and the CCTV footage finishes with images that appeared online today , of the Connex driver repeatedly punching the passenger .
The train operator would not comment on the incident this afternoon , other than to say that both passenger and driver appeared to have cases to answer .
WASHINGTON - Karl
Rove will be interviewed today as part of a criminal investigation into the firing of US attorneys during the presidency of George W. Bush , according to two sources who are familiar with the appointment .
Rove , a former senior aide to Bush , will be questioned by Connecticut prosecutor Nora Dannehy , who was named last September to examine whether former Justice Department and White House officials lied or obstructed justice in connection with the dismissal of federal prosecutors in 2006 .
Dannehy has in recent weeks interviewed other government aides , including former White House political deputies Scott Jennings and Sara Taylor .
Dannehy also has reached out to representatives of former Republican senator Pete Domenici and his chief of staff , Steve Bell , in an effort to determine whether US Attorney David Iglesias of New Mexico was removed improperly .

Children can add stress to marrage
What married couples have suspected for years is now proven by researchers at the University of Denver ( DU ) and Texas A&M – children can add problems and stress to a marriage .
According to an eight - year study of 218 couples , ninety percent of the couples experienced a decrease in marital satisfaction once the first child was born .
“ Couples who do not have children also show diminished marital quality over time , ” says Scott Stanley , research professor of psychology at DU .
“ However , having a baby accelerates the deterioration , especially seen during periods of adjustment right after the birth of a child . ”
The research recently appeared in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , and was funded by a grant to the University of Denver from the National Institutes of Health .
The paper was authored by Brian Doss , assistant professor of psychology at Texas A&M along with the team of researchers from the University of Denver , including , psychology professor Howard Markman , senior researcher Galena Rhoades and Stanley .
The research also showed couples who lived together before marriage experienced more problems after birth than those who lived separately before marriage , as did those whose parents fought or divorced .
However , some couples said their relationships were stronger post - birth .
Couples who had been married longer , or who had higher incomes , seemed to have fewer marital problems related to having a baby than those with lower incomes or who had been married for a shorter period of time .
Stanley cautions against concluding that children damage overall happiness in life .
“ There are different types of happiness in life and that while some luster may be off marital happiness for at least a time during this period of life , there is a whole dimension of family happiness and contentment based on the family that couples are building .
This type of happiness can be powerful and positive but it has not been the focus of research , ” Stanley says .

Like us , the EU Commission do n’t like bug ridden games either and could soon be taking matters into their own hands .
A new proposal has been put forward to provide gamers a two year guarantee on all games in the event that a bug or glitch is encountered preventing you from completing the game and / or ruining the experience .
This would work much like a normal guarantee on any product .
If you are unhappy with the experience – and I do not mean you just hate the game – then you have the right to a full refund .
– ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW –
Speaking to the BBC , Dr Richard Wilson , Head of the video games developers ’ association Tiga , stated that the proposed changes could “ stifle new ideas as people could end up just playing it safe . ”
This is true , but a glitched game should not make it past testing , perhaps preventing developers rushing the final stages to meet deadlines .
It would appear this guarantee also applies to digital downloads , however Francisco Mingorance of the BSA feels they should be exempt , saying : “ Digital content is not a tangible good and should not be subject to the same liability rules as toasters .
It is contractually licensed to consumers and not sold . ”
Enough about toasters .
Hopefully , these changes will result in games such as Fallout 3 becoming a thing of the past and developers will not see post - release patches as “ quick - fix solutions . ”

All forms of music streaming will pay a lower charge from July 2009 Music collection society PRS has unveiled a new pricing plan it hopes may entice YouTube and Pandora back to the UK market .
From 1
July , firms will have to pay 0.085 p for each track streamed , down from the previous rate of 0.22 p .
PRS for Music says the new plan will " enable the digital market to grow " .
Earlier this year , YouTube started removing premium music videos to UK users after failing to reach a new licensing agreement with the PRS .
Companies wishing to play or stream music over the internet are legally obliged to pay royalties to songwriters and performers .
However , many companies said the old rate was prohibitive .
The radio streaming service Pandora ended its UK stream at the start of 2008 and YouTube announced in March 2009 that it was removing all premium music videos to UK users after failing to reach a new licensing agreement with the PRS .
It remains to be seen if the new rate will entice Pandora back to the UK The PRS , which distributes royalties to songwriters , collected a record £ 117 million in the first three months of 2009 .
Steve Purdham , head of the music streaming service We7 , told BBC News he welcomed the new charges .
" It 's brilliant .
Not so much the rates but the realisation by the PRS that things have to change in the digital world .
" Till now it 's felt like they were not listening , " he said .
The PRS 's managing director , Andrew Shaw , told the BBC that its hands had been somewhat tied by a previous tribunal ruling .
" You need to understand the background .
In 2007 we published the proposed rates and there were a number of services who objected and so it went to the tribunal , who fixed the rates for a two year period .
" That said , we are not a commercial organisation ; we 're a not - for - profit organisation owned by its members and they control what we do , " he said .
" Back then our members were uncertain whether streaming services were viable and had spent millions on a tribunal and , at the time , were not minded to throw it all away . "
The PRS hope the new rates will enable digital music to reach a wider audience .
Mr Purdham said it remained to be seen if it would be enough to lure YouTube and Pandora back to the UK market .
" They [ the PRS ] are getting in touch with the reality of the digital world , " he said .
" It 's a big step and a good indicator that YouTube and Pandora may come back .
The PRS have shown that it is no longer a one sided argument any more . "
Mr Shaw said it was now down to firms to respond .
" We 've laid our stall out and listened to everyone who would engage with us .
We 've consulted with the 25 firms that represent 97 % of our revenue over the past six months and have been given opinions from many others .
" We need to ensure the music artists are paid for their work , but we also wanted to make sure that the framework was in place to enable the digital market to grow , " he said .
YouTube issued a statement that said : " We welcome any efforts to make licensing costs more realistic , but as we 're still in discussions with the PRS to agree license terms for YouTube we 're unable to comment further . "

Ultimate Magic Cube
Welcome to the home page of Ultimate Magic Cube ( UMC ) , the computer program that lets you create your own Rubik 's cube like puzzles .
This program is for the true Rubik enthusiast who can't get enough of the twisty puzzles .
You can download the full version here .
With it you can make countless more puzzles of your own .
Below is a tour of what UMC has to offer .
Many thanks to Leo Izen for creating the installer .
System requirements : Windows XP or Vista ( I have n't tried UMC on older operating systems , but it might work ) , NVidia 5000 series videocard ( or ATI equivalent ) or better , Directx 9 or better .
you need Winrar to unzip Ultimate Magic Cube 2
Important : You also need to install Dot Net Framework 4 and XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0
Tour of Ultimate Magic Cube
The program works by first having a platonic solid as a shape .
There are 5 platonic solids : Tetrahedron , Cube , Octahedron , Dodecahedron and Icosahedron :
Then cuttingplanes are added to the shape .
There are 3 types of cuttingplanes : Cuttingplanes which are parallel to the faces of the shape , ' parallel ' to the points of the shape or parallel to the edges of the shape .
Here are three pictures to make it clearer :
Cuttingplanes parallel to the faces Cuttingplanes ' parallel ' to the points Cuttingplanes parallel to the edges
These 3 types of cuttingplanes can also be mixed together on one shape :
Face and point cuttingplanes mixed together Face and edge cuttingplanes mixed together
This gives almost limitless possibilities , from traditional puzzles :
to mixed cubes , some of which are all new :
The second feature of UMC is to connect any cubies you like to make certain rotations impossible ( a so called bandaged puzzle ) .
This can greatly increase the difficulty of a puzzle .
The third feature of UMC is to allow the cubies to have an orientation by giving the outside coloured stickers faded colours .
Thus a cuby not only has to be on the right spot , but also has to have the right orientation :
ISTANBUL , Turkey ( CNN ) -- U.S. officials have taken " very seriously " a plot to assassinate President Barack Obama involving a Syrian man who was arrested late last week in Turkey , according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter .
President Barack Obama addresses the Turkish parliament on Monday .
But the officials strongly cautioned that American presidents are frequent targets of threats that are all watched very carefully , and in this case the alleged plotter did not appear to get anywhere close to Obama during his European tour .
The officials also noted that while Obama gets more threats than usual as the first African - American U.S. president , this particular threat did not force any change to his schedule .
" Life goes on , " said one of the officials familiar with the matter , who suggested the threat may be getting more attention because there has been a heavy international focus on Obama 's first overseas trip since taking office .
White House officials declined to comment on the matter , citing a policy of not talking about security and threats around the president .
U.S. Secret Service officials spoke only briefly about the case .
" We work closely with the host country whenever there is an arrest , which we are doing in this matter , " Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said .
The plot was first reported by the Saudi Arabian newspaper al - Watan , which revealed that Turkish security services arrested a man of Syrian origins Friday in connection with a plan to kill Obama during his visit to Turkey .
Obama was in Strasbourg , France , on Friday for a NATO summit and did not arrive in Turkey for the final leg of his trip until Sunday .
The Saudi paper reported the suspect , who was carrying an Al - Jazeera TV press credential in the name of " M.G. , " confessed to authorities after his arrest that he and three alleged accomplices plotted to stab Obama with a knife during the Alliance of Civilizations Summit in Istanbul , which Obama attended on Monday evening .
The U.S. officials confirmed those allegations , but stressed to CNN that the information provided by the man is still being verified .
Al - Jazeera 's bureau chief in Ankara , Turkey , Yucef al - Sharif , told the newspaper his news organization knew nothing about the man and suggested he may have obtained a forged press credential .
According to U.S. officials , it 's unclear whether the man , a permanent resident of Istanbul , had obtained a real press credential .
On Sunday , U.S. and international journalists covering Obama 's trip did face more extensive searches of their baggage than usual by the U.S. Secret Service before boarding a press charter flight from the Prague , Czech Republic , region to Ankara .
The same extensive searches were conducted Monday before a flight from Ankara to Istanbul .
But U.S. officials downplayed the possibility the more extensive searches were done out of concern that plotters may have infiltrated the media .
Instead , the officials suggested that since Turkish security officials had not necessarily handled such a large crush of media before , U.S. Secret Service officials simply wanted to go the extra mile in their searches .

A commenter on a Chinese forum for Apple aficionados who claims to have a friend that works at iPhone manufacturer Foxconn says the prototypes of new iPhone hardware he has seen differ little in appearance from the iPhone 3G .
The majority of the upgrades appear to be fairly modest updates to the internal hardware .
As previous rumors have suggested , the camera is said to be updated with higher resolution and autofocus , a digital compass is added , and the flash capacity will be doubled to 16GB or 32GB .
The CPU supposedly will see a speed bump to about 600MHz and the RAM will be doubled to 256MB , resulting in performance that has " really improved . "
The 3.5 " touchscreen and battery will " regrettably " be the same .
That Apple would do little to change the overall design or appearance of the iPhone should not come as a surprise .
The iPhone 3G is only slightly different in appearance to the original iPhone , after all .
And , while the forum poster — who goes by the handle patapon200 — characterizes keeping the same 480x320 px , 3.5 " touchscreen as " very regrettable , " changing anything about the screen would radically change the user interaction that is so focal to using an iPhone .
It would likely break compatibility with the tens of thousands of apps in the App Store , too .
If this information is right , the new iPhone may not be a compelling upgrade for many iPhone 3G users — though a camera upgrade has us here at Ars excited .
Still , it would definitely make a great smartphone for any new user .
Keeping the hardware mostly the same extends Apple 's platform for iPhone OS , which , along with the deluge of third - party apps , is where most of the iPhone magic comes from .
In the tech world , Christmas time is key to successful sales .
Failing to release Windows Vista by December 25 , 2006 was a large setback for Microsoft , which afterwards watched in vain as consumers opted for the older XP instead .
It 's not clear if a Christmas release would have changed that for the likes of Vista , but holiday sales may have helped cement it as a ' must - have ' for consumers .
That said , Microsoft will likely not make that same mistake again .
The Redmond - based company has confirmed that Windows 7 will in fact be released in time for the holidays , and the move could help drive up excitement even more .
Consumers worldwide are hoping that the software giant has ironed out the many issues that prevented Vista from living up to a mountain of hype .
Microsoft : " We 're going for holiday ... "
Bill Veghte , Microsoft 's senior vice president for Windows Business , made the announcement in a well - attended keynote address at the company 's TechEd conference in Los Angeles on Monday .
" We 're going for holiday and we 're tracking very , very well for it , " said Veghte .
Microsoft has remained very quiet on the ultimate release date for Windows 7 , perhaps trying to keep the hype and the expectations in check after the January 2007 debacle that was Vista .
Even after the company released a near - final Release Candidate last week , it still refused to offer a finer explanation of its plans for the complete version of Windows 7 .
Most rumors suggested Windows 7 would be released later this year , but others felt the new OS might follow in the footsteps of its predecessor -- however , given Vista 's infamy , it 's understandable that Microsoft would push , and push hard , for a Christmas release .
( Source : reuters.com )
Will Win7 Boost PC Sales ?
The big payoff for Microsoft is expected to be in PC sales , since many consumers often look towards laptops and desktops when considering Christmas presents for friends and family .
Since Windows 7 has thus far received generally positive fanfare , a December release could lead to big sales for both Microsoft and computer retailers like Best Buy .
Microsoft 's other big challenge will be winning over businesses , who for the most part could n't care less if the new OS is released in December or February .
However , Microsoft promises it has been working hard to meet the demands of beta testers , improving compatibility by working closely with third parties .
" This is something we spent huge , huge cycles on , " Veghte insisted .
" There should be no surprises . " ( Source : crn.com )
T here is a crazy , quiet air of desperation around Stephen Harper .
On the surface , the Prime Minister is – as always – the personification of iron self - discipline .
On television , he speaks in measured tones , his sentences deliberately interspersed with tight little smiles to suggest friendliness .
But the increasingly bizarre actions of his government suggest that this is a façade .
In his first term , Harper managed to walk the fine line between pleasing the general public and placating his much more conservative base .
Now , with that base uneasy about his interventionist approach to the economy , he flounders .
Almost every week , the government comes up with something new to divert red-meat conservatives away from Ottawa 's ballooning deficit .
The most recent was the government 's abrupt , and almost certainly unconstitutional decision to prevent Canadian citizen Abousfian Abdelrazik from returning home to Canada .
Abdelrazik 's story is Kafka - esque .
Returning to Sudan in 2003 to visit his mother , the Montrealer was jailed by local authorities as a suspected terrorist .
The Sudanese released him after 11 months , declaring that he was innocent .
The RCMP say they have nothing against him .
Still , he could n't get on a plane to come home because the U.S. had , by this time , placed him on an international no - fly list ( albeit one that does not bar the repatriation of citizens stranded abroad ) .
Meanwhile , Ottawa said it would issue him temporary travel documents ( his passport expired while he was being tortured ) if he could arrange a flight .
Last week , aided by luminaries such as former UN ambassador Stephen Lewis , Abdelrazik did so .
But just as he was due to board his flight home , Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon announced that no travel papers would be issued , calling Abdelrazik a security risk .
That 's not the first time that Harper 's government has played the national security card .
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney turned Canada into an international joke last month when he declared British MP George Galloway a security risk and barred him from the country .
Like the Abdelrazik decision , that made sense only as a blatantly political move designed to show Harper 's core supporters that , in spite of his new economic heresies , the Prime Minister remains an unrepentant hardliner .
So , too , Defence Minister Peter MacKay 's otherwise inexplicable public attack on Russia earlier this year for daring to fly a military plane in international air space near Canada .
Even U.S. military officials found MacKay 's tirade unwarranted .
Some have suggested that MacKay did this as part of his failed bid to become NATO secretary - general .
If so , it was a doomed gesture .
The more logical explanation is that MacKay , like Cannon and Kenney , was acting under orders to appease the Conservative base and allow control - conscious Harper to reassert his grip .
Because that grip is starting to slip .
Some on the right of his party were ready to dump Harper when he almost lost government last fall .
His conversion to Keynesian stimulus economics alarmed still more , as has his reversal of fortunes in Quebec and his clumsy feud with former prime minister Brian Mulroney .
Events are starting to spin out of control .
Another politician might go with the flow .
Stephen Harper 's instinct is to hunker down and rebuild the dikes .

Hungry men were attracted to heavier women
A study of 61 male university students found those who were hungry were attracted to heavier women than those who were satiated .
The hungry men also paid much less attention to a woman 's body shape and regarded less curvy figures as more attractive .
The study appears in The British Journal of Psychology .
Food lust
Although it is not clear exactly how hunger exerts an influence on attraction , past research suggests social , cultural and psychological factors are involved .
In some societies where food is a limited resource , such as the South Pacific , higher body weights are revered .
In others where food is abundant , such as the West , lower female body weights are preferred .
Your cognitive state , your drives and your interests are dependent on your underlying physiology , your blood sugar levels and your hormone levels and these depend upon hunger
Co-researcher Dr Martin Tovée , from Newcastle University
Evolutionary psychologists believe this is a survival preference .
What you are looking for in a mate is the best chance of healthy offspring and in an environment where food is scarce , a heavier woman is deemed a safer bet for this .
What can be regarded as a normal and acceptable body size is also influenced by what we see , including advertising , and can change .
For example , migrants from rural to urban societies show an increasing idealisation of thinner figures .
Dr Viren Swami from University College London and Dr Martin Tovée from Newcastle University believe there are biological factors at work too .
Physical drives
Dr Tovée explained : " Your cognitive state , your drives and your interests are dependent on your underlying physiology , your blood sugar levels and your hormone levels and these depend upon hunger . "
In the West , lower female body weights are preferred
They recruited male university students as they entered or exited a campus dining hall during dinner time .
They asked the men to rate how hungry they were on a scale of one to seven .
Using these responses , the researchers selected 30 hungry and 31 satiated men to take part in the study .
The men were then asked to rate the attractiveness of 50 women of varying weights , all within a healthy range , who had been photographed wearing tight grey leotards and leggings .
The hungry men rated more of the heavier women as attractive than the men who were full up .
Dr Tovée said : " This shows how physiology does impact on our perceptions and thought processes . "
He said the work also tied in with the resources model - in times of food scarcity , a heavier woman becomes the ideal .
Eating disorders
" Obviously we only saw a small shift in preference but it is a significant shift .
If you were to extrapolate it onwards to people missing many meals and getting hungrier and hungrier over a longer period of time you might start to see a bigger shift . "
They now plan to look at how hunger impacts on female attraction to males .
Dr Tovée said the findings might be completely different for women , particularly given the distorted body image perception of women with anorexia .
" Research suggests women 's ability to judge not only their own but also other people 's body shape is linked to their own body mass .
As their body mass declines they tend to overestimate body mass .
So the more weight they lose , the bigger they think they are . "
The work could also help further our understanding of obesity , he said .
" A lot of what we are doing is looking at how flexible these representations of body size and shape are and the effect of environment .
If you are growing up in an environment where you are seeing heavier body types , is this what you set your norm ?
" We know that diet is related to social class and obesity tends to be class related too .
So we are looking at how diet then impacts on your ideals and perceptions of what is a good or bad body shape . "
U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez
is proposing a federal grant program to research and educate children about Internet safety , according to an Associated Press report .
Menedez , D - N.J. , said he is hopeful that educating teenagers , teachers and parents will stop children from sending explicit photos of themselves over cell phones and the Internet .
The grant proposal would authorize $ 25 million to $ 35 million each year for Internet safety programs .
The grants would be awarded on a two - year basis and administered by the Department of Justice .
Menendez expects to introduce the grant proposal next week .
He is scheduled to discuss the program today at George Washington Middle School in Ridgewood , N.J .
The school hosts a peer - to - peer program called Teenangels , in which teen volunteers spread the word about Internet safety .
Prosecutors in many states are struggling with how to proceed in cases where teens have used the Internet or cell phones to spread explicit photos of themselves or other teens in a practice called " sexting . "
Their actions technically amount to distribution of child pornography , a charge that could land the offending teen in jail and on sex offender registries .
Last month , New Jersey authorities arrested a 14 - year - old girl from Clifton who posted nude photos of herself on MySpace.com .
She was charged with child pornography and distribution of child pornography .
In Pennsylvania , 17 teens who helped distribute photos of a scantily - clad classmate over their cell phones agreed to participate in a five - week , after - school program to resolve charges filed by the district attorney .
In a lehighvalleylive .com poll last month , 56 percent of respondents said they think teens should be criminally prosecuted for circulating obscene photos of themselves or others ?
What do you think ?

Nouriel Roubini wrote in March that Goldman Sachs was insolvent :
So for the Treasury to hide behind the “ systemic risk ” excuse to fork out another $ 30 billion to AIG is a polite way to say that without such a bailout ( and another half - dozen government bailout programs such as TAF , TSLF , PDCF , TARP , TALF and a program that allowed $ 170 billion of additional debt borrowing by banks and other broker - dealers , with a full government guarantee ) , Goldman Sachs and every other broker - dealer and major U.S. bank would already be fully insolvent today .
Yet Goldman reported a $ 1.7 billion dollar profit for last quarter .
How did Goldman do it ?
Well , as Floyd Norris – chief financial correspondent for the New York Times – explains , Goldman simply did n’t report results for December 2008 , a month in which it took huge write - downs .
Its easy to look profitable when you can cook the books . . .
Update : Congressman Grayson is talking about this as well .

Comment on this article
We 're all on the same path : to simply find ourselves .
Originally my nerdy , how - to video blog , GeekGirlKnows.com has become so much more .
Welcome !
While the entertainment industries push for harsher copyright laws , public opinion steers in the opposite direction .
Two recent studies from Canada and Spain found that half of the Internet users use p2 p networks to download music , software and films .
Less than 5 % of the respondents believe that people who download copyrighted content are engaging in criminal behavior .
In recent years many studies have shown that a large chunk of Internet users share copyrighted files on P2P networks , and this number is rapidly increasing every year .
The results of a Canadian study published today show that 45 % of all those surveyed use file - sharing networks to download movies and music .
Also , this behavior is widely accepted since only 3 % of the people who participated in the study said that file - sharers should be punished by law .
These results are not unique to Canada either .
A few weeks ago a Spanish survey found pretty much the same results ( pdf ) .
Of the thousands of Internet users questioned , more than half admitted using file - sharing software regularly .
In fact , 28 % said they use it every day .
Only 1 % of the respondents saw downloading copyrighted files as criminal behavior , while 43 % said that the development of P2P networks should be promoted .
The results of these two reports clearly show that public opinion is changing in favor of P2P users .
So how did this happen ?
Could it be that the Internet has changed the way we interact with digital media ?
Unlike 10 years ago , people are now used to unlimited access to all kinds of information , much of it thanks to Google .
The Internet allows people to access an unlimited library of information , and at an increasing rate people demand the same experience for TV , music and other forms of digital information , as the studies show .
Meanwhile , entertainment industry lobbyists do all they can to get tougher copyright laws in place , and to get repeated copyright infringers disconnected by their ISPs .
They argue that filesharing is hurting content creators , even though research indicates that the opposite might actually be true .
So what ’s going on here ?
Could it be that the bosses at the record labels and movie companies are trying to slow down innovation simply because they want to preserve their old business models ?
The people who actually create the movies and music want their content to be shared , only the large corporations behind it are too afraid to move on .
Lobby groups such as the MPAA and the RIAA represent the distributors of movies and music , NOT the creators .
They even pay politicians to support their cause by voting for or against laws so that legislation is made with their interests in mind .
Is that moral ?
When some of the most successful musicians start their own lobby group to take on the record labels for their alleged extortion practices , there ’s clearly something wrong .
So should sharing copyrighted material be legalized ?
Not per se , but the entertainment industry should focus on monetizing filesharing networks instead of bringing them down .
The Internet has drastically changed the way people consume music and other forms of entertainment .
Every piece of information is only a few clicks away , and people demand the same for their music and other types of media .
There are no boundaries anymore .
15 years ago it was unthinkable that someone could have access to millions of songs , on demand .
Now , this has become reality , but the music industry is still hesitant to offer such a service .
The answer really is to compete with piracy .
Right now most of the online music services do n’t offer a very good experience or are simply too expensive .
Most of them still include some form of DRM , no unlimited access , or a limited library .
“ All you can eat ” plans are the future though , either for a small fee or ad supported .
If it ’s done right , the motivation to download something illegally will simply disappear , at least for the majority of the people .
This aside , it is likely to generate more revenue for the artist and labels .
Everybody wins .

Cheney :
Do n't blame us for economic woes , ' stuff happens ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane

As the state of the economy has worsened , both political parties have increasingly attempted to lay the blame on each other .
Republicans and conservative commentators have begun speaking of an " Obama bear market , " while the president himself affirms with increasing bluntness that " my administration has inherited a fiscal disaster . "
Former Vice - President Dick Cheney added his voice to the bickering on Sunday , in his first interview since leaving the White House .
While acknowledging to CNN's John King that " the economic circumstances that [ Obama ] inherited are difficult ones , " Cheney also insisted , " I do n't think you can blame the Bush administration for the creation of those circumstances . "
" The notion that you can just sort of throw it off on the prior administration -- that 's interesting rhetoric , but I do n't think anybody really cares about that , " Cheney stated .
Later in the interview , King put up a chart of " The Bush - Cheney Record , " showing that between 2001 and 2008 that had been a leap unemployment from 4.2 % to 7.6 % , substantial increases in the ranks of the poor and the uninsured , and a shift in the federal budget from a yearly surplus of $ 128 billion to a deficit of $ 1.3 trillion .
" There are people , I assume , watching this interview right now , " King suggested , " and people in this town who would say , ' Why should we listen to you ?
...
What did you do when you were in charge ? ' "
In responding , Cheney chose to ignore the employment figures and focus solely on the budget deficits .
" There 's something that 's more important than the specific numbers you 're talking about , " he told King .
" Eight months after we arrived we had 9/11 .
We had three thousand Americans killed one morning .
...
We immediately had to go into wartime mode .
...
We had major problems with respect to things like Katrina .
...
All of these things required us to spend money . "
" Stuff happens , " Cheney summarized , " and an administration has to be able to respond to that -- and we did . "
In addition to ignoring the plight of the poor and unemployed , Cheney also brushed aside most of the other priorities of the Obama administration , charging that " they 've taken liberties , if you will , with the arguments " in describing health care reform and action on climate change as essential to long - term economic prosperity .
According to Cheney , the Obama administration is merely " using the current set of economic difficulties to try to justify a massive expansion in the government and much more authority for the government over the private sector . "
Cheney 's own prescription for resolving the current economic crisis would begin , not surprisingly , with tax cuts for the wealthy .
" Given the importance to the country ... of getting the economy back on track , it seems to me an administration does have an obligation to set priorities , " he stated .
" One of the tools that 's most important to doing that is tax policy , and cutting taxes , especially for those who invest and create wealth and create jobs . "

As a growing collection of Manhattan ’s most celebrated public elementary schools notify neighborhood parents that their children have been placed on waiting lists for kindergarten slots , middle - class vitriol against the school system  and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg  is mounting .
Parents are venting their frustrations in e-mail messages and phone calls to the mayor , local politicians and the schools chancellor , Joel I. Klein ( “ You have unleashed the fury of parents throughout this city with your complete lack of preparedness , ” read one father ’s recent missive , which he shared with The New York Times ) .
Some plan a rally on the steps of City Hall for next Wednesday afternoon ( “ Kindergartners Are Not Refugees ! ” proclaims a flier ) , and some are taking it upon themselves to scour the city for potential classroom space .
The outpouring of anger comes as state lawmakers consider whether to renew mayoral control of the city school system , which expires in two months , and Mr. Bloomberg is seeking a third term in part on his education record .
“ I got a call from Mayor Bloomberg ’s campaign about yadda yadda yadda was I going to vote for him , ” said Beth Levison , a documentary filmmaker whose son is No. 79 of 90 on a combined waiting list for Public School 41 and Public School 3 , both in Greenwich Village .
“ As a parent who has a child with no place to go next year , no indication of where he ’s going to go next year as a result of the mayor taking control of education , I said absolutely not .

On the surface , April 1 came and went without a peep from the dreaded Conficker megaworm .
But security experts see a frightening reality , one where Conficker is now more powerful and more dangerous than ever .
Advertisement
In the first minute of April 1 , Conficker did exactly what everyone knew it was going to do :
It successfully phoned home for an update .
And while it was fun to imagine what nasty payload that update may have included ( it was fun , was n't it ? ) , the result was not outwardly catastrophic ; rather than a blueprint for world domination , the update contained instructions on how to dig in even deeper .
Advertisement
" The worm did exactly what everyone thought it was going to do , which is update itself , " security expert Dan Kaminsky , who helped develop a widely - used Conficker scanner in the days leading up to April 1 , told us .
" The world wants there to be fireworks , or some Ebola - class , computers - exploding - all - over - the - world event or God knows what , but the reality is ... the Conficker developers have cemented their ability to push updates through any fences the good guys have managed to build in February and March . "
And here 's why that is deeply , deeply scary .
As we explained , Conficker has built a zombie botnet infrastructure by registering hundreds of spam DNS names ( askcw.com.ru , and the like ) , which it then links up and uses as nodes for infected machines to contact for instructions .
In its earlier forms , Conficker attempted to register 250 such DNS names per day .
But with the third version of the software , the Conficker . c variant which has been floating around for the last month or so , the number of spam DNS takeovers was boosted to 50,000 per day — a number security pros can no longer keep up with .
Advertisement
What the April 1 update did was simple :
It provided instructions for linking up with the thousands , perhaps tens of thousands of new nodes registered by Conficker .c over the last few weeks , effectively growing the size of the p2 p botnet to a point where it can not be stopped .
" It 's not about ownage , it 's about continued ownage , " says Kaminsky , citing a favorite quotation of one of his hacker buddies .
" It 's not about how you get into the network , it 's about , ' How do you be [ there ] a year from now ? ' "
And the answer is : " You do a lot of the things the Conficker developers are doing . "
Advertisement
" This is not something where the guys wrote it , it 's out , then they 're going to go out and play Nintendo .
They 're frankly trying to build something that is a sustainable network for months or years to come , " Kaminsky says .
Kevin Haley , director of Symantec Security Response , raises another good point : " The first [ of April ] would have been a pretty bad day to choose [ to do something with Conficker ] , because everyone was watching to see what was going to happen .
Whoever 's behind this is as lot more patient than we are . "
Advertisement
As far as what comes next ?
More waiting .
Good methods now exist for detecting and cleansing Conficker from infected machines on a network ( and , let 's not forget , a months - old security patch from Microsoft is all you need to protect yourself ) , but by now the size of Conficker 's infected army of nodes spread around the world is big enough to function with devastating consequences even if most PCs are secure .
So we 'll just have to keep waiting to see what this thing does .
Gordon Brown 's plan to reform the system of parliamentary allowances ran into trouble tonight when David Cameron and Nick Clegg flatly rejected Downing Street 's central proposal to introduce a daily allowance for MPs .
The prime minister will put pressure on backbench Labour MPs to support his plans in a parliamentary vote next week after the Tory and Liberal Democrat leaders said they would vote down his scheme .
In a tense 6 pm meeting at the Commons , Cameron warned the prime minister that introducing a daily allowance would pave the way for a corrupt Strasbourg - style system .
" It will be a sign on and bugger off system , " Cameron told the Tory backbench 1922 committee last night .
Brown attempted to seize the initiative on Tuesday when he announced plans to rush through a series of reforms after he was warned of a public backlash against the current system of parliamentary allowances .
His key proposal was to abolish the additional costs allowance , worth £ 24,006 a year , which is used by MPs to subsidise the costs of a second home .
This would be replaced by a daily allowance which would only be paid when parliament is sitting .
The rate would be set by the senior salaries review body .
But government sources said that the daily rate would be between £ 128 and £ 150 , which would work out between £ 17,920 and £ 21,000 a year .
Cameron and Clegg dismissed this system .
One
Tory source said : " We totally rejected what Gordon Brown put forward .
We received no assurances that the prime minister 's scheme would not end up like the system for the European Parliament .
His system is totally corruptible .
The majority of MPs would still be able to claim similar amounts of money . "
The Tory leader told the prime minister that he would attempt to put his own proposals to a vote in the Commons next week .
Cameron would replace the Additional Costs Allowance with a " Transparent Parliamentary Allowance " which would be worth less to MPs .
There would be four key changes :
• Claims could only be made for mortgage interest payments , which would be capped , and for rent , utility bills and council tax .
• The so called " John Lewis list " would be ended by banning claims for furniture , televisions , home decorations , television bills , stamp duty and moving costs .
• All claims , with receipts , would be published online within 28 days .
• MPs who live together would only be allowed to claim once .
Cameron accepted other proposals put forward by the prime minister .
These include greater transparency on MPs ' second jobs – mainly aimed at shadow cabinet members who work in the City – and making MPs ' staff direct employees of parliament .
Cameron said after his meeting with Brown : " Sadly , what is clear is that the prime minister is absolutely wedded to his idea of having a system where we pay MPs to turn up and do their job .
What he 's effectively doing is replacing a system where you have to produce some receipts with a system where you get the money without having to produce any receipts , it 's completely untransparent .
I simply do n't think the British public will accept that and so I think we 'll have to oppose it . "
The Tories had initially thought that they would have to sign up to the prime minister 's plan on the grounds that he would portray them as opponents of reform .
But when it became clear overnight on Tuesday that the daily allowance was being seen as a new version of the discredited Strasbourg system they realised they could say no .
Government sources indicated tonight that Brown would press ahead with the Commons vote next week even without the support of Cameron and Clegg .
The prime minister believes that the Tory proposal would still give MPs an incentive to take out large mortgages .
" There is some scepticism about their plans , " one source said .

Bank losses are even bigger than expected one year ago , the IMF says The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has warned credit crunch losses could reach $ 4 trillion ( £ 2.75tn ) , damaging the financial system for years to come .
It says that even if urgent action is taken to clean up the banking system , the process will be " slow and painful " , delaying economic recovery .
Banks may need $ 1.7 trillion in additional capital , the IMF forecasts .
And it warns that the cost of the bail - out will severely hit UK government finances with its added debt burden .
The power to force banks to raise additional capital rests with national regulators , such as the FSA , not the IMF
Robert Peston
BBC Business Editor
Read Robert 's blog
But the IMF corrected its estimate of the cost to the UK of the bail - out from 13.4 % of GDP , or £ 200bn , to 9.4 % of GDP , or £ 130bn .
The Treasury confirmed that the chancellor will be making a " prudent " estimate of the cost of the bail - out in the Budget , but many commentators believe this will be around £ 60bn , or half the IMF estimate .
The US and Ireland will face even higher government bills for the bail - out , according to IMF estimates .
Rising bill
One year ago , the IMF estimated that total losses from the credit crunch would be $ 1tn , which has been exceeded , showing how rapidly the financial meltdown has escalated .
The IMF now says that banks are likely to lose $ 2.7tn , but other financial institutions such as insurance companies and pension funds are also coming under strain .
And it says that emerging market economies , which will need $ 1.8tn in refinancing next year , will be hard - hit by the collapse of cross - border lending .
It predicts that there will be no net private lending at all to developing countries this year .
WHY $ 4TN LOSS MATTERS
The banks ' huge losses have made them reluctant to lend
The lack of lending has pushed the world economy into a deep recession Government budgets are strained by the cost of the bail - outs , hitting taxpayers
The report comes as the IMF and World Bank are beginning their spring meeting in Washington , after receiving a promise of $ 750bn in fresh funds agreed at the G20 summit .
Policy response
The IMF 's latest Global Stability Report says that the banking system has not yet been stabilised , despite the billions of dollars spent by governments .
But it warns that political support for further bank bail - outs is waning .
It says that there may be " a real risk that governments will be reluctant to allocate enough resources to solve the problem " because the public has become " disillusioned by what it perceives as abuse of taxpayer funds " .
The situation is especially difficult in the US , where Congress appears reluctant to allocate additional bail - out funds above the $ 700bn approved last autumn despite the inclusion of another $ 750bn in President Obama 's latest budget proposal .
Systemic risks remain high and the adverse feedback loop between the financial system and the real economy has yet to be arrested
IMF
The US Treasury has instead proposed a private - public partnership to buy up troubled assets underwritten by loans from the Federal Reserve .
But the IMF comments that " uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the the private sector will constructively engage in finding orderly solution to financial stress " .
Deeper recession
The IMF says that restoring the banking system so that it functions normally is likely to take several years , and this will make the recession longer and deeper than usual .
But it warns that if policies are unclear or not implemented forcefully and promptly , " the recovery process is even more delayed and the costs , in terms of taxpayer money and economic activity , are even greater " .
It adds that the worldwide recession has deepened the financial crisis .
COST OF REBUILDING BANKS US banks : $ 275 bn Eurozone banks : $ 725bn UK banks : $ 250 bn Other European banks : $ 225 bn Source : IMF , based on 6 % capital / assets ratio " Systemic risks remain high and the adverse feedback loop between the financial system and the real economy has yet to be arrested , despite the wide range of policy actions and some limited improvement in market functioning .
" Further effective government action - particularly geared toward cleansing balance sheets and strengthening institutions - will be required to stabilise the global financial system and to provide the foundation for a sustainable economic recovery . "
On Wednesday , the IMF will present its world economic forecast .
It is expected to be the gloomiest for 60 years , with the world falling into a global recession , and an even sharper decline in output in the rich countries .
An earlier version of this story referred to an IMF estimate that the total cost of bailing out the UK banking system would add 13.4 % , or about £ 200bn , to government debt .
The IMF has since corrected this figure , and has returned to its earlier estimate that it would cost 9.4 % of GDP , or about £ 130bn .

A lot of people miss the cane sugar sodas we drank as kids , before beverage companies switched to high fructose corn syrup .
They savor imported alternatives like Mexican Coke or kosher sodas , but it 's not quite the same .
I 've got good news for you : the geek elixir , Mountain Dew , which facilitated countless late - night programming sessions since its inception , will be released in cane - sugar format this summer called Mountain Dew Throwback :
" This spring , Pepsi and Mountain Dew are inviting consumers on a nostalgic trip back in time by offering special retro versions of these popular beverages . "
" The Pepsi Throwback and Mountain Dew Throwback packaging feature a retro look and are sweetened with natural sugar , just as they were back in the '60s and ' 70s , to give consumers a taste of the past "
( oh yeah , Pepsi too . )
The program officially starts April 20th but I have n't found any near me , but I can't wait !

The Southeast has enough renewable resources to meet the 25 percent renewable - power mandate proposed by draft House energy and climate legislation , according to a new assessment [ pdf ] by environmental groups .
The report was released today as lawmakers negotiate over whether to scale back the renewable electricity standard in the bill sponsored by Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) and Rep. Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) .
A dozen or so moderate and conservative committee Democrats want to lower the target .
Southeastern lawmakers , who say their states could not meet the targets , say their districts would face higher costs because utilities would be forced to buy credits or make other payments .
But the World Resources Institute paper argues the target is more than achievable , finding that renewable energy could supply as much as 30 percent of the region 's power needs within 15 years .
It calls for a range of policies , such as low - interest loans and strong state interconnection standards that enable new renewables to link to the grid .
The paper is a survey of existing research and assessments by the federal government and other experts .
" Right now we are depending on other regions of the country , and foreign countries like Columbia and Venezuela , to supply us with coal .
Does n't it make more sense to be producing cleaner power , closer to home ? , " said Stephen Smith , head of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy , one of the groups that released the study with WRI .
" Our research suggests we certainly have sufficient resources . "
Renewables were used to meet 5 percent of Southeast power sales in 2006 , according to the paper , which defines the region as Alabama , the Carolinas , Florida , Georgia , Mississippi , Tennessee and Virginia .
A nationwide renewable electricity standard is a major goal for Democratic leaders and environmentalists .
The draft bill would require utilities above a certain size to supply 25 percent of their power from renewable sources like wind , solar and biomass energy by 2025 , although efficiency measures could be used to meet a fifth of the target .
Waxman had offered a lower renewable target of 17.5 percent , according to Rep. Gene Green ( D - Texas ) , a member of the committee .
Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) called the RES a " moving target . "
" There have been at least three different proposals back and forth , " Stupak said in a short interview yesterday .
" It is very active . "
Rep. Jay Inslee ( D - Wash . ) , one of the panel 's more liberal members , said there should be " flexibility " to address regional issues but warned against watering down either the bill 's emissions or renewable energy targets .
" We have to keep our eyes on the prize and actually achieve something , " Inslee said .

👉 Mortgage Market Meltdown : Delinquencies Reach Highest Level Since 2011 !!
A house was a need , then it became an asset , and now an investment , and even speculative instrument in many cities .
Buying a house in 2020 would be like buying a house in 2006 !
Anyone who buys a house right now is either a millionaire or an idiot .
In about September or a little bit after , the government stimulus package will end , and you will see the real economy plays out .
Layoffs will skyrocket , followed by bankruptcies , followed by foreclosures , and followed by the great abyss of depression .
The average house is way beyond affordable for the average income in many areas of the country .
We are overdue for a correction .
It is a myth that an average income person should be able to afford an average priced home .
There is a reason why less than 2/3 of Americans own their homes , and the rest are renters .
If you have a mortgage or you 're looking to take a mortgage out in their future or even refinance , then you definitely need to watch this video to make sure that you 're fully informed .
There is a clear imbalance between the state of the economy and the price level in the housing market .
To take advantage of the low mortgage rate , it 's unwise to pay $ 100 K more in the conforming or $ 200 K more in the jumbo market .
V - shaped short - term reversal is not ' necessarily ' recovery ; a recovery is a sustainable event , so it 's too early to talk about recovery .
Welcome back to The Atlantis Report .
You are here for your daily dose of the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth .
Please take a second to smash that like button .
Thank You .
Nobody in their right mind should acquire any more debt at this time .
Instead , everyone should focus on getting out of debt and save , save , save for that mansion that ’s around the corner .
The average house is way beyond affordable for the average income in many areas of the country .
We are overdue for a correction .
The housing crash will happen after the auto loan default and credit card default .
The housing market will be called next ; it is a domino effect .
The U.S. Housing Market Crisis Is Inevitable ; Here 's Why .
Today U.S. household debt tops $ 14 trillion and reaches a new record .
It added $ 193 billion of debt in the fourth quarter , driven by a surge in mortgage loans , and overall debt levels rose to a new record .
Mortgage balances rose by $ 120 billion in the fourth quarter to $ 9.56 trillion .
Now just to put all of this into perspective ;
In 2008 , our entire economy had a meltdown .
The banks collapsed because of mortgage debt , guess how much !
How much was that debt back in 2008 ; 800 billion dollars !
The unemployment rate today in 2020 is higher than 16 percent .
Real unemployment as per shadow stats is closer to 40 percent .
Compare that to less than 10 percent rate in 2008 when we had an economic bust .
The economy is a dead man walking .
Today Home - Mortgage Delinquencies Reach Highest Level Since 2011 .
Only 15 % of homeowners in forbearance made payments as of June 15 , down from 28 % in May and 46 % in April .
What we have now is historic debt ; a historic number of people with no income,45 million are jobless , and forbearance that allows those folks to not pay their bills until six months from now .
The big question is , what happens six months from now when they have to start paying back their bills !
What happens when the gravy train runs out !
Many experts are claiming that very soon .
You wo n't even be able to get a mortgage because so many banks and mortgage providers will be going bankrupt .
Overall the banks have a very very high risk of taking on any new mortgages right now , and they know it .
This is why they are declining mortgage applications in record numbers .
We 're already seeing tighter lending policies , especially if millions of people are now going to be living off 80 percent of their previous earnings .
According to the mortgage bankers association or the MBA , about 8.55 of the mortgages are currently in forbearance , and that equates to about 4.3 million homeowners .
Black knight , a company that provides data to the real estate and mortgage industries , reported that about 80 percent of people in forbearance right now have at least 20 percent equity in their homes .
The homeowners who are at greatest risk of losing their house to foreclosure down the road are those who have lost their job and are not getting their job back .
And despite The Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero , surprisingly , mortgage lenders have actually increased their rates .
This is due to the high demand they claim .
The banks are not your friends .
You 've got to get that clear ; they are not your friends .
The banks know that a lot of people are afraid of losing their jobs , so they 're increasing these interest rates .
And people have n't really got a choice ; they either accept it now , or they wait knowing they may lose their job and they wo n't be able to get a mortgage .
So really these banks are preying on vulnerable people .
The bank pay 's you .05 % interest on your savings account , but charge you 18 % compounding interest on your credit card .
Wo n't help much when 65 % of Americans could n't afford or have the means to cover a $ 400 emergency , and that was pre-COVID .
So , wheres the downpayment going to come from !
70 % of Americans carry $ 10 k or more in credit card debt .
Millions of people have lost their jobs permanently during COVID .
How and who will benefit from record low mortgages ?
The people who already own and corporations that eat up the property .
Unless they are going to loosen up lending restrictions and get back to subprime mortgages , which will lead to another 08 recession , once the pent - up demand due to the lockdowns wanes and the statutory restrictions are withdrawn .
The real estate market will see a steady decline .
The mere fact that 45 Million people lost their jobs and the vast majority of whom are homeowners will negatively impact the real estate market .
Americans have skipped payments on more than 100 million student loans , auto loans , and other forms of debt since the coronavirus hit the US .
The latest sign of the toll the pandemic is taking on people ’s finances .
The number of accounts that enrolled in deferment , forbearance , or some other type of relief since March 1 and remain in such a state rose to 106 million at the end of May , triple the number at the end of April , according to credit - reporting firm TransUnion .
US home - mortgage delinquencies climbed in May to the highest level since November 2011 as the pandemic ’s toll on personal finances deepened .
The number of borrowers more than 30 days late swelled to 4.3 million , up 723,000 from the previous month , according to property information service Black Knight Inc .
More than 8 % of all U.S. mortgages were past due or in foreclosure .
The increase in delinquencies was smaller than the 1.6 million jumps in April when the economy ground to a halt nationwide .
Still , the path ahead is clouded by the spread of new Covid - 19 cases , uncertainty over business reopenings , and the looming expiration of benefits that have helped jobless homeowners avert delinquency .
Just wait till the mass evictions start , and the government now owns your home or apartment complex .
45 MILLION UNEMPLOYED ;( with many more not counted ) and more underemployed .
And What about the 37 million of homeless people living under the bridges and supermarket parking lots begging for food and winter clothing ; are they accountable to the 45 million jobless !
And Illegals not included , that adds another 10 million easily .
If you want a government - sanctioned hovel , then you must sign up for universal basic income and a vaccine .
Families are going to be thrown out into the streets , and all their luxury items will be seized under civil asset forfeiture .
Black Rock got 2 billion to gobble up homes after the scam of banks telling mortgage holders : " do n't worry for three months " after that , you can't pay everything now ?
Lose it .
They are partners .
Bank gets a kickback for stealing your house for a 15 billion hedge fund that , for some reason , needed 2 billion more .
Black Rock has over $ 7 TRILLION that enables them to purchase huge numbers of bankrupted businesses and foreclosed homes for pennies on the dollar .
They bought up huge swaths of repossessed homes after the 2008 economic meltdown and then drove up rents across the country as absentee landlords .
The US government just handed $ 6 TRILLION to massive bailout corporations like Boeing and cruise lines , while small and medium - sized companies could n’t even get the application submitted for a bailout .
Apparently , this “ bailout ” heist was planned before coronavirus emerged .
The coronavirus is a smokescreen for the biggest heist in history .
The virus did n't inflate this giant bubble .
It just ended it .
The pandemic was used to transfer wealth to eliminate the middle class and enslave the world .
It was a master plan to steal trillions of dollars from taxpayers and save big corporations and Wall Street .
The biggest transfer of wealth in history .
Big banks and corporations were collapsing in debt , the repo market was completely out of control in Sep 2019 , they had to do something , so they used this pandemic as an excuse to get billions of dollars in bailout money .
Hedge funds and Wall Street walked away with billions .
The government bought mortgage - backed security , junk bonds , everything .
Wonder how many houses are going to be owned by banks after this is all said and done .
Like 2008 , except small businesses thrown in this time , it 'll be the greatest transfer of wealth from the middle class in history .
And like all Bank - owned houses , they will be stripped of all the copper , heating eq , anything that can be taken .
Around here , banks let people live in the houses so the thieves would n't wreck them .
Wait for boomers to start moving to Florida and leave the housing market from natural causes .
That 's when prices will really drop .
That 's exactly what 's coming down the road .
All western countries have huge amounts of baby boomers , and when they get older , they will need to cash out .
We will see the biggest housing crash in history .
The only reason prices were going up is everyone was Buying .
Once the boomers start selling , it is the end of real estate .
A huge bust is on its way .
I think you better be prepared .
Get a tent and a hobo stove .
You will need it .
What the fed and the government are doing now is delaying the problem and kicking the can down the road , which makes the problems even bigger in the future .
Everything now because of COVID is in delay mode .
Delaying the problem does not make the problem go away .
It simply sets a new timeline for that problem .
We are living on borrowed time .
When stimulus payments end and the moratorium on evictions is lifted ;
We will see 35 million new homeless by the end of the year .
Over $ 50 million in unpaid mortgages this month alone .
Mortgage literary means " Death Pledge " in Latin .
The Federal Reserve is destroying Savers right now by printing unlimited fiat cash , so the price will be inflation , and a wave of stimulus checks .
Debt - free is the only way out .
Building society and banks pay a pittance for people 's savings but still charge over inflation rate and definitely a lot less than the savings rate , and it this money that they give as mortgages as far as I am concerned legalized thieves .
And Nationwide has adverts saying they are for the people , what a load of tosh .
How they jump from 0.1 % interest to 5 , 10 , or 15 % per year those " mortgage lenders " ?
What kind of job can you have to pay a $ 250 K for a house !
It has no meaning !
But if you calculate in another way , the loan is created to never be repaid , and the " lender " repossessing the house , after a while .
At that moment , the system has a meaning .
A clear mean meaning !
All in the plan .
America will only have the big corporation 's to deal with .
Just look at who and what the government declared as essential , and you will see your future economy , no more middle - class businesses !
The entire made up recession in the name of COVID 19 was to put people in more debt which is an asset for the creditors , More money for Wall Street 's Ponzi scheme .
In Germany , by the way , unemployment went from 4 % to 6 % because the German Government gave money to the People , not the RICH .
The government has a perpetual claim on your assets , and it 's called property taxes .
No one owns anything in America except for the government .
" Buying a house " is a long term rent that is permanently married in with property taxes .
Try to stop paying taxes on a paid - off house , and you will quickly find out who owns your house and the land it sits on , hint - not you !
The concept of ownership implies that a purchase price + sales tax is paid only ONCE .
That being said , a homeowner is someone who voluntarily becomes a lifelong victim of legal racket and extortion .
The tax structure should be changed .
No one should be forced to lose their home in their golden years .
Yet it happens every year .
There are more equitable ways to get the funds needed to support the Government like income tax , sales tax , etc .
In Pennsylvania alone , over 18000 people lost their homes because of the ever - increasing school tax on property .
When the other taxes are used , instead , everyone pays to support the Government services , and the burden is not left on the homeowner .
Housing people are the most optimistic people , but it takes a lot of optimism to buy a house and tie up your income for 30 years , Well , that is easily accomplished when you have real estate agents ( the notorious " Realtors " and mortgage brokers colluding to get people to buy too much house with too big a loan ... it requires instilling a LOT of optimism in that hapless buyer , and by gosh , they do it .
Their commissions depend on suspending the disbelief and caution that any right - minded person would have when being asked to commit to perhaps the most illiquid and most expensive of all assets .
Realtors always say that the best time to buy a home is today , no matter what time of year it is .
A lot of people fall for pump scam .
Buy a house because you want a home , and are willing to make the sacrifices that it will demand of you , but do n't buy it as " an investment . "
If you want good returns , there are many better investments .
The only problem is that they do n't offer the eye - watering leverage you can finagle out of your bank when getting a mortgage .
That gets a lot of people 's greed - meter pinned into the red zone .
As long as prices are too high compared to income ( which it is in many areas ) , there is zero chance of a good year for the housing industry .
The median - income , home buyer in Los Angeles , pays 103 % of his monthly income for his newly bought , median - priced house payment .
The FED might want to focus on making a sustainable economy , and not just focusing on preventing an asset price collapse for the baby boomers .
The more these prices go up ridiculously for various assets , the less confidence I have for the US economy , going forward .
The FED 's version of inflation is not based in reality .
The FED is lying to us about the economy to prop up the over - leveraged banks from collapsing .
Wages can not support current housing prices .
I wonder how property bubble 2.0 will end ?
Soon , only Chinese millionaires and billionaires will own houses in America , and Americans can rent from them .

Speaker Nancy Pelosi should listen to the wise Democrats who are pushing for an ethics inquiry into the far - too - cozy relationship between lawmakers and the PMA Group of superlobbyists .
The Justice Department is investigating whether PMA used illegal straw donors to lard the campaign kitties of cooperative lawmakers .
The firm  which shut itself down after being raided by federal agents  fed and fed richly off the defense appropriations subcommittee led by Representative John Murtha , the House baron of Pentagon spending .
Beyond the criminal investigation , the House needs to look into any violations of its own ethics rules .
And the Democrats need to deliver on their party ’s ethics promises  and more and more of them know it .
As Representative Ron Kind told The Hill newspaper , “ As long as this is not dealt with in the right manner , it ’s just going to be a cloud hanging over us . ”
There ’s plenty of questions to answer .
The firm was led by Paul Magliocchetti , a former appropriations staffer and Murtha protégé who wined and dined his former bosses and comrades with abandon .
These raucous dinners and big expense - account tabs should be vetted for ethics violations .
It seems those scurvy Swedish Pirates might not walk the plank after all -- at least , not so soon .
Turns out the judge who gave the Pirate Bay Four a year in the slammer and fines of $ 3.6 million has a vested interest in punishing copyright scofflaws .
Judge Thomas Norström is a member of the Swedish Copyright Association ( Svenska föreningen för upphovsrätt ) and sits on the board of the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property ( Svenska föreningen för industriellt rättsskydd ) .
[ Get the latest in Robert X. Cringely 's musings and observations with InfoWorld 's Notes from the Underground newsletter . ]
Other members of Svenska föreningen för upphovsrätt include attorneys representing the recording industry in that trial .
( I think I just exhausted my quota of umlauts for the rest of the year -- so much for that long essay on the use of diacritical marks in the names of heavy metal bands . )
TPB4 have accused the judge of having a conflict of interest and plan to ask for a mistrial .
If granted , this would hardly be the first time where the matter of whom the judge played golf and drank scotch with has had more bearing on a decision than the legal merits of a case .
But the bigger issue is the courts ' deep reluctance to join the rest of us here in the 21st century .
Which brings up the other copyright case stuck in my craw , Sony BMG et al v. Tenenbaum .
This is the one where the record companies not only ganged up on a file - swapping college student , they also picked on his parents -- one of whom is an attorney .
The Royally PO'd Tenenbaums then got Harvard law professor Charles Nesson on the case , who decided to use it to test the constitutionality of the RIAA 's thuggish tactics .
Last week an appeals court overturned a ruling by a lower court that allowed Joel Tenenbaum and his attorneys to Webcast proceedings of the trial on his site , JoelFightsBack .
Those of us longing to see the RIAA roasted over an open flame by a team of Harvard legal eagles are now unlikely to get their wish .
The appeals court based its decision on an interpretation of local court rules that say televising proceedings is fine in certain limited circumstances , but only those circumstances .
IANAL , but it seems to me like you could interpret those rules in any way you happen to feel like at the moment .
Among other things , Tenenbaum 's attorneys argued that Webcasting the trial is effectively no different than attending it in person , which is allowed .
First District Court Judge Bruce Selya responded thusly :
While the new technology characteristic of the Information Age may call for the replotting of some boundaries , the venerable right of members of the public to attend federal court proceedings is far removed from an imagined entitlement to view court proceedings remotely on a computer screen .
And that 's all he has to say on the matter .
We 'll just replot those boundaries later , after I 'm retired , so I do n't have to think about anything new .
Of course , any judge who uses phrases like " On close perscrutation , that contention comes to naught , " is probably still wearing powdered wigs and taking laudanum for head colds .
( FYI , " perscrutation " means " a thorough searching ; a minute inquiry or scrutiny , " and yes , I had to look it up . )
Another appeals court judge agreed with Selya 's interpretation of the court rules , but said the court rules are stuck in the dark ages :
... in my view , there are no sound policy reasons to prohibit the webcasting authorized by the district court .
Therefore , this case calls into question the continued relevance and vitality of a rule that requires such a disagreeable outcome ....
Ironically , however , almost immediately after the oral argument in this First Circuit mandamus proceeding ended , anyone with an internet connection could access a recording of that argument from our website .
In other words , it 's against the rules to show you what 's happening in the courtroom as it happens , but perfectly OK to show you a recording of it a few minutes later .
Judge Kermit Lipez adds this coda :
The Local Rule at the center of this controversy was adopted in 1990 .
Since its adoption , dramatic advances in communications technology have had a profound effect on our society .
These new technological capabilities provide an unprecedented opportunity to increase public access to the judicial system in appropriate circumstances .
They have also created expectations that judges will respond sensibly to these opportunities .
Right on , Kermit .
Now , how do we go about finding some sensible judges ?
Does our legal system need a thorough 21st - century overhaul ?

The rhythm game movement has put a plastic guitar in every home and a set of plastic drums in every closet , but is it possible that enough is enough ?
Both Activision Blizzard and Harmonix and MTV Games have released new details about their respective upcoming releases today , but gamers may be overwhelmed by the variety of choices and song selections of the newest batch of rhythm titles .
Activision 's Guitar Hero 5 seems to get away from the band simulation feel of both Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero : World Tour , into an area that 's much more — for lack of a better word — game -y .
You 'll be able to play with any combination of instruments .
Do you want a vocalist and three guitar players ?
That 's doable .
Four drummers ?
No sweat .
Band members will also be able to join or drop out on the fly , and there will be five new head - to - head modes playable either locally or online .
If you 're tired of grinding the game to play the songs , do n't worry : all the tracks will be available from the first time you turn the game on .
Want a little more spice to keep things interesting ?
" New innovations such as Band Moments , where bands are rewarded for hitting special note streams together and song challenges where gamers are tasked to play through a song a specific way , add a new competitive layer of excitement and accomplishment to the music rhythm genre , " Activision explains .
The first songs that will be included with the game have also been released , featuring :
The Rolling Stones - " Sympathy for the Devil "
Bob Dylan - " All Along The Watchtower "
The White Stripes - " Blue Orchid "
Santana - " No One To Depend On ( LIVE ) "
Vampire Weekend - " A - Punk "
Tom Petty - " Runnin Down a Dream "
Johnny Cash - " Ring of Fire "
Kings of Leon - " Sex on Fire "
There will be 85 master tracks included with the game , and downloadable content for World Tour will also be supported , so you 're not wasting your money by buying today 's tracks .
On the other side of the tracks , Harmonix is releasing Rock Band : Unplugged , which features the first online music store for the PSP .
You 'll be able to download tracks for the game using the hardware 's WiFi connection , or your PC or PS3 .
Those tracks are already available as DLC for the other version of the games , although the main set list will have a few songs that will be exclusive to Unplugged for a limited time , such as " ABC " by the Jackson Five and " Would ? " by Alice in Chains .
Without any peripherals , the gameplay in Unplugged looks and feels like the classic Harmonix title Amplitude , where you jump from track to track to keep the music going .
Harmonix also has a potential cash cow , as the company is sitting on a huge list of songs that can be resold to fans via the PSP .
But wait , that 's not all !
DJ
Hero is also scheduled for release this year , bringing a more DJ - centric game and peripheral to the US .
If that does n't scratch your itch for turntables , Scratch ! will also be available with yet another DJ peripheral .
If you want something safer for children , there is Lego Rock Band , which will be just like Rock Band , except with .. you know , Lego characters .
And songs more suited for the younger market .
Activision also wants a piece of the younger market , and is going after it with yet another rhythm game called Band Hero , although not much is known about either product as of this writing .
Do you remember when picking a rhythm game was as easy as choosing between Rock Band and Guitar Hero ?
It looks like those days are long gone , with a variety of products aimed at a variety of demographics .
How many games can the market handle ?
When will gamers simply shut down and stick with the titles they already own ?
Rock Band 2 still is n't boring , with new tracks being released weekly , and turning the Guitar Hero franchise into more of a video game and less of a band experience may be a risky move .
Or maybe the audience really is insatiable and each of these releases will find success .
That 's doubtful however , as companies may soon find the limit to how many plastic instruments one household needs .
One or two of these games may hit big , but for the rest ?
It could be a bloody holiday shopping season .
April 22 , 2009  --
A video tape smuggled out of the United Arab Emirates shows a member of the country 's royal family mercilessly torturing a man with whips , electric cattle prods and wooden planks with protruding nails .
A man in a UAE police uniform is seen on the tape tying the victim 's arms and legs , and later holding him down as the Sheikh pours salt on the man 's wounds and then drives over him with his Mercedes SUV .
In a statement to ABC News , the UAE Ministry of the Interior said it had reviewed the tape and acknowledged the involvement of Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan , brother of the country 's crown prince , Sheikh Mohammed .
" The incidents depicted in the video tapes were not part of a pattern of behavior , " the Interior Ministry 's statement declared .
The Minister of the Interior is also one of Sheikh Issa 's brother .
The government statement said its review found " all rules , policies and procedures were followed correctly by the Police Department . "
" If this is their complete reply , then sadly it 's a scam and it's a sham , " said Sarah Leah Whitson of Human Rights Watch .
" It is the state that is torturing them , " she said , " if the government does not investigate and prosecute these officers , and those commanding those officers . "
The 45 - minute long tape was smuggled out of the country by Bassam Nabulsi , of Houston , Texas , a former business associate of Sheikh Issa .
Nabulsi is now suing the Sheikh in federal court in Houston , alleging he also was tortured by UAE police when he refused to turn over the videos to the Sheikh following their falling out .
" They were my security , really , to make my case that this man is capable of doing what I say he can do , " said Nabulsi in an interview to be broadcast Wednesday on the ABC News program Nightline .
Nabulsi says the video tapes were recorded by his brother , on orders from the Sheikh who liked to watch the torture sessions later in his royal palace .
The Sheikh begins by stuffing sand down the man 's mouth , as the police officers restrains the victim .
Then he fires bullets from an automatic rifle around him as the man howls incomprehensibly .
Sadistic Torture by Sheikh
At another point on the tape , the Sheikh can be seen telling the cameraman to come closer .
" Get closer .
Get closer .
Get closer .
Let his suffering show , " the Sheikh says .
Over the course of the tape , Sheikh Issa acts in an increasingly sadistic manner .
He uses an electric cattle prod against the man 's testicles and inserts it in his anus .
At another point , as the man wails in pain , the Sheikh pours lighter fluid on the man 's testicles and sets them aflame .
Then the tape shows the Sheikh sorting through some wooden planks .
" I remember there was one that had a nail in it , " he says on the tape .
The Sheikh then pulls down the pants of the victim and repeatedly strikes him with board and its protruding nail .
At one point , he puts the nail next to the man 's buttocks and bangs it through the flesh .
" Where 's the salt , " asks the Sheikh as he pours a large container of salt on to the man 's bleeding wounds .
The victim pleads for mercy , to no avail .
The final scene on the tape shows the Sheikh positioning his victim on the desert sand and then driving over him repeatedly .
A sound of breaking bones can be heard on the tape .
Sheikh Issa 's lawyer , Daryl Bristow of Baker Botts in Houston , told ABC News " the tape is the tape . "
The torture victim was identified by Nabulsi as an Afghan grain dealer , Mohammed Shah Poor , who the Sheikh accused of short changing on a grain delivery to his royal ranch on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi .
The UAE government , in its statement , says the matter was settled privately between the Sheikh and the grain dealer , " by agreeing not to bring formal charges against each other , i.e. , theft on the one hand and assault on the other hand . "
Nabulsi says Sheikh Issa became increasing violent and sadistic following the 2004 death of his father , the UAE 's first and only president until that time , Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan .
" It 's like you flipped a switch and the man took a wrong turn in his life and started getting violent , " said Nabulsi .
Sheikh Issa is one of the country 's 22 royal sheikhs but does not hold an official position in the UAE government .
Man Says U.S. Embassy Officials in Abu Dhabi Knew of Torture Tape
Nabulsi first met Sheikh Issa when he traveled to Houston for medical reasons .
Nabulsi provided hotel and limousine services and their relationship grew into a business partnership , he says .
Nabulsi , in his lawsuit , says he was falsely arrested on narcotics trafficking charges by Abu Dhabi police when he refused to turn over the tapes and mistreated in prison , where he was held for three months .
" They would stick a finger up his anus and say , ' this is from Sheik Issa , are you going to give us the tapes , ' " said Nabulsi 's Houston lawyer , Tony Buzbee .
" They would keep him from sleeping , deny him his medications , tell him they were going to rape his wife , kill his child .
They made him pose naked while they took pictures , " the lawyer alleges .
The UAE government said its review " also confirmed that Mr. Nabulsi was in no way mistreated during his incarceration for drug possession . "
After a short trial , Nabulsi was convicted of having prescription medicine without a prescription from a local doctor .
Evidence at the trail showed his doctor in Houston had prescribed the medicine .
Nabulsi was expelled from the country and his passport is stamped with the notation " Not Allowed to Return to the UAE . "
Nabulsi says officials at the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi were aware of the torture tapes but took no action to protest the Sheikh 's action .
The UAE is considered a stalwart U.S. ally in the region , with close cooperation in working against al Qaeda .
The U.S. Navy has an important base outside Dubai .
Nabulsi says he even showed portions of the tape to a Department of Homeland Security official stationed in Abu Dhabi to train UAE police , Bill Wallrap .
Nabulsi says after the U.S. official watched the tapes , he advised Nabulsi to " gather your family and get out of the country as soon as possible for your own safety . "
A spokesman for DHS said neither Wallrap nor the DHS would have any comment on the torture tapes .
In its 2008 Human Rights report , the U.S. State Department referred to " reports that a royal family member tortured a foreign national who had allegedly overcharged him in a grain deal . "
The State Department made no reference to the video tapes played for the U.S. official .
Rep. McGovern Weighs In
Other U.S. embassy employees did help , says Nabulsi , who credits them with keeping him alive by their visits to the prison .
Asked why neither he nor his brother did n't report the torture he saw on the tape to authorities in the UAE , Nabulsi said , " I mean the whole government is all brothers .
I mean the president is al Nahyan , the crown prince is al Nahyan , the foreign minister is al Nahyan , the foreign minister is al Nahyan .
What can you do ? "
The co-chairman of the House Human Rights Commission , Rep. James McGovern ( D - MA ) , said the existence of the tape requires the U.S. to take action .
" Granted that they 're strategically located in a key part of the world , but it 's hard to imagine that we 're going to keep going on as if it ' business as usual when this kind of stuff happens , " said McGovern .
" My guess is that this is just the tip of the iceberg . "
Sheikh Issa 's lawyer , Bristow , has moved to have the case , which also involves allegations surrounding their business dealings , transferred to courts in the UAE .
Wherever it is heard , said Bristow , " You may be assured that in due course the one - sided " story " being told to ABC by the Nabulsi's and their lawyers will be completely addressed and the Nabulsi 's will be discredited , " he said in a letter to ABC News .
The " ' story that we think ABC is being told is grossly misleading ; it is in large measure demonstrably untrue ; and it is defamatory to Sheikh Issa . "
Bristow represented George W. Bush in the Florida recount case in 2000 .
Among the firm 's partners is former Secretary of State James Baker .

The economic downturn is hitting the legal world hard .
American Lawyer is calling it “ the fire this time ” and warning that big firms may be hurtling toward “ a paradigm - shifting , blood - in - the - suites ” future .
The Law Shucks blog has a “ layoff tracker , ” and it is grim reading .
Top firms are rapidly thinning their ranks , and several  including Heller Ehrman , a venerable 500 - plus - lawyer firm founded in 1890  have closed .
The employment pains of the legal elite may not elicit a lot of sympathy in the broader context of the recession , but a lot of hard - working lawyers have been blindsided , including young associates who are suddenly finding themselves with six - figure student - loan debts and no source of income .
Leading firms have historically avoided mass layoffs , concerned that their reputations would take a hit .
But some have been putting those inhibitions aside , perhaps calculating that the stigma of pushing out their colleagues has faded .
Law firm managers and bar associations should be looking for more creative ways to deal with the hard times  like reducing pay for both partners and associates to save jobs , as a few firms have begun doing .
The silver lining , if there is one , is that the legal world may be inspired to draw blueprints for the 21st century .
which is half the battle

You may be familiar with the modular line of Kondo robots sold in Japan -- but are you aware that a " Kondo Battle " exists where the bots duke it out to the death ( or until they fall over ) ?
Well , now you know ....
You can pretty much see where this is headed -- life - size ( or larger ) Gundams going totally crazy on cityscapes across the globe .
A picture says a thousand words , and video says billions and billions , so feast your eyes on theclip after the break , and to sweeten the deal , we 've included a few videos of the actual fights as well .
Defamatory messages appearing in public places are n't just an Internet Age affliction ; consider the following case from 1952 .
A woman received a phone call from a man who sought to arrange an unconventional , but apparently amorous , liaison .
After being rebuffed , the man informed the woman that her phone number appeared on the bathroom wall of a local bar along with writing indicating that she " was an unchaste
woman who indulged in illicit amatory ventures . "
The woman ’s husband promptly called the bartender and demanded he remove the defamatory graffito , which the bartender said he would do when he got around to it .
Shortly thereafter , the husband marched to the bar , policeman in tow , and discovered the offending scrawl still gracing the wall .
He defended his wife ’s honor by suing the
bar ’s owner .
That case history appeared in yesterday 's Ninth Circuit decision of Barnes v. Yahoo ( PDF ) , a case that was in many ways identical to the 1952 barroom graffiti incident .
The decision itself was written by a judge with a flair for the literary and the dramatic ; it makes a great read .
How many court decisions open with this line ?
" This case stems from a dangerous , cruel , and highly indecent use of the Internet for the apparent purpose of revenge . "
A revenge tragedy for the Internet age
Back in 2004 , Cecilia Barnes broke up with her boyfriend .
He did not take it well .
Soon after the breakup , he created numerous fake Yahoo profiles for Barnes , then entered Yahoo chat rooms posing as Barnes and told men that he met there to check out the fake profiles .
( You can see where this is going , ca n't you ? )
The fake profiles contained " some kind of open sexual solicitation , " and anonymous men soon began " peppering [ Barnes ' ] office with e-mails , phone calls , and personal visits , all in the expectation of sex . "
Definitely not cool .
But this case is n't about the boyfriend 's behavior ; it 's about Yahoo .
When Barnes found out what happened , she contacted Yahoo , sent them signed letters and copies of her photo ID ( as Yahoo requires ) , asking the profiles to be removed ( which Yahoo does ) .
In this case , nothing happened .
Barnes sent at least four letters to Yahoo .
When the story was about to break on local news , a Yahoo PR person called Barnes , asked for the information again , and said that she would " personally walk the statements over to the division responsible for stopping unauthorized profiles and they would take care it . "
But they did not .
So Barnes sued Yahoo , which finally removed the profiles after receiving the suit .
Yahoo said that it had immunity from prosecution under section 230 of the CDA , which protects online service providers from being considered the " speaker " or " publisher " of third - party information posted by users .
Yahoo should have acted more quickly , of course , but the company claimed that there was no basis in law for the suit .
Barnes countered that once the Yahoo PR person had promised to have the information removed , Yahoo was negligent in not doing so .
The judges raised the 1952 case , wondering if there might be a situation in which someone who provides public services might be considered the " publisher " of something if they refuse to take it down for a long enough period of time .
But in the end , the court ruled that the case was barred in its current form by the CDA .
Some legal bloggers are already calling this a " great case " and a " nice win " for online publishers , though the court did make clear that Barnes can recast the suit to focus solely on Yahoo 's promise to her .
Bottom line : Yahoo had no real responsibility to remove the profiles , though once it promised to do so , it may have created a contract - based claim that could result in liability .

Why has the loathsome Crash clung to the top of Netflix ’s top 100 chart like some preachy fungus ?
And why wo n’t it go away ?
Crazy bloggers are saying it has to do with quality or audience preference .
We refuse to believe that this could possibly be true .
Clearly , Crash has gamed Netflix ’s search engine in four despicable ( if unintentional ) ways .
1. Timeliness .
Crash ’s success is distorted due to historic accident :
It won Best Picture in 2006 , just as Netflix ’s user base was exploding .
It was likely one of the first films new users added to their queues .
If Netflix had existed for twenty years , films made before 2004 might actually crack the top 10 , thanks to long histories of user reviews and recommendations — but it has n’t , and old movies have n’t .
2. Awards .
Despite the fact that Oscar ratings are plummeting and people seem to care less about award shows than ever before , awards seriously skew Netflix recommendations away from films people actually like and toward films that associations praise .
Thanks to its confounding awards haul , Crash is linked to every other award - winning film in the database and sucks up referrals .
Could the problem with the vaunted Netflix recommendation engine be that it ’s best at serving up search - engine - friendly films , instead of films we might really like ?
Do the number of name actors , number of awards , maudlin message , and timeliness steer users toward Crash instead of better movies ?
If so , maybe the competitors in the million - dollar Netflix Prize contest would improve their algorithms by penalizing films for having big casts , preachy messages , recent production dates , and truckloads of statues .
4. The Bradley Effect .
Clearly , it does n’t hurt that Crash has a nearly inexplicable four - out - of - five star rating based on 2.8 million user reviews .
The only rational explanation for such positive reviews is a film - crit Bradley Effect , a self - flattering bias in the star ratings that pairs nicely with Haggis ’s middlebrow self - righteousness ( so what if you ’re a teensy bit racist , it ’s not like racism is an institutional problem , and , according to Crash , you ’re no more racist than the next guy and , best of all , there ’s nothing to be done about it … ) .
Yes , the Bradley Effect was supposedly discredited in the last election — but can you really think of a more plausible explanation ?
The implications of Crash ’s Netflix dominance are scary .
For decades , producers have been compiling crass and tidy charts of stars ’ global worth ( box - office numbers broken down by country and region ) .
This is one of the reasons bad Brits and Aussies often get good American parts , regardless of their talent for dialects ( see : Jude Law in Cold Mountain and All the King ’s Men ) .
Now that search engines are driving sales of video and movie tickets , will the casts get bigger and the roles smaller ?
Is this slew of ensemble films ( we ’re looking at you , He ’s Just Not That Into You ) a result of search - engine gaming ?
Is this why people keep casting 50 Cent , despite any evident talent ?
( See : the Crash - like ensemble drama Home of the Brave . )
Is this why the similar , tastefully maudlin feel - bad message movie Babel is also perched at No. 13 ?
Could the problem with the vaunted Netflix recommendation engine be that it ’s best at serving up search - engine - friendly films , instead of films we might really like ?
Do the number of name actors , number of awards , maudlin message , and timeliness steer users toward Crash instead of better movies ?
If so , maybe the competitors in the million - dollar Netflix Prize contest would improve their algorithms by penalizing films for having big casts , preachy messages , recent production dates , and truckloads of statues .
It ’s worth a try .
Crash must be dethroned .
The right 's second - favorite new talking point -- right behind " Leave Rush Aloooooone ! " -- is the claim that the ongoing downward spiral of the stock market is now President Obama 's fault .
It 's utter nonsense , of course .
Indeed , a far more plausible explanation for the continuing lousy psychology of the stock market is that all the hysterical fearmongering , marked by absurd charges that we 're descending into " socialism , " coming from the mouths of Republicans and various right - wing talkers ( most prominently Limbaugh ) has created a blanket of groundless fear and suspicion around Obama 's recovery program that is keeping the market in freefall .
It 's been everywhere on cable TV : Larry Kudlow , Sean Hannity , Bill O'Reilly , Glenn Beck , Charles Krauthammer , Lou Dobbs , even the morning talking heads at MSNBC -- they 've all been pitching the concept that this is an " Obama Bear Market " and that his " bad- mouthing " the economy to get his stimulus bill passed -- and more importantly , the shocking " socialism " of the Obama program -- is the reason the market continues its slide .
Probably the apotheosis of this was Michael Boskin 's piece in the Wall Street Journal declaring that " Obama 's radicalism " is tanking the markets .
That 's a fine how - do - you - do : Boskin was a member of George W. Bush 's Council of Economic Advisers .
In other words :
One of the architects of the current economic debacle is already trying to blame it on the man upon whom the job of cleaning it all up has descended , less than two months into his tenure .
There 's no chutzpah like right - wing chutzpah .
As Robert Reich explained at Salon :
The argument that Obama is somehow responsible for the collapse of Wall Street is absurd .
First , every major policy that led to this collapse occurred under George W.'s watch ( or , more accurately , his failure to watch ) .
The housing and financial bubbles were created under Bush and exploded under Bush .
The stock market began to collapse under Bush .
Second , it 's inevitable that stocks , led by the bloated financial sector , would lose their remaining hot air as the new administration begins " stress - testing " the big banks , many of which are technically insolvent .
After all , their share prices were built on a tissue of lies and dreams .
Other sectors whose values were similarly distorted and distended by years of financial deception and regulatory disregard , such as housing and insurance , will also have to return to the real world before they can recover .
Which could mean more stock losses .
Indeed , contrary to any radicalism , even David Brooks can see that Obama 's economic program is pragmatic and centrist :
They see themselves as pragmatists who inherited a government and an economy that have been thrown out of whack .
They ’re not engaged in an ideological project to overturn the Reagan Revolution , a fight that was over long ago .
They ’re trying to restore balance : nurture an economy so that productivity gains are shared by the middle class and correct the irresponsible habits that developed during the Bush era .
The budget , they continue , is n’t some grand transformation of America .
It raises taxes on energy and offsets them with tax cuts for the middle class .
It raises taxes on the rich to a level slightly above where they were in the Clinton years and then uses the money as a down payment on health care reform .
That ’s what the budget does .
It ’s not the Russian Revolution .
Second , they argue , the Obama administration will not usher in an era of big government .
Federal spending over the last generation has been about 20 percent of G.D.P .
This year , it has surged to about 27 percent .
But they aim to bring spending down to 22 percent of G.D.P. in a few years .
And most of the increase , they insist , is caused by the aging of the population and the rise of mandatory entitlement spending .
It ’s not caused by big increases in the welfare state .
What Republicans can't really handle , of course , is confronting the reality that it was their misbegotten approach to the economy -- mass deregulation , complete " free markets , " and tax cuts tax cuts tax cuts -- that was responsible for creating this mess .
So what we 're actually seeing is the Right busily constructing its own fresh new wing of Planet Wingnuttia , the alternative reality they 're coming to inhabit : Liberals conspired to cause the housing crisis , and therefore caused the economic collapse .
Then Obama started the stock - market slide even before he was elected , and now his radical socialism is driving the market into the sub -1000 region .
Hoo boy .
Get ready to deal with this nonsense for the next four years .
And particularly its consequences : Wall Streeters have always shown a propensity for gullibility when it comes to right - wing talking points , and the continuing drop in the markets almost certainly reflects that .
We got a glimpse of the kind of craziness the right is flinging up on the wall in its flight from reality earlier this week from J.D. Hayworth :
Hayward :
No , I 'll tell you what was bad .
The sneak attack on our economy , the dress rehearsal of Indy bank , when Chuck Schumer helped get that started and the guy in the background George Soros manipulating all the currency .
Matthews : What ?
Hayward :
You want to keep that going ?
Matthews :
You mean the economic situation we faced right now ... JD you can talk fast but I do n't know what you 're talking about .
This was a conspiracy theory worthy of the Protocols of the Seven Elders of Zion .
Which kind of makes sense , considering that Hayworth , before he went down flaming in the 2006 election , was out there touting Henry Ford - style " Americanism " :
That would be the Henry Ford who in 1920 began publishing The International Jew -- one of the most infamous anti-Semitic screeds in history .
This text first raised to national prominence the notorious Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion hoax -- and indeed may have been responsible for its subsequent wide distribution in Hitler 's Germany as well .
Speaking of Hitler , here 's what he had to say about the speculation in 1923 that Ford might run for president : I wish I could send some of my shock troops to Chicago and other big American cities to help in the elections ...
We look to Heinrich Ford as the leader of the growing fascist movement in America ...
We have just had his anti-Jewish articles translated and published .
The book is being circulated in millions throughout Germany . " ... But Ford was n't the only one out there thumping the drum for " Americanism . "
Indeed , as I 've detailed previously , one of the main slogans of the Ku Klux Klan then ( and later ) was that its program was all about " pure Americanism " or " 100 percent Americanism . "
( The same was true of William Dudley Pelley 's openly fascist Silver Shirts organization . )
One of its best - known pamphlets was entitled " The Klan 's Fight for Americanism , " which ... makes no apologies for its members ' attempts to impose their views upon " liberals , " immigrants , Catholics , Jews , or peoples of color .
Instead it sounds a clarion call for the Klan 's " progressive conservatism " and celebrates its influence in American public life .
Indeed , the path of right - wing populism is clearly where the current rhetoric is taking us .
As Robert Reich observes in his Salon piece :
Finally , none of the financial wizards who are now charging Obama with leading America into the abyss have offered an alternative plan for getting us out of the mess that , not incidentally , many of these same wizards happily led us into .
For years , the Wall Street Journal editorial page and the financial gurus of cable news cheered as Wall Street leveraged its way into oblivion .
This bizarre charge would n't be worth mentioning were it not a market test for a more intense attack from Wall Street and Republican media outlets next year as the nation moves into the gravitational range of the 2010 midterm elections .
Republicans have made no secret of their wish to blame Obama for the bad economy , and to stir up as much populist rage against his so - called socialist tendencies as politically possible .
History shows how effective demagogic ravings can be when a public is stressed economically .
Make no mistake :
Angry right - wing populism lurks just below the surface of the terrible American economy , ready to be launched not only at Obama but also at liberals , intellectuals , gays , blacks , Jews , the mainstream media , coastal elites , crypto socialists , and any other potential target of paranoid opportunity .
Guess it 's time for us all to head for our Doom Bunkers .
Because once they have their new wing of Planet Wingnuttia all decked out and furnished with specially collected talking points , there 's never any talking them out .
We just can hope that Wall Street is n't taking up a room there .
The open source Qt development toolkit is a popular choice for cross-platform development .
It provides native - looking widgets and tight integration with the underlying platform on Windows , Linux , and Mac OS X .
Qt applications that are written in C++ are easy to compile and deploy across all three platforms , but what if you do n't like C ++?
I prefer Python , a dynamic programming language with a richly expressive syntax and exceptionally powerful support for introspection .
Fortunately , there are cross-platform Python bindings for Qt . The downside , however , is that packaging PyQt applications so that they can be deployed to users on Windows and Mac OS X is an immensely frustrating and arcane process .
I declared victory last week after spending several hours battling with MacPorts and distutils .
Now that I have unlocked the toolkit 's dark mysteries , I can show you the hidden secrets that will allow you to achieve mastery of the alchemical art of cross- platform PyQt application deployment .
First , you 'll need access to each platform for which you want to build redistributable packages .
The easiest way to accomplish this is to use a Mac and either triple - boot or virtualize Windows and Linux .
The initial setup process for Mac OS X will require a lot of very heavy compilation , so you are going to be in for a world of pain and a very long wait if you try to do this on a Mac mini .
My test application
My computing environment is a quad core Mac Pro configured to dual - boot OS X and openSUSE 11.1 .
For Windows , I 'm running XP in VirtualBox .
I do most of my actual development in Linux , but you can do it pretty comfortably on any of the platforms .
My test application , which I call Orbital Liftr , is a simple utility that I made for batch uploading graphics to Ars Technica 's content management system .
The Ars CMS is built on Movable Type , which means that it supports the MetaWeblog XML - RPC API , and my app lets you upload images to any standard Movable Type or WordPress blog that supports the API .
The app has a few simple features like support for receiving images via drag - and - drop , and it can proportionally resize them before uploading .
The program consists of one module of Python code which contains the application logic and a few basic user interface forms that I made with the Qt Designer program .
I have published the complete source code of the program on Launchpad .
You can use it to follow along with this tutorial , or you can use your own code .
PyQt on Windows
To build a distributable PyQt package for Windows , you first need to set up a working PyQt execution environment .
Start by downloading and installing the standard Qt SDK from the Qt Software website .
Next , you will need to install Python 2.6.1 .
Use the binary installer for Windows from the Python website .
The next step is installing the Python bindings , which can be obtained from the download page at the PyQt website .
You 'll want to get the Windows installer that is compatible with Python 2.6 ; it 's listed at the bottom of the Binary Packages section .
These components should be enough to give you a fully functional environment for running PyQt applications .
You can test it by making a simple PyQt application with a few widgets in a single . pyw file .
If your PyQt environment installed correctly , you should be able to run the program by double - clicking the .pyw file in the file manager .
There are several example scripts that come bundled with the PyQt installation .
These can be found in the site - packages PyQt4 examples folder .
Now that you have a working PyQt environment , you need to package up the application so that you can distribute it to users and make it possible for them to run it without having to install all of the dependencies .
This is done with a utility called py2exe that leverages Python 's distutils framework .
An installer for py2exe is available from the SourceForge website .
You will need to adapt your setup .py script so that it can provide proper instructions to py2exe .
If your program is simple and you already know how to use distutils , this should n't be terribly hard .
The following example shows my setup.py file :
from distutils .
core import setup import py2exe setup( name = " liftr " , version = " 0.1 " , author= " Ryan Paul " , author_email=" segphault@arstechnica.com " , url = " https://launchpad.net/liftr " , license= " GNU General Public License ( GPL ) " , packages = [ ' liftr ' ] , package_data= {" liftr " : [ " ui / * " ]} , scripts = [ " bin/ liftr " ] , windows = [ {" script " : " bin/liftr " } ] , options = { " py2exe " : { " skip_archive " :
True , " includes " : [ " sip " ]
}} )
Most of that is pretty much standard distutils .
The last two lines were added to accommodate py2exe .
The " windows " parameter specifies the script that py2exe should use to launch the actual program .
As you can see , for a simple program that is being ported from Linux , it 's the same thing that you already have in your " scripts " parameter .
The " options " parameter allows you to pass specific instructions to py2exe .
For PyQt applications , you will need to tell it to include sip , a fundamental component of the PyQt binding system .
The py2exe tool will typically compress all of your required Python library modules into a single zip file in order to reduce space and keep your redistributable package clean .
I disable that with the skip_archive option .
My program dynamically loads the user interface description XML files at runtime , but it can't read those files when they are bundled up in the zip archive .
When you are building PyQt applications with py2exe , you need to either statically generate your user interface modules from the XML description files in advance , disable archiving with the skip_archive option , or structure your program so that the UI files will not end up in the archive .
After you finish making your setup.py script , you can build your redistributable package by running it from the command line :
$ python setup.py py2exe
The terminal will display a lot of messages as it byte - compiles your modules and copies all of the necessary dll files and other dependency components .
The automated setup process will take place in the " build " directory and everything that your users need will be copied into the " dist " directory .
If the script wo n't execute , make sure that Python is in your PATH environment variable .
To deploy your application to users , ship them everything that is in the " dist " directory .
This adds up to roughly 25 MB for a simple program .
It includes the executable and all of the runtime dependencies , which means that users will be able to run the program without having to install the other components .
You can just zip it up and ship it out that way , but it will be more convenient for your users if you give them a single self - standing executable with a standard installer wizard .
A lot of PyQt developers seem to like Inno Setup , a free installer maker .
Although your users will not have to manually install Qt or the PyQt bindings , they might still have to install the VC ++ 2008 Redistributable Package .
This package is available directly from Microsoft .
Deploying PyQt on Windows works reasonably well .
Inno Setup uses good compression , so you can get your final package down to an acceptable size and make it easy for users to install .
The biggest challenge is getting py2exe to deal appropriately with certain kinds of corner cases .
If your application is complex or structured in an unusual way , you might run into problems .
For example , py2exe does n't respect the distutils package_data option .
There are a few workarounds for problems of that nature , and you can get more details about py2exe from the project 's website .
Healing is a slow process that can take much of your time from a fixed routine that you might stick to , daily .
It also creates a bit of a stressed mind that disrupts the normal routine from catching up quickly with the incident .
Moreover , with healing , you cannot just distinguish the healing as a part of physical healing .
The mind also requires a bit time to process the injury .
However , there are certain exercises and tips that can elevate the time to help the body gain back its energy faster .
Warm ups before exercising
Before subjecting yourself to any forms of exercise , it is best to appoint yourself to a few warm up activities .
It is a highly important note that is followed by every fitness enthusiast because it is a vital part of the exercise .
It includes a series of different actions that allow the muscles to relieve and the blood circulates quickly .
It is basically a way to work up your muscles before the actual heavy workout takes place .
Ergonomics
Chiropractors suggest that the exercises comprising their patients ’ daily routine requires the use of ergonomics .
It is important that the patients align themselves according to their needs and keep their positions in check with their daily routine to avoid any mishap from happening in their backs .
The right attire
For any given work of art , the body requires to be in the perfect attire to cease the moment and grab the objective of the work .
Doing these exercises that can speed up the healing process , the main contribution is played by the right form of shoes .
The shoes that are not only comfortable to wear but also allow room for the feet to be flexible however a firm range of motion .
The right shoes will fit your feet perfectly but allow the cushioning to provide the required space and comfortability .
Maintain posture
The main advice that is both integral and beneficial , offered by any adelaide family chiropractic in town , is the maintenance of a good posture throughout your day .
This obviously speeds up the process of healing and relieves the muscles from the potential pain they can endure .
While sitting , do not slouch , while standing , do not let your shoulders slump and carry a good weight on your feet while sitting rather than dangling your feet .
Passive stretching
Another thing that has proven to be quite beneficial is the use of weights and passive stretching .
The small activities that the patient exhibits relieves the muscles through a gentle process that cannot be said for vigorous exercises .
These acts of work are stress relieving and can be adjusted according to a person ’s specific abilities that can be the best form of exercise available in town .
Lamborghini Murcielago Ends Up Underneath SUV
It 's not that uncommon for a low - profile car to wedge itself underneath another after rear - ending it , but miraculously , up until now that had never happened to a Lamborghini Murcielago .
We 've seen tons of Corvettes and Ferraris end up in this position , but for some reason , never a Murcielago .
Thanks to photographer Kelly Davis , we now present you with the first ever Murcielago " Wedge " :
The crash happened about 25 miles north of Seattle , Washington on I - 5 .
A Hyundai Santa
Fe braked suddenly due to heavy traffic and the Lamborghini could n't stop in time .
Considering that the Murcielago is capable of braking from 100 mph to zero in 4.4 seconds , our bet is the driver was n't paying much attention to the road .

Five Golfers We Hope Pull A Henrik Stenson ( And Five We Don’t )
By now you have probably heard about how Henrik Stenson took off all of his clothes when taking a shot from the mud at the CA Championship so they would n’t get dirty .
While one must admire his dedication to cleanliness and to the game ( while simultaneously not admiring his choice in underwear – Tighty - whities ?
Really ? ) , what if taking off your clothes to take a shot became popular in golf ?
Who would we want to see do this ?
And who should never , ever under any circumstances ( even if they are on fire ) take their clothes off on the golf course ?
We ’ll start with the golfers you do n’t want to see , so you can then have all the nice looking people fresh in your memory at the end as you head into your weekend .

Anarchism : in and out of the mainstream
Rob Ray ’s recent blog post on Libcom about what he see ’s as anarchist literature ’s “ failure to crack the mainstream ” really resonated with me .
In a nutshell , Rob says :
a ) anarchist publishers are producing higher quality works as of late .
b ) this increase in production standards has n’t necessarily resulted in higher sales
c ) distribution of our literature needs more fruitful outlets
d ) anarchists need more resources to help them reach their readership
I ’m not sure that the quality of anarchist publications has improved overall ( design and readability is improving , editing and fact - checking are going in the right direction but we have a long way to go still ) .
And I think sales have increased ( again , for some , not others , but largely due to making publications available through mainstream channels ) .
But I agree that it is always crucial for anarchist publishers to find better ways to distribute their materials and that it ’s a great idea for us to share , and find new , resources to help everyone reach a wider readership .
Cover design alone does n’t move books , but some knowledge and experience about what does move them exists — there ’s no need to reinvent the wheel .
AK
Press has been operating for almost two decades now under an assumption that anarchist ideas are not only worthy of being “ in the mainstream , ” but had better find a sizable following there ( or else , um , there ’s little hope in working toward an anarchist future ) .
NAVIGATING THE “ BOOK TRADE ”
Firstly , Rob mentions that “ Even with the best of organization [ anarchist pub lishers ] are having difficulty finding new places to stock [ books , magazines ] and hawk them around . ”
No doubt this seems increasingly true , but the picture is much broader than one might expect .
The obvious place to start selling books is through the book trade .
The good news is that almost anyone will carry your books ( from Amazon to Barnes & Noble to City Lights ) — if they feel that someone will wander in and buy them .
So , since City Lights is a great bookstore and readily stocks radical literature , the big question is : who is going to buy our books from Barnes & Noble and the like ?
Well , to be honest , lots of people .
In my opinion , the challenge is how to convince the B&N buyers that your book is going to sell ( and hence it ’s worth them stocking it ) .
Well , that ’s the icky marketing and publicity side of things .
You want to gain access to these places ?
There ’s two ways to do it : have convincing - enough marketing and publicity plans in place or buy your way in — large stores have “ programs ” where you can basically rent space in the store .
Book stores are a business .
Buying shelf space does n’t guarantee sales for the publisher but it guarantees income for the store ( Amazon has similar programs in place to “ promote ” your book for a fee ) .
Amazon is the fastest - growing bookseller , hands down .
They extract non-negotiable fees from AK ’s main distributor ( that we end up having to pay ourselves ) just to sell through them .
Wholesale distributors have similar plans in place to extract money from publishers and smaller distributors ( in the form of warehousing fees , catalog fees , fees on books returned , etc. ) .
It ’s called business .
You do n’t like it ?
Neither do we , but that ’s the playing field .
And none of this work is particularly gratifying , and certainly not glamorous .
Further , it ’s not generally thought of as “ anarchist activity ” by most .
DOING IT OURSELVES
Luckily , the established book trade is n’t our only source for reaching people .
But how do we reach the vast number of folks who never set foot into a bookstore and do n’t troll Amazon for new books ?
AK
Press reaches them by tabling at a variety of events , networking with other groups , and passing out catalogs .
Certainly we endeavor to attend as many radical events as possible ( see our Spring list here ) but we also get out to places where our literature is n’t commonplace .
Whether it ’s the Barrio Bookfest in LA , the Sonoma County Book Festival , the Baltimore Book Festival , the San Diego International Book Festival , or The Crossroads of the West Gun Show ( yes , two of us tabled there a few years back ) , we actually go out and talk to people .
Sometimes we sell a lot of books , sometimes we do n’t — but we always meet new people and do our best to turn them on to anarchist ideas .
TRAVELING OUTSIDE THE “ ANARCHIST GHETTO ”
And Rob really hit a nerve with “ Both online and off , more effort has been put into looking at what the mainstream does , understanding why it works , and then turning out our own , more honest work . ”
I could n’t agree more .
Attending a sales conference at the Helmsley Hotel is n’t really my , um , cup of tea , but it helps get AK books into stores around the country and we learn new tips from our fellow publishers — anarchist or not .
Everyday we ’re on the phone with Ingram , drafting catalog copy for Consortium , making onesheets for the media , preparing new title updates to send out to our book trade contacts , sending Spring announcements to Publisher ’s Weekly , and we ’re tediously processing returns .
Do n’t know about Ingram , Consortium , or Publisher ’s Weekly ?
Well , that ’s because you are in the anarchist movement , and not the book trade .
What AK ’s flurry of activity means — both as a publisher and distributor — is that anarchist ideas break out into the bookstores , the reviews journals , and get uploaded to Amazon , etc .
When we handle distribution for publishers — like Freedom Press , Autonomedia , Black Cat , Bureau of Public Secrets , Charles H. Kerr , and the Kate Sharpley Library — they can rest well knowing that someone on our end is filling those purchase orders , warehousing the stock , and tracking down that money owed .
It frees them up to what they do best : produce literature .
But the scope of their reach will be determined in large part by how much effort they want to put into promoting their books .
And believe me , it ’s a lot of work .
CREATING AND MAINTAINING INFRASTRUCTURE
Over the years we ’ve made our share of mistakes , but we ’ve always tried to learn from them .
And while publishing and distributing literature is not the only priority for the anarchist movement , it ’s an integral part of laying the groundwork for making social and economic change attractive and coherent .
So yes , we ’re asking ourselves these same questions Rob poses and answering them from within and without “ mainstream models . ”
And I have an answer to Rob ’s final comments : “ What we do n’t have , yet , is a central clearing house for all this information .
We do n’t have a database of potential outlets , or much in the way of guides to expected rates , the best approaches to take — how to close a distro deal .
…
Such an entity , or collective , creating and maintaining this kind of resource and with the ability to walk new groups through the minefield that is publishing , would be worth its weight in gold .
As a creed that is supposed to excel in mutal aid , we desperately need something along these lines , and it ’s a great shame that now , when we really need it , we have n’t got it . ”
Yes we do .
AK is happy to be a helpful resource .
And , possibly more importantly , there ’s always the growing web of infoshops and radical / anarchist bookstores popping up around the US .
There ’s a healthy diversity in the style and approach these spaces take and , among the valuable services they offer their local communities , they can function as an alternative book trade .
Tap into the Infoshop Network and find out more .
FROM PUBLISHING TO PRESENCE
To publish literally means “ to make public . ”
We promote our ideas and histories but is it an end goal just to make books available ?
Do we measure “ success ” by our Amazon ranking ?
Certainly not .
We need to reach people but let ’s not let that pursuit become a substitute for action and efforts that can positively affect people ’s daily lives ( hopefully inspiring their own self - activity ) .
In order to have a presence in society , we need to make public more than just new publications .
We actually need to change the world .
Let ’s not lose sight of that .
You got specific questions about navigating the publishing world ?
Send them to blog@akpress.org or post them in the comments and we ’ll try to answer them .
With enough interest and a specific idea of what people would find most useful , perhaps we could do some “ Distribution 101 ” posts .

Why ?
Because I love each and every one of you .
Oh , sorry , did I type that here ?
I was talking to my money .
In other news , the statisticians have determined that yesterday 's comic was the funniest comic ever ( recently ) .
You can't fight math , people .
Lastly , the next person on my list o' links is Jeph Jacques , who makes a comic you 've probably already heard of : Questionable Content .
Jeph is a nice young man , for whom I did a guest comic recently .
Enjoy !
why alternative medicine spreads like a virus
It seems bizarre , but the longer a patient using alternative medicine is sick , the more converts the alternative treatments win .
If there was an award for most counterintuitive results from a study , a recent project that tried to determine why quack medicine is still used by between 60 % and 80 % of the world , would win hands down .
Despite growing volumes of clinical studies linking virtually all gain from traditional and alternative medicine to what ’s known as the placebo effect , it seems nothing can damper people ’s desire to use witchcraft and roots of odd herbs to cure anything from common colds to HIV .
And that ’s exactly why they ’re so popular .
After applying a mathematical model which assumes that a person is either ill or healthy and has a period of time to demonstrate a traditional cure to others , converting a certain amount of people , the researchers found that bad medicine spreads like a virus .
Literally .
When someone is sick for longer periods of time but actually manages to recover in the end , this person has more time to show the traditional or alternative treatment to a greater number of people and when he gets better , it convinces those who saw his traditional cures that they really work .
On the other hand , when a medication clears up the disease quickly , the same person has a lot less time to show people how well the science - based medicine worked .
Ironically , it ’s the same strategy that makes viruses which cause many diseases so effective ,
The longer the host is alive , the more he can spread the virions to others .
The damage that viruses do to our bodies as they try to reproduce is purely coincidental .
Their goal is to multiply , not to kill us in the process .
The viruses that do trigger immensely high mortality rates tend to burn themselves out very quickly by running out of hosts .
And a related weakness applies to the spread of medical quackery .
Recurring diseases for which folk remedies are just not working all that well tend to lead people back to standard medicine or other treatments .
So when big outbreaks of common viruses keep coming back and witch doctors or eyes of newt or plant roots do nothing for them , the quack cures are discarded in favor of something different .
But wait a second .
What about developed nations where science - based medicine “ tends to reign supreme ? ”
The study points out that about 66 % of Americans are projected to be users of alternative medicine like folk remedies and homeopathy by next year .
Study lead Dr. Mike Tanaka of the University of New South Wales at Sydney , says that people just look at what works for others , regardless of the information they might see in medical journals or from the FDA since we ’re still not 100 % sure of the exact efficacy of many medications we use today .
And that brings us to an interesting conclusion we can draw from the study ’s results : the next time you see an article about the prevalence of quack medicine around the world , you should place a good part of the blame on our evolutionary heritage as social primates .
After all , the behavior of observing what we see and copying it is ingrained in us over millions of years .
When we hear that up to 80 % of the world still goes to see their witch doctor , shaman or neighborhood homeopath for primary medical care , our fancy ape brains tell us : “ well if so many people use it , it must be okay . ”
And this instinctual impulse to jump on the bandwagon is what gives alternative medicine it ’s power to sway perfectly logical people to try very illogical , useless and sometimes harmful things while praising quack doctors for all their help in treating what ails them .
Evolution can be such a cruel mistress …

Overview
Chris Kuklewicz has developed a regular expression library for Haskell that has been implemented with a variety of backends .
Some of these backends are native Haskell implementations , others are not and rely on external C libraries such libpcre .
New users may feel overwhelmed with the various options that are available to them .
The following table provides an overview of the various features supported by each backend .
There are also a number of alternate or complementary regular expression libs , including :
Bryan O'Sullivan 's text - icu – bindings to the ICU library , which includes Perl compatible regexes with extended Unicode support .
One of few regex libraries working with Text and not String .
Yoshikuni Jujo's regexpr - Regular expression library like Perl and Ruby 's regular expressions
Don Stewarts 's pcre - light - A small , efficient and portable regex library for Perl 5 compatible regular expressions
Martin Sulzmann 's regexpr- symbolic - Equality , containment , intersection among regular expressions via symbolic manipulation
Matt Morrow 's regexqq - A quasiquoter for PCRE regexes
Uwe Schmidt's hxt - regex - xmlschema - supports full W3C XML Schema regular expressions inclusive all Unicode character sets and blocks .
A tutorial is available at Regular expressions for XML Schema .

easier for newcomers from other languages ; 0.5.1 leaks memory in some cases
Note : speed is something that should be benchmarked by the actual user , since the story changes so much with the task , new GHC , compiler flags , etc .
The algorithm used may be a useful thing ( backtracking vs NFA / DFA ) .
All support String , ( Seq Char ) , ByteString , and ( except for regex - posix ) ByteString .
Lazy .
All are available from Hackage as tar.gz sources and from darcs .
regex - base
This package exports Text .
Regex .
Base which re-exports Text.Regex.RegexLike and Text.Regex .Context .
These do not provide the ability to do matching , but provide the type classes which all the other regex -* backends use .
The backend packages also import the utility module Text .
Regex .
Impl to streamline instance declarations .
The 0.71 version has a " tail " bug in one of the instances of RegexLike :
instance ( RegexLike a b ) =>
RegexContext a b ( MatchResult b ) where
which I hope to be fixed in ghc 6.6.1 .
Getting the unstable version of regex - base also fixes this , though you will have to get and re-compile all the other regex -* modules as well .
The versions of the regex -* backends that come with GHC 6.6 do not re-export the RegexLike classes , so the usage of regex - BACKEND is
import Text .
Regex .
Base import Text.Regex .BACKEND
The versions in unstable are being upgraded to re-export RegexLike , so the usage will be simplified to
import Text .Regex .BACKEND
The 0.71 version of regex - base only has Extract instances for [ Char ] and ByteString .
The unstable version also provides instances of ByteString .
Lazy and ( Seq Char ) .
This Extract support must be accompanied by adding support to each regex -* backend in unstable , and that work is in progress .
The RegexMaker class in v0.71 had no way to gracefully report errors in parsing the regular expression itself .
This was a design mistake and has been extended in the unstable version of regex - base to provide monadic version which can fail gracefully .
The RegexLike class only provides support for positions in the source text indexed by Int .
I am still considering how to provide Int64 support .
The best way is probably going to be another class , which will allow for more generalized index type support .
Different backends will , by necessity , have different instances for extended index types .
regex - tdfa
Chris Kuklewicz has just released regex - tdfa , ( Tagged Deterministic Finite Automata ) , a new library that works with GHC , the most recent being ghc - 6.10.1 .
It is POSIX compliant and tested against the AT&T tests .
This is available on hackage at regex - tdfa and via darcs .
The haddock documentation is also on the darcs site .
This uses a tagged DFA like the TRE c-library to provide efficient Posix matching .
It also defaults to true Posix submatch capture ( including ambiguous *- operator subpatterns ) , but this extra effort can be disabled .
The versions from 0.90 and up use mutable ST arrays to keep track of data during matching and have thus have both decent speed and decent memory performance .
Previous versions drove the memory use too high , overworking the garbage collector .
The versions from 1.0.0 and up improve the algorithm .
The search time is now O ( N ) for text of length N in the worst case , while still providing correct POSIX capturing and while running in bounded space .
By disabling submatch capture ( see the captureGroups field of ExecOptions ) this library avoids the extra work and should run faster ( " non capture " case , this is also used if there are no parenthesis in the regular expression ) .
By running in single line mode ( see the CompOptions ) and with a leading ^ anchor this library also avoids extra work and should run faster ( " front achored " case ) .
Doing both optimization should run faster still .
Just testing for a match stops at the shortest found match and should be fast ( using matchTest or match / mathM for a Bool output ) , and this also tries to optimize for the " front anchored " case .
The major advantage over pcre is avoidance of exponential blowup for certain patterns : asymptotically , the time required to match a pattern against a string is always linear in length of the string .
This O ( N ) scaling is now achieved even in the worst case and when returning the correct Posix captures .
As of version 1.1.1 the following GNU extensions are recognized , all anchors :
\` at beginning of entire text \' at end of entire text \< at beginning of word \> at end of word \b at either beginning or end of word \ B at neither beginning nor end of word
The above are controlled by the ' newSyntax ' Bool in ' CompOption ' .
regex - posix
See Regex Posix for bug reports relating to your operating system .
This backend provides a Haskell interface for the " posix " c-library that comes with most operating systems , and is provided by include " regex.h " .
This c-library probably also drives command line utilities such as sed and grep .
" Posix " is in quotes since it is often not fully Posix compliant and may be buggy ( as on OS X , where the bug also affects sed ) .
And the c-library has what I call impossibly - slow performance , as in at least 100x slower than other regex engines .
The goal of regex - tdfa is to create a replacement for regex - posix to accompany a future version of GHC .
regex - compat
This takes regex - posix and presents a Text .
Regex api that mirrors the one that came with GHC 6.4.x for compatibility .
regex - pcre
This wraps the pcre c-library from http://www.pcre.org and gives all the Perl regular expression syntax you might want .
This is especially efficient with Data .
ByteString .
regex - pcre- builtin
This is the same as regex - pcre , but comes bundled with a version of the pcre C library .
pcre -light
Another FFI binding to PCRE ; Don Stewart 's pcre - light is intended to be " A light regular expression library , using Perl 5 compatible regexes " , with support for Strings and strict ByteStrings .
It is available on Hackage , or through a Darcs repo ; see also the original announcement .
regex - tre
This wraps the TRE c-library from http://laurikari.net/tre/
which provides Posix regular expressions .
The current 0.7.5 version of TRE is buggy , however , so you should avoid this library unless you test your regular expressions to ensure you avoid the bugs .
The author of TRE is currently working to fix these bugs .
Also , the Posix compliance in 0.7.5 fails for *- operators with ambiguous captures .
regex - dfa
This is the only LGPL backend , as it is derived from CTKLight .
The stable version has had a bad bug on *- operators around patterns that could accept zero characters .
The unstable version will have this issue fixed .
This library provides no submatch captures , but is very fast at finding the Posix leftmost longest match .
regex - parsec
This backend can either find the left - biased match like Perl or the longest match like Posix .
It uses Parsec as a backtracking matching engine and is quite slow .
The submatches returned in longest match mode maximize the length of the captured texts instead of the subpatterns , and this is a divergence from the Posix specification .
Documentation
Coming soonish .
There is also a great tutorial for using ( =~ ) and ( = ~~ ) at this blog post .
A commentary on regex - posix bugs has been started at Regex_Posix in support of the regex - posix - unittest package .
A commentary on the design and internals of such Posix engines has been started at Regex_TDFA mainly describing the regex - tdfa package .
Link to article on DFA
There is an article by Russ Cox on Thompson Non-Finite Automata which presents the DFA algorithm and shows it to be faster than backtracking ( the method used in perl , ruby , python ) .
The original version of the above article is slightly incomplete advocacy .
I will explain in the ( apples|oranges ) section below ChrisKuklewicz 15:56 , 30 January 2007 ( UTC )
( apple|orange )
As Haskell is all about making data more strongly typed , I want to make the point that there are two popular Types of regular expressions in existence .
Just as all String 's are not the same Type , such as some may be escaped or encoded versions or hold data printed in different formats , a regular expressions like " a?a " means two different things depending on its actual Type .
And this difference is very close to another thing that Haskell and functional programming emphasize : declarative programming ( what ) as opposed to imperative programming ( how ) .
I will call the two Types of regular expressions Posix and Perl .
Posix Regular Expressions
This is the declarative approach to regular expressions .
The correct match of a regexp to a string of text starts at the leftmost possible position ; there are no valid matches that can start before it .
Of the possible matches that start at this leftmost position , the one that matches the longest substring is the correct match .
How this match is found is immaterial to this definition of the correct match .
Here and for the rest for the rest of this page I mean Posix to be modern " Posix Extended Regular Expressions " and never the older " Posix Basic Regular Expressions " .
Perl Regular Expressions
This is the imperative approach to regular expressions .
The correct match of a regexp to a string of text starts at the leftmost possible position ; there are no valid matches that can start before it .
To choose the correct match that starts at this position match parts of the regexp against the text until the first match is found .
Specifically you must try left branches of ' | ' before right branches , and treat '? ' '*' and '+' as greedy .
Greedy means to match as many iterations , and only backing off the number of repetitions if no complete match is possible .
The first match found may not be the longest , and it may not be the shortest .
It is the left - biased choice .
This definition of a correct match is identical description of how a backtracking implementation would operate .
To find a Perl match you usually do what Perl ( and Python , and Java , etc. ) do , which is try the left branches and greedy repetition first , then backtrack until the first answer is found .
The number of path is the multiplication of alternatives .
So " a ? " repeated ' n ' times has 2n paths .
To find a Posix match you must try all possible matches from a starting point and pick the longest , moving on the next starting point if there was not match .
If you must backtrack and check each path separately this will take exponential time .
To avoid this you construct an automata ( NFA or DFA ) and then you can check " a ? " repeated n times in polynomial time ( I think it is O ( n2 ) for NFA , O( n ) for DFA ) .
You do n't have to use an automata ; you can write a ( slow ) Posix engine using backtracking .
Perl has an obvious and easy to implement " right - bias " variant that is the mirror image .
And Posix has an obvious and easy to implement " shortest match " .
In Posix , declaring you want to match " a|b " is always exactly the same as " b|a " .
Where in Perl these can be very different instructions .
When writing a Perl regexp you may want more imperative control .
So there are lazy variants '?? ' and '+? ' and '*? ' which are non-greedy and try the fewest number of repetitions first .
And at least Java add posessive variants '?+' and '++' and '*+' that try the largest number of iterations that locally match , but will not backtrack to fewer repetitions ; thus removing many possible paths to try from the search space .
And Perl introduced lookahead assertions , where the engine checks if the future text a point matches or fails to match a nested regular expression .
After a while these extensions comprise a whole imperative parsing language expressed in the form a single complicated string .
So to make it easier to read Perl introduced comments and a whitespace ignoring mode that let you write better documented regular expressions .
And it lets you ( especially in Perl 6 ) embed fragments of Perl into the regular expressions .
So Perl regexps give you a tremendous amount of power in how to find the match , which translates into power ( for the expert ) in defining what the match will be .
With Perl there is a unique first match , so knowing what the parenthesized subgroups matched is easy .
In Posix there can several ambiguous ways to match the same longest answer .
Two examples :
" 12 " =~ " (.. ) |(. ) (. ) " could match \0 = " 12 " , \ 1 = " 12 " , \ 1 = no match , \ 2 = no match \0 = " 12 " , \ 1 = no match , \ 1 = " 1 " , \ 2 = " 2 "
" 12 " =~ " (.? ) * " could match \0 = " 12 " , \ 1 = " " ( empty match ) \ 0 = " 12 " , \ 1 = " 2 "
And the Posix standard requires a left bias in the first example and the non-empty final iteration in the second example .
So " a|b " and " b|a " are distinguishable if there are ambiguous ways to match and these ambiguities affect the captured subgroups .
About the paper in the above section :
It never mentions the difference between longest versus leftmost meaning of regular expressions .
Replacing the Perl engine with a Posix DFA will simply break many carefully crafted regular expressions .
I do not know if the engine Russ Cox touts that was written 20 years ago by Pike implements Posix or Perl semantics .
If it finds the longest match ( Posix ) then it is no help in replacing the default engine in a language like Perl .
If it does efficiently find the left - biased match then it would be possible .
The comparison to Ville Laurikari 's work is not encouraging in this regard since Ville 's system finds the longest match and not the left - biased one .
Bounded space Posix proposal
For further discussions , Chris has posted his bounded space proposal for Posix algorithms .
This is also a part of the discussion at a thread on Lambda The Ultimate .
Sample benchmark
The benchmark consists of matching " Hello world foo= 123 whereas bar=456 Goodbye " against " .* foo = ( [ 0 - 9 ] + ) .* bar= ( [ 0 - 9 ] + ) .* " ( as a lazy bytestring ) 1 mln times ( along the lines of length .
filter matches Pat . replicate 1000000 ) .
It has been performed on a 2x2GHz P4 machine , compiled with - O2 , ghc 6.10.1 .
regex - pcre : 0.02s
pcre-light : 0.02s
regex - tdfa 1.0.0 ( no compiler bug ) : 0.03s
regex - dfa 0.91 : 5.4s
regex - posix : 20s
regex - tdfa 1.0.0 ( most probably compiler bug ) : 89 s
In all cases , the pattern is compiled only once .
WARNING : This result of 97s may be the result of a compiler bug that probably may cause the pattern to be compiled at every match invocation ; without that bug , regex - tdfa performs extremely well .
Please see ticket http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3059
UNWARNING :
The code for regex - tdfa 1.0.0 is being improved .
In particular the slow 89s is probably real .
But it need not be so .
The upcoming version runs in less than 0.2 seconds .
Thus , for patterns as simple as this one , it is appropriate to use pcre .
For patterns where the Perl - style strategy of backtracking causes exponential backtracking blowup , it is appropriate to use regex - dfa or regex - tdfa .

2009 April 7
Explanation :
Two galaxies are squaring off in Virgo and here are the latest pictures .
When two galaxies collide , the stars that compose them usually do not .
This is because galaxies are mostly empty space and , however bright , stars only take up only a small fraction of that space .
But during the collision , one galaxy can rip the other apart gravitationally , and dust and gas common to both galaxies does collide .
If the two galaxies merge , black holes that likely resided in each galaxy center may eventually merge .
Because the distances are so large , the whole thing takes place in slow motion -- over hundreds of millions of years .
Besides the two large spiral galaxies , a smaller third galaxy is visible on the far left of the above image of Arp 274 , also known as NGC 5679 .
Arp 274 spans about 200,000 light years across and lies about 400 million light years away toward the constellation of Virgo .

With “ leaders ” like this , who needs Limbaugh .
While cable news outlets and major newspapers continue to use euphemisms such as “ harsh interrogation tactics ” to describe the Bush administration ’s approach to intelligence gathering , House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) used a more succinct term Thursday : “ torture . ”
“ Last week , they released these memos outlining torture techniques .
That was clearly a political decision and ignored the advice of their Director of National Intelligence and their CIA director , ” Boehner said at a press conference in the Capitol .
The techniques discussed include waterboarding , slamming detainees into walls , and depriving them of sleep for up to 11 days .
Boehner ’s admission subtly shifts the debate .
At first , the Republicans were trying to shift the debate to whether Obama helped the terrorists by publicizing the techniques we used against them ( techniques that everyone already knew about , by the way ) .
Now , Boehner is helping shift the discussion to whether it is ever appropriate for America to torture , not IF America tortured .
The larger question , which Boehner has now invited , is whether American officials committed war crimes .
That ’s a rather serious charge .
And it ’s utterly beneath what our country is supposed to be about .
Either we are better than the rest of the world , or we ’re the same , if not worse .
The Republicans , and the majority of Americans , need to decide which America they want to be .
Joe Scarborough thinks that Republicans who demonize President Obama are making a big mistake .
“ A lot of callers that call in , expect me to scream and yell and say I hate President Obama .
Being against his policies for some reason with a lot of people in the base , that ’s not enough .
They want you to hate the man .
And , of course , this is going back and forth .
They ’ve got to drop the hate , ” said Scarborough .

Mike Barnacle agreed .
“ You can be agreebly disagreeable , but it ’s unlike the base of the Republican party , which I now think is talk radio , ” said Barnacle .
“ It ’s not that they disagree with President obama .
It ’s that he ’s a socialist , he ’s this , he ’s that , and the vitriol that pours out over the airwaves is just stunning , ” Barnacle continued .
“ You ca n’t live a life as contentiously as they do on talk radio . ”

I grew up in Minnesota , in a suburb of the Twin Cities called Lakeville , and it was wonderful .
I was close to the Twin Cities but just far away enough for an almost rural life .
My favorite times of the year were Spring , when the snows had melted and the plants were starting to grow and bud , and Fall , when the leaves turned color and the brisk winds were a pleasant relief from the Summer heat and humidity .
But other than those two seasons of the year , the weather was harsh .
Summer was very hot and humid .
We would go to the malls and movie theaters just to get into some air conditioning .
Sometimes the heat was so oppressive that sleeping at night was difficult .
The winter was incredibly cold .
We used to be thankful for snow , because that would mean that the temperature would be a bit warmer .
It actually got too cold to snow , and people used to say that we had nine months of winter and three months of bad skiing .
One of the truly wonderful things about Minnesota is the people .
They tend to be friendly and polite , and they help each other .
If a car has difficulty on a snowy road , many people will stop their cars and offer help .
Everyone knows that the next time it could be them .
After I graduated from the University of Minnesota and completed my residency , I got a job offer in Florida .
I lasted all of a year .
Although there are wonderful people there , I felt trapped — there were too many people .
And the weather was almost the reverse of Minnesota : hot and humid for most of the year .
I wanted to run away .
I found I actually missed the cold of my home .
I guess I had become accustomed to it .
So when a job opened in a small , cold place , I took it .
It is a little town I 'll call " Tallman " in Alaska .
Tallman is very rural and small .
In the winter , snowmobiles are the most common form of transportation for getting around town .
That 's when I started worrying .
In Minnesota , the roads I frequented were almost always cleared of snow in the winter , and if you got in trouble , there were other people driving by .
In Tallman , there were neither cleared winter roads nor frequent drivers .
If your snowmobile broke down and you were stranded outside the town proper , you could be in a lot of trouble .
I decided I needed to do something by way of preparation .
Even though our town is small and out of the way ( in the winter , flying in is the only way to get here ) , we do n't lack for necessities of modern life , including access to the Internet .
I did searches through various areas and found special heaters ; small , lightweight blankets that were supposed to keep you warm ; and other gadgets .
I felt uncomfortable with all of them .
In my Web searching , I found a reference to something called tumo .
The websites I visited did n't say much more than that it was a Tibetan technique to keep warm .
It claimed that tumo could keep you warm " in spite of snow , freezing winds , and ice . "
It worked by a meditation technique that would send a " mystic heat " through veins , arteries , and nerve channels .
This process , they claimed , would keep you warm even during freezing conditions .
But they did n't say how to do it .
For the past several years , I have been a doctor , and my interests have been firmly in the scientific world .
The Internet is filled with some rather bizarre medical claims , and I take most of them with more than a grain of salt .
Some of my patients come in with these supposed cures , for everything from hair loss to benign prostate disease .
I always ask for the scientific proof .
Sometimes what you read on the Internet is accurate .
Sometimes it is exaggerated .
And sometimes it is just wrong .
Needless to say , the idea of tumo sounded absurd to me .
But whether it worked or not would be easy to prove .
All I had to do was try it .
But before I could do so , I had to learn it , and I was finding dead ends everywhere .
Finally , I saw a review of a recently - published book that claimed to give the entire process for learning tumo .
I clicked on the " to buy this book " icon and purchased the book over the Internet .
Soon I had a copy of Occult Tibet by J. H. Brennan .
Chapter six exclusively teaches the technique of tumo .
Brennan says that in Tibet the training would take " three years , three months , and three days , " ( p. 61 ) , and this disappointed me .
But he quickly follows by saying that this " clearly has symbolic association . "
I was relieved to discover that it might take a much shorter time .
Besides , the author adds that " the various steps of the exercise have benefits in their own right . "
I was ready to start .
There are three stages to learning tumo , each having several parts .
The first stage consists of preliminary exercises .
The first exercise shocked me and almost turned me off to the entire practice !
So do n't turn away after reading the technique , be sure to read the explanation afterward .
" [ V ] isualize yourself as the naked , virginal , sixteen - year - old Vajra - Yogini , a Tantric divinity who personifies spiritual energy .
This goddess has luminous ruby - red skin and a visible third eye in the middle of her forehead .
In her right hand she holds a gleaming , curved knife high above her heard to cut off completely all intrusive thought processes .
In her left hand she holds a blood - filled human skull against her breast .
On the head of the goddess is a tiara made from five dried human skulls , while around her neck is a necklace of fifty human heads dripping blood .
She wears armbands , wristbands , and anklets , but her only other item of adornment is a Mirror of Karma breastplate held in place by double strings of beads made from human bones that circle her waist and pass over her shoulders .
There is a long staff in the crook of her left arm , and a flame - like aura around her whole form .
The goddess is dancing with her right leg bent and the foot lifted up while her left foot tramples a prostate human . " ( p. 62 )
Yuck !
When I read this repulsive description , I figured this was too bizarre for me .
But I read on to discover that " even the worst of the horrors has symbolic significance .
The necklace of human heads , for example , should be seen as representing separation from the wheel of birth , death , and rebirth that locks humanity into the world of illusion . " ( p. 62 ) Understanding that this was all symbolic made me feel a bit better , so I decided to continue .
The book explains that this is just the outer form of the goddess and internally you should imagine yourself empty , " like a silken tent or shaped balloon . " ( p. 62 ) Visualizations had always been easy for me .
When I was studying medicine , I used visualizations of myself easily and successfully passing tests to relieve exam anxiety .
This was a bit different , however , because I was supposed to have two images in my mind at the same time , the external image of the goddess figure and the internal emptiness .
It took me a few days to master this .
Next , per the instructions in the book , I increased the size of the goddess image , larger and larger , until it was as big as a house , a hill , and so on until it encompassed the entire universe .
I stayed with that visualization for a time .
It was , as they say , a real " mind- rush . "
Then I did just the opposite , shrinking the visualization down until it was the size of a tiny seed and then to microscopic levels .
The next exercise is to visualize the Vagra - Yogini the same size as me , and then concentrate on visualizing an energy channel down the middle of my body .
" It should be seen as straight , hollow , about the size of an arrow - shaft , and a bright , almost luminous red . " ( p. 63 ) .
Again , per the instructions in the book , once I had this down I expanded the channel until it was the size of a " walking staff , then a pillar , a house , a hill , and finally large enough to contain the whole of the universe . " ( p. 63 ) At this stage the channel , of course , pervades the entire body , not just the center of it .
Then I was to visualize the channel getting smaller until it was about one - hundredth the thickness of a hair .
All of this was fairly easy for me to do , and within a week , I was pretty good at it .
The third exercise begins with sitting in the famous cross-legged lotus pose found in Hatha yoga .
I had studied yoga for a while , and quite frankly , I could never do the lotus pose .
Luckily , the teacher I had gave me a solution : " Do the best you can .
Alter the pose to fit your needs . "
I found that if I sat on the edge of a cushion I could modify the pose a bit , be comfortable , and get the desired effects of the pose .
Brennan mentions some alternatives , too .
Sitting in this position ( with the right leg on top ) , you put your hands in your lap , palms up , with the forefinger , thumb and pinky extended .
The spine should be straight , chin down , tongue against the roof of the mouth , and the eyes fixed on the tip of the nose .
Take three deep breaths and exhale completely .
Then inhale as much as possible and hold the breath as long as possible without straining .
" As you breathe out , imagine that five - color rays emerge from every pore of your body to fill the entire world .
The colors , which equate to the elements , are blue , green , red , white , and yellow — symbolizing respectively ether [ spirit ] , air , water , and earth .
On the in - breath , imagine these rays returning through the pores to fill your body with multicolored light .
Repeat the exercise seven times . " ( p. 64–65 ) I found this part of the exercise to be very stimulating ; leaving me feeling balanced and energized .
The exercise continues with sound , visualizing the concept of the five colors being part of the syllable hum ( I guess that is the Tibetan equivalent of the Hindu Om ) .
On the exhalation I would visualize the world being filled with the colored hum .
On inhaling I would feel the sound and colors enter and fill my body .
This , too , was repeated seven times .
The next part of the exercise was to imagine that each time I exhaled , the colored hum sound changed to mustard seed - sized versions of fierce , angry , and menacing deities .
Such deities are common in Tibet .
On the exhale they were to fill the world , while on the inhale they were to fill me .
This was repeated seven times .
Believe me , the feeling of all these little creatures , even though they were only visualized , was quite ... interesting , to say the least .
The next part of this step is , according to Brennan , a " critical stage in the exercise .
You are required to imagine that every pore of your body is inhabited by one of these tiny deities with his face turned outward .
The result of this visualization , when performed correctly , is that you see yourself as having grown a second protective skin composed of fierce and angry deities , which functions rather like a suit of mail armor . " ( p. 66 )
For two weeks , I practiced this .
Although I could sense the deities , I did n't have a feeling of them being armor .
Then , at the end of two weeks , I had a dream in which I was having a battle against giant monsters .
Although I battled valiantly , I realized I would lose .
" Somebody help me ! " I cried out .
I immediately heard a tittering sound .
Looking around I saw tens of thousands of tiny , angry , Tibetan gods .
" Oh great , " I thought , " a lot of good they 're going to be . "
Instead of fighting the monsters , they started jumping on top of each other until they formed a wall between the monsters and me .
" Hey , this looks like it might work , " I said .
Then the wall of deities moved toward me , and with a leap , surrounded me like a second skin .
At first I thought I would n't be able to breathe , but I quickly realized that their protective cover did n't harm me in any way .
Better , it prevented me from being harmed by the monsters , although my sword could cut through the beasts .
When I awoke , my first thought was that I had , indeed , been successful in getting the deities to be an armor - like second skin .
But then I wondered , " What were the monsters ? " I thought about it for a day before I realized that I was feeling very happy , content , and peaceful .
In my dream I had defeated my own fears , phobias , insecurities , and other negative qualities .
It did n't mean I had won the " war " with them , but I had won a battle .
That knowledge made me feel great !
Even if this tumo did n't work , I 'd already learned a powerful technique for personal development .
There are two other exercises in this stage , but I 'm not sure that they are necessary for this overview , so I 'll leave it for you to study them and decide for yourself .
In the second section Brennan goes into actual techniques for learning how to generate what he calls psychic heat .
It begins with breath control known as Nine Bellows Blowings :
" Close off your left nostril with your forefinger so that you are breathing only through the right nostril .
" Turn your head slowly from right to left while inhaling and exhaling three times through the right nostril .
" Now close off your right nostril and inhale / exhale three times while moving your head slowly from left to right .
" Finally , with your head steady and looking straight ahead , inhale / exhale three times through both nostrils . " ( p. 69 )
This cycle is repeated three times .
The first set has you breathe very , very gently .
The second is stronger .
With the third you inhale and exhale very completely , using the abdominal muscles to help push out all of the air .
For me , this was easy to do .
It only took a short time to get the feeling that I was doing it right .
The next step is called Four Combined Breathing .
Bend your neck over and silently and deeply ( let your chest bulge out ) breathe in through both nostrils as if the breath was coming from about a foot - and - a - half in front of you .
When this inhalation is hard to maintain , take several short breaths to equalize the pressure in both lungs .
When you are totally filled with air , begin to exhale gently , then with greater force , then gently again , all on a single breath .
This is called " shooting the breath forth like an arrow . " ( p. 70 ) Indeed , that name described what the sensation felt like .
The above two techniques are known as Calm Breathing .
The next technique is called Violent Breathing .
It has five exercises that are described briefly .
They all involve realizing that with every breath , energy is coming into your body .
More importantly , the " final technique of the sequence seeks to mingle the internalized life force with the great reservoir of cosmic energy all around you .
This is referred to as the Art of Relaxing the Breathing , a name which suggests the process involves an out - breath . " ( p. 72 ) I took this to mean that I should visualize energy coming in with each breath , combining with my inner energy in my lungs and expanded body ( from the first stage ) , and sent out on the exhalation .
Practice of an hour a day for a week made this very powerful , and I felt filled with power , but not " antsy . "
My power gave me peace of mind .
The next part of this stage involves visualizations .
Again , you visualize the Vajra - Yogini , but " instead of imagining yourself as this deity , you should create an image of the goddess standing at normal human size before you .
This image becomes your contact point with the universal energy and part of a visualized ' generator ' that will produce the psychic heat . " ( p. 72–73 ) When I read that this was where things will start , I got really excited .
I had this visualization down pat within two days .
The next visualization , as before , deals with the energy channel .
But rather than just the one main channel , there are now three .
The center one is hollow , red , transparent , and bright .
Two more go on either side of this central tube , gently curving to the center , crossing each other at the central point and continuing in this way back and fourth .
This is just like the image of the caduceus , the wand that was the symbol of medicine , my profession .
At each crossing point through the center channel , there is a chakra , or power center .
There are four major chakras ( this is different from the popular pictures I 've seen , but most of those deal with the Hindu chakras , so I made up my mind to try this out . )
The next part is difficult to explain in a brief article like this ; you 'll have to get a copy of Occult Tibet for yourself .
The basic idea is that you take two letters of the Tibetan alphabet ( for those familiar with it , they are the letter ham and half of the vowel A ) and visualize them in certain ways while working with the breath .
It 's not difficult , just complex to describe .
As you do this work , the letters change to flickering , spinning fires .
At the tip of the Ham is a drop of pearlescent " moon fluid , " which overflows the crown chakra above the head and then flows over the chakras at the throat , heart , and navel , and finally the entire body .
" The overall sequence of 108 breath cycles constitutes a single tumo course .
To become proficient , you will need to repeat six courses over each twenty - four - hour period in the early stage of your training . " ( p. 75 –76 ) I practiced this until I could sense that I had an increased amount of the universal life force charging me .
The book advises to cut the number of courses to four after that increase occurs .
The third stage is triggering tumo .
Brennan reveals that there are three ways to trigger the heat of tumo .
Once you have practiced and can perform all of the exercises already given , the simplest means of triggering the heat is through deep , diaphragmatic breathing .
The third method he gives involves visualizing yourself with all of the above images and with suns blazing in the palms and soles .
Bring the palms together and then the soles so the suns meet , then rub the palms and feet against one another . " [ F ] ire will flare up to strike the sun below the navel , then the [ Ham ] symbol , and go on to permeate your whole body . "
There 's a bit more to it revealed in the book , but this is the basic idea .
However , it was the second method that most interested me : " While seated in a simple cross - legged position , grasp the underneath of your thighs with your hands .
Use your stomach and abdominal muscles to circle the belly area three times to the right and three times to the left while keeping the torso still .
( You can prepare for this by first moving the muscles left and right , then gradually building up to a circular movement . )
Churn the stomach vigorously by rippling the muscles from top to bottom , then shake your body like a dog that has just come out of the water .
While you are doing so , raise yourself a little on your crossed legs , then drop back again onto your cushion , in effect bouncing a little off the floor .
Repeat this whole exercise three times , ending with a more vigorous bounce . " ( p. 76 )
According to Brennan , if you perform twenty - one vigorous bounces while doing the visualization for a week , " you will be able to endure almost any degree of cold " ( p. 77 ) while wearing only a thin cotton robe .
This was what I wanted !
I practiced daily for a couple of weeks .
Then I settled down to practicing only twice a week .
By this time , Spring had arrived , and the snows were melting .
I was giving myself several months of practice before relying on tumo for my safety .
I could swear that I was generating heat , but was it my imagination or was it real ?
Then there was a surprise cold spell and a late snow .
I decided to test what I had learned .
I drove out to the side of a large hill not far from Tallman .
By the afternoon , the sun was behind one side of the hill , and the dark side was not only covered with eight inches of snow , but was in the shade .
The cold had gotten worse , so it was n't going to snow any more that afternoon or night .
Using a snow shovel , I quickly made a six - foot - high pile of snow .
Then I packed it down firmly and piled on more snow .
I repeated this until I had a six - foot - tall mound of hard - packed snow .
It was a little after 4:00 when I climbed to the top of the pile and stripped off my parka and outer clothes , leaving only my underwear .
I sat down , cross-legged , making a crunching sound as the snow compressed under me .
Within seconds , my teeth were chattering and my skin started to feel numb .
I closed my eyes to focus on what I was going to do and started using the second method to trigger the tumo heat .
My stomach churned side to side and top to bottom .
I bounced once .
I did the visualization .
I repeated this , making the bounce more vigorous and gave more effort to the visualization , trying to make it even stronger than before .
On the third round , everything seemed to flow .
I got an eerie feeling that time was changing .
I think the visualization lasted a long time .
After the fourth round , I noticed that my teeth were not chattering and my body did not feel numb at all .
I was feeling rather comfortable .
Was this really working ?
By the seventh bounce and visualization , I was feeling peaceful and warm .
Actually , I was feeling very warm .
I realized that there was nothing in the book that said how long this effect would last .
I just sat there with my eyes closed , relaxing , feeling comfortable .
And then I noticed something odd .
It was a sensation I had experienced innumerable times before , but it was odd right now .
There was a slightly itching sensation at the tip of my nose .
It was a drop of sweat !
I was perspiring .
This really works .
I wiped the sweat from my nose , but my realization had broken the state I was in .
I opened my eyes .
It was dark in front of me .
Every where I looked it was dark .
I was terrified .
What had happened ?
I looked up and saw stars .
The heat from my body had been so warm and so long lasting that it had formed a hole four - feet deep in the snow !
As I clambered out of the hole , I realized how desperately cold it was and struggled back into my icy clothes .
There was a propane heater on my snowmobile and I started it up .
In a few minutes I was warm without the need for tumo .
Now that I had this technique and knew that it worked , I would n't have to rely on having a supply of propane for an unknown amount of time .
I could be safe and warm and not worry .
But for how long ?
I thought about the stars and realized that it was night .
I checked the watch I had left on the snowmobile .
It read 10:37 pm .
I had been safe , warm , and comfortable for over six hours !
This was absolutely astounding and amazing .
Having lived in areas that get very cold for most of my life , I can tell you that one way to survive the cold is to build a small snow building like a cave or igloo .
Sheltered from the wind and warmed by your body heat , it may be your only way to survive without dying from hypothermia .
So it could be that the pit - like hole in the snow was what kept me warm and safe that afternoon and evening .
At least , that 's what the skeptical side of me would say .
But who or what made the hole ?
I did n't dig it .
In fact , I made sure that the snow was firm and hard packed so I could n't just sink down .
Even if you accept the idea that the pit I sank into kept me warm , the only conclusion I can make is that through tumo , as taught in Occult Tibet , I was able to create enough heat to create that pit in the snow .
I look forward to the mild summer weather ahead , but I intend to keep up my practice .
Winter will come again and I feel very safe .
Perhaps I 'll melt some new holes in the snow in a few months .
OOPS .
Would help if I uploaded the video .

WASHINGTON 
After coming up short in a first effort , a Democratic lawmaker has again introduced legislation that would roll back a ban on Internet gambling enacted when Republicans led Congress .
The legislation , introduced this month by Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts , would allow the Treasury Department to license and regulate online gambling companies that serve American customers .
Under the current law , approved by Congress in September 2006 , financial institutions are banned from handling transactions made to and from Internet gambling sites .
At a news conference announcing the legislation , Mr. Frank , who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , pointed out that the federal government could collect increased tax revenues if Internet gambling was regulated .
But he said online gambling should be legal as a matter of personal liberty , calling it an activity the government should neither encourage nor prohibit .
“ Most actions the government should stay out of , ” Mr. Frank said .
Mr. Frank ’s bill has roughly two dozen co-sponsors , most of them Democrats .
He did not seek the backing of the Obama administration or the leadership in either the House or the Senate .
Dante ’s Inferno has been receiving some high marks from the press , and bears more than just a passing resemblance to the famous series , God of War .
In an interview with CVG , Stig Asmussen , director of God of War 3 , was more than welcoming of the competition his team was facing from EA .
In fact , he has high hopes for that team as well .
“ Outside of a few previews and a high - res trailer , I have n’t really seen much of the game .
So far though , the impressions from the press sound really good .
Some of the guys who used to work on GOW are working on Dante’s .
Really good guys .
I hope they make a fantastic game that serves as good competition for us .
I think using Dante ’s Inferno as a theme could really cook into something special – it is a very rich world to draw from .
As far as a threat to Kratos goes , I hope so .
We need more great games in this genre ! ”
It ’s always good to see respect and acknowledgment amongst competitors within this industry , and we ca n’t wait to see the progress made on both titles .
Stig was also asked for his take on the Devil May Cry series , and this is what he had to say :
“ Gameplay wise I think it is pretty fantastic !
We have learned a ton from that series and it has given us a great deal of inspiration .
The combat in the game is always a topic of conversation in the studio .
I remember when I played the first Devil May Cry several years back .
I was working at Midway Games .
We fired it up at work and everyone ’s jaw dropped .
It instantly received the name ‘ Game Developers May Cry ’ , because we just wanted to go home and cry because we did n’t think it was possible to make a game that awesome ! ”

Sophomore mechanical engineering major Justin Lambert reported that one male zombie looked at him funny after he came out of the campus rec center .
" This kind of shit is supposed to happen in Iowa City , but not here , " Lambert said .
" I 'm going back to my room now to play video games . "
Lambert 's girlfriend , freshman Stacey Hoffmeier , addead that one female zombie " said something about playing rugby and then jumped into a waiting Subaru .
She looked so much like us , it was creepy . "
Governor Chet Culver called an emergency press conference in Des Moines to discuss the crisis , but quickly ran offstage after a conga line entered the room singing " All I Owe Ioway " from State Fair .
" Is n't it just fabulous ? " one singer asked Des Moines Register reporter Reid Forgrave .
In Davenport , homemaker Laura Lewis was despondent .
" I just saw two men holding hands in front of the courthouse , " she said .
" My marriage of 30 years will never be same .

One of the toughest things for people to do is to anticipate sudden change .
Typically we project the future by extrapolating from trends in the past .
Much of the time this approach works well .
But sometimes it fails spectacularly , and people are simply blindsided by events such as today ’s economic crisis .
After an occupation and strike lasting over six weeks workers at the FCI Microconnections in Mantes - la - Jolie have saved their jobs .
The strike began on February 24th with workers demanding assurances on their future .
Management refusal to give information on production at an equivalent factory in Singapore and an announcement that there was ' overstaffing ' led workers to believe that the company was planning to shut the factory down and shift production .
Over half of the factory 's 400 workers occupied the factory to prevent any removal of equipment .
Workers held the factory and picketed for seven weeks , in spite of a legal order to quit the premises issued on the 26th of March .
100 workers responded by going to the company headquarters in Versailles and blockading the chief executive in the building for four hours to demand negotiations .
Management continued to deny that any redundancies were planned until the CGT uncovered a document detailing a redundancy plan for November on the 3rd of April .
This increased support amongst the workers , especially the non-strikers .
A week later after negotiations between the CGT and CFDT unions and management , mediated by the region 's sous - prefet and the work and employment bureau , an agreement was announced .
The workers had succeeded in winning a guarantee that the factory would stay open until 2014 with no job losses before 2011 .
Workers also won payment for 27 of their 34 strike days .
A team of brothers has won the U.S. finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup on Tuesday and we have a video of this project , and two others , to make you feel like you were there .
The Imagine Cup , now in its seventh year , is Microsoft 's contest for high school and college students worldwide in which teams develop software with the aim of solving global social , economic or environmental problems .
The U.S. finals were held in Boston .
The youngest member of team Multipoint is still in high school .
The three brothers from Oregon ( Jimmy , Mark and Luke Dickinson ) created a Silverlight extension to one of Microsoft 's existing education systems that allows multiple students to use the same computer at the same time , maximizing the use of limited hardware .
The project is intended to stretch the budgets of schools that do n't have the funds for large computer labs .
MultiPoint Web includes a component that lets users store lessons , courses , and activities to be shared around the world in multiple languages via a Web interface .
The team will represent the U.S. in the worldwide finals held in Cairo , Egypt , in July .
Prizes for Imagine Cup 2009 will total more than $ 180,000 ( U.S. ) across the nine categories in which students are competing , Microsoft says .
Here 's an overview of the finals , with a preview of several more of the final projects
This project shows just how creative some of the entries were .
This is a Windows mobile application intended to help teens become better drivers .
The application blocks texting when a person is driving .
But wait , there 's more .
It also collects data on how well the person is driving -- such as rapid starts and stops .
It can alert the teen ( and the parent ) if the teen is driving poorly .
Less than a week after dashboard camera footage of a traffic stop grabbed national headlines , Dallas police are now investigating a new scandal involving officers and video from a Dallas squad car .
Dallas police confirmed Tuesday that two high - ranking officers have been reassigned and others may face criminal charges in connection with an arrest captured by the dash - cam .
Early in the morning of March 20 , Dallas police pulled over three men suspected in a hit - and - run in downtown Dallas .
An officer on the scene said his fellow officers took it too far during the arrest .
" The important thing is that one of our own officers brought this to our attention , and we are investigating it as a result , " Lt. Andrew Harvey said .
According to a police report , Eric Delagarza was combative as officers tried to put him in the back of a squad car .
The report goes on to say Senior Cpl. Armando Dominguez shocked Delagarza multiple times with a stun gun .
The department is looking into how the weapon was used and what was said .
An officer reportedly told Delagarza to " take it like a man , " according to the police report .
Dallas police have not released the video , saying it may have to be used as evidence in an excessive - force investigation .
" Right now we are reviewing the tape to be sure that a criminal offense has not occurred , " Harvey said .
Two sergeants , Elsa Martinez and Elliott Forge , who were supervising the scene , have been taken off the streets while police investigate .
" We want to make sure we protect the integrity of the police department , and it is in the best interest of the city to conduct an internal and a criminal investigation , " Harvey said .
Delagarza , who is out of jail , has been charged with assaulting an officer and evading arrest .
He said he has been instructed by his attorney to not comment on the case .
Some authors try to imagine how could life in Soviet Russia could be depicted if there was no a strict censorship on the expressions of sensuality .

GOP lawmaker can only name 1 of 17 socialists he said were in Congress Greg Fulton
Published : Tuesday April 14 , 2009
Print This Email This An Alabama Republican lawmaker who declared last week that a gang of socialists are stalking the halls of Congress is apparently taking the Fifth .
Rep. Spencer Bachus ( R - AL ) told a gathering in Trussville , Ala. on Apr. 9 that there were 17 socialists in Congress .
" Some of the men and women I work with in Congress are socialists , " said Bachus , the top Republican on the Financial Services Committee .
But pressed to name the 17 , he 's only been able to come up with one .
And that senator , self - professed " Democratic socialist " Bernie Sanders ( D - VT ) wants to know the rest .
Sanders joined the chorus of reporters and lawmakers Tuesday pushing Bachus to make good on his claim that 17 socialists reside in Congress .
" Has Spencer released his list yet ? "
Sanders asked Politico .
" Everybody 's waiting with bated breath . "
 I think at the very least he has to tell people what his definition of socialism is , " he added .
" And I think he should tell us who he was referring to , whos on the list . 
Bachus has so far has decided to keep " the list " a secret , which he first referred to in his hometown newspaper .
The same day , Bachus had praised President Barack Obama .
" He 's a better listener than George W. Bush , " Bachus said .
" He tries to get ideas from people . "
Now Bachus finds that others are listening to him .
His office has made no official comment on his charge and has n't responded to repeated requests for comment .
So far , groups like the Democratic Socialists of America , Socialist Party USA and the Socialist Party Republicans have made little of Bachus ' comments .
Bachus ' comments remind some of those made by Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) , the freshman representative , who during her 2008 campaign called for an investigation of Congress " to find out if they are pro-American or anti-American , " during comments made on Hardball .

Ever have a bad day at work ?
God of War creator David Jaffe certainly has - and he vented about his frustrations with the PS3 dev kit on his personal blog .
Jaffe , who created the hit action game God of War during his tenure at SCEA before leaving to found his own studio , Eat Sleep Play , is known for being a fervent supporter of his former employer .
He 's also known for impassioned - occasionally rather exceptionally so - rants on his blog .
Sometimes , the two intersect , like when he called out a mysterious MSNBC journalist for being " biased " against the PS3 .
So , perhaps it was time for a change .
For all the folks who think all I do is rah-rah the PS3 all the time , here 's a switch for you : F**K THE MOTHERF **KING PS3 !!!!
At least the dev kit :)
This is n't Jaffe bemoaning the complexity of the PS3 hardware , or its oft - criticized difficult development process ( Jaffe would probably side with Guerilla on the issue ) , or its high price , or anything that people usually criticize the PS3 for .
No , Jaffe is angry at his PS3 dev kit because apparently , the things are too damn fragile :
DAMMIT !
Today I broke off my 6th f**king USB port thingy that hooks the controller up to the dev kit .
I know you can't tell all that well from this pic , but that little black tab on the floor is the thing that hooks the end of the usb cable into the ps3 .
And they are very , very fragile for some unknown motherf ** king reason .
And I was simply walking by the damn dev kit and the cord caught on my leg and snap !
God Damn
Motherf ** ker just popped and shut my day down .
It is n't just Jaffe 's problem , either ( or at least , he says it 's not ) : " According to our producer Angelic , she has already had to send 8 of the God Damned things in for repair !
So at least I do n't feel so bad about being the only one this happens to .
But still ... DAMN ! "
Alas , Jaffe may not be able to play whatever game he was hoping to try out until ... well , tomorrow .
This would n't be the first time the hot - tempered David Jaffe has spouted off on his blog , either .
One wonders what he'd do if he ever got a RRoD .

If the Republican Party wants to go on a listening tour to figure out what they need to do , they may start turning off their radios and televisions too .
Every day we post about the absurdity that is the Republican Party and every day a completely new mind - numbing smear comes out .
I understand what they are doing .
They feel if they keep chipping away at President Obama with nonsensical complaints , it will slowly erode his popularity .
The problem they face is that they look like loons doing it , and all the polls point to the same conclusion .
It 's good for ratings on FOX , because those uber - loons are watching the little horde of Republican lunatics in action with a fervent glee , but mainstream America is laughing at them .
The new one is that Obama had the nerve , the nerve I tell you ! of ordering Dijon mustard with his overcooked burger , and the media is covering up that fact .
As usual , Sean Hannity and the right wingnutosphere are all over it like Dijon on fries .
Following President Obama 's May 5 visit to Ray 's Hell Burger in Arlington , Virginia , Sean Hannity , Laura Ingraham , and Rush Limbaugh Show guest host Mark Steyn criticized Obama as an elitist because he ordered a burger with " spicy mustard " or " Dijon mustard . "
Hannity claimed that Obama ordered a " fancy burger " with a " very special condiment , " while Steyn asserted Obama is trying " to enlighten us " through his order .
Ingraham asked of Obama : " What kind of man orders a cheeseburger without ketchup but Dijon mustard ? ...
The guy orders a cheeseburger without ketchup ?
What is that ? "
In their discussions of Obama 's burger order , Hannity , Ingraham , and Steyn all referenced a Grey Poupon commercial featuring actors portraying wealthy British men expressing desire for the mustard .
I happen to like the spicy taste of Dijon too .
Hey .
I noticed there 's a Hate Hannity Hotline .
I hope I make it there sometimes .
He 's too cowardly to have me on his show , so I 'd really like to make the Hotline .
TIME magazine rips the Republican Party apart as Rep. Patrick McHenry says that Reaganism is dead .
Time Magazine 's new analysis of the state of the Republican Party is absolutely devastating .
It stops just short of pronouncing the still twitching corpse dead .
And it is n't just mainstream conservatives like Arlen Specter fleeing in droves ; even the target demo -- Know Nothing nitwits like Joe the Plumber are leaving too !
And the North Carolina pip-squeak congressman who once bragged he would be the model of ultimate right - wing obstructionism , Patrick McHenry , is now declaring Reaganism over .

The precariously moored West Antarctic ice sheet probably wo n’t collapse into the ocean all in one go as the climate warms .
But the bad news , says a researcher , is that the sections most likely to be released into the ocean would raise sea levels globally by 3.3 metres – and rather more on the shores of North America .

The West Antarctic ice sheet , the smaller of the icy continent ’s two giant slabs of ancient ice , is moored to an archipelago of islands , many of them below sea level .
It is held in place by floating ice shelves .
Glaciologists had feared that warm water could melt the shelves , releasing the entire sheet into the ocean , raising sea levels by up to 5 metres .
Concern has increased with recent failures of floating Antarctic ice , such as the Wilkins shelf .
A recent study ( pdf format ) found that the West Antarctic ice sheet would probably collapse if sea temperatures rose by more than 5 °C .
But now Jonathan Bamber at Bristol University , UK , has analysed which parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet are vulnerable .
He concludes that a third might stay put , mostly because it is moored above sea level .
“ The area ’s potential contribution to sea level has been greatly overestimated , ” he says .
Gravitational shift
Unfortunately , however , the loss of Antarctic ice would shift the Earth ’s gravitational pull , causing water to pile up in the northern hemisphere .
Around North America this could increase anticipated sea - level rise by about a quarter .
In March , Bamber argued that the other giant ice sheet vulnerable to global warming , the Greenland ice sheet , is also more resistant to temperature rise that experts had thought .
But not all glaciologists think it has significantly changed the planet ’s immediate prognosis .
“ The crucial question is how much ice could be lost in the next 100 to 200 years , and Jonathan ’s work has not really changed that , ” says David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey .
Most predictions , he says , put global sea - level rise in the coming century at around 1 metre – but more will follow .

PSYCHIATRISTS DON ’T cry .
As they delve into unfathomable pain , they must remain completely unemotional .
Last week , Prof Richard Green of Imperial College in London admitted that in 40 years of clinical work , there was one occasion when he broke down and cried .
It was while he was listening to a middle - aged Irishman describing the abuse he had suffered as a child at the hands of the Christian Brothers .
Tears come with the territory .
And yet , they are of little use to anyone .
Mannix Flynn , who did so much to break the silence , has warned of the danger of sentimentalising the victims .
What , precisely , do we do with all those religious congregations who are apparently incapable of understanding the crimes for which they are institutionally responsible ?
To understand the import of this question , let ’s take a concrete example .
The State is committed to building a single national children ’s hospital .
That hospital is to be part of the Mater Misericordiae complex in Dublin .
Both the Mater and the national children ’s hospital will therefore be under the control of the Sisters of Mercy .
An absolute majority of the members of the private limited company that owns the Mater and the children ’s hospital are members of the order .
Both hospitals must be run “ in accordance with the mission and traditions of the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy in Ireland ” .
Those traditions have many sides , good and bad , but they unquestionably include the running of an institution ( Goldenbridge ) where children were systematically beaten , emotionally abused and enslaved .
They also include the Cappoquin Industrial School in which a “ highly dysfunctional management ” , characterised by alcohol abuse and “ inappropriate relationships between senior personnel ” , continued well into the 1980s .
Even more to the point , those traditions include a culture of denying and minimising abuse when it was revealed .
Staggeringly , even after listening to the testimonies of survivors of Goldenbridge before the Ryan commission , the provincial of the order , Sr Helena O’Donoghue , told the commission that she did not accept that there had been either extreme violence used against children or “ daily unjustified physical abuse ” .
She continued to insist that Goldenbridge was a “ reasonably effective and caring institution ” .
On the practice of child slave labour at Goldenbridge , with children from the age of seven forced , on pain of beatings , to make 60 Rosaries a day ( 90 on Saturdays ) for a commercial manufacturer , Sr Helena described it “ as a pleasant activity to while away the time , which was enjoyed by the children and often done to music from the radio ” .
The activity was certainly pleasant for the nuns , who made so much money from it that they were able , in the 1950s , to put £ 1,000 towards the purchase of a holiday home for themselves .
This heroic level of denial fed into the scandalous deal between the State and the religious congregations : Sr Helena was the lead negotiator for the orders and her ex-employee at the Mater , Bertie Ahern , was taoiseach .
That deal protected , among other things , the order ’s control of the Mater itself and the € 40 million it got when it sold the Mater private hospital in 2000 .
The stark fact is that the State is planning to put both € 1 billion of public money and the care of sick children into the hands of a “ tradition ” that has been completely unable to grasp the meaning of what it did to children in industrial schools .
And this is just one example of the wider problem we face .
Just one of the religious congregations involved , the Rosminians , has had the grace to acknowledge fully its collective guilt and act accordingly .
The simple principle it adopted was , as Fr Joseph O’Reilly told the commission , “ Do no more harm . ”
Staggeringly , this position was , the commission said , “ unique ” .
Just one single congregation , in other words , has grasped the idea of doing no more harm as the primary imperative .
Which leaves us with a blunt choice .
Is it or is it not acceptable in the 21st century that institutions who cannot understand their obligation to do no more harm are still the trustees of our schools and hospitals ?
This is not an abstract question .
Just last week , we learned that the Department of Education has not responded after 15 months to a request by the parents ’ group Educate Together to be recognised as a patron for second - level schools .
We also heard Catholic bishops demanding that they be made co-patrons of new , non-Catholic State primary schools .
The arrogant demand for control has not changed .
In one of the most moving testimonies a priest who had run the notorious school at Daingean reported listening to a beating outside while he was praying to Christ and realising that “ Christ himself is being punished now right beside me . ”
It is time to say , in the words of James Larkin , “ You ’ll crucify Christ in this town no longer . ”
Just how conservative is the Supreme Court , anyway ?
It 's a question that has dogged constitutional scholars for years , as they 've tried to parse the opaque language and muddled writings of judges moving through the confirmation process .
Today 's court , headed by John Roberts with seven justices appointed by Republican presidents , is generally considered more conservative than the Supreme Court of the 1950s , for example , when Earl Warren oversaw its unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education .
But it 's hard to compare the current court — and today 's justices — with , say , the Burger court of the 1970s , which , with six Republican - appointed justices , decided Roe v. Wade .
John McCain , for one , does n't seem to want to take any chances .
Last week , he joined a long line of Republican presidential candidates who have pushed for a more conservative court when he promised to make Samuel Alito and John Roberts his " models " for judicial appointments .
But how conservative would a McCain presidency make the court — and how conservative is it already ?
The answers to these questions may be found in a new paper by Richard Posner , a judge who sits on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals , and William Landes , a law professor at the University of Chicago , that is now making its way through the academic community .
In " Rational Judicial Behavior : A Statistical Study , " Posner and Landes use a database that includes the political background and voting records of the past 70 years of Supreme Court justices — who appointed each justice and how the justices decided every case — to come up with a ranking , from most conservative to least conservative , of the 43 justices who have served on the court since 1937 .
Their conclusion :
Four of the five most conservative justices to serve on the Supreme Court since Franklin Roosevelt , including Roberts and Alito , are currently sitting on the bench today .
Justice Anthony Kennedy , another current Republican appointee , is ranked No. 10 .
( The table has a full list . )
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer , the two current justices nominated by Democratic presidents , are among the 15 " least conservative " justices of the past 70 years .
Thurgood Marshall , who became the first black Supreme Court justice when he was appointed in 1967 , has the most liberal voting record on the list .
Clarence Thomas , the second black justice , who was appointed to the court in 1991 , is ranked the most conservative .

These findings may not come as a surprise to political scientists , who have devised a range of techniques over the years for calculating judicial nominees ' political ideologies , often based on their records before joining the Supreme Court .
But Posner and Landes have taken their research a step further , examining the actual voting records of justices while they were sitting on the bench .
To do this , they 've relied on a database created by Harold Spaeth , a political scientist at Michigan State University , which codes each vote made on the Supreme Court between 1937 and 2006 as either " liberal , " " conservative , " " mixed , " or " both . "
If a justice votes in favor of a defendant on a criminal procedure case , that vote is considered " liberal . "
If the justice votes against the plaintiff in a civil rights case , the vote is considered " conservative . "
Some of the results of the authors ' analysis are familiar , if not reassuring .
The study demonstrates , for example , that Supreme Court justices , in spite of their reputation for impartiality , really do seem to vote along ideological lines .
With only a few exceptions , for 70 years , Republican - appointed justices have tended to vote conservatively , and justices appointed by Democrats have tended to vote liberally .
" A lot of this just confirms what everybody already knows , " says Landes .
But the paper reveals more than that .
For one thing , it demonstrates just how much every vote on the Supreme Court counts — particularly , it seems , when the court is leaning conservative .
The authors were surprised to find a dramatic pooling effect over the years every time a conservative justice joined the court .
" The larger the fraction of justices appointed by Republican presidents , " they write , " the more conservatively each Justice [ votes ] . "
With McCain promising to nominate conservatives , this finding appears to have real significance today :
The more conservatives join a conservative court , the more conservative each justice gets .
The same thing does n't appear to be true , curiously , for left - leaning judges .
The authors find that the court 's liberal justices are driven to vote more ideologically not when their numbers grow but when they begin to drop .
The fewer justices there are on the court appointed by Democratic presidents , in other words — meaning the more outnumbered the liberal justices are — the more liberal those justices get .
Even when the majority shifts only a small amount , from 5 - 4 liberal to 5 - 4 conservative , liberal justices tend to vote more liberally about 3 percent of the time .
" There 's a real polarization effect , " says Landes .
Today 's court , it seems , appears to be in just this situation , with increasingly ideological justices moving toward the ends of the political spectrum .
But there may be a solution already in the making :
The political atmosphere surrounding judicial nominations , the authors point out , has a dramatic effect on not only what kinds of judges are nominated but how they vote once they 're on the bench .
The more Republicans there are in the Senate , according to the study , the more conservatively the justices they appoint tend to vote .
But over the years , when the number of GOP senators drops — something many political experts think may be likely this fall — so , too , does the career conservative rating of the justices they appoint to the bench .
" It 's an interesting finding , " says Landes .
" There 's some real predictive power here .
You can determine a lot about how each justice is going to vote based on the political party of the president who appointed them and the composition of the Senate . "
LONDON ( CNN ) --
The latest video from Somalia 's al Qaeda - backed Al - Shabaab wing is as slickly produced as a reality TV show but with a startling message -- complete with a hip - hop jihad vibe .
Experts think Abu Mansoor al - Amriki , dubbed " The American " by al Qaeda , speaks in the Somali video .
" Mortar by mortar , shell by shell , only going to stop when I send them to hell , " the unidentified voice raps on the video , which runs at least 18 minutes .
The video also shows a man reported to be Abu Mansoor al - Amriki , dubbed " The American " by al Qaeda .
He apparently is now in Somalia training and counseling Somalis from North America and Europe .
He speaks in American English .
" Away from your family , away from our friends , away from ice , candy bars , all those things is because we 're waiting to meet the enemy , " says the man believed to be al - Amriki .
Watch part of the video »
Intelligence experts say the video was probably made in recent weeks and comes on the heels of an audio message in March purportedly from Osama bin Laden .
In that recording , the al Qaeda leader calls on his " Muslim brothers in Mujahid Somalia " to overthrow President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed for cooperating with the West .
Al - Shabaab is the militant Islamic wing in Somalia .
It means " Youth " in Arabic .
" We 're seeing perhaps their most sophisticated attempt so far to really reach an audience of potential recruits in America , and that 's one of the things that made that video very significant , " said Ben Venzke of the IntelCenter , a Washington - based research group that tracks al Qaeda 's development and messages .
" They 're casting it in a way that 's going to speak to the youth of today , " Venzke said .
" Most of the time , what we 're seeing in their videos directly parallels what the groups are doing operationally , what they are targeting , where they 're recruiting . "
Sheik Ahmed Matan knows that firsthand .
A respected member of Britain 's Somali community , Matan said he knows of hundreds of young Somali men who have returned to Somalia for terrorist training .
" A lot of young people from here , from America , from Canada , from everywhere from Europe -- they went there , " he said .
He added that these men are capable of being sent back home to conduct terrorist operations , even suicide bombings .
" It can be , they can train anytime and send them here , anytime , " Matan said .
Somalis from North America and Europe are beginning to come to terms with the problem of recruitment , he said .
The United States and British governments say Somalia is an emerging terror hot spot , which could pose a threat beyond its borders .
Matan said he often challenges " recruiters " at mosques and elsewhere in Britain , demanding that they stop brainwashing younger Somalis about Islam .
He said the government should play a greater role in monitoring what is said and done at these mosques -- but , he concedes , doing so has proved highly controversial in Britain and throughout Europe .
There is some evidence that al Qaeda is successfully preying on some of those with Western backgrounds .
One of them was a business student from London who suddenly left for Somalia .
He surfaced about 18 months ago on a martyrdom video , just before blowing himself up in southern Somalia , killing at least 20 people , officials say .
U.S. Defense officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , also said months ago that one of their worst nightmares would be al Qaeda operating freely in Somalia .
Now that nightmare continues , with Somalis in North America and Europe admitting that al Qaeda 's reach is spreading .
Venzke said Al - Shabaab has put out more videos than ever before in the past year .
" If that 's what they 're doing publicly , we can only assume how their operations have developed , " he said .

Mr Yettaw made two visits to Aung San Suu Kyi's house John Yettaw is a 53 - year - old American who was sentenced to seven years in prison but then deported after swimming to the lakeside home of detained Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi .
A Mormon , Mr Yettaw said he had been sent by God to deliver a warning that she would be assassinated .
Police fished him out of the lake after he had stayed uninvited at Ms Suu Kyi's home for two nights , sleeping on the floor .
At the time Burmese media reported that Mr Yettaw was carrying a large water bottle , presumably as a buoyancy aid , as well as a US passport , a torch , pliers , and US and local currency .
Images circulating on Burmese official websites apparently taken by Mr Yettaw himself showed a heavy - set middle - aged man .
In one , he was shown wearing improvised flippers on his feet .
His detention led to that of Ms Suu Kyi , who was sentenced to an additional 18 months of house arrest over the incident - enough to prevent her from taking part in elections scheduled for 2010 .
Mr Yettaw 's seven - year sentence was to include four years of hard labour .
But , on 15 August , the Burmese agreed to deport him , and he left with US Senator Jim Webb a day later .
The decision followed a meeting between Senator Webb and Burma 's military ruler Than Shwe .
Epileptic seizures Soon after Mr Yettaw 's arrest Ms Suu Kyi's lawyer said her supporters were " very angry with this wretched American " , whom he called " a fool " .
" He is the cause of all these problems , " said the lawyer , Kyi Win.
US embassy staff have been able to meet Mr Yettaw briefly Opponents of the government have said the bizarre circumstances were used as a pretext for keeping Ms Suu Kyi locked away .
Ms Suu Kyi's lawyer said Mr Yettaw had broken into her house once before , in November last year , and she had immediately sent him away .
On the second visit in May , he reportedly arrived at her house exhausted , lying down with cramps in his legs .
Ms Suu Kyi's companions heard him groaning but did not let him in until after dawn .
In her closing statements Ms Suu Kyi said that in allowing Mr Yettaw to stay she had acted " without malice , simply ... to ensure that no - one concerned should suffer any adverse consequences " .
She even defended him , saying he had a right to say what he believed .
Shortly before the verdict Mr Yettaw was treated in hospital in the Burmese capital , Rangoon , after suffering from epileptic seizures .
' Traumatic events ' A Vietnam veteran , from Falcon , Missouri , Mr Yettaw is also said to suffer from diabetes and heart trouble .
His ex-wife , Yvonne , told the Associated Press news agency that he had recently been working on a psychology paper about forgiveness after trauma , which took him to South East Asia .
John Yettaw used an improvised pair of flippers for his swim Mr Yettaw 's wife , Betty , described her husband as eccentric but peace - loving .
" He does not have a political agenda and meant her [ Aung San Suu Kyi ] absolutely no harm , " she told AP .
Mr Yettaw has claimed to have had a traumatic childhood , and his wife said he suffered a head injury during military service that caused blackouts and seizures .
His 17 - year - old son died in a motorcycle accident in 2007 .
" After Clint 's death , he took something that was already of intense interest to him because of previous experiences in his life , healing / forgiveness following traumatic events , and threw himself into his research , which precipitated his six months in Asia last year , " his wife said .
' Self - appointed saviour '
Soon after his arrest , neighbours in Falcon gave a mixed account .
One , Mike Assell , told CNN : " He was just a very intelligent man to talk to , he was very literate , he had a good vocabulary and you could talk to him and he understood what you were talking about . "
Other unnamed residents alleged that he struggled with drinking and post - traumatic stress disorder , CNN reported .

The Thailand - based independent Burmese publication Irrawaddy said Mr Yettaw appeared to be one of the many " self - appointed saviours " in Burma - foreign democracy activists using direct action to achieve political change in the country .
Among these is Briton Rachel Goldwyn , who in September 1999 was sentenced to seven years of hard labour for singing pro-democracy songs in Burma .
She was released after two months .
Her detention came shortly after another Briton , James Mawdsley , was arrested for handing out anti-government leaflets .
He was sentenced to 17 years in prison , serving just under a year .
Irrawaddy magazine criticised the " activists , experts , apologists , lobbyists , scholars , opportunists , do - or - die religious zealots and mercenaries " who have attempted to make a change in Burma on their own .
The " naive acts cause more harm than good " , it said .

GOP Launches " Teabagging " Parties Posted by Pile ( 9303 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Fox News and other news media are calling attention to a new wave of protests , " Teabagging parties . "
As Rachel Maddow says , " Apparently they did n't check Urbandictionary before they chose their name . "
What 's even more amusing is this batch of republicans are protesting all the policies enacted by the Bush administration .
Where were they when he put all these policies in effect ?
Dan Gross tries to figure out what the " tea party " movement is actually for :
And some actual footage of " Tea Party " participants :
Dumb
Posted by Timothy Rutherford on 2009-04-15 00:34:27 Oh !
They said " teabagging " !
That 's so funny we need to dedicate the rest of the show to pretending not to laugh while repeating the word " teabagging " over and over .
Grow up and make a sex tape .
And if this last dumbass knows nothing about who the protesters are , why ask him ?
He can grow up and make a sex tape too .
Thanks for wasting my time .
Posted by Pile on 2009-04- 15 20:31:33
I think there was more substance to the issue than the mentioning of " teabag " .
Talk about inaccuracies !
Posted by Informant756 on 2009-07-30 15:30:11
I hate these dumbasses who claim that the Teaparties are all " Republicans " and " neocons " .
Truth is , there were many Democrats there , and probably more Independents than anyone .
I happen to be an Independent ( former Democrat ) , and I was there .
And get this straight - I was demonstrating against the Bush policies also !
Jackass die - hard Democrats like you are so goddamned narrowminded that you can't even CONSIDER the possibility that anyone other than your fellow Democrats would attend an anti-Bush policy demonstration .
Sorry to burst your bubble buddy , but only Democrats have their noses that far up anyone 's asses .

The Deal Un - Thought : KFC and Free Meals
The Deal Un - Thought : KFC and Free Meals
By Binoy Kampmark
The idea of a free meal , whatever the quality , always has force .
In a society where jobs are being lost more quickly than they are being replaced ; in a world where food prices are volatile and often rising , an advertisement for a free feed is worth its weight of gold .
Even if it emanates from Kentucky Fried Chicken .
It should be little surprise that a corporate giant like KFC decided to opt for the notion of bread , with perhaps more than its fair share of a circus .
Panem et circenses , as the saying goes from the Roman satirist Juvenal , with its sense of forfeiting responsibility and sound policy .
The corporate sector has lost a huge fan club , with complicit government officials happy to abdicate social responsibility in favour of market gains .
Nothing like gratis chicken meals ( ‘ healthy ’ ones at that ) to stay the rot and resurrect corporate goodwill for the public .
Enter the KFC coupon , available from a website aptly named ‘ UnthinkKFC.com ’ .
‘ Free 2 pc Kentucky Grilled Chicken meal . ’
The recipient is promised two pieces of grilled chicken , at the discretion of the manager , two individual sides and a biscuit .
The offer ’s validity , according to the coupon available for printing , is from May 5 to May 19 , but exclusive of Mother ’s Day .
( Mothers , it seems , do n’t need free KFC meals . )
It also had to be printed by a certain time : 10 the evening of Wednesday .
The company in time was wishing that it had ‘ un - thought ’ its offer .
The high priestess of promotions , Oprah Winfrey , who creates social phenomena in the United States my merely uttering a few words , endorsed the offer on her program .
The offer was also featured prominently on her website .
The masses , with bellies eager for a free meal on download , rushed and queued , overwhelming various outlets in the country .
Within 24 hours of the announcement , almost 11 million coupons had been printed .
By Thursday , the generosity of the food giant had well and truly evaporated .
Having advertised the offer with fanfare , officials were now turning customers back , refusing to accept the coupon .
Chicken supplies were apparently running thin .
The next day , KFC President Roger Eaton was eating his words before Oprah , betraying a certain dottiness in what he termed the ‘ chicken caper ’ .
The company had ‘ had a very big projection of numbers on this , but not in our wildest imagination could we believe the response we ’ve gotten . ’
Eaton is evidently not brimming with much imagination on this score .
In this climate , people will eat food resembling worn leather and cardboard in numbers as long as they believe it is ‘ free ’ .
‘ Health ’ has very little to do with it , even if an assortment of experts have suggested Oprah ’s personal battle against an expanding waistline and her endorsement of a ‘ healthier ’ product made a difference .
This is hardly a time for gourmandizing and nutritional squeamishness .
Having found itself in an uncomfortable position , the company has instructed all those at locations to pass out forms promising a free meal at some later date , accompanied by gratis soft drink .
That ’s put pay to the healthy aspect of it , in any case .
In the end , KFC found that it could barely provide the bread , but certainly the thronging circus .
As one disappointed customer , Shannon Edwards , put it to a CNN affiliate station , ‘ I have to go to McDonald ’s now . ’

Since the California Supreme Court decision almost two hours ago , I have been trying to stay focused on work and get to the many things I have sitting on my desk waiting for my attention , but have been stewing inside and wanting to write a rant - type of blog to vent my frustration over this all - too - common blow of a decision .
But then , I got an email from HRC and watched this video ( below ) and realized that while anger and frustration is definitely a normal reaction , the passion and energy needed to get anything accomplished needs to be refocused and put in the right direction to really make a change .
We can not stop fighting !
Those concerned with equality for ALL must come together and continue to work for what should be afforded to every citizen of this country .
Please watch this video and do what you can and what you personally determine will help to make a difference .
Steve and I make monthly donations to the HRC and I also donated extra today , in accordance with what we could afford right now .
I know that in this economy , that money is tight , so if that 's not possible , donate your time and your energy in any form possible .
While it's hard to remain positive in light of disciminatory mindsets , it 's essential to concentrate on the change that simply MUST come .
We need to educate the ignorant and choose love and equality over fear and bigotry .
BE THE CHANGE THAT YOU WANT TO SEE !

TEHRAN , May 8 ( UPI ) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Friday he had officially registered for re-election in Iran 's 10th presidential election .
PRESS TV said while Ahmadinejad previously was ambiguous regarding his possible candidacy in the June 12 elections , he officially joined more than 170 people who enrolled as potential candidates .

The electoral and constitutional watchdog , Guardian Council , will review all electoral applicants before announcing the final nominees for the June elections .
Among the more notable names registered for the elections are former Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and two - time Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karroubi , PRESS TV said .
Another top candidate is Mohsen Rezaei , who is currently the secretary of Iran 's Expediency Council .
Bram Stoker 's iconic 1897 novel Dracula is regarded by enthusiasts of Gothic literature as one of the defining works of the genre .
The book 's undying popularity has brought true immortality to its eponymous antagonist , the infamous Count Dracula .
The eerie tale has been reinvented countless times in film , theater , animation , and even video games .
Whitney Sorrow , an inventive bibliophile from Michigan , has given the vampire new life in an unexpected medium : a blog .
The original novel , as written by Stoker , is an epistolary .
It consists primarily of diary entries and letters penned by the story 's main characters .
The entries are labeled with dates , which delineate the narrative 's temporal progression .
This characteristic makes it uniquely suited for a blog adaptation .
Sorrow intends to break down the original text into individual letters and diary entries , which she will post in a blog on the assigned dates .
The blog , which is called the Dracula Feed , will enable readers to consume the story in real time .
This literary experiment is made possible by one of the most important features of copyright law — the concept of the public domain .
The underlying function of copyright law is to encourage creativity by granting content creators exclusive rights to their work for a limited term .
The protections afforded to content creators by copyright law are intended to incentivize the production of original works , but the duration is limited so that aging content can be repurposed , brought to new mediums , and be experienced by a broader audience .
Both aspects of copyright law — the protections and the limitations — are needed to maximize creativity .
The limited duration ensures the eventual liberation of every piece of our society 's shared cultural heritage , guaranteeing that it will not be held hostage perpetually by burdensome licensing fees and restrictive terms of use .
Consequently , the limits are essential to maintaining a healthy balance between the rights of content creators and content consumers .
The Dracula blog demonstrates the role that the public domain plays in boosting creativity and ensuring that ageless classics never die or become completely inaccessible .
In its earliest form , United States copyright law granted protection for a duration of 14 years to authors who registered their creative works .
The nature of copyright has transformed significantly over the years as a result of key legislative changes and harmonization efforts such as the Berne Convention .
In both the United States and the United Kingdom , content creators no longer need to register their works , and the term lasts for the duration of their lifetime plus 70 additional years .
Stoker did not register for a copyright on Dracula in the United States .
In the United Kingdom , the work was protected for fifty years beyond Stoker 's death in 1912 as dictated by law at the time — meaning that the book fully entered the public domain in 1962 .
As a result of its current public domain status , the full text of Dracula is widely available on the Internet where it can be appreciated by scholars and new audiences at no cost .
Stoker 's infamous Count , now a ubiquitous cultural icon , can be shared by all .

" We do need a new politics in this country , " declared the leader of the opposition .
" Ordinary people have become unprecedentedly cynical about politics and politicians .
There is only one way out of this national crisis that we face .
Transform our politics ... give power to the people . "
I 've cheated you a little there .
That is not one , but two leaders of the opposition speaking .
The first and third sentences come from David Cameron 's recent speech in which he presented himself as the people 's champion , the blue Robespierre of Notting Hill .
The second and fourth sentences belong to a speech made in 1996 by Tony Blair when he was offering himself as the pink Danton of Islington .
When he arrived in office a year later , Mr Blair demonstrated little enthusiasm for sharing power with most of his cabinet , never mind the people .
Always beware any leader of the opposition who says he only wants to seize power in order to give it away .
David Cameron was not saying much at all about democratic reform before the expenses scandal exploded on Westminster : a dirty bomb that continues to spread toxic fall - out on both sides of the aisle .
Deflection is one reason why both the Tory leader and Gordon Brown have seized on the subject of the constitution .
A debate about that may , or so they rather vainly hope , lift the nation 's gaze from all the squalid scams involving champagne flutes , swimming pools and phantom mortgages .
The next reason is positioning .
The Tory leader has long been trying to seduce progressives with the idea that he is a " liberal Conservative " who is as appalled as they are with the control - freakery of the Labour years .
The expenses scandal provides another opportunity to whisper some sweet nothings about reform .
The Tory seducer hopes to weaken the knees of liberal Britain with the romance of a " massive , sweeping , radical redistribution of power " .
What he 's most ambitious to achieve is a massive redistribution of power from Gordon Brown to David Cameron .
By their works shall ye know them .
The highly centralised style of the leadership of the Conservative party does not suggest that he is genuinely one of nature 's pluralists .
As for transparency and accountability , we still do not know whether Michael Ashcroft , the deputy chairman and Tory sugar daddy , is a British resident for tax purposes .
The segments of the speech with most promise were those which relied for their ideas on Vernon Bogdanor , the professor of politics who taught PPE to David Cameron at Oxford .
In his latest book , The New British Constitution , Professor Bogdanor makes an insightful observation about why devolution and Labour 's other constitutional reforms have not rejuvenated politics .
They redistributed power not between government and people , but between elites , between politicians and judges , and between one set of politicians in London and others in Edinburgh , Cardiff and Belfast .
That persuasive critique provided the basis for the most compelling section of Mr Cameron 's speech .
It would indeed be empowering , though also with considerable complications over which he skated , if the public truly gained the capacity to hold to account the people who run their police forces , hospitals and schools .
He is on more familiar , though very swampy , ground when he demands a repatriation of power " from Brussels to Britain " .
About this , the Conservatives are both deadly serious and dangerously flippant .
We have yet to hear from the Conservative leader how he thinks he will convince the other 26 members of the European Union to renegotiate the complex power relationships within the EU .
" In so far as there is a plan , it is in William Hague 's head , " says one senior Tory , unconvincingly .
It is not at all obvious why Paris , Berlin , Madrid , Rome and the rest would co-operate with a renegotiation at the behest of a Conservative party which is so short of friends in Europe that they are allying themselves with the ultra- reactionary Polish Law and Justice party and the crazily right - wing Fatherland and Freedom party of Latvia .
David Cameron is timid when it comes to reform in Britain .
He sees the objection to privileging whoever is prime minister with the ability to try to fix the race by calling an election at any time of his or her choosing .
He says he will " seriously consider " introducing the fixed - term parliament .
Yes , I am sure he would think about that for all of a sub- nanosecond after he had stepped into Number 10 .
The power is not always such a boon : Gordon Brown used the starting gun to blast a huge hole in his own foot when he dithered and swithered about calling an election in autumn 2007 .
Harold Wilson , Ted Heath and Jim Callaghan all mistimed elections .
But no prime minister has ever seriously considered giving up that power once he had his sticky hands on it .
I will not believe that David Cameron has any intention of delivering unless the promise is written in his blood in his manifesto and then I will continue to doubt it until the legislation to introduce fixed - term parliaments has received the Royal Assent .
Electoral reform of the Commons is the big one .
The Conservatives remain viscerally opposed to changing a voting system which effectively creates two kinds of rotten borough .
In the large number of constituencies where the contest between the parties is never competitive , getting selected as the Conservative or Labour candidate means being given a seat for life - bar disgrace .
One of the origins of the expenses scandal is the complacency this can breed in MPs sitting on seats that are forever safe .
In a smaller number of seats , the 100 to 150 marginals where swing voters determine the outcome , MPs are sent to Parliament never having secured the positive endorsement of half their voters .
In the last election , not a single MP sent to the Commons had the expressed support of more than 50 % of their total electorate .
The Tories have got the rough end of first past the post at the last three elections , because it exaggerates the penalty for being the runner - up as it also amplifies the reward for coming first .
In 2005 , it was worse than that .
The Tories won 60,000 more votes in England than Labour , but Labour took 92 more seats .
Labour is profoundly unpopular now .
But then Labour has not been popular for a long time .
They won a parliamentary majority of 66 with the endorsement of barely over 1 in 5 of the electorate .
The Tories nevertheless remain attached to first past the post , not least because they expect to be the big beneficiaries of winner takes all at the next election as they were for most of the elections of the 20th century .
One promise that I do believe from the Tories is that they will implement a sweeping redistribution of constituency boundaries to make more equal the number of voters in each seat .
This will not make each vote equal in value .
It will have the effect of inflating the number of Tory MPs and culling the ranks of their opponents .
After a decade in which the system has been tilted against the Conservatives , they are going to make jolly sure that in future the bias is in their favour .
As Labour contemplates losing power , some of its senior figures have suddenly remembered that they are mustard - keen on voting reform .
One of them is Alan Johnson , the cabinet minister thought most likely by his colleagues to succeed should Gordon Brown fall - or be pushed - under a bus .
Roy Hattersley , with whom I had many good - natured arguments during his years as a supporter of first past the post , is now a convert to reform .
It is all far too late for Labour .
You can not step in the same river twice .
The time for Labour to be serious about electoral reform was after the 1997 landslide when it could have changed the voting system from a position of parliamentary strength and moral authority .
There were several reasons why Tony Blair reneged on the promise to hold a referendum , left Paddy Ashdown jilted at the altar of coalition and betrayed his favourite uncle , Roy Jenkins .
Of those many reasons , one of the most important was the implacable opposition of Jack Straw , David Blunkett , John Prescott and , most of all , Gordon Brown .
As they sowed , now shall they reap .
A minority of Labour politicians are sincere on this subject , but Labour as a party is completely untrustworthy on electoral reform .
It flirts with the idea when it is in opposition or becomes afraid that it is about to lose office .
As soon as it has power , Labour forgets its promises .
Only one of the main parties has been a consistent and persistent advocate of a democratised House of Lords , a reformed Commons , fixed - term parliaments and the rest of the menu of truly sweeping constitutional reform .
That party is the Liberal Democrats .
They have also , incidentally , come out of the expenses scandal much less sleazed than either Labour or the Tories .
Of course , it is self - serving of the Lib Dems to want voting reform .
A more proportional system would almost certainly give Nick Clegg a larger - that is to say , fairer - number of MPs .
Precisely because they stand to gain , we can rely on the Lib Dems to remain committed to reform long after the expenses scandal has faded from the headlines .
This is not an endorsement of the Lib Dems .
It is simply an observation , which perhaps makes the point more powerfully .
If you want to maximise the chances of securing serious constitutional reform , then the party to vote for is the Lib Dems .
The archbishops said now was a chance to show higher ideals The Archbishops of Canterbury and York have urged voters not to let anger over the expenses scandal drive them to vote for the BNP in next month 's elections .
Dr Rowan Williams and Dr John Sentamu said it would be " tragic " if people abstained or voted BNP at the local and European elections on 4 June .
They said disillusionment was understandable but voters should not allow their anger to be exploited .
The BNP said the bishops did not represent the public 's views .
' Great vigilance '
In a joint statement , issued on behalf of the Church of England House of Bishops , Dr Williams and Dr Sentamu said the forthcoming elections were taking place " at a time of extraordinary turbulence in our democratic system " .
" The temptation to stay away or register a protest vote in order to send a negative signal to the parties represented at Westminster will be strong .
" In our view , however , it would be tragic if the understandable sense of anger and disillusionment with some MPs over recent revelations led voters to shun the ballot box . "
It is an opportunity for renewing the vision of a community united by mutual respect
Dr Rowan Williams
Dr John Sentamu
The archbishops appealed to voters to exercise " great vigilance " in making their decision .
Some parties , they said , would exploit the current political climate to foster " fear and division within communities , especially between people of different faiths or racial background " .
They said , rather than caving in to anger , the elections were a chance to show higher ideals .
" It is an opportunity for renewing the vision of a community united by mutual respect , high ethical standards and the pursuit of justice and peace . "
BNP leader Nick Griffin said support for the party was now sufficient that is was time " the Church of England grew up and decided to sit down and talk with us about the issues that we are getting across for our supporters " .
The archbishops were trying to make themselves relevant in the modern world
BNP spokesman A BNP spokesman added : " We 're the only people standing up against the new religion of multi-culturalism and the Islamification of Britain .
" These church leaders do n't represent the views of the public .
The archbishops were trying to make themselves relevant in the modern world and the Church should stay out of politics . "
' Rare direct intervention '
On a European election campaign poster , the BNP has used an image of Jesus suggesting that he would vote for the party .
Leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg said the church should stay out of politics .
" I do n't think you beat the BNP by telling people how to vote .
You get out there and say we have got the solutions , they have n't .
They peddle hate and they do n't actually provide people with hope , " he told BBC's Politics Show .
Polly Toynbee , president of the British Humanist Association , supported the church 's intervention to speak out against a party they considered to be unchristian .
The BBC 's religious affairs correspondent , Robert Pigott , said the archbishops ' appeal had been a " rare direct intervention in the electoral process " .
Anglican bishops have called for a BNP boycott before but " never with such unanimity and in such forthright terms " , he said .
The Right Reverend Peter Broadbent , Bishop of Willesden , said the archbishops ' statement represented the feelings of all the Church 's bishops and had come about after a bishops ' meeting last week .
In February the Church 's general synod voted overwhelmingly in favour of measures to stop clergy joining the BNP .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Twitter is working on various ways to make money from its fast - growing microblogging service , but advertising is an option that is not currently being considered .
Twitter co-founder Biz Stone said on Monday that the company is developing various add - on tools and services for the businesses and professional users of Twitter , which could create a revenue stream for the company .
He said Twitter plans to introduce some of these tools by year end .
But Stone dismissed the notion of selling advertisements on the popular service at this time , even though ad revenue is the main way most Web start - ups manage to stay in business while keeping their service free for consumers .
“ There are a few reasons why we ’re not pursuing advertising -- one is it ’s just not quite as interesting to us , ” Stone told the Reuters Global Technology Summit in New York via videolink from San Francisco .
Stone said serving up ads alongside Twitter messages could also annoy users .
And he said Twitter does n’t have , and is n’t seeking to hire , the staff to create an advertising - based business .
“ There are no people at Twitter who know anything about advertising or work in advertising .
So we do n’t have anyone there to make or take those calls , ” said the executive , whose real name is Christopher Isaac Stone .
He acquired the Biz title based on a childhood mispronunciation of his name .

DOUBLE STAFF BY END - 2009
Twitter , a two - year - old , venture capital - backed company that lets people send 140 - character messages , or Tweets , has enjoyed explosive growth in recent months .
Visitors to Twitter jumped 83 percent in April from the previous month , to reach 17 million , according to comScore data .
Stone co-founded Twitter with Evan Williams , who is the chief executive , and Jack Dorsey .
Venture capital backers include Spark Capital and Union Square Ventures .
Twitter is searching for ways to make money from its popularity .
Stone said the San Francisco - based company now has more than 40 employees and plans to double its staff by the end of the year .
The company turned down a $ 500 million acquisition offer from privately - held social media firm Facebook last year , sources told Reuters earlier .
According to media reports , Internet search giant Google Inc has also held talks with Twitter about a potential deal .
During Google ’s quarterly earnings results conference call last month , CEO Eric Schmidt said Google would be happy to pursue an advertising partnership with companies like Twitter .
Stone said on Monday that Twitter would remain free for consumers and businesses , and that the company ’s main focus at the moment is developing new features for commercial users , such as “ lightweight analytics ” and a directory of commercial accounts that would verify that businesses on Twitter are legitimate .

He also said the company has had talks with cell phone carriers to make sure that Twitter works on their text messaging networks , and said it was possible Twitter could strike revenue - sharing agreements with some of the carriers .
Twitter closed a round of financing earlier this year pegged at $ 35 million by media reports , and Stone said the company was not under any pressure by its investors to earn a profit in the near future .
He also dismissed the notion of an initial public offering soon , saying the company was only two years old .
Stone would not disclose the rate at which Twitter is burning through its funds , but said its model allows it to continue operating in its current fashion for the next couple of years .
He acknowledged that Twitter ’s rapid growth cannot last forever .
“ We were joking in the office that if this growth rate continues week over week , we ’ll run out of people on planet Earth to sign up to Twitter by the end of the year , ” Stone said .

WASHINGTON -
In what could be an encouraging sign of change in the longstanding shortage of American students preparing for high - tech careers , the hottest subject on college campuses across the nation seems to be renewable energy - a surge of interest largely stimulated by the specter of global warming .
Concern about climate change is apparently galvanizing more undergraduate students to turn toward a subject involving science and engineering , some educators suggest , in much the same way that Moscow 's launching of the Sputnik space satellite jolted baby boomers to turn their eyes to the stars .
What remains uncertain is whether enthusiasm for the science and technology of renewable energy sources will carry over into graduate school and swell the ranks of Americans with advanced degrees in such subjects .
" We have a shortfall of people to do cutting - edge research and do the innovations we need , " said Vijay K. Dhir , dean of the engineering school at the University of California , Los Angeles .
But , he added , " the potential is there . "
The rising interest in renewable energy is so new that it's not clearly reflected in the latest enrollment figures , educators say .
But leaders from a range of schools - including Arizona State University , Indiana University , and the University of Colorado - say energy and sustainability are the hottest topics for their students .
President Obama is mounting a multibillion - dollar push to boost " clean energy , " in hopes of creating millions of domestic jobs .
The effort includes stepped - up support for graduate students doing research in the area .
At the White House last week , he told a group of academics and energy entrepreneurs that " innovators like you are creating the jobs that will foster our recovery . "
The United States has struggled in the past two decades , however , to produce enough homegrown scientists and engineers to meet demand .

Ugobe , the Idaho - based consumer robotics company that brought the world Pleo , the adorable robotic dinosaur , is extinct .
The company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on April 17 and made plans to liquidate its assets .
Ugobe , the Idaho - based consumer robotics company that brought the world Pleo , the adorable robotic dinosaur , is extinct .
The company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on April 17 and made plans to liquidate its assets .
Ugobe unveiled Pleo to great attention and acclaim almost three years ago , but delays and the lack of further development beyond the initial rollout of the robotic dinosaur may have hampered the business .
In recent years , Ugobe changed leadership and moved from its California - based offices to Idaho .
Pleo was always manufactured in Hong Kong .
Perhaps the most sophisticated consumer robot since Sony 's AIBO robot dog ( Sony stopped selling them in 2006 ) , Pleo charmed reviewers and consumers when it finally arrived in stores in 2007 .
With cartoon looks , a puppy - like personality that developed over - time and a web site where you could download personality enhancements and interact with other Pleo owners , the Ugobe creation looked poised for success .
At the time , Ugobe execs promised that Pleo would be just the first of many Life Forms .
The product certainly had the pedigree for success : Furby creator Caleb Chung helped design it and was front and center during the product launch .
However unlike WowWee , which sells robot toys ( that lack the ability to learn or change over time ) for well under $ 200 , Ugobe 's Pleo listed for $ 349 .
That steep price and Pleo 's painfully slow locomotion , lack of features like a camera , speaking voice ( it could make sounds ) , and remote control may have hindered its adoption .
In the end , it 's another promising consumer robot that failed to live up to and beyond expectations .
With some companies pulling back on research and development , one has to wonder if we 'll ever see another product like it .
We take a loving look back at the Pleo on Gearlog .
If you ’re a fan of Grand Theft Auto , you ’re probably wondering when GTA 6 will become available .
And you ’re not alone : thousands of gamers around the world are asking when developer Rockstar Games would release the latest installment of the popular video game franchise .
Release Date
Unfortunately , finding the answer to this question since Rockstar itself has not given any hint concerning the GTA 6 release date .
The only thing we know for sure is that the video game developer has been thinking about the installment since 2013 .
In an article dated October 2013 on Develop - Online.net , former Rockstar North president Leslie Benzies revealed that they did n’t know exactly what GTA 6 would be but that they had “ about 45 years worth of ideas ” for the game .
There are rumors that GTA 6 is due to be released in 2020 .
However , since they ’re not backed by any strong evidence , it ’s best to take these rumors with a grain of salt .
If they turn out to be true , though , the timing does make sense — if Rockstar had been working on GTA 6 since 2013 , they would have had seven years to develop it by the time 2020 rolls around .
Seven years is usually more than enough time to put together a functioning game , no matter how advanced and complicated it is .
Locations and Console Compatibility
Aside from hinting at a 2020 release date , rumors have also revealed that the GTA 6 map will include three locations : the U.S. , London , and Vice City .
Some reports say that the map will cover the entire United States ; if this turns out to be true , GTA 6 will have one of the biggest gaming maps among video games .
There are also different speculations on the console that GTA 6 will debut on .
Some say that Rockstar is waiting for Sony and Microsoft to launch their next - gen consoles so it could time the release of GTA 6 alongside these new devices .
Others , meanwhile , think Microsoft ’s Project Scorpio will be released anytime soon , which can mean that the new GTA game will be launched with the Sony PS5 .
Judge tosses case filed by Pima County Election Department against Democratic Party watchdog
Becomes second citizen recently cleared of charges following arrests while observing elections ...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/16/2009 , 4:36 pm PT
[ Updated at bottom of article with video of trial testimony and the judge 's dismissal of the case . ]
Along with everything else that 's been going on over the past week or two in the criminal investigation hand count of the 2006 Pima County ( Tucson ) , AZ , special election ( see our detailed special coverage here and here , with a bit of followup coming tonight , by the way .
[ UPDATE : Here 's that late report . ] ) , local election integrity watchdog John Brakey has had a trial of his own to contend with this week , following his arrest last September , while serving as an official observer during a post-election hand - count " audit " of the state 's primary election on behalf of both the Democratic and Libertarian Parties .
As The BRAD BLOG reported at the time , Brakey had noticed that a number of ballot bags , selected for the hand - count , had missing or broken security seals on them .
When he asked about them , he was promptly arrested on the orders of Pima 's " Election Director Gone Wild " Brad Nelson , a Republican and long - time foe of Brakey's .
The case against Brakey , heard in court this afternoon , was dismissed by Judge Luis Castillo after the county presented its evidence on the charges of " trespassing , " as we were informed today by Brakey and his attorney Bill Risner , who would n't even need to plead their own case to the judge today ...
" The judge dismissed the case on motion of state 's evidence , because they had n't produced a prima facie case , " Risner told The BRAD BLOG by phone just after the hearing .
Moreover , the judge found " Nelson over - reached as he had deprived the Libertarians of an observer . "
Risner says the court found that Brakey 's actions had led to important improvements in the procedures implemented by the Pima County Department of Elections .
The attorney also tells us that he plans to take civil action against Nelson .
" We 'll probably be issuing a notice of claim that we 'll sue him for personal damages . "
Brakey was ecstatic .
" We really won big , " he said today .
" We did n't even have to put up a defense " since the judge simply dismissed the county 's case after they 'd heard it .
He added that Nelson " really made a fool of himself " on the stand , and promised that he'd send us some video from Nelson 's testimony , and the judge 's admonishments soon .
( We 'll add it as an update when we receive it . )
Brakey becomes the second arrested election integrity advocate in recent weeks to see such charges dismissed following arrests in the course of attempting to observe post-election counting .
This past March , Ellen Brodsky , a Florida election integrity advocate --- and a candidate for Broward County Supervisor of Elections last November --- saw all charges dropped against her , following her arrest last year as she was attempting to oversee the post-election tabulation of her own election .
Last year , Brakey was quoted in video coverage of his arrest , by Tucson 's local ABC affiliate , discussing his " five C's : character , capacity , credibility , civility , and ... citizenship . "
He 's added at least one " C " to the list since then , as he explained to us this afternoon : " Courage .
Courage is needed to stand up and take on these bullies to regain and rebuild our democracy . "
* * *
To hold us over until we have video of Nelson on the stand during today 's short - lived trial , here 's
The BRAD BLOG classic of Brad " Election Director Gone Wild " Nelson , completely flipping out following a question from Brakey at a public meeting in February of 2006 ( original exclusive coverage and full transcript here ) ...
* * *
LATE UPDATE : David Safier , a witness for the defense who was not called today since the judge ended the trial before the defense put on its case , covers today 's court ruling , and offers an inside perspective on what led to the arrest in the first place , as he was an auditor at last September 's hand count when Brakey was hauled away in cuffs .
[ Disclosure : Safier also has guest blogged about the Pima RTA election for The BRAD BLOG ] .
In addition to explaining what happened last September , Safier writes :
Brakey is something of a bull in a china shop .
When he sees a problem --- and he sees plenty in Pima County elections --- he charges in without worrying what Emily Post might think .
But an election system is n't a Wedgewood teacup .
It has to be robust enough to withstand rough scrutiny .
...
Brad Nelson comes out looking bad almost every time his work is called into question .
And today , in a court of law , Nelson came out looking bad once again .
UPDATE 4/17/09 , 11:11 am PT : Here 's the video compilation of Nelson 's testimony and the ruling of Judge Castillo afterwards yesterday , Video compilation courtesy of J.T. Waldron , producer of the forthcoming Fatally Flawed , a documentary film on the entire years - long Pima County election nightmare / struggle ...
The text of Judge Castillo 's ruling ( as heard above ) :
Elections are the hallmark of democracy .
We have to therefore protect the integrity of the election process .
Certainly as an elected official , I can certainly appreciate that .
When I look at the whole context of this , when I consider the testimony that was presented to me , I find that Mr. Nelson has over - reached .
And the resulting actions would not have been charged , but for the fact of this over - reaching by Mr. Nelson .
So I am finding at this time there is no substantial evidence to merit conviction .
I 'm releasing you from this case , and the matter is concluded .
Attorney Bill Risner 's no-holds barred assessment of Nelson today , via email :
My conclusion is stronger than the judge 's measured conclusion that Nelson had " overreached . "
He needs to be fired .
He is not merely a serial liar .
He has serious personality control problems that disqualify him from working with political parties .
He is simply a power mad lunatic , at a minimum .
Calls for the removal of Nelson have increased following last years ' arrest of Brakey .
The hot - headed Nelson is an appointed , not elected , official .
He is appointed by the County Manager who himself is also appointed , rather than elected , by the Pima Board of Supervisors .
As we reported last year , Pima County Supervisor Ann Day said , after a Board of Supes meeting following the arrest : " We 've taken a lot of security precautions , but there are too many problems , and they keep happening ... I think we 've reached a point where we need a change in leadership .
There needs to be trust between the public and the Division of Elections . "
Why Nelson is still in place after all of these continuing nightmares , we could n't tell you .
It 's certainly long overdue that the Supes take action on behalf of the people to remove both Nelson and County Manager Chuck Huckleberry from the jobs that they 've clearly bungled for years .

Membrane proteins that transport hydrophobic compounds have important roles in multi-drug resistance 1,2,3 and can cause a number of diseases 4,5 , underscoring the importance of protein - mediated transport of hydrophobic compounds .
Hydrophobic compounds readily partition into regular membrane lipid bilayers6 , and their transport through an aqueous protein channel is energetically unfavourable3 .
Alternative transport models involving acquisition from the lipid bilayer by lateral diffusion have been proposed for hydrophobic substrates 3,4,7,8,9,10,11,12 .
So far , all transport proteins for which a lateral diffusion mechanism has been proposed function as efflux pumps .
Here we present the first example of a lateral diffusion mechanism for the uptake of hydrophobic substrates by the Escherichia coli outer membrane long - chain fatty acid transporter FadL .
A FadL mutant in which a lateral opening in the barrel wall is constricted , but which is otherwise structurally identical to wild - type FadL , does not transport substrates .
A crystal structure of FadL from Pseudomonas aeruginosa shows that the opening in the wall of the β - barrel is conserved and delineates a long , hydrophobic tunnel that could mediate substrate passage from the extracellular environment , through the polar lipopolysaccharide layer and , by means of the lateral opening in the barrel wall , into the lipid bilayer from where the substrate can diffuse into the periplasm .
Because FadL homologues are found in pathogenic and biodegrading bacteria , our results have implications for combating bacterial infections and bioremediating xenobiotics in the environment .
The Barbarians at the Gate
Why has policing in Britain gone so mad ?
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 19th May 2009
The principal cause of man ’s unhappiness is that he has learnt to stay quietly in his own room .
If our needs are not met , if justice is not done , it is because we are not prepared to leave our homes and agitate for change .
Blaise Pascal ( “ the sole cause of man ’s unhappiness is that he does not know how to stay quietly in his own room ” ) could n’t have been more wrong .
We do not starve , we are not arbitrarily imprisoned , we may vote , travel and read and write what we wish only because of the political activism of previous generations .
Almost all MPs , when pushed , will acknowledge this .
Were it not for public protest they would n’t be MPs .
Yet , though the people of this country remain as mild and as peaceful as they have ever been , our MPs have introduced a wider range of repressive measures than at any time since the Second World War .
A long list of laws – the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act , Terrorism Act 2000 , Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 , the 2005 Serious Crime and Police Act and many others ( 1 ) – treat peaceful protesters as if they are stalkers , vandals , thugs and terrorists .
Thousands of harmless , public - spirited people now possess criminal records .
This legislation has been enforced by policing which becomes more aggressive and intrusive by the month .
The police attacks on the G20 protests ( which are about to be challenged by a judicial review launched by Climate Camp ) are just the latest expression of this rising state violence .
Why is it happening ?
Before I try to answer this , let me give you an idea of just how weird policing in Britain has become .
A few weeks ago , like everyone in mid-Wales , I received a local policing summary from the Dyfed - Powys force .
It contained a section headed Terrorism and Domestic Extremism .
“ Work undertaken is not solely focussed on the threat from international terrorists .
Attention has also been paid to the potential threat that domestic extremists and campaigners can pose . ”
I lodged a freedom of information request to try to discover what this meant .
What threat do campaigners pose ?
I ’ve just been told by the police that they do n’t intend to reply within the statutory period , or to tell me when they will ( 2 ) .
I ’ll complain of course , and ( in 2019 or so ) I ’ll let you know the result .
But Paul Mobbs of the Free Range Network has found what appears to be an explanation .
Under the heading “ Protect[ing ] the country from both terrorism and domestic extremism ” , the Dyfed - Powys Police website repeats the line about domestic extremists and campaigners .
“ In this context , the Force was praised for its management management of the slaughter of what was felt to be a sacred animal from the Skanda Vale religious community in Carmarthenshire ” ( 3 ) .
You might remember it : this Hindu community tried to prevent Shambo the bull from being culled by the government after he tested positive for TB .
His defenders sought a judicial review and launched a petition .
When that failed , they sang and prayed .
That ’s all .
Mobbs has also found a bulletin circulated among Welsh forces at the end of last year , identifying the “ new challenges and changes ” the police now face .
Under “ Environmental ” just two are listed : congestion charging and “ eco-terrorism ” ( 4 ) .
Eco-terrorism is a charge repeatedly levelled against the environment movement , mostly by fossil fuel lobbyists .
But , as far as I can discover , there has not been a single recorded instance of a planned attempt to harm people in the cause of environmental protection in the United Kingdom over the past 30 years or more .
So what do the police mean by eco-terrorism ?
It appears to refer to any environmental action more radical than writing letters to your MP .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) now runs three units whose purpose is to tackle another phenomenom it has never defined : domestic extremism .
These are the National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit ( NETCU ) , the Welsh Extremism and Counter - Terrorism Unit and the National Public Order Intelligence Unit .
Because ACPO is not a public body but a private limited company , the three bodies are exempt from freedom of information laws and other kinds of public accountability , even though they are funded by the Home Office and deploy police officers from regional forces .
So it ’s hard to work out exactly what they do , apart from libelling peaceful protesters .
I wrote a column in December about the smears published by NETCU , which described villagers in Oxfordshire peacefully seeking to prevent a power company from filling their local lake with fly ash as a “ domestic extremist campaig n ” ( 5 ) .
It also sought to smear peace campaigners , Greenpeace and Climate Camp with the same charge .
NETCU ’s site went down on the day my column was published and has n’t been restored since .
But we have only patchy evidence of what else these three unaccountable bodies have been up to .
They appear to have adopted the role once filled by Special Branch ’s counter - subversion campaign , which spied on Labour activists , including Jack Straw and Peter Mandelson ( sadly the spooks failed to bump them off while there was still time ) .
But as Paul Mobbs points out in his new report on Britain ’s secretive police forces , today the police appear to be motivated not by party political bias , but by hostility towards all views which do not reflect the official consensus ( 6 ) .
Mobbs proposes that mainstream politics in Britain cannot respond to realities such as global and national inequality , economic collapse , resource depletion and climate change .
Any politics that does not endorse the liberal economic consensus , which challenges the concentration of wealth or power , or which does n’t accept that growth and consumerism can be sustained indefinitely , is off - limits .
Just as the suffragettes were repressed because their ideas – not their actions – presented a threat to the state , the government and the police must suppress a new set of dangerous truths .
By treating protesters as domestic extremists , the state marginalises their concerns : if people are extremists , their views must be extreme .
Repression , in a nominal democracy , cannot operate accountably , so the state uses police units which are exempt from public scrutiny .
I am sure Mobbs is right .
There is no place for dissenting views in mainstream politics .
I was told recently by a Labour back - bencher – a respected MP untainted by the expenses scandal – that “ if the door was open just an inch to new ideas , I would stay on .
But it has been slammed shut , so I ’m resigning at the next election . ”
Our grossly unfair electoral system , which responds to the concerns of just a few thousand floating voters and shuts out the minor parties ; the vicious crackdown on dissent within parliament by whips and spin doctors ; the neoliberalism forced upon governments by corporate power and the Washington Consensus ; the terror of the tabloid press : all combine to create a political culture which cannot respond to altered realities without collapsing .
What can not be accomodated must be suppressed .
The police respond as all police forces do ; protecting the incasts from the outcasts , keeping the barbarians from the gate .
The philosophy of policing has not changed ; they just become more violent as the citadel collapses .

Q2 . Britain ’s Secretive Police Force .
The Free Range Network .
http://www.fraw.org.uk/download/ehippies/q02/index.shtml
IBM just announced a $ 3 b share - buyback and 10 % increase to their dividend , despite a 10 % decrease in Q1 revenue .
Judging by moves like this , the concept of deleveraging has not caught on at many big companies .
So it looks like financial wizardry will be with us for a while longer .
Using Debt to fund Buybacks and Dividends
It was just last October that IBM raised $ 4 billion from bond sales .
The money was n’t cheap , either .
Yields ranged from 6.5 % for the 5 year bond , to 8 % for the 30 year bond ( details here ) .
And now they announce a $ 3 billion share repurchase , and a div boost ?
Layoffs Too
Official numbers are hard to find , but it looks like IBM has laid off up to 10,000 North American workers so far this year .
Public companies like IBM have a responsibility to shareholders to maximize ROI .
At times that requires getting rid of some dead wood .
But is it really prudent to lay off 10 % of your U.S. workforce , while ramping up spending on share buybacks and dividends ?
That ca n’t be good for employee morale and loyalty .
I ca n’t think of a better way to describe IBM ’s strategy here than “ jacking up the dividend , then doing a big ol ’ share buyback to lure in longs and scare off shorts , resulting in a short - term pop in our stock .
Yes , we have a bunch of liabilities that we should probably pay off first , but we ’ll deal with that later “ .
That does n’t exactly roll off the tongue .
Maybe if the Treasury Dept was in charge of naming it , they ’d give us a catchy acronym like JUDDBSBLLSSRSTPOSYWHBLSPPOFBWWATL .
Focused on the short - term
So , will the buybacks , layoffs , and dividends that IBM purchased be worth the cost ?
Highly unlikely .
They may succeed in temporarily juicing the stock price , which is what management probably wants to happen .
That will allow for bonuses and profitable options .
But will these moves be good for IBM 10 years down the road ?
No .
Sketchy moves like this buyback should discourage investors from buying IBM .
Wall St , however , was impressed with IBM ’s flexing .
The logic must have been along these lines , “ yield good , money good , earnings good .
buy ibm . ”
I do n’t get it , there are a just so many better companies to own than IBM .
Among other tech companies , I ’d take AAPL over IBM any day , even at current valuations .
The Flawed Rational of Share Buybacks
Share buybacks are touted as a great way to return value to shareholders .
They do increase earnings per-share , as the total # of outstanding shares decreases .
In reality , buybacks are often just poorly - timed efforts to support a stock price .
They ’re also a distraction to management , who arguably have no business engaging in what is basically the day - trading of their own stock .
Unfortunately , many boards of directors have the tendency of insta-approving reckless moves like this .
I think of buybacks as debt - fueled orgies , which are usually accompanied by unsustainable dividends .
Buybacks are the worse of the two .
But borrowing money so you can pay it out in dividends is pretty bad too .
GE is arguably the worst offender when it comes to this type of scheme .
In their day , GE made IBM ’s announcement today look miniscule .
From 1994 to 2004 , GE bought back 1.1 billion of their own shares , at a huge premium to their price today .
At the same time , they piled up debt , taking advantage of their AAA rating .
During the 10 year period up leading up to 2004 , GE spent ~ $ 75 billion on dividends and buybacks .
Unfortunately I could n’t find reliable information on how much they ’ve spent since then .
But I ’m pretty sure it ’s a staggering amount .
This year alone , they were on track to pay out ~ $ 13 b in dividends , until they had to reluctantly slash the payout .
Paying the tab
The buybacks propped GE ’s stock up for a while , and the dividends kept investors happy .
But GE is now feeling the hangover from their binge .
They currently have $ 504 b in long - term debt , and seem reliant on the government ’s generosity to roll - over their short - term paper .
They have massive exposure to the commercial - real - estate market , credit cards , and other vulnerable pieces of our economy .
It ’s a shame that a great American institution like GE has been reduced to this .
But it ’ll be a much bigger shame if taxpayers end up footing the bill for their risky loans .
Sorry about that , sometimes it ’s hard to stop ranting about GE .
Back to IBM ’s balance sheet .
It certainly is n’t as bad as GE ’s , but it ai n’t pretty either .
The announcement today may give IBM shares a temporary boost and scare off potential shorts .
But in the long run it will degrade their balance sheet further , and reinforce the cycle of debt .
Here are some highlights from their Q1 2009 balance sheet :
Debt / Equity ratio of 2.28 x .
That ’s quite high , especially for a mature tech company
$ 18 b in unfunded pension liabilities , plus $ 11.4 b in “ other unfunded liabilities ”
$ 9.8 b in short - term debt , plus another $ 21.1 b in long - term debt
$ 12.2 b in cash , $ 1 million in short - term investments
$ 37 b in total current liabilities , and $ 44b in current assets
The last bullet - point is the most concerning .
It gives IBM a Current Ratio of 1.18 x , meaning their short - term liquidity situation is n’t great .
In our current economic environment , why are they scraping by with minimal liquidity , while increasing the dividend and instituting a $ 3 b share buyback ?
They could be putting that money towards paying off their substantial total debt of $ 30.9 b .
Instead , it seems they ’ll keep re-financing and rolling debt over for eternity .
Who knows , they might be forced to sell back those repurchased shares eventually ( GE was forced to sell shares at a ~ 20 year low ) .
Solutions ?
We are in serious need of a compensation system that actually rewards executives for long - term success , and removes conflicts like these from the system .
I heard Lloyd Blankfein , Goldman ’s CEO , on NPR the other day comparing executives like himself to pro-basketball players , “ They get paid a lot too , we ’re all just really awesome at our jobs ” was essentially what he said .
Is he serious ?!?!
First of all , I do n’t recall the last time taxpayers bailed out failed NBA teams .
And while Goldman may have avoided much of the damage from this collapse , they created more than their fair share , in my opinion .
See this post for more on that topic …
Investors and analysts need to start looking beyond PEs and dividends , and into the murky balance - sheets beneath .
We ’ve glossed over corporate balance sheets for too long ( ie highly - leveraged REITS like GGP ) .
This debt - mentality is pervasive throughout American society .
And the longer we put off changing our behavior , the more painful it ’s going to be .
Just to be clear , I ’m not saying IBM is a GE or GGP .
But the strategy they ’re using is simply not sustainable or efficient .
And I think it ’s crazy that investors apparently gave them a big thumbs up today , pushing the stock up 2 % on a down day .
Disclosure : Long Apple , no positions in other stocks mentioned .
Balance sheet data is as of 3/31/09 , pulled from Etrade .
Do You Realize ? is taken from 2002 album Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots
A track by US band The Flaming Lips is to become the official rock song of the state of Oklahoma despite opposition from politicians .
Do You Realize ?
won an online vote to find a state rock song but was rejected by the house of representatives .
Some members complained about bassist Michael Ivins wearing a T - shirt with the communist hammer and sickle on .
But Governor Brad Henry has announced he will overrule the decision and will officially endorse the song .
Republican representative Corey Holland had said he was offended by Ivins 's T - shirt , worn on a visit to state offices last month .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The great thing about this country is he has the right to make whatever statement he wants to make , " Mr Holland added .
" I have the right to be offended by that . "
Fellow Republican representative Mike Reynolds had also denounced singer Wayne Coyne for swearing at an event .
Now Governor
Henry has said he will sign an executive order to adopt the song for the state .
Coyne told Billboard magazine that the Oklahoma City band had never thought they were " battling against what we feel is like a backwards mentality here " .
" It 's really just a couple of these small - minded guys who are the most popular guys in their church and their little small towns , " he added .
" For the governor to stand up and veto it and be on our side - it 's such a great story in the end . "
In the opening sentence of the last chapter of his new book , “ Reason , Faith and Revolution , ” the British critic Terry Eagleton asks , “ Why are the most unlikely people , including myself , suddenly talking about God ? ”
His answer , elaborated in prose that is alternately witty , scabrous and angry , is that the other candidates for guidance — science , reason , liberalism , capitalism — just do n’t deliver what is ultimately needed .
“ What other symbolic form , ” he queries , “ has managed to forge such direct links between the most universal and absolute of truths and the everyday practices of countless millions of men and women ? ”
Eagleton acknowledges that the links forged are not always benign — many terrible things have been done in religion ’s name — but at least religion is trying for something more than local satisfactions , for its “ subject is nothing less than the nature and destiny of humanity itself , in relation to what it takes to be its transcendent source of life . ”
And it is only that great subject , and the aspirations it generates , that can lead , Eagleton insists , to “ a radical transformation of what we say and do . ”
The other projects , he concedes , provide various comforts and pleasures , but they are finally superficial and tend to the perpetuation of the status quo rather than to meaningful change : “ A society of packaged fulfillment , administered desire , managerialized politics and consumerist economics is unlikely to cut to the depth where theological questions can ever be properly raised . ”
By theological questions , Eagleton means questions like , “ Why is there anything in the first place ? ” , “ Why what we do have is actually intelligible to us ? ” and “ Where do our notions of explanation , regularity and intelligibility come from ? ”
The fact that science , liberal rationalism and economic calculation can not ask — never mind answer — such questions should not be held against them , for that is not what they do .
And , conversely , the fact that religion and theology cannot provide a technology for explaining how the material world works should not be held against them , either , for that is not what they do .
When Christopher Hitchens declares that given the emergence of “ the telescope and the microscope ” religion “ no longer offers an explanation of anything important , ” Eagleton replies , “ But Christianity was never meant to be an explanation of anything in the first place .
It ’s rather like saying that thanks to the electric toaster we can forget about Chekhov . ”
Eagleton likes this turn of speech , and he has recourse to it often when making the same point : “ [ B] elieving that religion is a botched attempt to explain the world . . . is like seeing ballet as a botched attempt to run for a bus . ”
Running for a bus is a focused empirical act and the steps you take are instrumental to its end .
The positions one assumes in ballet have no such end ; they are after something else , and that something does n’t yield to the usual forms of measurement .
Religion , Eagleton is saying , is like ballet ( and Chekhov ) ; it ’s after something else .
After what ?
Eagleton , of course , does not tell us , except in the most general terms :
“ The coming kingdom of God , a condition of justice , fellowship , and self - fulfillment far beyond anything that might normally be considered possible or even desirable in the more well - heeled quarters of Oxford and Washington . ”
Such a condition would not be desirable in Oxford and Washington because , according to Eagleton , the inhabitants of those places are complacently in bondage to the false idols of wealth , power and progress .
That is , they feel little of the tragedy and pain of the human condition , but instead “ adopt some bright - eyed superstition such as the dream of untrammeled human progress ” and put their baseless “ trust in the efficacy of a spot of social engineering here and a dose of liberal enlightenment there . ”
Progress , liberalism and enlightenment — these are the watchwords of those , like Hitchens , who believe that in a modern world , religion has nothing to offer us .
Do n’t we discover cures for diseases every day ?
Does n’t technology continually extend our powers and offer the promise of mastering nature ?
Who needs an outmoded , left - over medieval superstition ?
Eagleton punctures the complacency of these questions when he turns the tables and applies the label of “ superstition ” to the idea of progress .
It is a superstition — an idol or “ a belief not logically related to a course of events ” ( American Heritage Dictionary ) — because it is blind to what is now done in its name :
“ The language of enlightenment has been hijacked in the name of corporate greed , the police state , a politically compromised science , and a permanent war economy , ” all in the service , Eagleton contends , of an empty suburbanism that produces ever more things without any care as to whether or not the things produced have true value .
And as for the vaunted triumph of liberalism , what about “ the misery wreaked by racism and sexism , the sordid history of colonialism and imperialism , the generation of poverty and famine ” ?
Only by ignoring all this and much more can the claim of human progress at the end of history be maintained : “ If ever there was a pious myth and a piece of credulous superstition , it is the liberal - rationalist belief that , a few hiccups apart , we are all steadily en route to a finer world . ”
That kind of belief will have little use for a creed that has at its center “ one who spoke up for love and justice and was done to death for his pains . ”
No wonder “ Ditchkins ” — Eagleton ’s contemptuous amalgam of Hitchens and Richard Dawkins , perhaps with a sidelong glance at Luke 6:39 , “ Can the blind lead the blind ?
Shall they not both fall into the ditch ? ” — seems incapable of responding to “ the kind of commitment made manifest by a human being at the end of his tether , foundering in darkness , pain , and bewilderment , who nevertheless remains faithful to the promise of a transformative love . ”
You wo n’t be interested in any such promise , you wo n’t see the point of clinging to it , if you think that “ apart from the odd , stubbornly lingering spot of barbarism here and there , history on the whole is still steadily on the up , ” if you think that “ not only is the salvation of the human species possible but that contrary to all we read in the newspapers , it has in principle already taken place . ”
How , Eagleton asks , can a civilization “ which regards itself as pretty well self - sufficient ” see any point in or need of “ faith or hope ” ?
“ Self - sufficient ” gets to the heart of what Eagleton sees as wrong with the “ brittle triumphalism ” of liberal rationalism and its ideology of science .
From the perspective of a theistic religion , the cardinal error is the claim of the creature to be “ self - originating ” : “ Self - authorship , ” Eagleton proclaims , “ is the bourgeois fantasy par excellence , ” and he could have cited in support the words of that great bourgeois villain , Milton ’s Satan , who , upon being reminded that he was created by another , retorts , “ [ W ] ho saw / When this creation was …?/
We know no time when we were not as now / Know none before us , self - begot , self - raised ” ( Paradise Lost , V , 856-860 ) .
That is , we created ourselves ( although how there can be agency before there is being and therefore an agent is not explained ) , and if we are able to do that , why ca n’t we just keep on going and pull progress and eventual perfection out of our own entrails ?
That is where science and reason come in .
Science , says Eagleton , “ does not start far back enough ” ; it can run its operations , but it ca n’t tell you what they ultimately mean or provide a corrective to its own excesses .
Likewise , reason is “ too skin deep a creed to tackle what is at stake ” ; its laws — the laws of entailment and evidence — cannot get going without some substantive proposition from which they proceed but which they cannot contain ; reason is a non-starter in the absence of an a prior specification of what is real and important , and where is that going to come from ?
Only from some kind of faith .
“ Ditchkins , ” Eagleton observes , cannot ground his belief “ in the value of individual freedom ” in scientific observation .
It is for him an article of faith , and once in place , it generates facts and reasons and judgments of right and wrong .
“ Faith and knowledge , ” Eagleton concludes , are not antithetical but “ interwoven . ”
You ca n’t have one without the other , despite the Satanic claim that you can go it alone by applying your own independent intellect to an unmediated reality : “ All reasoning is conducted within the ambit of some sort of faith , attraction , inclination , orientation , predisposition , or prior commitment . ”
Meaning , value and truth are not “ reducible to the facts themselves , in the sense of being ineluctably motivated by a bare account of them . ”
Which is to say that there is no such thing as a bare account of them .
( Here , as many have noted , is where religion and postmodernism meet . )
If this is so , the basis for what Eagleton calls “ the rejection of religion on the cheap ” by contrasting its unsupported ( except by faith ) assertions with the scientifically grounded assertions of atheism collapses ; and we are where we always were , confronted with a choice between a flawed but aspiring religious faith or a spectacularly hubristic faith in the power of unaided reason and a progress that has no content but , like the capitalism it reflects and extends , just makes its valueless way into every nook and cranny .
For Eagleton the choice is obvious , although he does not have complete faith in the faith he prefers .
“ There are no guarantees , ” he concedes that a “ transfigured future will ever be born . ”
But we can be sure that it will never be born , he says in his last sentence , “ if liberal dogmatists , doctrinaire flag - wavers for Progress , and Islamophobic intellectuals . . . continue to stand in its way . ”
One more point .
The book starts out witty and then gets angrier and angrier .
( There is the possibility , of course , that the later chapters were written first ; I ’m just talking about the temporal experience of reading it . )
I spent some time trying to figure out why the anger was there and I came up with two explanations .
One is given by Eagleton , and it is personal .
Christianity may or may not be the faith he holds to ( he does n’t tell us ) , but he speaks , he says , “ partly in defense of my own forbearers , against the charge that the creed to which they dedicated their lives is worthless and void . ”
The other source of his anger is implied but never quite made explicit .
He is angry , I think , at having to expend so much mental and emotional energy refuting the shallow arguments of school - yard atheists like Hitchens and Dawkins .
I know just how he feels .

Whistleblower protections axed from stimulus John Byrne
Published : Thursday February 12 , 2009
Print This Email This
So much for keeping the federal government from blowing millions in taxpayer money .
The Senate quietly stripped whistleblower protections from the final stimulus package Wednesday afternoon , as the bill 's authors bragged of a bipartisan compromise .
The removal is particularly significant because of the bill 's $ 789 billion price tag .
Despite the ugly record of federal spending in Iraq -- where auditors found problems with $ 88 million in federal contracts , and could n't account for 8.8 billion dollars -- senators quietly nixed the measure from the bill , without explanation .
Talking Points Memo , which cited a source close to the final bill , said the provision was removed by Republican Sen.
Susan Collins ( R - ME ) , one of the senators brokering the compromise .
" According to a person following the bill closely , Collins used today 's conference committee to drastically water down the measure , citing national security concerns as the reason for her opposition , " TPM's Zachary Roth wrote .
In the end , the protections were so weakened that House negotiators balked , and the result was that the entire amendment was removed . "
Some Republicans take umbrage with the idea of blanket whistleblower protections , saying they could damage the US 's ability to collect intelligence .
Project for Government Oversight , a government watchdog group , blasted the removal .
" Accountability got mugged today when congressional leaders stripped federal whistleblower protections from their compromise stimulus bill , " the group said in a release .
Part of the reason for government mismanagement of massive federally - funded projects is that federal whistleblowers have few effective protections from retaliation under current law .
Of 55 whistleblowers who've filed complaints with the Merit Systems Protection Board for being fired or demoted , just two have won their cases .
" Federal workers who expose lax oversight of drugs at the Food and Drug Administration , cozy relationships between FAA inspectors and certain airlines , hundreds of billions of dollars in conscious " underestimates " for the cost of prescription drug coverage , and billions of dollars wasted in no -bid defense contracts face intimidation and retaliation and often are fired or demoted , " the Kennebec Journal wrote in a Wednesday op - ed column .
" And their efforts to go through the chain of command or seek relief from retaliation by agency managers nearly always fail . "
The Obama Administration has n't spoken out about the whistleblower provision 's removal .
Thus far , they 've been relatively accommodating to Republicans ' requests -- for example , removing a provision that would have provided money for the prevention of sexually - transmitted diseases .
Yet , the Administration said they'd be protectors of whistleblowers as recently as last week .
During his Feb. 5 confirmation hearing , Deputy Attorney General designate David Ogden told a Senate committee that he was " a big believer " in whistleblowers .
 I think what we need is a process that encourages whistleblowing in this administration and any other administration going forward .
The business of making sure that were doing the right thing is an ongoing business ,  Ogden said .
The Center for American Media 's Washington Independent bemoaned the measure 's removal late Wednesday .
" It s an odd outcome , given that federal employees are often the first people to notice fraud and other abuses by government contractors , as exhibited in many of the House oversight hearings on the subject over the past few years , " the Independent 's Daphne Eviatar wrote .
" ( Remember Bunnatine Greenhouse , who lost her job after blowing the whistle on the no- bid contracts for Halliburton ? ) "
" The sticking point on the federal workers may be , as I explained before , the strong opposition from Republicans to providing whistleblower protection to intelligence employees , " Eviatar added .
Chris Lewis had denied a charge of smuggling class A drugs Former England cricketer Chris Lewis has been jailed for 13 years for smuggling cocaine into Britain .
His co-accused , ex- basketball player Chad Kirnon , was given the same sentence at Croydon Crown Court .
The pair were found guilty of carrying a liquid form of the drug into Gatwick Airport on a flight from St Lucia .
Cans of fruit and vegetable juice seized by officials last December were found to contain dissolved cocaine with a street value of more than £ 140,000 .
Both men had denied a charge of smuggling Class A drugs .
Lewis , 41 , of Bruce Road , Brent , north London , claimed to have been on holiday in St Lucia and that he was unaware his luggage contained the drugs .
Kirnon , 27 , of Carnegie Street , Islington , north London , was a former London Towers basketball player , who was stopped by customs officers after returning to the UK on the same flight as Lewis , on 8 December .
" In a cowardly attempt to evade justice , you each sought to blame the other
Judge Nicholas Ainley
Test cricketer 's fall from grace Judge Nicholas Ainley told both men they had been motivated by greed and would be handed the same prison sentence .
" In a cowardly attempt to evade justice , you each sought to blame the other for a crime you obviously jointly committed .
" Drug smugglers would not entrust a valuable cargo like this to an innocent traveller , " he said .
Addressing Lewis , Judge Ainley said : " You made it to the top of your profession . "
He added : " This was greed and I am sure that you ran the risk that you did because you deduced that the risk was worth it , because the rewards were substantial .
" You were knowingly and willingly engaged in major organised crime . "
Cigarette papers
Giving evidence in his defence during the trial Lewis said he did not even know cocaine could be converted into a liquid form .
The tins of fruit juice contained dissolved cocaine
He insisted he had no idea there were drugs in his cricket bag until he was stopped at the airport , saying he thought he was carrying fruit juice .
He also rejected allegations that he had admitted smuggling cocaine on several previous occasions .
The court heard customs officers seized five tins of juice inside Lewis 's Puma cricket bag which were found to contain a brown liquid which smelt of chemicals and turned out to be dissolved cocaine .
Traces of cannabis residue were also found in his luggage on a silver grinder and on cigarette papers which were tucked into a paperback book .
Lewis had stated he was travelling alone and that he had packed his luggage himself .

His co-accused was also found with three tins of dissolved cocaine in his luggage when he was stopped by officials 10 minutes later .
Kirnon said he had no idea the tins contained drugs and the juice was a gift for his mother .
The court heard the pair had been acting together to import the " very valuable consignment " in a " joint enterprise " .
Tom Wilkins , prosecuting , said that when Lewis 's luggage was inspected , the Puma cricket bag was found to be labelled with Mr Kirnon 's name .
He said it was the " first of a number of links between these two defendants " and evidence " of what they were , together , up to " .

During the eight - day trial each had protested his innocence , casting suspicion on the other .
Speaking after they were sentenced , Peter Avery , assistant director of HM Revenue & Customs Criminal Investigations , said : " Sportsmen and women who are regularly in the public eye have a responsibility to act as role models and ambassadors for their respective sports .
" It is therefore even more disappointing when such role models get involved in the criminality of attempting to smuggle Class A drugs into the UK . "
All - rounder Lewis , who was born in Guyana , played 32 Tests and 53 one - day internationals for England .
He played county cricket for Leicestershire , Nottinghamshire and Surrey before retiring with a persistent hip injury in 2000 , though he rejoined Surrey in 2008 to play in the Twenty20 tournament .

This Saturday Mark Cavendish will begin his second Giro d'Italia firmly established and recognised as the most exciting and charismatic young talent to hit cycling in recent memory .
It now seems almost unbelievable that just over two years ago Cavendish 's first pro-team coach told him he would never be good enough to be a professional bike rider .
The Manxman 's roots make his success story even more unlikely : a former bank clerk and amateur ballroom dancer , the chances of him consistently blasting to victory at 70 k mh on the roads of Europe seemed slim .
But now , his total of 36 victories in three years , around one win out of every seven races he 's taken part in , are an unquestionable indication of his talent .
There 's no arguing either with four stage wins in the Tour de France last year .
Or with taking the Milan - San Remo Classic in March , the Holy Grail of the sprinters races , at his first attempt at 23 .
Becoming the best road - racer Great Britain has ever produced is something the fans have accepted as a mere milestone in his career .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Cavendish is on the fast track towards becoming , as fellow racer David Millar says " a true great " .
But there are often accusations that he is too cocky .
Talk to the man himself and Cavendish makes no apologies for pushing the bar upwards so high , so fast .
" I 've said it before and I know some people think I come across as arrogant but I do achieve what I say I 'm going to do , " he argues .
" There has to be a point and a logic to why you want something .
It 's about knowing what you want .
It 's not about being over demanding , it 's about having the balls to do what you know is best for you . "
Still , there 's also a humble streak behind his brash veneer .
After winning San Remo , Cavendish refused to buy himself the Audi R8 he had promised himself if he won , because when it came to it , he was afraid it might change him .
Rather than move to Monaco or Switzerland as most top riders do when they hit the big time , Cavendish has remained in the Isle of Man .
Together with his fiancée , Melissa , he bought a farmhouse near Douglas , just up the road from his mother 's place .
" Living here is my way of staying close to my roots .
Here I know what I am , where I am . "
Inside his farmhouse , there is only one trophy on show , from the Belgian Scheldeprijs race , the first he won as a pro .
It is as if he wants to remind himself that for all he's now recognised as the fastest rider on two wheels , this is where he comes from .
Cavendish certainly has retained a calculating , almost mathematical , outlook to his sprinting from his bank clerk days .
He improves his dash for the line through endless games of speed chess .
Couple that with an elephantine memory – he says he is able to recall every single dash for the line he has been in since the Tour of Berlin back in 2005 , and is constantly reanalysing them for mistakes , working out the odds .
Cavendish is also a bookworm who devours race manuals .
Every evening , while his team - mates are calling their wives and partners , Cavendish will be committing the finer details of the next day 's stage to memory .
" I will read it for an hour , maybe more , even if it's the top of a mountain , " Cavendish says .
" I need to know it down to the last detail . "
So obsessed is he with knowing the terrain of the finish that he makes the team send out someone to walk the last four kilometres of the big stages , just in case .
He is , he says , not exceptionally talented , but this meticulousness is typical of someone who is exceptionally driven .
Fear of failure is what seems to motivates him :
" The races where I could have done better where I did n't , that feeling just eats me alive . "
After losing a race he expected to win in Belgium last year , he now says " I do n't just rely on my strength .
Now , I win from the front , and by a heck of a lot more . "
" I never demand the impossible .
I 'm a perfectionist .
There 's no excuse for failure .
I never want to be one of these people who say , I should have done this , I could have done that . "
It is to his credit that Cavendish recognises that in comparison to British riders 10 years his senior , he has had an easy start to his career .
As recently as the 1990s , turning pro in mainland Europe for British riders was a question of putting a suitcase in the back of the car , getting on the Channel ferry and crossing your fingers you struck gold .
That was n't Cavendish 's case .
" I was lucky that British Cycling helped me .
I would have gone to Belgium to do it the old way and I 'm adamant to this day that I would still have become a professional .
Maybe I would n't be where I am now at 23 and achieved what I 've achieved but I would have made it . "
Ask him about doping , professional cycling 's scourge , and Cavendish points out that he 's been tested over 60 times in the last year .
He was also the first rider to sign the new anti-doping charter created by the Union Cycliste Internationale back in 2007 .
His team , Columbia - Highroad , have their own independent anti-doping regime , far stricter than that of the cycling authorities .
Despite keeping his roots back home , Cavendish bases himself in Quarrata in Tuscany during the cycling season , has recently bought an apartment , and has taken to the Italian lifestyle .
He confesses freely that he 's addicted to Italian designer clothes , adores the local food and just like every male Italian 20 - something - year - old , when not riding his bike he potters around town on a Lambretta .
As for the Giro , Italy 's biggest race and the second biggest in the world , he has his eye on taking three stages , one more than last year .
And like every Italian pro , Cavendish lays special importance on winning his " home stage " – into Florence , the one closest to his base in Quarrata .
" On top of that , I really want to get the leader 's jersey in either the opening team time - trial or a little late . "
Although he will almost certainly have to pull out of the Giro at some point to keep intact his chances of doing well in the Tour – the season 's main goal – he is refusing to say when , arguing it 's disrespectful .
However far he goes , in the dash for the line in the flat stages that are Cavendish 's natural hunting ground , his tactics are anything but simple .
At Milan - San Remo , Cavendish resorted to low cunning , by deliberately losing time on small hills in a previous race , Tirreno - Adriatico , and saying he was only taking part in San Remo for experience .
His rivals thought that he would not be able to reach the finish , let alone contest the sprint .
They thought wrong , and Cavendish powered over the climbs to become the second Briton ever to win La Primavera and the first in over three decades .
" They thought I would n't be able to get over a bridge , " Cavendish recalls with a mischievous grin .
" These days they have accepted that they can't get rid of me most of the time . "
It looks as if that will be the case for quite some time to come .

A happy update to last week ’s post , replete with scalp - taking ( and , unhappily , death threats against the kid who ’d sponsored the original motion ) .
Women , minorities , punitive liberalism hardest hit :
Following vocal protests from students , the Carleton University Students Association voted unanimously Monday night to : * Support next year ’s cystic fibrosis fundraiser , called Shinerama .
* Donate at least $ 1,000 to the organization .
* Issue a formal apology .
In addition , the student councillor who crafted the controversial motion to drop the fundraiser resigned …
Meanwhile , a group on campus has submitted a petition signed by 1,000 students calling for the student association president , Brittany Smyth , to be impeached over the incident , which they are calling “ Shinerama - gate . ”
Exit question :
When was the last time a group undid a mistake as forthrightly as this ?
I ’m sad to say that I ’m shocked by how well they seem to have handled it .
Tennessee plans to self - report another NCAA secondary violation after a high school recruit was mentioned by name Tuesday on Lane Kiffin 's Twitter page .
Tennessee athletic director Mike Hamilton said it was n't actually Kiffin who penned the post in question but an employee in the football office who was updating Kiffin 's Twitter page for him .
The post was up for about an hour during the afternoon before being removed by Tennessee officials .
It read : " It 's a beautiful day in Knoxville , Tennessee today .
I was so exited to hear that J.C. Copeland committed to play for the Vols today ! "
NCAA rules prohibit coaches and athletic department employees from commenting about unsigned prospects or publicizing them in any way .
Copeland , a 6 - foot - 1 , 245 - pound defensive end from LaGrange , Ga. , is an ESPNU 150 Watch List member .
He chose Tennessee over Auburn , Ole Miss , Maryland , UAB , Central Florida , East Carolina and Southern Miss .
" It was one of Lane 's personal assistants , and it was his first day on the job , " Hamilton explained .
" He posted the message on Lane 's Twitter account without asking compliance .
It was an inadvertent error , but it 's still a violation and one of those things where you 've got to know what the deal is .
We 'll report it . "
This is the second time under Kiffin that Tennessee has had to self - report a violation involving an unsigned prospect .
In February , Kiffin mentioned running back Bryce Brown by name on a radio talk show in Knoxville and referred to him as a great player .
Tennessee self - reported the violation to the NCAA , but Brown was still allowed to sign with the Vols .
Kiffin has been a lightning rod for controversy ever since his hiring on Dec. 1 and has managed to keep things stirred up with some of his remarks about rival schools .
He was reprimanded by the SEC after erroneously accusing Florida coach Urban Meyer of cheating the day after signing day , and the Vols have had to self - report a handful of secondary violations involving Kiffin and the football program .
Kiffin and his Tennessee assistants were also recently banned from the Pahokee High School campus in Florida by the school principal after Kiffin in February made some demeaning comments about the high school and the community during a speech to Tennessee boosters and fans .
Kiffin has since apologized on a couple different occasions , and Tennessee assistant Eddie Gran was allowed back on Pahokee 's campus on Tuesday .

Words are notoriously cheap , and words spoken by candidates for appointments to Cabinet - level positions , at least in recent years , are n't worth used toilet paper .
Nonetheless , I 'm greatly heartened by Mr. Holder 's statements .
I truly hope this does n't motivate the giggling murderer to pre-emptively pardon every miscreant in his " administration . "
I mean , I really do n't ever have to repatriate myself , but I still love my native land and many of her residents , and , frankly , a dangerous America makes for a dangerous rest of the world .
The first step to righting the myriad wrongs is certainly in the direction of The Hague .
Go get 'em , Mr. Holder !!!
Do n't fold 'er ...

This guarantees that Holder will not be confirmed as the Democrats & rethugs will vote against him .
I think it is quite obvious to anyone with even a room temp IQ that the Democrats are just as guilty of the crimes the past 8 years as the Rethugs / Neofascist are .
There is no logical or valid reason that Pelosi did not Impeach both Bush & Cheney except that she and many others are guilty of being complicit in the crimes and the cover ups .
there is only ONE way these criminals will ever see justice served and that is through citizens groups like maybe Vincent Bugliosi , or also International bodies like the Hague , the UN , International Criminal Court etc .
The democrats have proven well beyond any doubt that they are going to do nothing .

Even if he does pursue prosecution for waterboarding , you KNOW that the buck would stop at some military level ( colonel ? General ? ) and only in a pipe dream would make it as far as the Sec of Defense .
Bush would almost certainly have ' plausible deniability ' personally .
Still , I think prosecuting illegal government activities would be good step to show both our own citizens as well as the world that noone is above the law in a democracy .

Yes , Holder 's statements are very encouraging for all of us who want to see this criminal Bush administration be held accountable for the many dead and injured and traumatized people they have left behind them .
Holder was appropriately cautious and responsible in his statements , considering he has yet to review the evidence and reports cited by Feinstein , et al .
Holder is supposed to be a bit independent in judgment from the President .
It is more appropriate for Holder to make decisions on the prosecution of Bush / Cheney and their cohorts ' crimes than it is for Obama , and so Holder 's statements on these matters are actually more important .

As for the other fate of so - called Darwinism  the reductionist controversy fostered by religious conservatives  well , Darwin knew plenty about that , too .
The cultural opposition to evolution was then , as now , scientifically irrelevant .
Perhaps the persistence of opposition to evolution is a reminder that culture is not biological , or else we might have evolved past such a gnashing of sensibilities .
In a way , our peculiarly American failure to come to terms with Darwin ’s theory and what it ’s become since 1859 is a sign of something broader : our failure to come to terms with science and the teaching of science .
Darwin does not fit our image of a scientist .
From the 21st century , he seems at first to bear a closer resemblance to an amateur naturalist like Gilbert White in the 18th century .
But that is an illusion .
Darwin ’s funding was private , his habit was retiring and he lacked the kind of institutional support that we associate with science because it did not exist .
But Darwin ’s extensive scientific correspondence makes it clear that he was not the least bit reclusive intellectually and that he understood the character of science as it was practiced in his day as well as anyone .
We expect these days that a boy or girl obsessed with beetles may eventually find a home in a university or a laboratory or a museum .
But Darwin ’s life was his museum , and he was its curator .
In June 1833 , still early in the five - year voyage of the Beagle , he wrote about rounding Cape Horn : “ It is a grand spectacle to see all nature thus raging ; but Heaven knows every one in the Beagle has seen enough in this one summer to last them their natural lives . ”
( In this same letter , he celebrates the parliamentary attack on slavery in England . )
The rest of Darwin ’s life did in fact revolve around that voyage .
As you sift through the notes and letters and publications that stemmed from his years on the Beagle , you begin to understand how careful , how inquisitive and how various his mind was .
The voyage of the Beagle  and of a young naturalist who was 22 at its outset  is still one of the most compelling stories in science .
Darwin recedes , but his idea does not .
It is absorbed , with adaptations , into the foundation of the biological sciences .
In a very real sense , it is the cornerstone of what we know about life on earth .
Darwin ’s version of that great idea was very much of its time , and yet the whole weight of his time was set against it .
From one perspective , Darwin looks completely conventional  white , male , well born , leisured , patrician .
But from another , he turned the fortune of his circumstances into the most unconventional idea of all : the one that showed humans their true ancestry in nature .
Update : Victory ! — the treaty proposal survived this meeting and will be back on the agenda at the next one .
We 've got a couple months to lobby our governments and make sure that the next time they show up , they do n't embarrass us by opposing this .
Right now , in Geneva , at the UN's World Intellectual Property Organization , history is being made .
For the first time in WIPO history , the body that creates the world 's copyright treaties is attempting to write a copyright treaty dedicated to protecting the interests of copyright users , not just copyright owners .
At issue is a treaty to protect the rights of blind people and people with other disabilities that affect reading ( people with dyslexia , people who are paralyzed or lack arms or hands for turning pages ) , introduced by Brazil , Ecuador and Paraguay .
This should be a slam dunk : who would n't want a harmonized system of copyright exceptions that ensure that it 's possible for disabled people to get access to the written word ?
The USA , that 's who .
The Obama administration 's negotiators have joined with a rogue 's gallery of rich country trade representatives to oppose protection for blind people .
Other nations and regions opposing the rights of blind people include Canada and the EU .
Update : Also opposing rights for disabled people : Australia , New Zealand , the Vatican and Norway .
Update 2 : Countries that are on the right side of this include , " Latin American and Caribbean region including ( Uruguay , Argentina , Chile , Jamaica ) as well as Asia and Africa . "
Update 3 : Canada is upset with me .
That 's fine , I 'm upset with Canada .
Activists at WIPO are desperate to get the word out .
They 're tweeting madly from the negotiation ( technically called the 18th session of the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights ) publishing editorials on the Huffington Post , etc .
Here 's where you come in : this has to get wide exposure , to get cast as broadly as possible , so that it will find its way into the ears of the obscure power - brokers who control national trade - negotiators .
I do n't often ask readers to do things like this , but please , forward this post to people you know in the US , Canada and the EU , and ask them to reblog , tweet , and spread the word , especially to government officials and activists who work on disabled rights .
We know that WIPO negotiations can be overwhelmed by citizen activists — that 's how we killed the Broadcast Treaty negotiation a few years back — and with your help , we can make history , and create a world where copyright law protects the public interest .
I am attending a meeting in Geneva of the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) .
This evening the United States government , in combination with other high income countries in " Group B " is seeking to block an agreement to discuss a treaty for persons who are blind or have other reading disabilities .
The proposal for a treaty is supported by a large number of civil society NGOs , the World Blind Union , the National Federation of the Blind in the US , the International DAISY Consortium , Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic ( RFB&D ) , Bookshare .
Org , and groups representing persons with reading disabilities all around the world .
The main aim of the treaty is to allow the cross - border import and export of digital copies of books and other copyrighted works in formats that are accessible to persons who are blind , visually impaired , dyslexic or have other reading disabilities , using special devices that present text as refreshable braille , computer generated text to speech , or large type .
These works , which are expensive to make , are typically created under national exceptions to copyright law that are specifically written to benefit persons with disabilities …
The opposition from the United States and other high income countries is due to intense lobbying from a large group of publishers that oppose a " paradigm shift , " where treaties would protect consumer interests , rather than expand rights for copyright owners .
The Obama Administration was lobbied heavily on this issue , including meetings with high level White House officials .
Assurances coming into the negotiations this week that things were going in the right direction have turned out to be false , as the United States delegation has basically read from a script written by lobbyists for publishers , extolling the virtues of market based solutions , ignoring mountains of evidence of a " book famine " and the insane legal barriers to share works .

Attention Bing visitors : I ’m getting tons of traffic today for this post and everyone ’s using exactly the same search string to get here .
I ’m perplexed why this is happening .
If someone could leave a note in the comments explaining what led you here , I ’d be super grateful !

I enjoy watching House Hunters on the HGTV network , where a single person , couple , or family decides which house to buy after touring three of them .
Yesterday I watched in amazement as a woman said she was concerned that a 4,000 sq. foot house was n’t enough room for herself , her husband and three small children .
Four thousand feet is n’t enough ?
Gimme a break !
I grew up with two parents and four siblings in a 1,250 sq. foot house and survived .
And here ’s the incredible part .
All seven of us shared ONE bathroom and we did n’t die .
My husband and I share a 1,700 sq. foot home and that ’s plenty of house for two people .
In fact , we do n’t even use the two front rooms at all .
One is I guess what you ’d call a sitting room .
We do n’t sit in there .
We store crap in there .
The other room is our dining room .
Ha !
Dining room .
That ’s rich .
We barely cook .
So we have more crap and decorative items in there that we could do without if we had to .
Together we watched another episode of House Hunters where a couple sought an apartment in Paris .
They had a budget of $ 300,000US and wound up buying a flat with no more than 400 sq. feet !
We agreed we could totally live in that small space .
The payoff , of course , is that we ’d be living in Paris .
How much house do you have ?
Do you wish you had more ?
Could you live with less ?
What would you want in exchange for less room ?
Plum Line got the audio .
Greg has the transcript here :

He believes in the conservative principles that many of us believe in –- of lower taxes , of making sure that we turn back towards a focus on entrepreneurialism in this country , to promoting innovation and not stamping that out by over - reacting , if you will , which this town often does , to crisis . ”
I know Joe posted on this earlier , and mentioned Limbaugh , but it did n’t hit me until now , looking at the transcript , that Cantor , the minority whip , THE NUMBER TWO REPUBLICAN IN THE HOUSE , said he prefers Rush Limbaugh ’s solutions to the economic crisis over what the Democrats are offering because THE DEMS ARE TOO CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMY .
It ’s bad enough to suggest that the economic crisis is n’t that important a problem , but in the same breath – the same sentence – to say that you prefer Rush Limbaugh ’s solutions ?
Are these guys nuts ?
After a month debating whether Limbaugh was the intellectual leader of the party , the number 2 Republican in the House confirms that Limbaugh is the guy inspiring their solutions to the economic crisis ?
The night 's events had that peculiar mixture of dread and farce common to Brazil in the past , particularly when it was living under one of its periodic military governments .
It was the late 1970s .
Our CBC crew had landed in Sao Paulo where a huge union walkout that day had shut down Brazil 's auto industry , throwing the giant city into chaos .
A rally of 30,000 angry autoworkers had poured onto a sports field on an appropriately stormy evening to hear from their local union boss .
Given police repression at the time , the crowd did not expect media and was surprised when a lone TV crew showed up from Canada of all places .

Given the risks , many in the crowd assumed we were either lost or nuts or police spies .
But their night was not going well either .
The small , muscular union leader was standing mute in frustration as the tension rose .
His microphone was bust .
After many minutes of delay an organizer had a brainwave and raced over to us to ask , forcefully would be the word , for use of the CBC mike .
The protest of my producer Tony Burman was unavailing and my own was a little on the weak side , I confess .
But with this bizarre mike - jacking the night was saved and history served .
The firebrand union leader gave a rip- roaring speech of political defiance that was later seen as yet another momentous step towards restoring democracy in Brazil .
That he did so holding a microphone with a CBC sticker on it did not endear us to Brazilian security , but it mercifully escaped attention back in Canada .
Later the union boss , gruffly ungrateful , only rewarded us with the shortest of interviews .
Though he was clearly popular , I thought him a rumpled mediocrity unlikely to rise far even in opposition leftist circles .
I even thought his nickname lacked promise : Lula .
How would I know he would become the most popular national leader in all of the Americas .
Lula of Brazil
He is still called Lula today , of course , although more officially the name is President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil .
With an approval rating of between 70 and 80 per cent , he is one of the world 's most popular — and arguably successful — leaders .
Despite that success , Lula remains a scarcely known figure in Canada and our government pays surprisingly little attention to him or Brazil .
But Lula is a sensation in Latin America and throughout the emerging world .
What 's more , President Barak Obama at the recent G20 meeting in London gave him the most ringing of endorsements while pumping his hand : " Here 's my man , right here , " Obama said .
" I love this guy .
He 's the most popular politician on Earth . "
Popular , for sure , and not overly modest about himself or his country .
" God is a Brazilian , " he has declared as yet another oil find is made in his resource - rich nation .
Before the G20 in March , he insisted that Brazil is now emerging as a significant power in the world , a profound moment , he felt , that was being spoiled only by the current recession and " the irrational behaviour of white people with blue eyes , who before seemed to know everything and now have shown they know nothing . "

His own immodesty can be forgiven .
The rumpled union leader I retrieved my mike from long ago in Sao Paulo was a part - time mechanic and former shoe - shine boy with a grade 4 education .
Lula has had a lifetime of being underestimated by people like me .
More than a survivor
Lula is a survivor , of not only repression but also three defeats in presidential races before he won the first of two terms in 2003 , in the process launching one of the more remarkable social and economic reform movements of the past decade .
Overstated ?
Even the pinnacle of the U.S. foreign policy establishment , the Council on Foreign Relations in New York , notes Lula was justified in his G20 frustrations because the economic meltdown had put a damper on " an enormously successful two - term presidency . "
( Lula 's second term ends next year and , despite much popular demand that he change the Constitution to allow for a third , he is so far refusing to run again . )
Brazil is now seen by many economists as a model of balanced development , all the more remarkable as it has flourished under a left - of - centre government — a coalition no less — that many Western governments all expected to flop .
Even more than Canada , Brazil avoided the toxic pit that befell international banking in the past year .
Because of its strong banking regulations , it now has sound and very profitable banks as well as a buzzing investment sector .
Unlike so many oil rich nations , Brazil has not squandered its windfalls .
It has used its petrodollars to bring down inflation , build up foreign currency reserves and increase domestic demand for its own products .
It has also invested massively in energy efficient biofuels , improved farming methods and a startling array of infrastructure improvements .
While Canada still dithers about a future high - speed rail link between Montreal and Toronto , for example , Lula 's government has now started on a " bullet train " between Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro , the first in the entire Western hemisphere .
The future is now
Brazil , it 's important to note , still has a great many serious weaknesses , enough to fill a whole column .
It has excessive government bureaucracy and corruption , ongoing deforestation and lawlessness in the Amazon , a generally poor education system and alarming urban violence .
But , despite the recession , economic and social progress is so impressive that emerging countries around the world are studying one particular aspect of its success — the combination of economic liberalism with aggressive empowerment of the poor .
By offering Brazil 's poor property rights , small loans , increased state support and subsidies to those struggling to get by , Brazil , in just six years , has lifted 20 million people out of poverty and into the middle class .
Throughout this period , it has increased the minimum wage annually and brought electricity into 10 million new homes , all the while driving the economy forward and keeping the country politically stable .
Its recent average annual growth rate of five per cent is behind that of China and India , but the gap between the haves and have - nots is closing faster in Brazil .
At the same time , Brazil has just knocked Canada out of the top 10 list of ranked economics .
It soared to seventh place , while we 've been bumped down to 11th .
Internationally , it is also playing the role Canada once saw for it self .
Brazilian troops head the UN mission in Haiti and its advisers are a noted force in helping emerging African nations with development assistance , especially in agriculture reform and infrastructure .
Brazilian diplomats are highly regarded at the UN , where they 're campaigning insistently for one of the seats on the Security Council , a race Canada now seems to have abandoned .
Acknowledging the phenomenon of Lula and Brazil , I cringe all the more when I recall my lines in the closing standup all those years ago in Sao Paulo : " There 's a saying about this country ' Brazil is the country of the Future .
And always will be . ' "
Yes , well , here we are .
JERUSALEM  Based on testimony from Israeli soldiers who took part in the recent war in Gaza , Israel is being confronted directly with the serious charge that permissive rules of engagement allowed for the killing of Palestinian civilians and widespread destruction of Palestinian property .
The disclosures created a stir after first publication Thursday in a major front - page spread in the Tel Aviv daily , Haaretz .
The charges are all the more telling in that they are based on first - hand accounts from dozens of combat soldiers who served in the war .
Their testimonies were compiled by an academic college the soldiers had attended in a prep course before being drafted .
This represents the first uncensored recording in Israel of what occurred within combat units which took part in what Israeli codenamed Operation Cast Lead .
The picture drawn by the soldiers differs radically from the refined version of the war provided by military commanders to the public and Israeli media .
The report includes the testimony of one NCO ( non-commissioned officer ) : " A company commander with 100 soldiers under his command saw a woman walking down a road some distance away , but close enough that you could ’ve gunned down whoever you identified …
She was an elderly woman  whether she raised any suspicion , I do n’t know .
But what the officer did in the end was to put men on the roof and with the snipers bring her down .
I felt it was simply murder in cold blood . "
As presented in the report , Danny Zamir , head of the army prep-course , who compiled the transcript of the testimonies , intervened : " I do n’t get it  why did he have her shot ? "
The soldier who witnessed the incident replied : " That what ’s great in Gaza , you could say  you see someone walking down a track , not necessarily armed , and you can simply shoot them .
In our case , it was an elderly woman .
I did n’t see her with any weapon .
The order was to bring the person down , that woman , ‘ as soon as you sight her ’ .
There are always warnings , and there ’s always the saying  ‘ it could be a suicide bomber ’ .
What I felt was a lot of bloodthirstiness .
Because , we were n’t in many engagements , our battalion was only involved in a very limited number of incidents with terrorists . "
According to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights , 1,434 Palestinians were killed during the Israeli offensive , 960 of them civilians , among them 288 children .
Palestinians have spoken insistently of atrocities by Israeli troops and of random destruction of thousands of homes .
Israel has brushed off the accusations and calls for investigations into " war crimes " committed during the war , dismissing it as " anti-Israel propaganda . "
In the report , another infantry squad leader gave this account of an incident where an IDF ( Israeli Defense Forces ) sniper shot and killed a Palestinian woman and her two children : " There was a house with a family inside … .
We put them in a room .
Later we left the house and another platoon entered it .
A few days later there was an order to release the family .
They had set up positions upstairs .
There was a sniper position on the roof , " the soldier said .
" The platoon commander let the family go and told them to go to the right .
One of the women and her two children did n’t understand the instructions .
They went to the left .
No one told the sniper on the roof that they had been permitted to go , that it was okay , and he should hold his fire and he…he did what he was supposed to , like he was following orders . "
According to the squad leader ’s account , " The sniper saw a woman and children approaching him , they crossed the line he was told no one should cross .
He shot them straightaway .
In the end , what happened is that he killed them .
I do n’t think he felt too bad about it , because , as far as he was concerned , he was doing his job according to the orders he ’d been given .
The atmosphere in general , from what I understood from most of my men who I talked to …I do n’t know how to describe it …
The lives of Palestinians , let ’s say , are very , very much less important than the lives of our soldiers .
As far as they ’re concerned , that ’s the way they can justify it . "
" I was in shock at what I heard , " said Zamir in an interview on Israel Radio .
" The incidents involving the killing of civilians are the most disturbing and need to be investigated .
What I also found very distressing was how the norms of the army ’s code of conduct have been eroded and how widespread the aberrations are at junior commander level . "
Zamir said the soldiers reported that officers never intervened when troops deliberately damaged property , harassed civilians or wrote " Death to Arabs " graffiti .
The report also quotes individual soldiers reporting that , when they tried to remonstrate with fellow soldiers who were causing wanton damage , they were met with the response , " Because they ’re Arabs . "
" This is not the Israeli Defense Forces that we used to know , " said Zamir .
Amos Harel , the Haaretz military affairs correspondent who broke the story , says the accounts have a ring of authenticity .
" The soldiers are not lying , for the simple reason that they have no reason to do so .
There ’s a continuity of testimony from different parts of the Gaza war zone .
Read the transcript and you wo n’t find any judgment or boasting .
This is what the soldiers saw in Gaza . "
Israel ’s army is a temple of social consensus and a national melting pot .
It is one of the fundamental tenets of Israel ’s social fabric that the army does not commit war crimes , and operates according to " the highest ethical standards , " even in war time .
They call it " purity of arms . "
The accounts expose a dehumanizing view of ‘ the enemy ’ that seems to be more extreme than ever among Israeli soldiers .
But the deterioration has been going on for decades  since Israel ’s occupation of Palestinian lands has meant that the Israeli army has been principally engaged in fighting guerrillas in civilian populated areas ; this has included fighting two Palestinian Intifada uprisings and two wars in Lebanon , one against the Palestinian Liberation Authority and one against Hezbollah .
The report of what happened in Gaza was submitted three weeks ago to Israel ’s Chief of Staff , Lt. Gen. Gaby Ashkenazi .
The army says it will investigate the allegations thoroughly .
But Harel says that " if the army never heard about these incidents , it ’s a reasonable assumption that it did n’t want to know .
The soldiers describe the reality in combat units , from the level of company commander down .
In debriefings , the participants usually include company commanders up .
It seems that , except for isolated incidents , the rule is ‘ you do n’t ask , we wo n’t tell . ’ "
Asked on Israel Radio to comment on the report , Defense Minister Ehud Barak stuck to the credo : " I only heard of the charges this morning .
I ’m convinced that the army will carry out a thorough investigation .
There are always exceptions , but our army is the world ’s most moral .
Our soldiers talk openly when they return home . "
Moshe Negbi , a leading legal expert , told IPS that an independent inquiry was essential  " not only for justice to be seen , but also as a most effective way of heading off increasing world pressure for a war crimes inquiry against the Israeli military . "
Whether there will be a major public grappling within Israeli society that will press for such an inquiry is improbable .
Ever since the beginning of the occupation more than 40 years back , and especially in the last decade since the Second Intifada , attitudes and public and political discourse in regard to the Palestinians , and to Arabs in general , have been degraded .
This past week was not a good time for members of the political media .
Jon Stewart reprised his memorable smackdown of CNN's " Crossfire earlier this week by demolishing Jim Cramer , the host of " Mad Money " and noted postapocalyptic diarist .
Meanwhile , David Gregory and Tim Russert were outed by Glenn Greenwald as slavering pawns in the giant game played by political elites in America .
It 's fair to say that political media sucks pretty hard right now .
Political cartoonists are a subset of that larger , awful political media conglomerate .
Stupidity is the exclusive province of neither ideology : both Ted Rall and Michael Ramirez are equally loathsome players in this game .
It actually pains me every time I open the Sunday paper , see something like this , and realize that someone illustrates this shit for a living .
I suppose it is bittersweet , then , that Something Awful forum goon Deep Hurting draws political cartoons .
Bitter , because he can't get hired in a world which tolerates Rall and Ramirez on a daily basis .
Sweet , because for the last few months he 's been entertaining us throughout several threads with his witty , well - drawn cartoons .
Below are some of the best , culled from the forums and his website ThisIsHistoricTimes.com and roughly organized by topic .
Enjoy the following , because they 're better than anything you 'll see professionals do any day .

The featureless glassy screens of touch - screen phones may seem like a forbidding barrier for blind users , who often rely on tactile clues to feel their way around .
But a pair of engineers at Google , T.V. Raman , who is blind , and Charles Chen , who is sighted , have developed software that makes the touch - screen T - Mobile G1 , which uses Google ’s Android software , more accessible to blind users .
They hope the technology will also be useful to anyone who needs to operate a phone without looking at the screen , like drivers .
Back in January , I profiled Mr. Raman , who has a long history of adapting technology to his needs .
I thought the work on touch screens he was doing with Mr. Chen was intriguing :
Since he cannot precisely hit a button on a touch screen , Mr. Raman created a dialer that works based on relative positions .
It interprets any place where he first touches the screen as a 5 , the center of a regular telephone dial pad .
To dial any other number , he simply slides his finger in its direction — up and to the left for 1 , down and to the right for 9 , and so on .
If he makes a mistake , he can erase a digit simply by shaking the phone , which can detect motion .
If that is hard to conceptualize , now you can see it in action .
Mr. Raman and Mr. Chen have created five videos to demonstrate the first installment of their work , which includes a “ shell ” application that operates an Android device , a dialer and a method for inputting text .
The applications themselves are available in the Android Marketplace , an applications store for the G1 .
Mr. Raman said that based on comments posted there , more sighted people than blind people were using the applications .
That ’s perhaps not surprising , since blind users may not have been inclined to purchase a touch - screen phone , even one with a keyboard like the G1 .
But it seems to validate Mr. Raman ’s approach in developing technologies not just for the blind , but for anyone who cannot look at the screen .
“ People are saying they are using it in their cars , ” Mr. Raman said .
The “ shell ” application has an interesting location function that combines GPS or cell tower location data with Google Maps and the G1 ’s compass .
For Mr. Raman , who was once dropped off by the Google employee shuttle on the opposite side of the street from his usual drop - off location and walked two blocks before realizing he was heading the wrong way , it ’s pretty useful technology .
“ You just touch it , and it tells you which direction you are heading in , the location you are close to , and the cross streets , ” he said .
As the automotive industry is in crisis and after a large event such as Geneva Motor Show , it is no wonder that the Auto Show in Leipzig ( March 28 - April 5 ) failed to attract the attention of builders .
Even so there were a few world premieres , the most interesting being the Audi TT - RS Roadster ( only Coupe version was present in Geneva ) , VW Golf and Ford Mondeo GTD Tri-Fuel .

Why ItÂs Plausible :

Upside :
Downside :
impossible for our technology to mimic the human mind ; if , as many argue , we are in fact reaching the end of a period of rapid technological development , what will happen to us ?
Basically , we 'll all die .
If you want to get less basic , experts have put forward a number of varied theories .
Some predict food shortages leading to a collapse of civilization , while others go so far as to predict joblessness leading to a collapse of civilization .
And of course there are the extremists , who predict a crippling economic downturn as a result of the dead - end technology market , leading to a collapse of civilization .
We do n't have claws , or tails , or super hearing ; we put all our points into INT .
Being smart and building things is basically our only trick .
Take it away from us , and some shit is going to go down .
Because the engine driving our advancement is and has always been increasingly sophisticated tool use .
From the lever to the plow to the printing press to the Krispy Kreme doughnut , a constant increase in the effectiveness of our tools is the only thing that Âs allowed us to keep our economy going and provide for the livelihoods and survival of all - - or at least a majority - - of the world Âs citizens .
Maybe it wonÂt be as doom and gloom as futurists tend to predict .
Maybe weÂll start finding ways to advance in other important areas instead , like learning to not be such assholes to each other all the time .
But there Âs no question that if our population continues to grow , and advancements in technology fail to keep up with our needs , weÂll be looking at things like widespread terrorism , piracy , human rights violations , destabilized governments and global environmental crises .
Actually , in hindsight , I guess this entry is more a prediction of thepresent than the future .
WeÂ re already kind of used to it ?
For starters , it seems to be the most likely scenario .
The more we learn about the human brain , the more we realize how little we know about how it actually works .
Technological advances that took months a decade ago -- like doubling the processing power of a computer -- now take much longer , as the level of specialized knowledge required , people involved and chances of something going wrong all increase .
Even if we do reach that gleaming robo-utopia or cyberpunk VR haven or cyborg nation weÂve been dreaming of , there Âs a good chance it Âs going to take a lot longer than predicted , and weÂll get there limping , with a lot of stops and starts along the way .
Which all adds up to the ultimate downer of the Âreal world Â scenario : personal responsibility .
If you Âre like me , you Âd love nothing more than a radical perceptual shift in life as we know it to come along and transcend you to a plane of pure light and thought , where all human minds are as one and paternity tests always come back negative .
But until that glorious , improbable ( but theoretically possible ) day , it looks like we may have to busy ourselves worrying about mundane stuff like Â the development of true human nobilityÂ and Âfeeding and educating the world before the ice caps melt or we all starve .
Â And even worse , weÂve got to do it with nothing but the tools currently available to us and whatever else we can come up with along the way .
Not nearly as cool as hurling rockets into space or having VR sex with Sandra Bullock , but there you go .
My advice : Anything is possible , and most of the more likely possibilities suck balls , so in the meantime letÂs all make the best of a bad situation , shall we ?
At least until the Large Hadron Collider blows a hole into another dimension and we can steal their technology .

THE current recession has broken many of the rules of business cycles , but not this one : when something gets cheap enough , buyers emerge .
America 's housing bubble seems mostly deflated .
According to the S&P / Case - Shiller 20 - city index , house prices through January were down 29 % from their all - time peak .
Relative to incomes , houses are now 10 % undervalued , and relative to rents they are fairly valued , thinks Paul Dales of Capital Economics , a consultancy .
This is luring buyers back .
House sales rose unexpectedly in February .
The National Association of Realtors estimates that up to 45 % of existing homes sold were “ distressed ” properties — those in , or close to , foreclosure .
In Nevada , which with California , Florida and Arizona was the epicentre of the boom and bust , fourth - quarter sales were more than double their level a year earlier .
Keith Kelley , a Las Vegas estate agent , has an investor interested in offering about $ 80,000 for a foreclosed , four - unit apartment building which , fully let , could bring in over $ 25,000 a year in gross rent .
He has two buyers interested in paying $ 220,000 for a five - bedroom house that sold in 2004 for more than triple that .
Their monthly mortgage payment would be about half the rent on a similar property .
Even so , he says , “ I still talk to buyers waiting to see when we get to the bottom . ”
Indeed , homes may be fairly valued now but could get dirt cheap if , as commonly happens , prices overshoot .
The stabilising of the housing market is one of several tantalising glimmers that the end of the recession may be in sight .
In March factory purchasing managers were their least gloomy about new orders since last August .
Vehicle sales rose 8 % in March from February .
New claims for unemployment insurance have stopped rising .
Gross domestic product , which shrank at a 6.3 % annual rate in the fourth quarter , probably shrank at a similar rate in the first , but the composition of the drop was more encouraging ; it was driven not by the collapse in consumer spending , but by sinking output as businesses sought to bring inventories into line with lower sales .
Second - quarter growth “ has a good chance of being positive ” , according to Ian Morris and Ryan Wang , economists at HSBC , though “ the risks … are still huge . ”
What has brought this turnabout ?
In part , the normal corrective powers of the economy .
Larry Summers , Barack Obama 's main economic adviser , has noted that current annualised vehicle sales of about 9 m are well below the 14 m necessary for replacement and rising population , while annualised housing starts are about a quarter of the rate needed to support the forming of new households .
The improvement is also the expected response to monetary and fiscal stimulus , both of which have been exceptionally aggressive .
The Federal Reserve , having lowered short - term interest rates in effect to zero , has intervened in bond markets to push down long - term mortgage rates as well .
On April 1st paycheques were due to begin reflecting the tax cuts in Barack Obama 's $ 787 billion fiscal stimulus .
As investors have shifted their economic outlook from catastrophic to merely grim , the stockmarket has shot higher , by 19 % on April 1st from its 12 - year low on March 9th .
Like houses , stocks look cheap .
Strategists at Deutsche Bank estimate that investors can expect to earn an additional seven percentage points over the long run from holding stocks instead of Treasury bonds , the highest such “ equity risk premium ” in at least 25 years .
Mr Summers says it may be “ the sale of the century ” .
Yet even if the bottom in economic activity is in sight , a robust recovery almost certainly is not .
Housing usually leads the way out of recession as falling interest rates unleash pent - up demand .
But easy credit in earlier years has turned many renters into homeowners already .
At the end of last year 67.5 % of households owned their home , down from a peak of 69 % in 2006 but still well above the 64 % that prevailed from 1965 to 1997 .
Moreover , many prospective buyers cannot take advantage of low mortgage rates because higher down - payments are now required .
The tonic of lower interest rates has been dulled by the dysfunctional financial system .
That is why credit markets have not reflected the optimism of stocks and are forcing corporations to pay punitive yields on the bonds they issue ( see chart ) .
Consumer spending may also be depressed for some years to come by the record 18 % collapse in household net worth over the course of last year , a drop of $ 11 trillion .
That is a chief reason why the OECD on March 31st released an exceptionally gloomy prognosis , predicting that the American economy would shrink by 4 % this year and not grow at all next year .
Deflation , it said , “ may become a threat ” .
The greatest risk of renewed recession or stagnation comes from the banking system .
As long as home prices keep falling and unemployment keeps rising , banks ' bad loans will keep mounting .
Huge questions hang over the Treasury 's plan to remove those loans , and many economists think it must commit more public capital than the already authorised $ 700 billion in TARP money .
Perversely , a continued stockmarket rally could undermine the chances of more aid , lulling some in Washington to believe enough has been done .
Tim Geithner , the treasury secretary , understands that .
“ The big mistake governments make in recessions ” , he said on March 29th , “ is … they see that first glimmer of light , and the impetus to policy fades . ”
Yet he hurt his own case the same day by saying that more TARP money is not needed for now because some banks will repay the government capital they have previously received .
That is bad news , not good news : banks are lining up to repay the money to free themselves from political interference , even though the loss of capital will constrain their lending .
That increases the odds of a multi-year , Japanese - style credit crunch .
Even if the administration wants the money , Congress at present is in no mood to grant it .
The Senate and House budget resolutions were silent on the administration 's request for $ 750 billion in extra funds ( with a budgeted cost of $ 250 billion ) .
The administration is wisely waiting for tempers to cool before asking for the money .
Government troops sodomised pygmies in March in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) , believing they would gain supernatural powers , a regional rights group said yesterday .
" Some soldiers from the 85th Brigade sodomised three male pygmies to gain supernatural powers and protection in Kisa village in Walikale territory , " said the Human Rights League of the Great Lakes ( LDGL ) .
" The village chief was stripped and ( sodomised ) in the presence of his wife , his children and daughter in - law , " said the LDGL , which groups dozens of rights groups in Rwanda , Burundi and the DRC .
" The children in turn were stripped and raped in front of their father , " said the group in a report .
It said armed groups in the region also abused the pygmies .

Opening at New York ’s Tribeca Film Festival this week , OUTRAGE is a new gay - themed political documentary by Academy Award - nominated filmmaker Kirby Dick .
As described on the film ’s website …
A searing indictment of the hypocrisy of closeted politicians who actively campaign against the LGBT community , OUTRAGE boldly reveals the hidden lives of some of our nation ’s most powerful policymakers , detailing the harm they ’ve inflicted on millions of Americans , and the media ’s complicity in keeping their secrets .
And from an early review of the film .
Where Dick ’s film truly succeeds is in laying consequences at both men ’s feet .
For [ Ed ]
Koch , it was silence during the exploding AIDS crisis … [ Charlie ]
Crist , who has shown himself to be a moderate , or even liberal - leaning , Republican on a variety of issues – as well as a craven opportunist – is shown backing both a gay marriage amendment as well as that state ’s unique law prohibiting adoption by gay parents .
Set against both men ’s stories , Dick , working with his editor Doug Blush , unleashes a succession of news reports detailing hate crimes against gays and lesbians , ending with a 14 - year old shooting a 15 - year old at Oxnard High School in California .
It ’s here that the film makes its powerful , and frankly compelling , closing argument – as Kirby Dick draws a line from the DC political closet to the death in Oxnard .
Watch the trailer .

[ Please welcome Dr. Todenhofer and Host Siun - bev ]
Why Do You Kill ? is the most important book I ’ve read on our occupation of Iraq .
Written by Dr. Jürgen Todenhöfer , this book finally provides a voice to the people of Iraq , a voice we never hear in the Western media , a voice our government silences rather than engages .
Sweeping aside the usual political debates on Iraq and the paternalistic views of even so many on the progressive side of the debate , Dr. Todenhöfer takes us along on his 2007 trip to Ramadi and allows us to hear what Iraqis say – about the occupation and about why they fight against it .
This is a very human book .
From celebrations of the victories of the Iraqi soccer team to the sorrows so many of his hosts speak about , we see life as it is lived in the midst of occupation – and we have a chance to see that occupation from the perspective of the Iraqis who fight against it , fighting for freedom and the security of their communities and their families .
We meet families and young men who had no desire to become insurgents as well as leaders of that insurgency and even one member of Al Qaeda .
The stories shared in Why Do You Kill are devastating .
The suffering of these families , the brutality of the occupation and the grinding conditions of daily life in a destroyed Iraq are told simply , in the words of the people Dr. Todenhöfer met .
This is not a book of polemic , but a book of meals shared and hearts opened .
For all that they have suffered , the Iraqis ’ voices still reach out to us , asking us to see how very wrong our actions have been – and how much those actions harm us all .
During his time in Ramadi , Dr. Todenhöfer spends time with a 21 year old Iraqi resistance fighter named Zaid and it is his story , told over several days , that speaks to us most directly :
Zaid talks very slowly and deliberately today .
He is clearly trying to keep his emotions under control .
He often breathes deeply , pauses , purses his lips .
Zaid is the oldest of three brothers .
Haroun is one year younger , and Karim two .
In July 2006 , Haroun spends a few nights at his uncle 's house in the center of Ramadi .
He is 19 at the time and studying engineering .
It is summer break , and he is trying to enjoy it as best he can , given a war is underway .
Like his two brothers , he has little to do with the resistance .
Though like all the youngsters in Ramadi , he helps the resistance fighters when they are looking for a hideout or need information .
But Haroun does not play an active part .
On July 14 , 2006 , Haroun sets off early in the morning , before it gets too hot , from his uncle 's house to go back to his family in Al - Sufia .
He turns into the narrow street where his family lives just after seven .
He is dribbling a ball he found on the way .
In his right hand he is carrying a white bush rose which he picked for his mother at sunrise .
He sees a young neighbor , Jarir , coming the other way , and calls out to greet him , salam – peace .
Just as he utters the word salam , a shot rings out .
Haroun touches the back of his head in disbelief , sinks to his knees in what seems like slow - motion , and falls forwards with his face in the dust .
His lifeless body lies there in the dirt , the small white rose for his mother in his right hand .
As we learn the rest of Zaid ’s story , as we see the war as Dr. Todenhöfer writes “ through a Muslim ’s eyes , ” we begin to see the real horror of our actions in Iraq .
When Dr. Todenhöfer was leaving Iraq , Moussa who drove him back to Syria , summed it up in this message to us all :
“ Tell your American friends that they have not only destroyed our country but also broken our hearts . ”
Following the account of his trip to Ramadi , Dr. Todenhöfer presents Ten Theses , which he also published as 3 ads in the New York Times in March 2008 .
Developed from both his reading and his experiences traveling in Algeria , Afghanistan and Iraq , these point to a way for us to enter into a genuine dialogue with the Muslim world .
They are a critical corrective to the western perspective and deserve our attention and discussion .
( The Theses and a full . discussion of each can be read at Dr. Todenhofer ’s website )
As he did with his previous bestselling books , Dr. Todenhöfer will donate the royalties from Why Do You Kill ? to finance medical aid for Iraqi refugee children and an Israeli - Palestinian reconciliation project in the Middle East .
Dr. Todenhöfer writes “ Our horizon is not the end of the world . ”
Why Do You Kill invites us to move beyond our limited horizon and meet the world with open hearts and with respect .
The next step is up to us .
A close shave for set theory
Suppose you walk past a barber 's shop one day , and see a sign that says
" Do you shave yourself ?
If not , come in and I 'll shave you !
I shave anyone who does not shave himself , and noone else . "
This seems fair enough , and fairly simple , until , a little later , the following question occurs to you - does the barber shave himself ?
If he does , then he must n't , because he does n't shave men who shave themselves , but then he does n't , so he must , because he shaves every man who does n't shave himself ... and so on .
Both possibilities lead to a contradiction .
This is the Barber 's Paradox , discovered by mathematician , philosopher and conscientious objector Bertrand Russell , at the begining of the twentieth century .
As stated , it seems simple , and you might think a little thought should show you the way around it .
At worst , you can just say " Well , the barber 's condition does n't work !
He 's just going to have to decide who to shave in some different way . "
But in fact , restated in terms of so - called " naïve " set theory , the Barber 's paradox exposed a huge problem , and changed the entire direction of twentieth century mathematics .
In naïve set theory , a set is just a collection of objects that satisfy some condition .
Any clearly phrased condition is thought to define a set - namely , those things that satisfy the condition .
Here are some sets :
The set of all red motorcycles ;
The set of all integers greater than zero ;
The set of all blue bananas - which is just the empty set !
This set is not a member of itself
Some sets are not members of themselves - for example , the set of all red motorcycles - and some sets are - for example , the set of all non-motorcycles .
Now what about the set of all sets which are not members of themselves ?
Is it a member of itself or not ?
If it is , then it is n't , and if it is n't , then it is ...
Just like the barber who shaves himself , but must n't , and therefore does n't , and so must !
So now we realise that Russell 's Barber 's Paradox means that there is a contradiction at the heart of naïve set theory .
That is , there is a statement S such that both itself and its negation ( not S ) are true .
The particular statement here is " the set of all sets which are not members of themselves contains itself " .
But once you have a contradiction , you can prove anything you like , just using the rules of logical deduction !
This is how it goes .
If S is true , and Q is any other statement , then " S or Q " is clearly true .
Since " not S " is also true , so is " S or Q and not S " .
Therefore Q is true , no matter what it is .
The paradox raises the frightening prospect that the whole of mathematics is based on shaky foundations , and that no proof can be trusted .
In essence , the problem was that in naïve set theory , it was assumed that any coherent condition could be used to determine a set .
In the Barber 's Paradox , the condition is " shaves himself " , but the set of all men who shave themselves can't be constructed , even though the condition seems straightforward enough - because we can't decide whether the barber should be in or out of the set .
Both lead to contradictions .
Attempts to find ways around the paradox have centred on restricting the sorts of sets that are allowed .
Russell himself proposed a " Theory of Types " in which sentences were arranged hierarchically .
At the lowest level are sentences about individuals .
At the next level are sentences about sets of individuals ; at the next level , sentences about sets of sets of individuals , and so on .
This avoids the possibility of having to talk about the set of all sets that are not members of themselves , because the two parts of the sentence are of different types - that is , at different levels .
But to be a satisfactory philosophy , we have to be able to say why you are not allowed to mix levels .
Although , for example , it is not true that the property of being red is itself red , this is surely a wrong statement , rather than actually meaningless .
And there are properties that seem reasonably to apply to themselves - the Theory of Types disallows statements such as " It 's nice to be nice " but really this seems like a reasonable and true statement !
For this and other reasons , the most favoured escape from Russell 's Paradox is the so - called Zermelo - Fraenkel axiomatisation of set theory .
This axiomatisation restricts the assumption of naïve set theory - that , given a condition , you can always make a set by collecting exactly the objects satisfying the condition .
Instead , you start with individual entities , make sets out of them , and work upwards .
This means you do not have to suppose that there is a set of all sets , which means you do n't have to try to divide that set up into those sets that contain themselves and those which do n't .
You only have to be able to make this division for the elements of any given set , which you have built up from individual entities via some number of steps .
To end on a more flippant note , if Russell had been aware of the inbuilt sexism of the language of his day , the course of twentieth century mathematics might have been different .
There is an easy solution to the Barber 's Paradox , which does n't require the opening of any nasty cans of set - theoretic worms .
Just make the barber a woman ...

There 's controversy already in America regarding the first Obama administration detailed Defense budget plans , announced yesterday .
Some are painting the plans as a cuts package , others disagree .
What 's clear is that the US military 's top - secret ( or " black " ) budget is now on the same level as the whole of UK defence spending - and the UK has the second biggest defence budget in the world .
According to veteran black - budget watcher and secret - plane journalist Bill Sweetman , editor of Defense Technology International , the planned black budget for fiscal year 2010 is just over $ 50 bn .
That 's about £ 33bn at current rates , a bit less than the total UK defence budget - but only a bit .
It would n't be inaccurate in money terms to say that one could rank the top few armed forces in the world thus :
1 ) Mainstream US armed forces $ 490bn - odd
2 ) UK armed forces $ 60 bn
3 ) Chinese armed forces $ 58bn
4 ) French armed forces $ 54bn
5 ) " Black " US forces $ 50bn +
6 ) Japanese Self - Defence forces $ 44bn
And indeed there 's probably more secret US military funding than this .
The US government declines to disclose exactly what the CIA 's budget is , but both the Agency and other non-military spooks do get money of their own .
Some of this is spent on military or quasi-military activities : for example the CIA were heavily involved in development of the famous SR - 71 " Blackbird " turbo - ramjet spy plane back in the Cold War , and it was sometimes flown by CIA pilots .
Likewise the CIA is known to have deployed significant numbers of armed " paramilitary " operatives on foreign soil from time to time - sometimes local mercenaries , sometimes US personnel .
It 's an open secret that the agency has a significant fleet of armed Predator drones which it uses to eliminate people in places like Yemen and Pakistan .
So one could probably add at least a few CIA paramilitary billions to the Defense black budget , putting the US secret forces up in the number three or even two spot .
To be sure , much of the secret cash - probably a majority - is nowadays spent building and operating spy satellites , which are n't weapons in a conventional sense .
Even so , that in itself is fairly jaw - dropping .
Say $ 20bn or $ 30bn for the black space programme , then - and compare that to the entire NASA budget for 2008 , at just over $ 17bn .
However you slice it , America 's secret services alone are a fairly high - ranking world power in their own right - and nobody except them ( and perhaps a few politicians in Washington ) has a good handle on what they 're doing . ®

" I think , on balance , that those moves help [ us ] , " said the chief of U.S. Central Command .
" In fact , I have long been on record as having testified and also in helping write doctrine for interrogation techniques that are completely in line with the Geneva Convention .
And as a division commander in Iraq in the early days , we put out guidance very early on to make sure that our soldiers , in fact , knew that we needed to stay within those guidelines .
" With respect to Guantánamo , " Petraeus added , " I think that the closure in a responsible manner , obviously one that is certainly being worked out now by the Department of Justice -- I talked to the Attorney General the other day [ and ] they have a very intensive effort ongoing to determine , indeed , what to do with the detainees who are left , how to deal with them in a legal way , and if continued incarceration is necessary -- again , how to take that forward .
But doing that in a responsible manner , I think , sends an important message to the world , as does the commitment of the United States to observe the Geneva Convention when it comes to the treatment of detainees . "
We all know physical cowards ( and draft dodgers ) Dick Cheney and Rush Limbaugh love belittling and denigrating the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend our country .
Their scurrilous attacks on Colin Powell have even been supported by the fringy base of the Republican Party .
But what about General David Petraeus ?
He 's been a GOP icon who they 're praying will run for president and bring them back to power .
Well Limbaugh , Rove and Cheney may all prefer each other over Colin Powell , but General Petraeus is in line with the mainstream of American thought that torture is the wrong approach and that Guantánamo should be shut down
He was interviewed on Radio Free Europe Sunday and he broke Dick Cheney 's .. whatever contraption he 's got in there .
Like Colin Powell and most military men Petraeus opposes torture and opposes keeping Guantánamo open .
Of course , Petraeus is hardly the only one pointing out how wrong Cheney and Limbaugh are .
" Matthew Alexander , " a pseudonym for an actual official Air Force interrogator in Iraq , is especially important to listen to -- and his perspective shows what a lying sack Cheney is .
Torture cost us thousands of lives and was a major recruiting tool for Al Qaeda .
Cheney and Bush need to be put on trial .

US President Barack Obama has fulfilled a pre-election promise by flying first lady Michelle to New York for a date .
" I promised her during the campaign that I would take her to a Broadway show after it was all finished , " the US president explained in a statement .
Republicans characterised the trip as insensitive and wasteful against the backdrop of US car giant General Motors preparing for an expected bankruptcy .
White House aides and media accompanied the first couple on their private date .
The president and first lady travelled to New York in a smaller plane than the regular Air Force One 747 .
Mr and Mrs Obama ate dinner at Blue Hill restaurant , described as a trendy place where the food is grown by owner - chef Dan Barber .
Crowds lined the streets near the theatre for a glimpse of the couple
After dinner they moved on to the theatre .
Taxi drivers stood on the door frames of their vehicles as crowds gathered , up to eight people deep , to glimpse the first couple as their motorcade passed through blockaded streets .
The presidential date ended with a performance of August Wilson 's play , Joe Turner 's Come and Gone .
The play is set in a Pittsburgh boarding house during a time when thousands of descendants of former slaves seeking work moved in large numbers from the rural south toward the industrial cities of the north .
The Obamas flew back to Washington on Saturday night .
NAZI hunter Simon Wiesenthal was often asked why he pursued old men about events from so long ago .
He replied : " I am someone who seeks justice , not revenge .
My work is a warning to the murderers of tomorrow that they will never rest . "
Those words highlight everything wrong about US President Barack Obama 's response to the so - called " torture memos " .
The documents , written by lawyers in George Bush 's Justice Department , authorise CIA interrogation techniques .
They permit agents to push prisoners into walls , slap them on the face and abdomen , douse them in very cold water , strip them naked , house them in dark , cramped spaces , force them into painful positions ( one memo reads , " in wall standing , all of the individual 's body weight is placed on his fingertips " ) and deprive them of sleep for up to 180 hours ( while shackled and in nappies ) .
And they authorise water - boarding .
Known in the Spanish inquisition as toca , or tortura del agua , water - boarding — which induces the physiological responses associated with drowning — was used by Marcos in the Philippines , Pinochet in Chile and Pol Pot in Cambodia .
The new memos show that the CIA performed water - boarding on Khalid Sheikh Mohammad 183 times in a month , and on Abu Zubaydah , who seems to have been mentally ill , 83 times .
CIA doctors stood by to perform an emergency tracheotomy — a wise precaution , since one memo suggests a detainee ( probably Abu Zubaydah ) stopped breathing or lost consciousness .
To his credit , Obama has publicly acknowledged the obvious : water - boarding is torture .
Yet he has made it clear that interrogators will face no sanctions , saying : " I do not think it 's appropriate for them to be prosecuted . "
But low - ranking individuals ordered to carry out torture invariably do so within guidelines provided by their superiors .
Here is part of the charge sheet drawn up by American lawyers against a civilian employee of the Imperial Japanese Army : " In or about August 1943 , the accused , Genji Mineno , together with other persons did , willfully and unlawfully , brutally mistreat and torture George De Witt Stoddard and William O. Cash , American prisoners of war , by strapping them to a stretcher and pouring water down their nostrils . "
Mineno was sentenced to 20 years ' hard labour — even though official Japanese army manuals instructed interrogators to torture POWs .
It ’s official .
Fast & Furious is a runaway success that doubled original estimates … well at least after opening weekend where the fourth installment of the franchise netted $ 72.5 million according to preliminary estimates .
It now has the distinction of having the best ever April opening by surpassing the $ 42.2 million pulled in from Anger Management .
And it also gives Universal Pictures a notch in its belt by beating out the studio ’s previous 3 - day opening record of $ 72.1 million set by The Lost World : Jurassic Park .
And while I ’m on a roll , Fast and Furious had the best opening so far in 2009 , beating out the previous franchise record from 2 Fast 2 Furious of $ 50.5 million and is # 1 right now at the box office .
So , what does all this mean ?
Why more car movies of course … with massive budgets , bigger stars and more expensive rides , crazy special effects , giant explosions and “ you ca n’t do that in a Civic ” lines .
Okay , so maybe , maybe not , but at least some eyebrows have been raised and folks are taking notice .
Following the footsteps of Alien vs Predator , maybe there is a Transporter vs The Fast & The Furious somewhere in sight .
Let ’s hope not , but my point is that we will potentially see a resurgence of movies centered around wicked rides .

Wolfenstein 3D for iPhone
For once , developers were able to read the source code of an id software product just a few days after its release .
I spent a week in my spare time reading the internal of the Wolfenstein 3D for iPhone engine .
It is by far the cleanest and easiest id source code release to date .
This review is far from being exhaustive but it provides answers to a few of the questions I asked myself :
How was the absence of direct framebuffer access addressed ?
How is the engine ( ANSI C ) coupled with Objective - C ?
How was the absence of Immediate mode in openGL ES addressed ?
Is NSTimer the only way to perform animation on this #*! iphone ?

Overall design
If you are not familiar with iPhone development , in a nutshell :
You do n't control it , it controls you !
The big picture does not look like the classic :
int main ( int argc , char* argv[ ] ) { while ( gameOn ) { getUserInputs ( ) ; updateTimer ( ) ; updateWorld ( ) ; renderWorld ( ) ; swapBuffer ( ) ; } }
With something like this , you would have total control of the thread / process and it's just not the way the iPhone works .
Everything is based on events , you define callback methods and function pointers that will be used by the iPhone when it needs it :
The " while loop " , updateWorld and renderWorld for instance are replaced by an object NSTimer that will call your rendering / update method at a FIXED rate .
that will call your rendering / update method at a FIXED rate .
User inputs are handled via callbacks method , that your main class is supposed to overwrite .
You end up having the following block to setup the NSTimer in EAGLView .m :
self.animationTimer = [ NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.032 target:self selector:@selector( drawView ) userInfo:nil repeats : YES ] ;
As you can see , the method called by NSTimer is named drawView , the refresh rate is set to 1/0.032 ( 30 Hz ) .
The method drawView will update the world , calls the C rendering method ( iPhoneFrame ) and finally swap the buffer to the screen .
Most of the engine is ANSI C , Objective - C is just being used to host the windows , load textures and grab the users input .
The following block shows the Objective - C method overwrite needed to grab user input .
- ( void ) touchesBegan :( NSSet * ) touches withEvent : ( UIEvent * ) event { [ self handleTouches : touches withEvent : event ] ; } - ( void ) touchesEnded : ( NSSet * ) touches withEvent : ( UIEvent * ) event { [ self handleTouches : touches withEvent : event ] ; } - ( void ) touchesMoved : ( NSSet *) touches withEvent : ( UIEvent *) event { [ self handleTouches : touches withEvent : event ] ; }
For any finger on the screen , the method handleTouches is called with data as parameters .
The core of the ANSI C engine is then updated with new position and angles .
Engine
The DOS version of wolfenstein was written in Borland C/ TASM with direct framebuffer access , it was a pure raycaster engine :
For every column of pixels on the screen , a ray was casted .
Taking advantage of the axis aligned walls , the intersection of the ray with the first blocker was fast to determine .
The distance from the POV would give the height of the pixel column to write in the framebuffer .
After a little bit of fishBowl perspective correction you had the illusion of 3D .
Check out F. Permadi's article , it 's pure gold if you want to read more about raycasters engine .
Wolfenstein for iPhone could not go this way because the iPhone library CoreSurface / CoreSurface.h needed to access the framebuffer is restricted .
You just ca n't use it for Appstore applications .
So , how do you render the world if you cannot write the column of pixel in the framebuffer based on their distance ?
You keep the first part of the algorithm for visibility determination :
Cast a ray for every columns of pixel ( wolf3D casts 640 rays ) , it will build the list of visible walls .
Build a list of every sprite entity in the room , sort them by distance : Back to Front .
Set the GL_MODEL_VIEW and GL_PROJECTION according to the player POV .
Using the walls coordinate , draw a bunch of big QUADS for walls and entities .
The resulting engine is actually even more elegant than the original in my opinion .
And it also provides hardware texture filtering !
void iphoneFrame ( ) { int msec = 14 ; // fixed time iphoneFrameNum ++ ; if ( consoleActive ) { iphoneSet2D ( ) ; Client_Screen_DrawConsole( ) ; iphoneSavePrevTouches ( ) ; GLimp_EndFrame ( ) ; return ; } // fill the floor and ceiling R_Draw_Fill ( 0 , 0 , viddef .
width , viddef .
height >> 1 , r_world->ceilingColour ) ; R_Draw_Fill ( 0 , viddef .
height >>
1 , viddef .
width , viddef .
height , r_world->floorColour ) ; // draw 3D world R_SetGL3D ( Player.position ) ; R_RayCast ( Player.position , r_world ) ; R_DrawSprites ( ) ; // draw 2D overlays iphoneSet2D ( ) ; //
Draw damage or bonus blending , simulate palette switch Client_Screen_DrawConsole ( ) ; ShowTilt ( ) ; // do the swapbuffers GLimp_EndFrame ( ) ; }
Escaping infamous Immediate mode
Iphones run openGL ES 1.1 .
Hence you have no access to glVertex3f , glTexCoord2f and all other outdated methods .
There was a bunch of calls to these method in the original Wolf3D Redux by Michael Liebscher .
Instead of changing every methods calls , a really neat abstraction layer was implemented , hiding a vertexArray mechanism .
What looks like :
pfglBegin( GL_QUADS ) ; pfglTexCoord2f ( 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; pfglVertex3 f ( 0.0,0.0 , 0.0 ) ; ... pfflEnd ( ) ;
Is actually doing this :
//qglBegin( GL_QUADS ) ; curr_vertex = 0 ; curr_prim = prim ; //pfglTexCoord2f ( 1.0 , 0.0 ) ; vab.st [ 0 ] = s ; vab.st [ 1 ] = t ; //pfglVertex3f( 0.0,0.0 , 0.0 ) ; vab.xyz [ 0 ] = x ; vab.xyz [ 1 ] = y ; vab.xyz [ 2 ] = z ; immediate [ curr_vertex ] = vab ; curr_vertex ++; //qflEnd( ) ; qglDrawArrays ( curr_prim , 0 , curr_vertex ) ;
Of course to make all this work , openGL is initialized as follow :
struct Vertex { float xyz [ 3 ] ; float st [ 2 ] ; GLubyte c [ 4 ] ; } ; #define MAX_VERTS 16384 typedef struct Vertex Vertex ; Vertex immediate [ MAX_VERTS ] ; void initGL { qglVertexPointer ( 3 , GL_FLOAT , sizeof ( Vertex ) , immediate [ 0 ].xyz ) ; qglTexCoordPointer ( 2 , GL_FLOAT , sizeof ( Vertex ) , immediate [ 0 ].st ) ; qglColorPointer ( 4 , GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE , sizeof ( Vertex ) , immediate [ 0 ].c ) ; qglEnableClientState ( GL_VERTEX_ARRAY ) ; qglEnableClientState ( GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY ) ; qglEnableClientState ( GL_COLOR_ARRAY ) ; }
Short lived bottleneck
While digging in the source , I found out that the framebuffer was being swapped way more often than necessary .
After firing an email to John Carmack , it looks like it 's already fixed in v1.1 !
Email from : Fabien Sanglard fabien.sanglard@fabiensanglard.net to : John Carmack johnc@idsoftware.com subject : How to make Wolfenstein 's iphoneFrame 50 % faster .
Hello john , I 've been reading the code of Wolfenstein 3D for a few days .
I 've noticed that the buffer is swapped at the end of every drawView calls ( pretty much standard ) .
But it looks like the buffer is also swapped in calls to GLimp_End Frame method .
It does n't look like the Right Thing to Do ( unless I am missing something ) .
According to my testing , changing : void GLimp_EndFrame ( ) { [ eaglview swapBuffers ] ; } to void GLimp_EndFrame ( ) { //[eaglview swapBuffers ] ; } changed the iphoneFrame runtime from 20ms to 10ms .
Email from : John Carmack johnc@idsoftware.com to : Fabien Sanglard fabien.sanglard@fabiensanglard.net subject : Re : How to make Wolfenstein 's iphoneFrame 50 % faster .
That was already changed in v1.1 .
It was interesting that the only way that was possible to go unnoticed was the fact that the iPhone uses triple buffering instead of double buffering -- with double buffering the screen would have never been updated at all .
So next release should be even faster .
It 's also a good news from people hoping for Doom : Wolfenstein is far from pushing the iphone to the limit .
As a side note , I was really surprised to get an answer from John Carmack public email address .
It 's pretty amazing that some stranger can exchange with one of the gods of programming .
Compiling
If you are an Apple iPhone Developer , you can actually build the game from the source and upload it on your iPhone .
An early attempt , selecting the configuration " ReleaseEpisode1 " will fail :
CodeSign error : Code Signing Identity 'iPhone Developer : John Carmack ' does not match any code - signing certificate in your keychain .
No doubt , the code IS still warm .
Just remove John Carmack 's signing certificate , grab a new " Provisionning Certificate " from the Apple Developer Portal and build again :
The game builds flawlessly and gets uploaded on the iphone device .
Objective - C/ C++ communication
The engine feature a neat example of method calls Objective - C <=> ANSI C .
Objective - C => ANSI C is quite easy : Just import the header with the function declaration and call them .
This is done in - ( void ) drawView , to call iphoneFrame ( ) .
Objective - C <= ANSI C : Call an Objective - C method from a C program is a little bit more tricky :
You need the main UIView to maintain a reference to itself via a global variable :
EAGLView.m
EAGLView * eaglview ; - ( id)initWithCoder :( NSCoder *) coder { eaglview = self ; } void GLimp_EndFrame ( ) { [ eaglview swapBuffers ] ; }
You then declare the function " extern ' C ' " ( if you are in c ++ ) and can call it from your C/C++ code :
#ifdef __cplusplus extern " C " { #endif void GLimp_EndFrame ( void ) ; #ifdef __cplusplus } #endif ... void foo( void ) { GLimp_EndFrame ( ) ; }

South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster needs to get laid
Last week Craigslist got rid of its “ erotic services ” section because people were offering companionship for money but that “ anything else ” that may happen is the decision of two consenting adults and blah blah blah .
Basically Craigslist allowed people to offer sex for money in case anyone was unaware ( I was until Rick Sanchez ’s show on CNN pointed out this section , and I still did n’t believe it existed ) .
Well CL apparently replaced it with an “ Adult Services ” section , and the segregationist right wing theocrat Attorney General of South Carolina is still unhappy about Craigslist ’s offerings :
Craigslist ’s promise to remove its Erotic Services category , replacing it with a screened Adult Services section , was apparently not enough for South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster , who announced plans to prosecute the popular online classifieds
Web site , of which eBay owns a minority stake .
“ As of 5:00 p.m. this afternoon , the craigslist South Carolina site continues to display advertisements for prostitution and graphic pornographic material , ” said a statement on the Attorney General ’s Web site .
“ This content was not removed as we requested .
We have no alternative but to move forward with criminal investigation and potential prosecution . ”
The man in charge of Craigslist responded :
“ He evidently feels justified in singling out craigslist for investigation , and publicly condemning me personally as being worthy of criminal prosecution , ” Buckmaster wrote in a blog posting .
“ Seriously ?
The craigslist adult services section for Greenville , SC has a total of 1 ad for the last 3 days , featuring a photograph of a fully clothed person . ”
Buckmaster went on to site the overall tameness of Craiglist ’s South Carolina postings , compared to the adult services ads in other traditional media venues throughout the state .
“ Would you target a venue with 9 PG - 13 rated ads , or one with 250 XXX rated ones ? ” he wrote .
This is what happens when people who are insanely religious acquire the power to enforce laws , they forget they ’re forced to stay within the guidelines of the state and US constitution , and think that the “ laws ” created by some mythical Jew living in the clouds is greater than their secular restrictions .
News of green trends emerging in cities around the world is becoming commonplace to the point that visions of a “ green city ” are beginning to enter the minds of the populace , appearing in flashy renderings or news articles .
The term incites thoughts of 100 % solar power or hundreds of wind turbines on buildings or merely just bounding foliage on every corner .
I found a prime example in a New York Times article speaking of plans for a Florida city to be run completely by PVs .
When environmental critics come along and call such talk “ fantasy , ” they may not be mistaken because those technological tactics are not the basis for what will make our cities truly sustainable .
The true conversion to a sustainable economy is to rethink how we organize our cities and how their components can work together to achieve new levels of efficiency and production as part of a reflexively beneficial network .
An ecology .
If we look hard enough we can find instances of this mentality that have actually been successfully attempted .
A prime example is i the city of Kalundborg , Denmark where industry and residents work as part of a functioning ecosystem rather than individual entities in close proximity .
The names given to describe the creation are numerous : Industrial Symbiosis , Environmental Industry Ecology , Industrial Ecosystem — but they all spell progress .
The City of Kalundboug
With over 20,000 residents , the coastal city boasted a number of different industries all providing a net export of products .
For a capitalistic , free market system this could be business as usual .
But the people of Kalundborg came to realize nature ’s most powerful lesson and the prime focus of Intercon ’s dialogue : the interconnections between components of society are the path to achieving a stasis that is truly sustainable .
The city and its industries set off to find how they could collectively function better and their result was a harmonized ecology that could not be achieved without their collective participation .
Kalundborg ’s ecosystem begins with four main components .
The Asnaes Power Station is Denmark ’s largest coal - fired power plant producing up to 1,500 MW of energy .
The StatOil refinery , also Denmark ’s largest , produces up to 3.2 million tons / year of crude oil as of 1995 .
The Gyproc Plasterboard plant makes gypsum wall board ( blueboard or sheetrock ) while Novo Nordisk , an international pharmaceutical company , has one of their largest plants in the Kalundborg .
Outside of these seemingly unrelated industries , we have the natural environment and the city itself .
Building an Ecosystem
The system started with the Asnaes power plant which began to use excess heat to create steam that could be sold to the other facilities and 3,500 homes to replace more expensive oil heating systems .
Looking at its own waste stream , the plant harvested Sulfur Dioxide which when mixed with Calcium Carbonate , makes Calcium Sulfate–or Gypsum .
This new product helped supplement the stream of raw material into Gyproc Plasterboard .
Instead of using freshwater lakes for cooling needs , the power station began using salt water from the ocean and then transferred that heated water to local fish farms who , in turn , lowered their own secondary heating needs .
Lastly , Asnaes removed fly ash from its smoke stacks and sold it for use in cement production and road paving ( a key component to recycled content in concrete structures . )
StatOil found its own methods of integrating into its surrounding network .
Instead of flaring off their excess gas it was utilized and harvested as power that was sold to Gyproc and back to Asnaes .
The refinery also began to treat its waste water before discharging it back to the environment while producing a supply of organic sludge .
Similarly , Novo ’s use of ingredients like insulin and industrial enzymes created by products of organic material .
Both of these components was combined with waste from the fish farms to create a rich fertilizer base that can be sold to surrounding farming regions to complete a transition from hard industries like oil and coal to aiding organic farming .
Through the course of reorganization and contemplating new methods for exchange , this city was able to reduce emissions , reduce fossil fuel usage , reduce its waste stream , increase efficiency and create new product streams that produced revenue .
Research firm Indigo Development refers to this system as an example of “ Industrial Symbiosis ” and estimates that the $ 60 million in total investments produced $ 120 million in cost - savings and new revenue streams .
This happened with no PVs , no turbines , no CFLs and no hybrid cars .
Any common consumer level savings in energy or materials would be above and beyond this infrastructural intiative .
The clear resemblance to a natural , balanced system is unsurprising .
Now it is true that the businesses in question are not hallmarks of sustainability , but that only speaks to the promise of the process .
I am not endorsing the production of more coal and oil facilities , but if this much can be accomplished with coal plants and oil refineries think of what we could do with a city of solar panel makers , vertical farms , construction salvage depots and biomass plants .
While noting the effort of municipalities and developers utilizing green systems is worthwhile , we must continue to underscore the vast amount of potential from breaking the borders of traditional business planning and urban organization .
As the vast population of people who are not professional experts in sustainability become educated on the possibilities , it is imperative that we do not cloud vision to truly sustainable goals by gimmicks and half - hearted benchmarks that stand out merely because they are above the historical baseline effort ( nominally zero ) .
Whether or not these so - called green cities get built is less of an issue as long as people know they are a long way from what we can ( and should ) produce .
The announcement by Eric Holder that I wrote about yesterday regarding the return of the “ assault weapons ” ban received this very interesting reception from Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill :
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will join Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) in opposing any effort to revive the 1994 assault weapons ban , putting them on the opposite side of the Obama administration .
Reid spokesman Jim Manley said the Nevada Democrat will preserve his traditional pro-gun rights voting record .
“ Senator Reid would oppose an effort ( to ) reinstate the ban if the Senate were to vote on it in the future , ” Manley told The Hill in an e-mail late Thursday night .
It was not immediately clear whether Reid would block the bill from the Senate , but his opposition casts serious doubt on its chances .
Also , Manley noted that Reid voted against the ban in 1994 and again when it expired in 2004 .
Reid ’s stance joins him with Pelosi , who told reporters Thursday that the administration had not checked with her before Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters the administration would attempt to reinstate the ban .
Pelosi gave a flat “ no ” when asked if she had spoken to Holder or any other administration officials about the issue .
“ On that score , I think we need to enforce the laws we have right now , ” Pelosi said at her weekly news conference .
“ I think it ’s clear the Bush administration did n’t do that . ”
Outside of the dig at the recent Republican president , that phrase is the stock line of those who do n’t want to pass new gun control laws , such as the National Rifle Association .
Q. Why does Mayor Tommy Battle not have his e-mail address on the City of Huntsville 's Web site - www.hsvcity.com?
I think Mayor Loretta Spencer had her e-mail address on the Web site .
The City Council members have theirs listed .
Does Mayor Battle plan to list his e-mail address soon ?
A . The reason Mayor Battle 's e-mail address is not listed on the city 's Web site is for security reasons .
The mayor 's office said by not posting his e-mail online , it prevents phishing and the amount of spam received .
The mayor can be reached through e-mail at tommy.battle@hsvcity.com .

How many tax havens are there ?
About 40 countries have been identified as tax havens by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .
These countries levy little or no tax on corporate and personal income , and advertise their low tax rates to lure foreign money .
They also have a “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy regarding foreign income .
Tax havens do n’t inquire about the source of that income , and they stonewall requests for information from other countries hunting tax evaders .
The secrecy has helped attract an estimated $ 12 trillion in assets .
“ There is no doubt that offshore anonymity encourages big companies and rich people to use these tiny islands as a means of avoiding or evading tax , ” says British economist David Boyle .
Are they really all ‘ tiny islands ’?
No .
Switzerland , Andorra , and Liechtenstein — landlocked countries in the heart of Europe — are among the world ’s busiest tax havens .
But it ’s true that many tax havens are small island nations , ranging from the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean to Nauru , a flyspeck in the Pacific Ocean , through which some $ 70 billion in looted Russian assets flowed after the ruble collapsed in 1998 .
Because their government budgets are tiny , the havens can afford not to tax foreigners who set up bank accounts or corporations in their territory .
In return , the havens get thriving banks , good - paying jobs , and higher living standards for their citizens .
Who hides their money in these banks ?
Everyone from retirees with modest incomes to big - time gangsters and drug dealers to giant corporations such as News Corp. , American Express , and AIG .
Legitimate users of tax havens include people who set up accounts in places such as Bermuda because they plan to retire there as well as local citizens who work overseas and send money back home to their families .
But most of the wealthy individuals and corporations that open bank accounts or set up shell corporations in tax havens are trying to shield their money from the taxman or from law - enforcement authorities .
How do criminals use tax havens ?
Bank secrecy enables them to launder their money , disguising its source .
Consider the case of Colombian economist Franklin Jurado , who in the 1990s set up several shell companies in Panama , a notorious tax haven , on behalf of a Colombian drug lord .
He deposited
$ 36 million in cocaine profits in the corporate accounts , then moved the money to accounts in 68 banks in nine European countries .
Eventually , the money would re-emerge in Colombia , looking like corporate dividends or bill payments from foreign customers .
Investigators tried for years to trace the transfers back to Panama , but some banks there refused to cooperate .
Jurado ’s scheme was not exposed until police investigated the noise coming from his apartment :
It was a money - counting machine that was in almost constant operation .
What about legitimate companies ?
Their main motivation is to shelter income from taxes in their home countries .
The federal government says 83 of the 100 largest U.S. companies , including 14 recipients of federal bailout money , have set up subsidiaries in tax havens .
Bank of America has 59 subsidiaries in the Caymans , and Citigroup has 427 subsidiaries in various havens , including 90 in the Caymans .
The Treasury Department estimates that it loses $ 100 billion a year in tax revenue from companies that ship their income offshore .
“ We cannot tolerate $ 100 billion in offshore tax abuses burning a hole through our budget each year , ” says Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . )
How do companies get away with that ?
Under current U.S. law , American companies operating overseas do n’t have to pay taxes on foreign earnings until and unless those earnings are transferred back to the U.S.
( They often are n’t . )
The Obama administration wants to close that loophole , and Sen. Levin has proposed legislation that would tax the foreign earnings of U.S. companies .
The member nations of the G - 20 , meanwhile , have agreed to “ name and shame ” — as well as impose economic sanctions on — tax havens that refuse to share information with other governments investigating possible tax evasion and money laundering .
“ If tax information is exchanged on request , ” says British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , “ then the benefits of being in these countries will diminish every day . ”
Is the crackdown working ?
It ’s too early to tell .
Some countries , such as Liechtenstein , have vowed to resist , but Switzerland , long a bastion of secrecy , has made substantial concessions .
After U.S. authorities caught UBS , Switzerland ’s biggest bank , helping American clients evade U.S. taxes ( see below ) , the Swiss reluctantly agreed to ease their long - held tradition of total bank secrecy .
In addition to paying a $ 780 million fine , UBS agreed to give the U.S. information on 300 account holders suspected of evading U.S. taxes .
But the bank is fighting a U.S. subpoena for data on 52,000 additional accounts .
It promises to be a long legal battle , but with a deep recession biting into tax receipts , the U.S. wo n’t give up easily .
“ The No. 1 thing is , we need revenue , ” says lawyer Jack Blum , an expert on tax havens who frequently consults with Congress .
“ This business of letting people get away with bloody murder by taking money offshore is inconsistent with trying to fund our government . ”
Swiss banking under siege
The Swiss tradition of banking secrecy dates back to the Middle Ages .
But under pressure from revenue - hungry countries seeking tax evaders , the wall of secrecy is starting to crumble .
It started even before UBS agreed to give the U.S. the names of depositors suspected of dodging U.S. taxes .
Beginning in the 1990s , the Swiss agreed to tax the accounts of European citizens and remit the payments to their countries of origin .
But the UBS case has raised suspicions that the Swiss are n’t complying with that agreement , and foreign governments are leaning on Swiss banks to be more forthcoming about the $ 2 trillion in foreign deposits they hold .
Come clean , other governments warn , or lose your licenses to operate overseas .
In recent weeks , alarmed account holders have been pulling their money out of Swiss banks and negotiating settlements with tax authorities in their home countries .
“ Switzerland has to take action , ” says an apologetic Roland Meier of the Swiss finance ministry .
“ The international pressure is tremendous . ”
The new Nintendo DSi launches in the UK today and is bound to sell - out immediately , much as any new piece of Ninty - branded gaming hardware always does .
But is it worth your hard - earned ?
£ 150 is a lot to part with , particularly if you have already got a DS Lite ( and , if you are anything like us , a first - gen DS ' phat ' , a Gameboy Micro , a Gameboy Advance , a Gameboy Colour and so on at the bottom of the kitchen drawer ) .
The real USP with the DSi is the much - improved online features and the new DSi store , with loads of games ( old and new ) being made available on a weekly basis for you to download .
Nintendo slams Apple
Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils - Aime said this week that the company does n't want " thousands upon thousands " of games on its DSi download store , while criticising Apple 's iPhone strategy of providing thousands of games and apps ( of varying quality ) .
Fils - Aime told Wired.com that Nintendo is " taking a film - festival approach — high - class content done by knowledgeable developers in creating fantastic experiences for the consumer — instead of the YouTube approach of everything under the sun that is difficult for the consumer to navigate through . "
" What we do n't want to see is a game that is available on a number of other platforms , either mobile or home , nor do we want to see games that do n't take advantage of the unique capabilities of the DS , " said Fils - Aime .
The DSi costs £ 150 , packs in two cameras and a web browser and stores games , music , photos and fun Nintendo utilities on the in - built 256MB memory or on an SD card .
Wired notes that while Japan's DSiWare store already has over 50 games , Apple 's iPhone 's App Store gets over 150 new applications per day .
Check out TechRadar 's full and frank review of Nintendo's new DSi .
When India last toured New Zealand , in December 2002 , we stitched them up all right .
They were known for their weakness in seamer - friendly conditions , and they got green ones to play on all right .
In the two Tests , the highest score India made was 161 ; in the second Test , in Hamilton , in the first innings both sides failed to make 100 .
New Zealand won the series 2 - 0 .
Things then did n't overly improve for India in the ODI series , which they lost 2 - 5 .
You could argue that the weather had a major impact on producing green wickets , because pre-Christmas in New Zealand the climate is far from conducive to dry brown wickets ; but it did not help India that the New Zealand administration 's desire to produce wickets with pace and bounce meant grass , and lots of it , was left on the surface .
All that conspired into a nightmare for anyone who did n't bowl .
But hey , who cared : with a batting line - up that read Sehwag , Dravid , Tendulkar , Ganguly , Laxman it gave us Kiwis the best chance of winning ... and we did .
Little did we know that the boss , Indian cricket , was not impressed , We had embarrassed this powerful cricket nation , and in particular what they were most proud of - their top six batsmen .
They were dispatched and sent packing .
They were laughed at , ridiculed , and their bravery brought into question .
That was six years ago and we have not seen them back until now , and so it comes as no surprise that recently comments have been made by the tourists about the difficulties this grass - loving country poses for a batsman , because all but one of the above batting greats are back for another crack .
However Messrs Tendulkar , Dravid and Co can rest easy this time round because I can almost guarantee conditions will be vastly different .
Why ?
Well , because New Zealanders and New Zealand cricket understand who pays the wages nowadays and this tour for the Black Caps is very much the scenario of playing your boss at golf .
You need to put up a good account for yourself if you want to get the desired invite again .
However , if you are going to win you do n't want to stuff him out of sight in some sort of perceived under - handed manner .
If you do win , do so in a manner that allows the boss to retain some sort of dignity , and if you lose , make sure he felt the engagement worthy of his time .
That way you may just get the invite to join the country club .
In cricket terms what New Zealand really need to achieve from this tour is a sense of goodwill towards New Zealand cricket from Indian cricket once the tour is over .
That does not mean rolling over and dying , because fans of New Zealand cricket also like to win .
However , this could be the last time New Zealand fans see these great batting names of Indian cricket on our shores , and both nations may feel cheated if seaming wickets nullify the Indian batting machine .
So the people under the most pressure may in fact be the ground staff .
Nothing but perfect cricket conditions will suffice for this tour .
In the ODIs we want conditions that provide for quality strokeplay , but ones that do n't turn Iain O'Brien and Co into cannon fodder .
In the Tests we need a session or two of movement , followed by a batsman - friendly period , and then some turn and variable bounce later on .
The good news is that this can be done with the application of a little work ethic .
Also , over the last few years New Zealand wickets have improved out of sight , and the weather also generally plays ball in late summer , unlike in early summer - the part of the season India experienced last time .
So the red carpet , or more appropriately the brown , dry carpet , may be rolled out for our guests this time round , and fewer demons may be found in the Basin Reserve pitch ; but that said , there are inherent challenges that Indian players must overcome in New Zealand .
In cricket terms what the Black Caps really need to achieve from this tour is a sense of goodwill towards New Zealand cricket from Indian cricket once the tour is over .
That does not , however , mean rolling over and dying , because fans of New Zealand cricket also like to win
Whether or not the pitch has seam movement or not , most New Zealand surfaces bounce .
It 's not an Australian - type bounce but rather a tennis - ball - style bounce .
The ball may only carry to the keeper at shin height , but as it passes the batsman it can be quite high , even when very full .
Indian players who are used to being able to move into the ball and driving on the up will find that in New Zealand you must get much closer to the ball if you want to experience good timing .
In defence , on the front foot they must get used to the ball hitting high on the bat .
New Zealand soils need grass to provide enough pace , and that grass also provides seam movement .
If caution is taken by the ground staff , pitches could be slow .
In India the ball often skids and that provides for good batting ; in New Zealand the ball will hold up and that means patience and batting accuracy become paramount .
It 's not just the surface you must get your head around in New Zealand .
Stoppages and shortened games become a challenge too .
March and April may be the best summer months , but in a narrow country bordered on both sides by ocean you can expect very changeable weather .
You must be able to deal with starting and restarting games at will and adapting to the differing situations that scenario brings .
You can expect a lot of wind too .
All venues in New Zealand can get windy , let alone Wellington , which on most days blows a gale .
It ruins the bowling rhythm , makes your eyes water , chills you to the bone , affects you balance and back - lift , and most of all is exhausting .
You must have strategies , preferably developed through experience , to deal with the wind in New Zealand .
Wind and a bit of chill also leads to old , and even young , bones getting a little stiff .
It can take a bit of extra time to get the body loosened up and moving early in an innings or bowling spell .
For those used to starting warm and loose , special attention needs to be taken to ensure stiffness does not result in sloppiness .
New Zealand is not that dissimilar to England , but it is most certainly not the subcontinent , and thus takes a bit of getting used to as far as the Indians are concerned .
However , the only advantage in terms of assistance the New Zealand bowlers may get this time round against a touring Indian side may simply be an initial psychological one , based on the mental scarring from the last time the Indian players toured , and stories of horror told to the new guys in the squad .
Where Has All the Ammo Gone ?
( And Primers , Brass … )
“ Sold Out ” is the message these days at retail stores , gunshows , and online merchants .
Our readers have reported that big outlet stores such as WalMart are completely sold out of loaded ammo in popular calibers .
At a Sportsman ’s Warehouse store , the shelves were bare ( see photo below ) .
Likewise at a gunshow we attended last week in California , vendors sold out their supplies of rifle primers … down to the last box .
Many online e-merchants ( including Grafs.com , MidwayUSA , and Wideners ) are completely sold out of small and large CCI , Federal , Remington , and Wolf rifle primers .
What ’s going on ?
Is this a wave of panic buying or are there other factors at play ?
First , it ’s pretty clear that shooters nationwide are laying in large supplies of ammo , bullets , and primers .
This is motivated by fears ( justified or not ) that Congress is contemplating new taxes on ammo and reloading components .
Also , there has been increased demand for ammunition for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan , and that has siphoned off some of the supply of primers from CCI and Federal .
However , the primary cause of the shortages is “ panic buying ” and hoarding by gun owners .
Amy Bruno tells us that none of her suppliers have notified her of any production issues .
CCI , Federal , and Remington are cranking out as many primers as ever , but supplies are selling out as soon as they hit the shelves .
The Good News
Nammo Lapua reports that a large shipment of Lapua cartridge brass should be arriving in the USA and clear customs within the next 10 days .
This will include 220 Russian , .243 Win , 6.5 Grendel , 6.5×47 , 6.5×55 , 7.63×39 , .308 Win , 30 - 06 , 7.62x54 R , and 338 LM brass .
This shipment will also include loaded ammo , plus Scenar bullets and Lapua rimfire ammo .
Also , a second container is due around the end of March .
Hopefully that will include 6 mmBR brass also .
Check with major vendors such as Sinclair Int’l , Grafs.com , and MidwayUSA .
Midway is listing 3/14/09 as the “ Date expected in - stock ” for Lapua .308 brass .
Bruno Shooters Supply has significant quantities of CCI and Federal primers in stock ( mention 6 mmBR.com when you call ) .
However , all Rem , Winchester , and Wolf rifle primers are sold out .
Here ’s what Bruno ’s has as of today , March 6th :
CCI BR2 Large Rifle Benchrest ( quantity 50 1 K boxes ) : $ 49.95/box
Fed 205M Small Rifle Match ( quantity 383 1 K boxes ) : $ 43.95/box
Fed 210 Large Rifle standard ( quantity 122 1 K boxes ) : $ 32.95/box
Amy Bruno also reports she has 55 8 - lb jugs of the hard - to - find VV N133 .
She does n’t know when the next shipment of Vihtavuori powders will arrive .
Powder Valley has the CCI BR2 Large Rifle Benchrest primers in stock at $ 37.00 per thousand .
Unfortunately , Powder Valley is sold out of almost all other rifle primers .

President Barack Obama has announced tough targets for new fuel - efficient vehicles in order to cut pollution and lower dependence on oil imports .
Describing the move as " historic " , Mr Obama said the country 's first - ever national standards would reduce vehicle emissions by about a third by 2016 .
The plan aims to replace overlapping rules on emissions and efficiency set by federal agencies and states .
US carmakers and environmental groups have expressed support for the move .
Under the proposed standards , manufacturers would be required to begin improving fuel efficiency by 5 % a year from 2012 .
US CAR EMISSIONS PROPOSALS 5 % yearly rises in fuel efficiency from 2012 through 2016 Cuts oil consumption by estimated 1.8bn barrels 34 % reduction in emissions by 2016 Cuts equal taking 177m cars off the road Price of cars may rise by $ 1,300
Obama 's first emission cap Readers ' views
By 2016 , they would have to reach an average of 39 miles per US gallon for passenger cars , and 30 miles per gallon for light lorries .
The new targets would increase the average fuel efficiency of all US cars and light lorries to 35.5 miles per gallon , about 10 miles per gallon more than the current standard .
Announcing the plan at the White House , Mr Obama said the status quo was " no longer acceptable " and led to dependence on oil exporting countries and climate change .
The new standards are expected to raise the price of new vehicles by about $ 1,300 ( £ 839 ) per vehicle by 2016 .
But the president said this would be offset by lower fuel cost within three years .
UK AND US GALLONS
The UK measurement of a gallon is slightly larger than that for a US gallon .
UK gallon : 4.546 litres US gallon : 3.785 litres 1 US gallon = 0.833 UK gallons
The US is the biggest car market with more than 250 million cars and light lorries on the road .
The proposed nationwide standard for exhaust emissions is expected to cut the amount of carbon dioxide produced by new passenger vehicles by 34 % .
Savings The Safe Climate Campaign , an environmental group , welcomed the plan saying it was " major signal " that the US was serious about curbing greenhouse gas emissions .
BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin , in Washington
The president has acted remarkably quickly to come up with a compromise .
It still leaves American fuel efficiency standards lagging behind Europe .
But this is the first American nationwide standard on greenhouse gas emissions - and it will be welcomed by other nations trying to negotiate a new treaty on climate change .
What is interesting is that so far no - one here seems to be protesting .
The AAA drivers association welcome the move for the certainty it gives carmakers and the prospect of lower fuel bills .
They are not complaining at the likely extra purchase price of vehicles .
Carmakers are also hailing a single nationwide standard , after years of court battles to stop California and other states setting their own tough pollution controls .
" GM and the auto industry benefit by having more consistency and certainty to guide our product plans , " GM Chief Executive Fritz Henderson said in a statement .
Mr Obama predicted that the lawsuits would be dropped as a result of the proposed regulation .
The president said : " As a result of this agreement we will save 1.8 billion barrels of oil over the lifetime of the vehicles sold in the next five years . "
He said this amounted to removing 177 million cars from the roads by 2016 .
In that period , the savings in oil will amount to last year 's combined US imports from Saudi Arabia , Venezuela , Libya and Nigeria , Mr Obama added .
BBC environment correspondent Richard Black says the plan should act as an incentive for US carmakers to increase fuel efficiency towards European and Asian levels .
The proposed regulation needs the approval of the Environmental Protection Agency and the transportation department .

A key provision in the House bill deals with " balance transfer " offers .
Card companies sometimes offer low interest rates - occasionally zero percent for a while - on money moved from one card to another .
Yet consumers do not realize that if they also have an old balance at a high interest rate at the company at the time of the transfer , the high - interest debt remains .
All monthly payments typically go to retiring the zero percent interest balance .
Recessions usually bring cheap oil and gasoline .
But not now .
And that has analysts worried that another fuel - price spike could be on the way .
Crude oil , the lifeblood of the global economy , costs $ 61.67 , even as the world struggles through the worst recession since World War II .
And prices are rising , climbing 26 percent in the last month .
Gas prices have jumped as a result , rising 12 cents in California last week to reach an average of $ 2.62 for a gallon of regular .
Compared with last year 's record oil price of $ 145.29 per barrel , for oil sold on the New York Mercantile Exchange , $ 61 may not sound like much .
But it 's twice the historic average for petroleum , which used to trade from $ 20 to $ 30 .
Prices briefly fell below $ 34 in December and February , but they 've rebounded with a vengeance .
The economy has n't .
But oil traders are betting that the recession is at or near its worst , meaning a recovery could start later this year and drive up global demand for oil again .
They 're trading on the possibility of a recovery , rather than a recovery itself .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
To many analysts , the current high price is a bad sign .
The worldwide oil market is awash in petroleum , because countries stuck in recession do n't need as much to fuel their cars , factories and power plants .
So if oil costs this much now , when demand is low and supplies are high , what happens when the economy improves ?
Another record - setting price spike ?
Gasoline rising back above $ 4 a gallon ?
" The fact it 's going up now on nada is proof that speculators are still in control , " said Judy Dugan , research director with the nonprofit group Consumer Watchdog .
" Unless there are curbs in place , it obviously could shoot through the roof again . "
Changing the rules
That fear is fueling efforts in Washington to change the rules of the oil market .
A global warming bill wending its way through Congress includes provisions designed to limit the role of speculative oil investors , whom many politicians blame for last year 's runaway bull market .
" We need to look no further than today 's oil prices , which have doubled since December , to see the effect speculators have on energy prices , " said Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Mich. , who wrote those provisions .
" We are in the middle of a recession , supply is at a 20 - year - high , demand is at a 10 - year low , yet oil prices are up 70 percent since the beginning of the year .
This can not be explained by simple supply and demand . "
However , even if the legislation does n't pass , another major price spike is hardly certain .
Due to the recession , the world has a glut of oil in storage , with supplies in the United States at their highest level in 19 years .
An estimated 100 million barrels worldwide are sitting in tanker ships , which companies have been using as floating storage bins .
As the price rises , more of that petroleum will pour onto the market .
" That 's definitely going to be a headwind against the price of oil as it moves up , " said Allen Good , an analyst with the Morningstar market research firm .
In addition , Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may try to keep oil supplies high enough to prevent a price spike , said Amy Myers Jaffe , an energy research fellow at Rice University 's Baker Institute .
The worldwide recession cut demand for their oil , they want the recession to end and high prices could hinder a recovery .
' Speculative bubble '
" I liked $ 45 ( per barrel ) , and I think the Saudis have the ability to bring it back down to there if they want to , " Jaffe said .
" To me , we 're having a little speculative bubble right now , and it 's going to fizzle out . "
The last time oil rose above $ 60 , in March 2007 , America 's economy was growing , China 's was soaring , Chrysler was still solvent and few people outside the financial world had ever heard of mortgage - backed securities .
Back then , $ 60 was considered frighteningly high , a price capable of causing serious economic harm .
The decade 's rising oil prices were already having a clear effect on drivers , who were buying less gasoline .
Gas sales in California have dropped for the last three years in a row .
Even after last summer 's economic meltdown ended the bull market for oil and sent gas prices tumbling , drivers kept buying less .
Americans used 2.7 percent less gasoline in the last four weeks than they did during the same period last year , according to the Energy Information Administration , part of the U.S. Department of Energy .
Such weak sales should be keeping oil prices low .
But traders have been gambling that the recession has finally bottomed out , with a recovery perhaps starting later this year .
That would increase worldwide demand for petroleum .
In addition , China 's thirst for oil may be picking up again .
After falling through the winter and spring , China 's oil consumption rose about 4 percent in April compared with the same month of 2008 , according to the Platts energy information service .
China 's increasing need for oil was one of the main reasons - some would say , excuses - for last year 's price spike .
Some politicians argue that the country remains far too vulnerable to a repeat performance .
Limiting trades
The climate change bill includes provisions that would ban some types of oil trades and regulate others that do n't take place on a formal market .
Limits on the number of oil contracts a speculator can hold would be extended to cover those trades as well as trading on electronic exchanges and overseas markets .
" I think there 's no question that supply - demand fundamentals are not reflected in the current ( oil ) price , " said Tyson Slocum , director of the energy program at the Public Citizen watchdog group , which supports cracking down on oil - market speculation .
" Is this a preview to $ 145 oil ?
I do n't think so .
But I think this underscores the need to increase oversight of these markets . "
BRINGING up children is a labour of love , and a pricey one at that .
Thankfully , most governments offer some form of tax breaks or cash benefits to ease the burden .
In all but one of 30 OECD countries , a married one - earner couple with two children takes home more money than a single person with no children on the same average annual salary .
Measured at purchasing - power parity , a family in Luxembourg has the highest overall net income of $ 48,980 , out of an average gross wage of $ 49,488 .
But the best countries for families are Ireland or the Czech Republic , where “ net ” incomes end up higher than gross .
British singletons subsidise families less than their German counterparts , who take home almost $ 10,000 less from almost the same salary .
Mexico , the poorest of the OECD countries , is the only place where married couples with children get no breaks at all .

Golf is performed on courses that supply an assortment of distinct configurations , and also you want in order to handle those numerous configurations successfully in the event that you may love to place fantastic scores .
Possessing the capacity to attack irons from a fantastic lie ensures you are going to have a less difficult time working with inferior establishes too .
Irons you choose are important .
If you are a petite lady like myself , you ’ll need proper set of clubs .
More about that here :
https://www.golfclubsguru.com/best-golf-clubs-for-petite-ladies/ .

Hitting back about the ball is critical to get a fresh attack , also you also may just hit if both palms are beyond the ball when contact is manufactured .
To produce this easier , you can want to install within the ball with the hands at a forward ’s posture .
Utilize Plenty of Club
While that really is really a course direction hint significantly more than whatever else , it could get an effect on the characteristic of one ’s ball spectacular .
Just by deciding on out a club that ’s adequate to reach the objective .
Regrettably , most beginner golfers decide clubs depending about the optimal / optimally scenario situation for this shot .
To put it differently they choose the club that ’ll get to the prospective just supposing it ’s struck entirely completely .
That does n’t happen , of course , take an additional club and produce a easy swing which is sold with a few built in gross for mistake .
Create the Turn into Fitted Clubs
The previous thing which individuals will earn on ball spectacular has absolutely nothing more to perform all the swing in the slightest .
As an alternative , this really is a gear tip which should n’t be neglected .

Reports said Dalu Mncube had saved a colleague from attack earlier this year
A rare white tiger has mauled to death a New Zealand zoo keeper as horrified tourists looked on , police said .
The attack occurred at the Zion Wildlife Gardens in Whangarei , some 200 km ( 124 miles ) north of Auckland .
Police said the tiger grabbed a male zoo keeper who was cleaning an enclosure and would not let go despite the efforts of other staff members .
The zoo - home to some 40 rare lions and tigers - has been closed to visitors , and the tiger destroyed .
Police said the attack was witnessed by a group of eight tourists .
Please turn on JavaScript .

The keeper was named in local media as South African Dalu Mncube who reportedly rescued one of his colleagues from an attack earlier this year .
The zoo is well known in New Zealand as the setting for a reality television programme that starred its founder Craig Busch , known as the " Lion Man " .
Mr Busch was dismissed from his post last year by his mother , who controls the zoo .
Sony has a large advantage over the Xbox 360 : the PS3 offers free online gaming and content downloads .
Xbox Live of course costs around $ 50 — less if you get a deal — and a good amount of content is made available to Gold members first and Silver members down the line .
The only problem is that someone has to pay for all these online features , and if reports are correct , Sony is passing that bill onto publishers .
MTV Multiplayer has gotten hold of a memo sent to publishers from Sony that changes the fees associated with hosting content on the PlayStation Store .
Publishers are now charged 16 cents per 1GB downloaded through the store for the first 60 days when it comes to free content , and in perpetuity for paid content .
That 's not a small amount of money ; if a demo gets downloaded one million times , it would cost a publisher $ 160,000 for a 1GB file ; even more if the file is larger .
This is on top of the regular fees that Sony charges to put content and games up on the store , mind you .
While no one is willing to speak on the record , publishers are obviously not happy .
" It definitely makes us think about how we view the distribution of content related to our games when it is free for us to do it on the web , on Xbox Live , or any other way — including broadcast — than on Sony ’s platform , ” a source told Multiplayer .
“ It ’s a new thing we have to budget .
It ’s not cool .
It sucks . ”
This is bad news for publishers , but it could be even worse news for PS3 owners .
Publishers now have a strong financial incentive to release fewer demos , or to make file sizes smaller .
Releasing those retail - sized games for purchase may make the PlayStation Network stand out , but it could cause publishers to have to cough up hundreds of thousands of dollars to Sony , giving them a reason to stick to physical distribution .
What 's worse is that there is no way to know how much money you 'll owe Sony .
If a smaller company with a tight budget releases a demo that takes off , it would suddenly have to cough up a huge chunk of cash unexpectedly .
Put that same demo on the 360 ?
Smooth sailing .
That 's an advantage Microsoft has to be more than happy to take advantage of .
Sony , of course , does n't expect there to be a downturn in content , but these are tough times ; even big publishers are looking for ways to cut costs .
This program was apparently put in place last October , and the Resident Evil 5 demo was given an exclusive 360 launch in January of this year .
While the demo was available a week later on the PS3 , perhaps Capcom simply wanted gamers with multiple consoles to download the sure - to - be popular demo on the 360 to avoid the fees ?
Maybe we 're in tinfoil - hat territory , but now Microsoft does n't have to pay for exclusive demos of popular games ; it need only not charge to host them .
It 's been a good week for transparency , which is bad news for people who get undressed with the light on .
Last Tuesday , Gordon Brown said : " We have clearly got the balance wrong when online businesses have higher standards of transparency than the public services " and announced that , as a result , people are going to be able to comment online about GPs , hospitals , nurseries , schools and the police , just like they can on Amazon , eBay , TripAdvisor and , indeed , the Observer website .
I expect that 'll sort everything out .
The prime minister is deploying what he calls " the enormous democratising power of information " .
Well , you do n't have to do much surfing to find books , CDs , YouTube clips , newspaper articles , restaurants and theatre shows that have all had the shit democratised out of them .
He 's invoking the collective wisdom of the nation to pass judgment on and improve our public services .
Unfortunately , he 'll mainly attract the same self - selecting bunch of inexplicably livid weirdos who infect the comment sections on all websites .
There are many perfectly reasonable remarks put online , and others that are only bland or harmlessly nonsensical , but if there 's one thing the internet demonstrates it's that a lot of angry people can read .
Their writing , on the other hand , needs work .
If you 're in any doubt , go to ifyoulikeitsomuchwhydontyougolivethere.com which provides a hilarious selection of the most illiterate , prejudiced and irate posts from the BBC's Have Your Say site .
It not only makes me laugh , it makes me angry at what people write , thus providing a moment 's insight into what it feels like to be a member of the incensed posting community .
I reckon I 've got off pretty lightly from online comments ( until now ) but still , whenever I indulge in a drunken self - googling , I inevitably find , among the compliments or fair criticism , a smattering of remarks that are eye - wateringly personal , mean , hate - filled and unforgettable .
There 's always someone who reads my column or watches a TV show I 'm in and does n't just disagree or dislike it but reacts as if I 've stamped on their foot and punched their mother .
It 's like I 've said the very thing they have been furiously expecting me to say their whole life .
Like they 're a teenager and I 'm their maddening sibling who , with just a syllable out of place , can release a torrent of rage because they SO knew I was going to say that because that 's EXACTLY the sort of CRAP that I ALWAYS SAY .
To them , I typify a horrendously unfair world that 's all wrong , but will never change because it 's run by the likes of me and Gordon Brown and JK Rowling and Bono and Lulu , sitting at the top table guzzling money pie in hypocrisy sauce and laughing in their apoplectic faces .
Last Sunday , someone with the username Veganjules rabidly exhorted me to calm down about teenage spending .
It was about as logical as screaming at someone to relax or they might set off a landmine .
You can't see the comment any more because it was removed by the moderator as it ended with the words " you fat cunt " .
The fact that that phrase is allowed in articles but not comments is , as I expect Veganjules would be the loudest to point out , everything that 's wrong with this country .
Obviously I was insulted - I 'm not fat !
As for the rest , I 'm sure Veganjules knows one when he sees one .
But maybe he 's got an unusually reflective computer screen .
Hard copies of this newspaper which are subsequently used to wrap chips , blow noses , wipe arses , start fires in major public buildings or for post - masturbatory clean - up will all end up with more eloquent adornments than many of the comments that are posted online .
And unlike the salt , vinegar , snot or semen , they 're not even biodegradable .
So if I , as someone whose work does n't really affect people 's lives , am subjected to this online abuse , what are GPs , nurses , consultants , police and teachers in for ?
They 're obliged to tell people things that they do n't want to hear : to arrest them , give them homework , make them stop eating fried breakfasts , announce that their gran died on the table .
While scrutiny of these professions is vital , a single lay opinion is simply not as valid as a professional one in those contexts .
A democratising strategy of endorsing abuse could have unfortunate consequences .
Some things should n't be that democratic : " I 'm afraid you 've got terminal cancer . "
" No , doctor , I vote that I do n't .
It 's a hung parliament , I wo n't die . "
The only consolation for hospitals is that the patients they most fail wo n't be in a position to criticise .
Most people do n't comment much online .
They 're not arrogant enough to think their opinions , or anger , are of general interest .
But the convention of inviting comment from the benign many has put a metaphorical speakers ' corner at the bottom of every web page for the poisonous few .
A friend of mine has come up with an idea to stem the tide of bile .
He wants people to post , as a comment , on as many opinion - garnering web pages as possible , as often as they can be bothered , the phrase : " It just goes to show you can't be too careful ! "
It 's perfect ; it seems lighthearted without being a joke .
It 's vaguely pertinent to almost any subject without meaning a thing .
It 's the ideal oil for the internet 's troubled waters .
I invite you all to join me in doing this .
Let 's drown out the screeching with this peaceful , bland , meaningless psalm to not being constantly consulted .
Wherever that phrase is seen we will remember that the self - appointed abuse - hurlers are few and unrepresentative , as is so often the way with the products of well - meaning democratisation .
I need you all to do this now and for many days to come , particularly at the bottom of my column .
Writing this will have drawn the eyes of the angry upon me .
Without your help , it will have been nothing more than a red rag to their bull .
( CNN ) --
With bachelor parties kicking into high gear and the summer season about to begin , the Foxy Lady wants to be sure that its three locations are fully staffed and prepared to meet their customers ' demands .
So the Providence , Rhode Island , strip club will be holding a job fair to fill 30 positions -- bartenders , waitresses , masseuses and strippers -- according to club manager Bob Travisono .
" We are looking to find a diamond in the rough , " Travisono told CNN .
Based on phone inquiries , Travisono said he 's expecting a large crowd Saturday for the job fair .
" So many people in Rhode Island have been hit hard by the economy that we wanted to do our part , " he said , adding that he could n't think of a better place than the Foxy Lady to find that ideal job .
Rhode Island 's unemployment rate was 10.3 percent in January -- the third - highest in the nation , behind Michigan and South Carolina , and the highest the state has seen in more than 30 years .
Unemployment in the Providence area was at 11.5 percent .
But Travisono said the Foxy Lady 's business " is doing very well " despite a slight dip .
" But nothing major , because people like to drain their sorrow away , " he said .
Applicants for the Foxy Lady 's openings should bring a resume and will have to answer a short questionnaire , he said .

Russia 's state - controlled Sberbank says it has never seen such strong demand for investment coins .
In Australia , the Perth Mint had to suspend new orders for gold coins because it could not keep pace with overseas demand .
And , in America , the US Mint says sales of its one - ounce American Eagle gold bullion coins rocketed by more than 400 per cent to 710,000 ounces in 2008 .
" The demand for gold and silver , " said US Mint spokeswoman Carla Coolman , " has been unprecedented . "
Austria 's Philharmonic , named after the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra , was the world 's best - selling gold coin in the last quarter and sales soared 544 per cent in the first two months of 2009 .
" There is no sign of demand abating , " Austrian Mint 's marketing director Kerry Tattersall said .
Sales this year are expected to exceed 2008 's record levels .
" At present , production is struggling to keep up with demand . "
Hans Dieter Rauch , who sells both collectors ' and investors ' coins in his boutique on Graben , one of Vienna 's most exclusive shopping streets , said revenues rose 300 per cent last year .
" It 's the man in the street , not particularly rich people but normal citizens like you and me , " said Mr Rauch , 65 , monitoring the fluctuating price of gold on a screen in his back room .

Gold hit a record high of $ 1,030.80 ( £ 700 ) an ounce in March 2008 and last month rose back above $ 1,000 .
Jewellery sales by cash - strapped Americans and Europeans have helped to slow the metal 's rise in recent weeks .
The Czech Republic 's Komercni Banka this month added gold coins and bars to its traditional portfolio of products .
Even the Central Bank of Armenia is at it , issuing 10,000 gold coins with a Zodiac signs design .
And , in New Zealand , Michael O'Kane , head bullion trader at the mint , said it was averaging a month 's transactions in a day .
Wealthy investors are more likely to invest in bars than coins as the premium for production costs is lower , said Wolfgang Wrzesniok - Rossbach , head of sales at the precious metals group Heraeus .
" If you buy a kilo bar you have to pay the surcharge for producing the bar , which is pretty low , only once " he said .
" If you buy 30 1 oz coins , which would be about equal to a 1 kilo bar , you have to pay 30 times that amount . "
Coins have the edge for small investors who want flexibility and appreciate their aesthetic allure .
Demand is for more than physical products : in the past few years , gold has been sought after for speculative gains , with interest in gold - backed funds in particular soaring .
But since the financial crisis accelerated last autumn , interest in coins and bars has increased , with investors seeking security rather than profit .
Other manufacturers are reducing output and jobs , but the Royal Canadian Mint quadrupled capacity to produce its bullion gold and silver Maple Leaf coins in late 2008 , and the Austrian Mint is producing in one week what it usually churns out in a month .
It has extended its shifts throughout the night and weekend and recruited more workers to cope with the surge in demand .
Yesterday morning I was sent an article written by Michigan House Representative Paul Opsommer regarding the Department of Homeland Security ’s push to implement Enhanced Drivers ’ Licenses :
The Department of Homeland Security is coming to Detroit to push their new “ Enhanced Drivers License ” ( EDL ) program on Tuesday as a way to make Michigan licenses compliant with the federal Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative ( WHTI ) .
If you do n’t pay to enhance your license , you ’ll need a passport in order to continue going across the Canadian and Mexican borders in June ( you ’ll still need a passport to fly ) .
Opsommer argues that it would make better sense to lower the price of a passport instead of trying to graft the purpose of a passport on to a drivers ’ license .
Then , he gets to the heart of the DHS proposal :
Instead , they ’re offering to “ enhance ” our license by having a security interview , paying more , and then getting a wireless RFID chip in your license .
While the first two requirements seem reasonable , if the part about the wireless RFID chip has you scratching your head , you ’re not the only one .
We already wisely do n’t issue licenses to illegal aliens , but with the enhanced license you have to be able to not just prove your citizenship , but prove it via a wireless chip .
Everyone who applies will have a new unique federal ID number assigned to them in addition to their current Social Security Number .
The wireless chip then carries that new number , which can be wirelessly scanned by common readers up to 30 feet away , even while it ’s still in your wallet .
In theory this will get you through the border faster , but then you are left with an unencrypted chip in your license for the other 12 hours a day you carry it .
He says the following about the privacy implications :
There is currently nothing in the law prohibiting the government from using this to track people away from the border , and also nothing in the law that would prohibit banks , hospitals , hotels , or others from linking you with the number and using it for their own marketing purposes or selling it .
Technically , this technology never tracks people , it only tracks the license .
The assumption is that the license is being carried by the license holder when out in public , thereby being a good proxy for tracking the person .
However , wallets and purses can be left at home , lost , or stolen , at which point the assumption breaks down .
For the sake of argument , let ’s assume that the RFID - chipped license will be carried by the owner 99 % of time .
This is the equivalent of forgetting one ’s license three or four times a year , which is not uncommon for most of the folks I know .
In cases where identity verification is considered critical , such as at a border crossing , a 99 % accuracy rate is n’t good enough .
Therefore , the system is n’t designed to operate by reading the license alone :
Enhanced drivers licenses will make it quicker and easier to cross the border back into the United States because they will contain a vicinity Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) chip that will signal a computer to pull up your biographic and biometric data for the CBP Officer as you pull up to the border , and
a Machine Readable Zone ( MRZ ) or barcode that the CBP officer can read electronically if RFID is n’t available .
If the system is working as designed , it will accurately identify the person carrying the chip only when a person ( or computer ) can compare the features of the holder with the features on file .
In any other case , the identity of the holder can not be known for sure .
That , however , does n’t prevent someone from relying on the assumption that a license is always carried by the license holder and not another person .
This is an important point to make before addressing Opsommer ’s argument about a “ more secure ” form of RFID license .
In his comment above , Opsommer uses the word unencrypted to imply “ less secure ” .
This is not the case .
To fulfill the identification role specified by DHS , the government reader would need to be able to decrypt the encrypted value returned by the chip with no other information .
This requires the use of an encryption algorithm that produces a unique encrypted number for each unencrypted number submitted to it .
The tracking opportunity is the same in either case .
People are running around with unique RFID signatures that can be read from up to 30 feet away .
The first piece of information a would - be tracker would get is the RFID signature .
Once the signature is encountered , the tracker can start gathering information about the holder of the RFID - chipped license .
The interesting thing to consider here is that a third - party tracker piggy - backing on the DHS - sponsored license system would not need to match the ID number to a pre-established identity , meaning the encrypted value is just as useful for third - party tracking as the unencrypted value .
Imagine that a supermarket chain wanted to track its customers using the RFID signature of a drivers ’ license .
They set up a scanner to read in the area where a patron would stand to interact with the checker and read the license every time payment was accepted .
It would be possible to track a patrons buying habits by linking the data saved from the register to the RFID signature .
In the case a club card was used , the drivers ’ license would be linked back to the name on that .
If a check or credit card was used to pay , that financial information could then be linked to the RFID signature .
The store would now have an entire identity built around the unique signature that has nothing to do with the DHS database .
Taking this hypothetical to the next level , imagine that a diverse array of businesses such as banks , hospitals , hotels , casinos , restaurants , and bookstores began employing similar tracking techniques .
Each would build an identity around the unique signature of the chip .
The bank would know one ’s financial habits .
The hospital would know one ’s health problems .
The hotel would know when one visited .
The casino would know when one gambled .
The restaurant would know what one ate .
The bookstore would know what one read .
And the supermarket from before would know what one bought .
At that point , there would be an opportunity for an information clearinghouse to buy tracking data keyed to the unique RFID signature from different sources and build an amazingly detailed profile of the license holder / carrier .
The clearinghouse would know everything from their name , telephone number , and address to the fact that they bought a box of 24 donuts on Tuesday despite having diabetes .
In the extreme , it would be possible for the government itself to leverage the work of the clearinghouse by purchasing the data and crossing it with the DHS database .
This scenario is both technically possible and consistent with previous DHS behavior .
Encryption would make no difference in this case because DHS can already decrypt the RFID signature .
Imagine what the government could do with all that information about how a citizen lives his life ?
Remember that this detailed profile grew out of exposure to a single unique signature .
The businesses doing the tracking started knowing nothing about the person other than the unique number emitted by their RFID - chipped license .
The only measure of safety encrypting the number provides is that the RFID tag could not be used to query the DHS database .
Of course , since one ’s name would be revealed in one of many transactions , even this layer of protection is transitory since the DHS database would contain both name and ID number .
Back to Rep.
Opsommer ’s article , he laments the situation by saying the following :
[ A]t the very least they need to offer enhanced licenses in two varieties , one that has RFID and one that does n’t , and then let taxpayers decide which they want to choose .
DHS has instead chosen a take it or leave it approach that bullies taxpayers with fiscal coercion and a one - size - fits - all policy that does n’t allow Michigan to use more secure forms of RFID or to skip the chips altogether .
Since an EDL will also technically be a limited passport , how the biometric data on the computer system gets shared with the governments of Canada and Mexico is also important .
I would submit to Representative Opsommer that encryption simply does n’t matter .
Any RFID license that can be read without the holder ’s consent is a threat to privacy .
Metallic sleeves and other devices that shield the license are not good enough , since they can be lost or forgotten .
The Ontario government has found a good solution to this problem , though .
They are looking at an Enhanced Drivers ’
License that can be read only when someone holds it a certain way :
Seattle - based RFID chip manufacturer Impinj Inc. has demonstrated a prototype vicinity RFID card with a switch .
The design activates the RFID chip when someone places their finger on the corner of the card .
A mechanical switch – with moving parts – would be too frail , says Kerry Krause , vice - president of marketing at Impinj .
So they took a different approach .
“ With our technology , all you have to do is touch it , ” he says .
“ The tag is only readable when a person is holding the driver ’s licence and pinching it in the right spot .
Your fingers are completing a circuit and turning it on . ”
Such a license offers true privacy , as the person holding it has to take an explicit action for it to be read .
Anything short of this is simply a privacy violation waiting to happen .

* Note that I do n’t mention licenses with changing values .
Temporal encryption , in which the license include a one - time code that was encrypted along with the ID code , the result would be an ever - changing output that could only be correctly comprehended by a system set up to decrypt and process the output .
In a clock - based system such as RSA ’s SecurID , for example , a random code is generated for a specific period of time and then discarded , replaced by a new code .
The clocks on the authentication server and the token are in sync , and the authentication server will confirm that the code generated was correct for the time it was entered .
The disadvantage of using a one - time code is that the license becomes much more complex , increasing cost while decreasing durability .
Also , the centralized authentication servers needed for this model open the door to system - wide shutdowns or privacy breaches since they present a single point of exploitation .
On balance , this option would be more secure , but still not “ safe ” given the chance of a single , large - scale breach of privacy .

Gamers love war simulators .
The chance to virtually step into the shoes of American troops storming Normandy , Iwo Jima , or Sicily is hard to pass up for fans of shooters , but it seems it 's still too early for a similar game based on the Iraq war .
Legendary game publisher Konami has announced that it recently decided to kill its upcoming title " Six Days in Fallujah , " a game based on the famous Iraq battle .
Developed by Atomic Games ( well known by PC gamers for their much - praised Close Combat strategy franchise ) , the game was to follow characters into the Second Battle of Fallujah from a third - person perspective ( similar to Xbox 360's Gears of War ) .
Game Too Intensive
Given Atomic Games ' past commitment to realism in its war games , there 's no doubt that Six Days in Fallujah would have been an immersive , and perhaps for some , disturbing experience .
( Source : theregister.co.uk )
It did n't take long for veterans and the families of troops lost at Fallujah to begin protesting that the game was insensitive and inappropriate given the United States ' continued struggle in Iraq .
In a statement , a representative for Konami announced , " After seeing the reaction to the videogame in the United States and hearing opinions sent through phone calls and email , we decided several days ago not to sell it ...
We had intended to convey the reality of the battles to players so that they could feel what it was like to be there . "
Cancellation " A Shame "
Game critics , including PC World 's Matt Peckham , feel Six Days in Fallujah 's cancellation is a shame .
Peckham feels that it could have been an incredible title and should not have been abandoned a year prior to its release .
Of course , it makes sense that if Konami was concerned about bad press , it 's better to have killed it now rather than after months of development and marketing .
( Source : pcworld.com )
Peckham 's main problem is that the game seems to have attracted more negative attention that other media based on Iraq .
HBO 's " Generation Kill " often portrayed the men fighting the war in Iraq as less than savoury individuals , something Six Days in Fallujah almost certainly would have avoided .
Guilty Unless Proven Innocent
Those who have played other war titles , including Call of Duty or Medal of Honor , will note that games more often than not bestow great respect upon troops and commanders .
There 's little wiggle room for critical political commentary when one is pinned down by a ( virtual ) enemy .
That 's all besides the fact that gamers tend to learn more about historical events like Normandy and Operation Market Garden from the games they truly enjoy than the textbooks and high school lectures that put them to sleep .
Maybe , just maybe , we 're not supposed to know more about the war in Iraq .
In the end , we have a title killed long before anyone even took the time to play it .
That 's a lot like finding someone , or something , guilty before proven innocent .
Sony is a company which is not exactly loved by technologists , despite the fact it has come up with some damn fine technology – with my personal favourite being the MiniDisc format .
The problem with Sony has always been that it was stuck in the old ways of doing things ( proprietary , closed , DRM ) , and of course things like the rootkit scandal did n’t help either .
It seems like things are about to change , with Sony ’s CEO announcing a new direction for the company – focussed on openness .
Sony ’s CEO , Howard Stringer , consolidated his position of power earlier this year by also assuming the role of president of the company .
In an interview with Nikkei Electronics Asia , Stringer makes some very open mea culpa comments .
It ’s an interesting interview .
Understanding customers
A quote that really struck me as evidence of common sense has to do with understanding customers .
“ We have to become a company that can open the window and say , ‘ Look , we do n’t just design technology because we love technology .
We design technology because we understand that our customers are different , ' ” he said , “ We can no longer say that we ’re right and our customers are wrong .
We ca n’t build only what we want to build . ”
Those are pretty interesting words coming out of a Sony CEO .
Gaming of course also makes its appearance .
The Playstation 3 simply is n’t doing as well as the competition ; I know countless people with XBox 360s and Wiis , but I know only one with a PS3 , and he only has one because he received it as a gift when he switched mobile phone contracts .
The PS3 is expensive and difficult to program for , which has hindered its adoption as a gaming platform , making it lag behind the Wii and the XBox 360 .
Stringer admits that , and hints that understanding customers , and finding what he calls “ hidden customers ” is very important .
“ Understanding customers will also help us uncover hidden customers .
The Wii from Nintendo Co Ltd of Japan is an excellent example .
They did n’t develop any unique technology ; they just realized that there was potential demand out there for something different from conventional games , and thought about how to satisfy different demands from different age groups , ” he explained , “ They attained results that the PS3 has n’t ; namely , generating profit from hardware sales . ”
Even though the XBox 360 does n’t seem to be making Microsoft any profits either , hardware - wise , it does ship far more units than the PS3 .
When asking around the gaming - inclined part of my group of friends , they all say the same : they ’d love to buy a PS3 , but they ca n’t justifiy the price difference between Sony ’s gaming rig and the XBox 360 .
Wii owners are obviously a group apart .
Openness
If there is one word that summarises Sony , it ’s “ proprietary ” .
Stringer looks back upon the competition with Apple , and states that had Sony embraced openness , it would ’ve beaten the Cupertino company .
“ Sony has n’t taken open technology very seriously in the past .
Its CONNECT music download service was a failure .
It was based on OpenMG , a proprietary digital rights management ( DRM ) technology .
At the time , we thought we would make more money that way than with open technology , because we could manage the customers and their downloads , ” Stringer said , “ This approach , however , created a problem : customers could n’t download music from any Websites except those that contracted with Sony .
If we had gone with open technology from the start , I think we probably would have beaten Apple Inc of the US . ”
Openness is not the only area where Sony should ’ve taken a different path in its competition with Apple .
Sony ’s software has always been a total disaster ( and I ’m being kind here , because I ’m in a good mood ) , and Stringer acknowledges that a good user interface is just as important as a good price and openness .
Moving back to openness , Stringer claims that Sony is transforming from a closed system to an open one .
He also believes that it does n’t matter how many open technologies , content , and services there are to choose from .
He tells the tale of a time when he worked at a US TV network , right around the time cable and satellite were introduced .
There were only three nationwide US networks back then , and executives of those stated that three was more than enough , that customers could n’t handle more choice .
“ I was about 40 then , ” he recalls , “ And raised my hand to speak : “ That ’s not true , ” I said .
“ The customer will always like choice .
While it ’s better for broadcasters if the world stays the same – that there will always be three networks – it ’s going to change . ”
Four weeks later I was made an unexpected job offer .
I was hired as president , replacing the man who had given the speech .
If I had kept my mouth shut , I would have remained a journalist .
And of course cable TV , satellite broadcasting and the like did develop , just as I ’d anticipated . ”
Whether or not Sony will actually make the transition it needs to make in order to stay relevant in the content business remains to be seen , but it seems as if Stringer at least has his brain in the right place .
I ’ve personally never had a bad experience with Sony , and very much like the various Sony products I own , but I do realise that the company needs to make some serious changes in its attitudes towards its customers .
Last month after reading up on the Obama Administration ’s new “ Making Home Affordable ” refinance program , I decided to look into it for our household .
We ’re sitting on a 6.5 % 30 year fixed rate mortgage right now , and we ’d like very much to be able to refinance that loan into a lower APR .
With rates this low , who would n’t ?
If you ’re interested in finding out more about the program , check out these links :
Making Sure We Were Eligible For Making Home Affordable Refinance Program
We went to the government ’s website first , to see if we were in fact eligible for the program .
After going through the steps there we found that we were .
Next we checked to see who owned / backed our loan , and it turns out we have a Freddie Mac loan .
We were hoping it was a Fannie Mae loan , because that would mean that we could refinance with another lender , and with Freddie Mac you have to refinance with the original loan servicer .
In other words , you have to refinance with the same company .
Trying To Get Refinance Information – The First Time
Next , I got the special “ Making Home Affordable ” refinance program phone number off of the Countrywide Home Loans website ( now Bank Of America Home Loans ) .
I was n’t expecting much from them as I had called a few months earlier to look into my refinancing options , but they wanted to charge us in excess of $ 7000 in closing costs and fees , and on top of that we had to have an appraisal done and we probably would have had PMI added back onto our loan .
That made it a non-starter .
I called the refinance hotline and was quickly transferred to a “ mortgage specialist ” who was supposed to talk to me about our refinance options .
Problem was , the phone line after the transfer was n’t any good and I could n’t hear the agent talking at all .
She got my number and said she would call me back .
So I waited , and waited .
She never called me back .
I went on twitter and talked about how I was getting the run-around , and how my lender had never called me back .
Several people fired right back that they had similar experiences .
Some were getting the run around , while others had their loan servicers feigning ignorance when talk of the “ Making Home Affordable ” plan came up .
I gave up on getting more info that night , and decided to follow up the following week .
Trying To Get Refinance Information – The Second Time
Over the weekend I started talking with an extremely helpful mortgage twitter user , @mortgagereports .
I came away with the impression that doing a refinance for a Freddie Mac home loan would not be as easy as a Fannie Mae loan .
They tend to be more restrictive , and thus far their documentation for the HARP program is n’t very helpful for the lenders .
Because of that people are running into problems doing refinances .
After confirming that I would have to refinance through my current servicer , Countrywide Home Loans , @mortgagereports said he would try to hook me up with a contact he had at Countrywide , “ on the inside ” !
He thought his friend might be more helpful than the customer service hacks I had talked to before .
I talked with his contact at Countrywide and he was in fact a lot more helpful .
After doing some initial paperwork we discovered that we would be eligible to do a refinance and lower our rate to about 5.125 % , with closing costs coming in at around $ 3000 ( plus pre-paid interest , taxes and other escrowed items ) .
This is about the same deal that we had gotten months before , but the fact that we had to pay PMI at that time meant we did n’t go through with it .
Because of the Making Home Affordable refinance program , this time we would not have to start paying PMI , even though our equity has dropped below the 80/20 loan to value ratio .
We were getting ready to go through with doing the refinance when something happened that stopped us in our tracks .
Another Stay In The Hospital ..
And Hospital Bills
Around the time that we were about to sign on the dotted line to do the refinance , my wife found out that she was going to need to have surgery for a medical issue that was discoverd during a doctor ’s visit .
She was scheduled for , and had the surgery .
She stayed in the hospital for several days while she was recuperating .
Thank God everything turned out pretty well .
As most of you know hospital stays are not cheap , even when you have insurance .
We discovered that fact last year when my wife was in the hospital for a month and we racked up over $ 250,000 in medical bills .
Thankfully we only had to pay a bit over $ 2000 .
Thank God for insurance .
We are now expecting to have medical bills coming in the mail again ( and they have already started coming in ) , so we decided to hold off on the refinance for now .
At least until we got all of our medical bills paid off , and enough saved up to pay for the closing costs .
We decided to refinance after some time went by .
Details here : My Experience
With the HARP program : Part 2
Are You Refinancing ?
Are you in the middle of doing a refinance , either through the Making Home Affordable Program , or otherwise ?
I ’m curious how it ’s going for you ( or how it went ? ) .
Was it a smooth process , and did you get the rate you were looking for ?
Did you have to pay a lot of fees ?
Tell us about it in the comments !
History Is Clear More fiat money wo n’t solve this crisis ; a return to sounder money will

It is often said  there are no atheists in a foxhole . 
The other week , as world financial markets melted down , CNBC go - to wise man Art Cashen put a market spin on that familiar line drolly saying ,  there are no libertarians in a market crash . 
The crusty Cashen is certainly right for the most part .
Plenty of financial talking heads who argue for free markets and smaller government on a daily basis suddenly screamed that government must intervene to save capitalism .
Of course , the idea that government must print multiple blizzards worth of money to save a system where individuals and businesses trade with each other unfettered makes as much sense as presidents who claim that war must be waged to protect the peace . 
The fact is that what we ’ve been enjoying since the Federal Reserve was created is anything but free - market capitalism .
The value of the dollar has been pushed down 99 percent and the economy has been a series of booms , followed by busts , ad nausea since J.P. Morgan partner Harry Davidson and other big bank chieftains secretly took a train to go duck hunting on Jekyll Island in 1910 .
Of course , the ducks were safe , but Americans since have paid the price for the Federal Reserve System idea that was hatched that weekend .
As historian Gabriel Kolko wrote :  The entire banking reform movement , at all crucial stages , was centralized in the hands of a few men who for years were linked , ideologically and personally , with one another … the major function , inspiration and direction of the measure [ the Federal Reserve Act ] was to serve the banking community in general , and large bankers specifically . 
The TV pragmatists probably forget that Karl Marx and Frederick Engels wrote in The Communist Manifesto that creating a centralization of credit in the hands of the state , by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly  should be near the top of any communist ’s agenda .
Is it any wonder that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’s plan has morphed into the federal government taking equity stakes in banks , mortgage companies and at least one insurance company ?
As Oscar B. Johannsen wrote :  A socialized banking system is the precursor of socialism in all business . 
( By the time you read this , airlines and car manufacturers may be partially owned by the government ) .
But the level of economic knowledge displayed in main street print or on TV has dropped lower than the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
Economist and historian Tom DiLorenzo got an earful on MSNBC ’s  Morning Joe program recently from former Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan who admonished DiLorenzo :  How could you criticize Hamilton ?
He ’s the architect of the American economy !
DiLorenzo ’s new book Hamilton ’s Curse shows us that Buchanan and other Alexander Hamilton apologists have it all wrong .
 Hamilton was an enemy of free - market capitalism and early America ’s foremost proponent of mercantilism , the system of government - granted monopolies , corporate welfare , protectionist tariffs and other policies that generally benefited politically connected businesses at the expense of the rest of society ,  DiLorenzo explains .
As Lew Rockwell points out , the real cause of the current financial crisis can be summed up with two words : fiat money .
The word fiat means , out of nothing .
And since 1971 , when Nixon proclaimed ,  We are all Keynesians now and severed the last link that tied the dollar to gold , the amount of dollars created by the Fed out of nothing has grown over 10 times as measured by M - 2 ( from $ 685 billion in August 1971 to $ 7.7 trillion in August 2008 ) .
As if all this past monetary expansion was n’t enough , the Fed is now working overtime , in concert with the world ’s other central banks , to create what investor Jim Rogers told a foreign CNBC audience will be a monetary holocaust . 
Rogers did n’t make any friends with others on Wall Street with those comments .
As Rockwell points out :  The best way to fall out of favor with the regime — or its pseudo - libertarian and neocon supporters — is to question its central bankers . 
But , history is clear , more fiat money wo n’t solve this crisis ; a return to sounder money will .

There was a lectern set up behind home plate at Dodger Stadium on Thursday , just as it was nine months ago , when Manny Ramirez was ceremoniously introduced to Los Angeles .
Only this time , Dodgers Manager Joe Torre was standing there , looking into a wall of television cameras and recalling how Ramirez sounded “ devastated ” when they spoke earlier in the day .
General Manager Ned Colletti said he felt “ sick and saddened . ”
Ramirez , the All - Star outfielder who revitalized a once - proud franchise mired in mediocrity and coined the term “ Mannywood , ” had become the most famous player to be suspended under the drug policy implemented by baseball in 2004 .
Testing positive in spring training for a female fertility drug that is used by steroid users to restore testosterone production to normal levels , the 36 - year - old Ramirez received a 50 - game ban , costing him $ 7.7 million of his $ 25 - million salary and the Dodgers a potent middle - of - the - lineup bat that took them to their first National League Championship Series in 20 years .
Ramirez , who was replaced on the active roster by minor league call - up Xavier Paul , is eligible to return July 3 .
“ It ’s sort of like somebody punching a hole in the balloon , ” Torre said .
The Times was the first to report Ramirez ’s suspension on its website Thursday morning .
Ramirez was nowhere to be seen before , during or after a loss to the Washington Nationals , which ended the Dodgers ’ home winning streak at 13 .
The only public statement made by Ramirez was in a news release issued by the players ’ union .
Ramirez blamed the test result on medication prescribed to him by a doctor for a “ personal health issue . ”
He did not disclose the medication , doctor or health issue .
“ He gave me a medication , not a steroid , which he thought was OK to give me , ” Ramirez said in the statement .
“ Unfortunately , the medication was banned under our drug policy .
Under the policy , that mistake is now my responsibility .
I have been advised not to say anything more for now . ”
The medication in question was human chorionic gonadotropin , or HCG , according to a source familiar with the situation not authorized to publicly discuss the issue .
A high - ranking sports doping authority said HCG could legitimately be prescribed for a man who does not naturally produce enough testosterone , but BALCO founder and convicted steroid dealer Victor Conte said it is often used to replenish testosterone levels at the end of a cycle of steroid treatments
HCG is one of dozens of substances prohibited under baseball ’s policy .
Players can call a hotline to check the legality of any substance and can get a therapeutic - use exemption for any legitimate medical use of a banned substance .
An appeal hearing was scheduled for Wednesday -- baseball ’s top lawyer , Rob Manfred , flew from New York to Los Angeles the previous day -- but sources said Ramirez dropped the appeal on the advice of his agent , Scott Boras .
Ramirez noted in the statement that he had passed “ around 15 " drug tests over the last five years .
He also issued a widespread apology .
“ L.A. is a special place to me and I know everybody is disappointed , ” he said .
“ So am I . I ’m sorry about this whole situation . ”
Torre described Ramirez ’s remorse as sincere .
“ The thing that was toughest for Manny is how he disappointed everyone , ” Torre said .
Colletti said the Dodgers would stand behind Ramirez and applauded the way he handled the matter .
“ Whenever somebody makes a mistake and they accept responsibility . . . are contrite , it ’s a plus , ” Colletti said .
“ And that ’s what Manny did today .
Had he dismissed it or acted like it was somebody else ’s fault , I ’d really have a tough time with it .
But that he takes ownership of what transpired speaks to the man . . . that ’s not bad . . . that ’s part of being human . ”
Torre and Colletti said they did n’t learn of the situation until owner Frank McCourt called them after midnight the previous night .
Asked by The Times after Wednesday night ’s game whether they had heard that Ramirez was about to be suspended , Torre and Colletti denied knowing anything .
A source close to Ramirez said Ramirez ’s agent had informed Torre of the matter before Wednesday ’s game , a claim the manager denied .
Ramirez was taken out of the lopsided game in the seventh inning and was n’t in the locker room when reporters came in .
Until Torre and Colletti addressed reporters at the 4:30 p.m. news conference , the Dodgers limited their comments on the matter to a short statement by McCourt ’s wife that was e-mailed to reporters .
At 3:10 p.m. , a sign was posted on the door of the Dodgers ’ clubhouse that read , “ Clubhouse closed . ”
Inside , the Dodgers held a team meeting .
“ It was somber , ” right fielder Andre Ethier said .
Players said they were surprised to learn that Ramirez had flunked a drug test -- to a certain extent .
“ It ’s to the point where nothing shocks you , ” Doug Mientkiewicz said .
Last week , Mientkiewicz answered questions regarding steroid allegations involving his former high school teammate , New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez .
Rodriguez , the game ’s highest - paid player , acknowledged during a February news conference that he used steroids from 2001 to 2003 .
The admission followed a Sports Illustrated report that he failed a drug test in 2003 , when players were not subject to suspension .
Torre said Ramirez ’s standing in the game should n’t be affected .
“ It does n’t change my view of his accomplishments as a player , ” Torre said .
“ What I learned is how hard he works .
He spends a lot of time practicing his trade . ”
Nationals first base coach Marquis Grissom , who played with Ramirez in Cleveland in 1997 , shared the same view .
“ He ’s been great since the first time I laid eyes on him , ” Grissom said , adding that Ramirez “ no doubt ” belongs in the Hall of Fame .
Torre said he reminded his players they ’d have to win without Ramirez .
“ This is a man ’s game , ” Torre said .
Mientkiewicz agreed .
“ This is a team , ” Mientkiewicz said .
“ This is n’t the Los Angeles Mannys . ”
Ethier said it would be important for the players to not try too hard to compensate for Ramirez ’s absence .
“ I think if we put too much of a chip on our shoulders , we could start pressing , ” said Ethier , who inherited Ramirez ’s role as the No. 3 hitter .
First baseman James Loney said he wanted to see Ramirez back in the clubhouse .
While serving his suspension , Ramirez can work out with the team but must be out of uniform by the start of the game .
Torre said Ramirez wanted to clear his mind before deciding where he would prepare himself for his return .
Ramirez was planning to return to his home in Miami for at least a few days , according to a source in his camp .
Also uncertain was whether the Dodgers would use the money saved on Ramirez during his suspension to sign a free - agent pitcher such as Pedro Martinez , Ben Sheets or Paul Byrd .
Because Ramirez agreed to be paid only $ 10 million this season -- the other $ 15 million was to be deferred -- the Dodgers are saving just $ 3.1 million this year .
Ramirez can exercise a $ 20 - million option for 2010 .

International Business Machines Corp. is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems Inc. in a combination that would bolster IBM's heft on the Internet , in data storage and in government and telecommunications areas , according to people familiar with the matter .
The two companies have a common interest in that both make computer systems for corporate customers that are n't reliant on Microsoft Corp . 's Windows software or Intel Corp.'s microprocessor technologies .

A few weeks ago one of my daughter 's friends was swept out to sea off the California coast .
This happened a couple months after one of the upper classmen on the high school football team dropped dead from a blood clot to the lung while walking between math and science class , and before the freshman girl committed suicide .
I had just found out the guy had gone missing because it was in the newspaper .
The blonde haired girl came to me with the San Jose Mercury .
" Have you seen this ? " she asked .
I had n't .
" This is the guy your daughter had a crush on for the past 3 years .
She used to sit on the sofa in front of the TV staring at her cell , hoping he'd invite her to the movies or a school dance . "
" I did n't know that . "
" No , you did n't . "
I went to work in the attic to install some lighting and discovered two switches had been wired badly by the prior owner .
Somewhere the black and white wires had been crossed and it was causing me problems with the new in - ceiling lighting I was trying to install .
I had to crawl back out of the attic and go over to the garage to hit a circuit breaker .
Stepping off the ladder I almost ran into my daughter who was waiting for me , quietly .
She asked , " Dad , do you have any wire ? "
I have a lot of wire .
Call me Mr. Wire .
" What kind of wire do you need , honey ? "
" We want to put a memorial poster on the beach and we do n't want it to blow away so we want to tie it to some rocks with wire . "
I looked at the sign they had made .
It was a piece of white cardboard with the words painted , " We love you Dennis . "
There were hearts on it .
They had glued pictures of the boy to it , and pictures of themselves .
A bunch of kids had signed it .
My daughter 's eyes were misty but her voice was steady .
I told her I had wire but my mind spiraled around the thought that when I was a kid , kids did n't die .
Ozzie and Harriet did n't divorce .
What had I done to my children ?
Why did my kid have to go through this trial when I had it so easy ?
How to take this burden from her shoulders ?
I found a spool of bailing wire in the garage .
I showed my daughter how to use a lineman 's pliers to cut the wire and twist it firm .
She watched me quietly .
Asked no questions .
She took the wire and the pilers and the sign and got into a car full of kids headed to the beach where Dennis was last seen alive .
They were not smiling and hooting .
It was less a car full of teenagers than a carload of senior citizens heading to the clinic for injections .
I went back to work on the house wiring as fast as I could .
Deep in the attic amid the insulation and wiring a man can shut off his headlamp and not be seen .
Sometime later , while crawling on my hands and knees through a particularly narrow part of the attic I decided it was a good time to cry .
I did n't go through with it , at first .
This is what I told myself I was thinking : I was calculating how to get my hands and knees on the ceiling joists so I did n't fall through the ceiling into the living room .
Then the image of my daughter 's face came into my mind .
Then I was too weak to stop it .
Sometimes I am not a very strong man .
" She told me she 'd had a crush on him since grammar school , " said the blonde haired girl about my daughter .
She was making dinner in the kitchen .
I was unloading the dishwasher .
My daughter was still at the beach putting up signs for the boy who was swept out to sea .
" Did they go out ? "
" He never knew . "
" So he was n't her boyfriend .
Just a friend . "
" Sometimes I think there 's a glimmer of hope that you actually understand women .
But then you say something like that . "
" I 'm glad she was at her mother 's birthday party and not at the beach party with the rest of them .
I doubt she would have tried swimming in that surf , but to have been there when the guy disappeared .
That 's the kind of thing that really damages someone . "
" I 'm not sure it makes much difference right now . "
" I think I need to be cut a break . "
" If you keep talking nonsense ... "
" When I was a kid we were all immortal .
We did all sorts of stupid things : we drove like idiots , we climbed rotten trees , we went into abandoned buildings , we swam during hurricanes , I actually went scuba diving during a lightning storm - that should have killed us , but it did n't happen .
All those bad things happen other places to other people .
How come my kid can't have that kind of childhood ? "
" I do n't know . "
" Nobody knows , " I said , " and I 'm getting sick and tired of nobody knowing anything . "
I broke a glass , then .
I was n't intending to , but my body made the point my mind was screaming .
My father was a glass man .
He ran factories that made bottles in the back yonder when things came wrapped in brittle glass , and not flexible hydrocarbonized envelopes .
The first plastic bottles promised " UNBREAKABLE " , and when my mother brought home a soft drink so packaged , I tossed it to the kitchen floor , upon which it exploded under pressure spewing froth from wall to wall .
" But it said ... "
I said , because we were glass people in a glass house .
She handed me a towel .
It took me hours to clean it .
My father told me , " Glass is a liquid , " because even when it hardened , it flowed on a geological time scale .
Stained glass windows in ancient churches were thicker at the bottom than the top .
These things happened , even though we did n't see them .
Puddles of glass that were our bottles and watch crystals will greet our future distant progeny .
My father made mayonnaise jars and soda bottles .
He would pick up any glass container he saw and make a recitation about it .
He would flip over the mayo jar , look at the markings on the bottom , and tell you the name of the company that made it , and on which date .
I believe that from years of listening to him opine on things glassine , I still can , too .
And when the blonde - haired girl comes home I tell her these things about my father and me .
I point to our flowing glass house windows , and the gentle flow of the virgin olive oil container , structured from glass ( not plastic ) blown somewhere in Sicily , birth home of my grandfather .
I hope these information morsels can make my memories real to her .
So she can think of them as I do , and perhaps she could think of me as my mother still thinks of my father in the lost decade of the mind .
" Midland glass company , " I tell her , upside down mayo jar in hand .
" They 're still around .
See this ?
Glass .
Not plastic . "
She grabs my wrist and twists the jar upright , too late - the top falls from the jar and it emits a blob of mayo to splatter upon our kitchen floor .
" Do n't dump the condiments , " she says .
" You clean that , now . "
" I was just reading the bottom of that jar . "
" Great .
Can you make sure the lid is screwed on tight before you do it again ? "
" Not many people can tell you what the marks mean on jar bottoms . "
She hands me a wet rag .
As I commence to clean I explain , " It 's a lost art . "
" Not very useful , " she says .
" Art does n't need to be useful . "
" Do you want pasta or soup for dinner ? "
" This is something I can do .
You never know when it will come in handy . "
" Chicken or lentil ? "
" So we 've already decided - soup ? "
" Can you go get the bag of lentils out of the pantry ? "
" There are many reasons to love me , you know .
I 'm a plethora of lovability . "
" All the soup bowls are in the dishwasher . "
When I 'm sad I think this way .
I do normal things and my mind erupts into bad poetry .
These words in my head while I walk in the dark , trying to escape myself .
I think :
My love , I wear your Petzl at night .
We walk in the grass on the mountainside , me and the dog .
This is the dirt trail that leads to the summit .
The dog can see quite well , but I am night blind and helpless without your Petzl .
The eyes of forest animals reflect the headlight .
Mostly green , sometimes red - but mostly green .
The eyes of the deer .
Feral cats .
Raccoons .
Ocular doublets , animated plant light , frozen to camouflage as part of the inanimate universe .
Fear not for it is I , man vulnerable .
Unable to suss the rocks and pits in the ground I am prey without my technical head - mounted contrivance .
Though , assuming my position at the top of the food chain , I take my right to violate this space with my prosthetic sun , thus I freeze the forest inhabitants as if they were the abductees of UFO aliens .
Then on the dirt trail before me , glints of crystalline blue .
Brilliant blue like fractured cobalt glass .
Deep blue - a careless hiker 's gems knocked loose from the setting .
Droplets of liquid electricity .
Then close , these are eyes staring upward into my beam .
A tiny brain cogitates .
A couple of neural bits at most have taken hold in a non-mammalian carbonized automation .
Even the dirt is intelligent , it seems .
Until closer I see the wolf spider .
When I hear a good song I think of my children and whether I could convince them to like it .
I would share with them the times I spent tapping my fingers on the steering wheel , traffic bound , driving to work or school or home .
Flipping toll quarters from down rolled windows ( when windows were rolled , and not button - pushed ) daydreaming of the future when everything would track through the greased grooves I 'd laid as a young man and they would benefit from the fruit of my labor .
Inching through summer traffic on the Garden State Parkway , in my faded blue Mercury Marquis , back when paint faded and cars rusted , when computers were only ownable by corporations and states , and man had walked on the moon , I was a the guy who wondered who they would be .
When I hear a good song I become part of the historical record .
And I explain to my children how things were different then than they are now - and I would leave out all the parts about how I wished for time to pass quickly to get to the parts of life where stress and strife were minimized by the benefit of experience .
How I would get to the " when , " when things would be better , then .
And they would enjoy and become part of that history and like the songs I like for the same reasons , and sing along in tone - driven ecstasy , marking life with the same music , and the same movies and books .
This is what I have left .
These memories of these songs on endless drives between obligations .
They would see me with eyes shining
and love the things I love .
So there would be no choice .
They 'd have to love me , then .
" Let me hug you again , " I say to my daughter .
" Dad ... " she says in that condescending , correcting voice you get from teenagers who want to explain to you that it is highly improbable that you understand them .
But she does n't pull away from me .
" I have to get all my hugs in before my arms fall off .
You just have to put up with it . "
" People 's arms do n't fall off just because they get old . "
" Mine might .
Did you put up your sign ? "
" Yes .
Thanks for the wire . "
" Did you put the lineman 's pliers back in the tool box ? "
" Yes . "
" Ok , let me hug you some more .
I feel my arms coming off . "
" Daaaad . "
I chose electronics for my career because I was n't a good enough writer or musician to starve for my art .
The basis of electronics , these days , is silicon .
It used to be germanium and selenium and various other inorganic compounds .
Now it 's silicon .
We in the silicon business like to say we 're in the sand business , because sand is silicon dioxide and most electronics parts start off as sand that gets melted down and turned into crystal boules that get cut into wafers , have circuits printed onto them , then diced and packaged for insertion into iPods .
And it 's cool to suggest we are magicians who take the beach sand you wash from the lining of your bathing suit and turn it into satellite receivers .
But it 's actually sort of true .
I remember walking through the glass factory with my father , watching orange globs of molten glass drop from pipes in the ceiling into molds that turned them into mayo jars and coke bottles .
The molten glass came from furnaces heated to thousands of degrees by massive electric coils .
" What are you melting in there ? " I asked my dad .
He could barely hear me over the din of the factory - churning greased gears , conveyor belts , and high - pressure air .
" Mostly sand .
Glass is made from sand . "
For my 50th birthday the blonde haired girl and my children surprised me with a dinner at a fancy California restaurant .
We ate strange foods like bacon ice cream and basil foam .
I poured wine for my under - aged daughters , because at 50 , even in America a man is able to do that without fear .
" How do you hold the wine glass ? " my middle daughter asked me .
So I explained how white wine was different from red , and that the serving temperatures were different , and white wine glasses should be held by the base or stem so the heat from the hand does n't warm it up , while red wine glasses are larger and bowl - like and you could cup them in the palm so the aromas hit the nose .
And she accepted what I said without comment , trying out the wine holding procedures I outlined .
" I never know these things , " she said .
" Well , you 're young and you have to learn .
That 's what you do when you 're a kid .
You ask questions and people tell you things .
I have a lot of things to tell you if you 're interested . "
" Yes , we know , " said my youngest , sarcastically .
" Did I tell you that when he was young my father used to make glass bottles ? "
I said , keeping up with the whole glass motif .
" Yes , Dad .
A hundred times . "
" Did I tell you that glass is made from sand and sand is also what we make electronics out of ? "
" Really ? "
" It 's true . "
My oldest said , " I do n't think any of us are going into a glass business , though . "
I said , " That 's ok .
You will all do your own thing . "
" Dad , " said my middle daughter , " the side view mirror is coming off my car and the car place said it would cost $ 300 to fix it , but my friend told me you could buy one of those for $ 60 and put it on yourself . "
" That 's probably true .
It 's always cheaper if you do it yourself . "
" Well , I wish I knew how to do that . "
" I can show you if you want . "
" If I get a new mirror can I come over and you can show me how to put it on ? "
" Yes of course .
Please come over soon .
We can work on it together . "
" This bacon ice cream tastes weird . "
" Did you know glass was a liquid like water ?
Only it 's really thick , like ultra - thick pancake syrup . "
" No .
How can that be ? "
" It 's true .
And did you know that some spiders have blue eyes ?
Check it out . "
" I do n't think ... "
" And did you know that song you were humming to in the car on the way over is by David Byrne ? "
" Yeah . "
" And did you know before that song he had a band called the Talking Heads ? "
" Dad , you do n't have to tell us everything tonight . "
" But I have to tell you everything .
Before my arms fall off . "
" Dad , nobody 's arms fall off . "
" My father 's did .
And now he can't hug me anymore . "
" Dad .. . "

Police Dash Cam , February 27/09:A Fort Worth police officer who crashed his patrol car last month was driving 100 mph shortly before it overturned , according to video from the dashboard camera .
Officer T. Horne was on his way to help another officer who was n’t answering his radio when he lost control on Bridge Street at about 8:30 p.m. on Feb. 27 .
The video , obtained under the Texas Open Records Law , shows the officer reached 99 mph as he approached a group of cars , then slowed to pass them .
Then , as he was about to pass another car , he topped out at 100 mph and lost control , the video shows .
Horne was rushed to a hospital , but was not seriously injured .
There are no policies limiting how fast officers can drive on the way to an emergency , but police will review the crash to see if the officer was at fault .
"
If so , he will face some sort of discipline , " Lt. Paul Henderson said .
Bob Herbert : Doubling troops in Afghanistan a ' terrible idea ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday January 14 , 2009
Print This Email This With Barack Obama signaling his intention to keep much of Bush 's war team in place , observers like MSNBC's Rachel Maddow are starting to wonder whether anything is really likely to change .
In Afghanistan , Obama is planning to nearly double the number of US ground troops but , says , Maddow , " It is unclear exactly why he is doing that -- and what his long - term intentions are . "
New York Times columnist Bob Herbert also believes that widening the war in Afghanistan as the US hovers on the brink of depression is a terrible idea .
Herbert wrote last week , " What Mr. Obama doesnt need , and what the U.S. cannot under any circumstances afford , is any more unnecessary warfare .
And yet , while we havent even figured out how to extricate ourselves from the disaster in Iraq , Mr. Obama is planning to commit thousands of additional American troops to the war in Afghanistan , which is already more than seven years old and which long ago turned into a quagmire . "
" Get out of it as quickly as you can , " Herbert told Maddow on Tuesday when asked how you deal with a quagmire .
" I think this is a terrible idea , doubling the troops in Afghanistan , " Herbert went on .
" It reminds me very much of Jack Kennedy coming into office in 1961 and we had advisers in Vietnam .
We should have learned the lesson of the French in Indo - China -- we did n't .
We should have learned the lesson , in this case , of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan -- we apparently have n't . "
" How are we going to pay for this escalation ? " Herbert asked .
" Who 's going to fight this war ?
The troops who are going to be going into Afghanistan in many cases have already served two , three , four , or more tours in combat zones in Afghanistan and Iraq . "
Herbert acknowledged that the US still has an interest in preventing terrorists from establishing a safe haven in Afghanistan , but he insisted , " We need to expand our intelligence efforts and we need to focus on not allowing terrorists to develop plans to attack the United States -- not on nation - building . "
" At some point , we have to get over this idea of these foreign military adventures , " Herbert concluded .
" We have to wind it down in Iraq .
...
We need to wind it down in Afghanistan .
...
We 've got to bring it down and then have a discussion on how to go forward -- not ratchet it up and then decide what we 're going to do . "

ROUGHLY handled , and incompetently stunned , terrified animals may awaken several times before they are slaughtered .
Some have their throats slit fully conscious .
Europe 's industrial farms dispatch 1 m sheep , cattle and pigs every day .
You cannot cater to the welfare of a large animal like a pig when the line must kill five in a minute .
If the European Parliament were really interested in animal welfare , then it might look rather more closely at the farming industry that the European Union so lavishly rewards with subsidies .
But it has more pressing business .
On May 5th MEPs , suddenly disgusted by the cruelty of people far away hunting seals , voted to endorse a ban on the trade of seal products , most of which come from Canada .
Their hypocritical recommendation , which still has to be approved by the European Commission and Council , is n't even much good for the seals .
Bash it on the head , quick
Every year , 300,000 seals meet their end not by mauling from a polar bear , but instantaneously from gunshot or a blow from a club .
Four years ago the WWF , an environmental organisation , commissioned an independent vet 's report which concluded that seal clubbing is not cruel if it is properly done by competent and trained professionals .
The report judged that the Canadian hunt was professional and highly regulated .
And the vets said that popular horror of the seal hunt seemed to be based largely on emotion and on images that are difficult even for experienced observers to interpret .
By the grim standards of Europe 's farrowing sheds , millions of seals enjoy a blissful life fishing and breeding on the Canadian ice .
At least Canadian seals have the luxury of being stunned before they die .
Compassion in World Farming , a lobby group , says that half the sheep killed in France are conscious when their throats are slit .
Such treatment is possible through a loophole that allows for religious slaughter — a loophole that the same champions of animal welfare in the European Parliament voted to avoid closing on May 7th .
A few seals are killed to protect fish , others as a source of blubber or food .
Most are indeed killed for their fur .
That may not be to everyone 's taste , but it is hardly unEuropean .
Europe 's fur farms produce over 30 m mink and fox pelts a year .
Every four or five days Europe kills more animals for their fur than the entire annual Canadian hunt does in a year .
Seal hunting sounds unfair ; but Europeans are reluctant to ban the hunting of similarly defenceless game birds , deer or wild boar .
A ban on the seal hunt would spare individual seals , but it may not do much for the seal population as a whole .
When wildlife cannot be traded , it loses its value and thus the incentive for people to conserve it .
Today the hunters exploiting the seals have an excellent reason to maintain a healthy and growing population .
A trade ban would mean that the management or maintenance of a wild population becomes just another drain on resources .
Sometimes ecotourism pays the bills , but it works only in places that are easy for tourists to get to .
Why did the European Parliament overlook all this ?
Seal - murdering foreigners are a soft target and animal - welfare groups have been lobbying MEPs for years .
It may not be a coincidence that they finally voted for a ban just a month before they face elections .
Having been invisible to their constituents for the past five years , what better way for MEPs to save their own skins than to fight valiantly for those of baby seals ?
Last month , I was sorting through the mail after work .
Amid the plastic windowed envelopes offering lower interest rates on credit cards and thick glossy catalogs touting everything from a ladder to help an arthritic dog climb onto your bed to a $ 6,000 coyote skin throw rug , I found an item that really grabbed my attention , a Backyard Outdoor Theater System .
The combination consisted of a projector / dvd combo , two speakers and a 12 ' x 6 ' screen .
I thought about it .
Lazy summer evenings , sitting back and sipping a cool beverage , while the kids ran around catching fireflies and watching a Hollywood blockbuster on a very big screen .
These are the moments when vivid , lifetime memories are made .
But then I saw the price tag : $ 3,499 .
The dream of outdoor movie watching began to make a hasty retreat .
But before throwing in the towel , I thought I 'd explore the idea a little further .
What about buying the components on my own , surely there would be some savings there .
Sure enough , the catalog listed each component 's maker .
So a quick Google search turned up a buy - it - yourself price of $ 218 for the speakers , $ 900 for the combo dvd player / projector and $ 1149 for the collapsible screen .
It was still more than two grand .
For that price , I could practically take the family to Sundance and watch a week of movies .
It was time to get creative .
My company had a projector that - with a little work - could be repurposed for an outdoor event ( and it had nearly 1,000 more lumens than the piddly projector in the catalog ) .
The speakers could be borrowed from an audiophile friend and I dusted off an old receiver to drive the sound .
Finally , the dvd player was disconnected from the kitchen tv to contribute to the cause .
With the audio and visual requirements resolved , I was still stuck with finding a simple solution for the most expensive element of the equation , the screen .
There were tons of great ideas at the backyardtheater.com forums , but nothing that met my specific needs .
I wanted a screen that was not only temporary , but lightweight enough to be portable and storable .
I also wanted something inexpensive .
After much deliberation on materials and design , I settled on a 5 ' x 9 ' screen constructed of blackout cloth stretched over a 1.5 " PVC frame .
Blackout cloth was a great solution , offering nearly - perfect color and texture for viewing movies .
I put together a rough drawing and headed to the hardware store for parts .
With the help of a miter saw , I was able to cut and glue all of the PVC in a single Saturday afternoon .
( While I love the flexibility and ease that PVC offers , the headaches that resulted from using the pungent PVC cement gave me renewed respect for plumbers everywhere ... not that I did n't before . )
The blackout cloth had to be doubled over and sewed along the edges for reinforcement .
Grommets were added every foot to connect the fabric to the frame .
This was the one piece of the project I had outsourced , the week before , to a local awning company .
I laid the cloth over the frame and attached it with zip ties .
These allowed for fine adjustments to get the fabric as centered as possible .
To support the frame , I sunk three - foot sections of 2 " PVC in concrete in three 5 gallon buckets .
After the concrete dried , I was able to slide the screen frame 's three 1.5 " PVC legs deep into the 2 " pipes for support .
A couple of eye bolts at the top sides of the frame allowed the screen to be secured with rope and stakes to prevent it from forward and backward movement in the event of a breeze .
With that , the screen was done .
To be on the safe side , we tested the setup to make sure everything worked together and then we were ready .
We put out some invitations to the neighborhood and this past Friday , my kids and most of neighborhood kicked off the summer by sipping lemonade , eating popcorn and watching Indiana Jones try to discover the Ark of the Covenant .
Everyone enjoyed the evening immensely and we are already looking forward to our second screening – most likely Episode Four .
The material and cost list for the screen follows :
( 3 ) five gallon buckets @ $ 2.78 ea = $ 8.34
( 2 ) sacks Sakrete @ $ 4.37 = $ 8.74
( 1 ) jar PVC cement = $ 3.76
( 2 ) eye bolts @ $ 0.52 = $ 1.04
( 4 ) anchor stakes @ 2.16 ea = $ 8.64
(7 ) 10 ' sections 1.5 " PVC pipe @ $ 3.16 ea = $ 22.12
(1) 10 ' section 2 " PVC pipe = $ 4.18
( 1 ) bag , 100 ct 14 " zip tie = $ 9.87
(1) 100 ' nylon rope = $ 6.24
(8) 1.5 " wye fittings @ $ 2.23 ea = $ 17.84
( 2) 1.5 " 90 degree elbows @ $ 0.61 ea = $ 1.22
(1) 1.5 " cross fitting = $ 2.63
( 2) 1.5 " tee fittings @ $ 1.57 ea = $ 3.14
(1) 5 ' x 9 ' piece of blackout cloth $ 24.99
Total material costs : $ 122.75
Lessons learned :
If I had the skill ( and the machinery ) , I would have done the cloth reinforcement & grommet work myself or found a friend or relative who could have done it for me .
Working with a self - imposed deadline of Memorial Day weekend , I bit the bullet and had a local awning company do the work for me .
That added an additional $ 125 to the overall cost , for a grand total of $ 247.75 .
I 'm not happy about that , but sometimes there is n't much of a choice .
And it 's still much better than $ 1149 .
Also , if I were to make the frame again , I would add 45 degree fittings at every point of interior frame support .
The screen sits too tautly on the frame and the supports show through the canvas .
( Fortunately , it 's completely unnoticeable while a movie is showing . )
But aesthetically it would look better if the supports were less visible .
Kicking them back a couple inches with 45 º fittings would likely resolve that problem .
Finally , fearing the flexibility of the frame 's weight , I added a center support midway through construction .
I 'm not sure if this was entirely necessary , but sometimes it pays to be on the safe side .
This week police used ' kettling ' - penning marchers in an area and refusing to let them out - to deal with the G20 demonstrations .
Is this really the most sensible way to tackle protests ?
Thirty years ago this month , a young teacher called Blair Peach was killed during a demonstration against the National Front in Southall , west London .
Peach was a member of the Socialist Workers Party and the Anti-Nazi League , which had organised the protest during an upsurge of support for the far right .
Peach 's death and his funeral , attended by the thousands who accompanied the procession through East London , was memorialised in art , poetry and song .
It was believed that he had been killed by a blow on the head from a police radio but the exact cause was never officially established .
A jury returned a verdict of death by misadventure .
The policing of the protest , in which the Metropolitan police 's Special Patrol Group ( SPG ) were notably involved , remains a topic of debate to this day .
Another 30 years , another demonstration , another death , albeit one that appears to have no link at all to violence by either police or demonstrators .
Once again , however , the policing of the protest is under scrutiny .
Of course police tactics have changed over the years .
The outright confrontation , like an old Roman battle , which was common in the 70s and 80s in demonstrations , has been refined .
The nightmare scenario , as far as the police are concerned , is a repeat of the poll tax riots of 1990 when control of the centre of London was lost .
Everything is now done to try and avoid a repeat .
The surveillance techniques offered by closed circuit television , sophisticated long - distance filming , computerised identification and improved riot gear , mean that the old street battles are less common and have been replaced by containment .
What the City saw on Wednesday and , to a lesser extent , yesterday , is a distillation of all those new techniques .
When the main body of protesters arrived on Wednesday from four different directions at their planned destination of the Bank of England , they soon found themselves hemmed in from all sides by ranks of police .
Requests to leave the area were refused .
This is , in police terms , the " kettle " .
It is best known for having been used in the May Day protests at Oxford Circus in 2001 , after which it became the subject of a civil action , brought by one of those contained and only finally resolved by the law lords ( in the police 's favour ) in January this year .
The kettle has also been used often in other , smaller , less publicised protests .
Many away football fans , forced to stay behind police lines for long periods of time after a game , will be familiar with it .
But what is significant about its use this week is that it is now apparently being applied in a rigid , inflexible way - policing as video - game .
Its use was predicted and justified by the former assistant commissioner ( special operations ) at the Met , Andy Hayman , in an article in the Times earlier this week .
" Tactics to herd the crowd into a pen ... have been criticised before , yet the police will not want groups splintering away from the crowd , " he wrote .
There were certainly people anxious to smash windows and cause some mayhem in the City on Wednesday .
But they were far outnumbered by a playful , peaceful , harmless group of protesters , including rappers , sax - players , jugglers , spliff - rollers , students , CND campaigners , passers - by , and men dressed as police officers and wearing blue lipstick .
For many of them the intention had been to come and make a lunchtime April Fool 's Day protest against the City and the banking world 's self - indulgence , as well as to air concerns about everything from climate change to homelessness .
But when many wanted to leave the area , hardly any were allowed to .
" Do n't ask us , ask the gaffer , " was the response from police officers to people who wanted to leave and were puzzled that they could not .
Gaffers seemed in short supply and none had , apparently , been allowed to use their own initiative in allowing who to release from the pen of police in which the protesters were corralled .
There 's an old police joke in which a constable injured in a riot staggers back through the ranks for treatment .
Another officer comes to his aid .
" Thanks , sarge , " says the constable .
" That 's OK - but by the way , I 'm a superintendent . "
" Blimey , " replies the officer , " I did n't realise I was that far back . "
Where were the supers this time , why were the crowd given no instructions as to where they should go or when ?
The area became a public lavatory as people unable to leave used the entrances to Bank underground station as a urinal .
The containment was backed up at the Bank of England , first with mounted police and then with police dogs , ramping up tensions and fuelling further bloody confrontations .
As people were eventually allowed to leave the area , they were funnelled out down a pavement on Princes Street with a police officer grabbing them by the arm as though they were under arrest .
One officer , asked why people were not allowed to leave under their own steam , replied : " They might fall over . "
People were then asked for their name and address and required to have a photo taken .
Those who refused were put back in the pen .
As for the more obvious signs of destruction - the Royal Bank of Scotland had its windows smashed .
Why no one had thought to board up a building with the RBS sign on it , as many other outfits had been boarded up , is unclear .
As for the violent clashes that led to cracked heads and limbs - how much was inevitable and how much avoidable ?
Certainly , the police had to put up with much abuse and missiles , although these were mainly plastic bottles and sprayed beer and cider .
Certainly , some demonstrators were bent on aggro but , then again , so were some of the officers on Queen Victoria Street .
But how much of the trouble as the day wore on could have been avoided by policing that did n't involve containment ?
And what does this mean for the future of protesting ?
Does this mean that anyone wanting to go on a demonstration in the future needs to be prepared to be detained for eight hours , photographed and identified ?
And how long , if such techniques continue , or are further refined , before the confrontations become bloodier ?
The thing about kettles is that they do have a tendency to come to the boil .
It 's comparable to the Windows versions for when you want to have a portable solution .
In a lot of cases it appears to do even more and better checks than what Windows does internally .
Only Linux safe C lib for strings available AFAIK .
Note Windows uses standard errno , mainly EINVAL and ERANGE , while this lib uses custom / additional ones .
Easy enough to fix if you want them to be the same .
I only wish it had a " vsnprintf_s " ( as a base " sprintf_s " , " snprintf_s " , etc. ) already built in .
Micro$oft 's internal custom version not only has argument and buffer size validation , it also validates the format .
Note understood this is meant to be ISO / IEC TR24731 compliant , the Windows versions are a bit different ..
ATHENS - Police in Greece say robbers near Athens have got away with everything including the kitchen sink , lifting a prefabricated home off its foundation and spiriting it away .
Police say the owner went to visit his 70 - square meter vacation home on Monday in the coastal area of Rafina , 25 kilometres east of Athens , and discovered it was missing , along with its contents .
Police said on Wednesday they think the thieves used a crane to load the structure onto a trailer .
They have been unable to locate the missing building .
Thousands of Athenians , including Greece 's prime minister , Kostas Karamanlis , have vacation properties in Rafina .

Last night we learned that the Federal Reserve is going to put into practice its announced plan to buy US government debt .
Today 's Financial Times article by Krishna Guha gives the gory details .
Everyone knows that this action by the Fed increases money supply , and most are aware that it increases the probability that at some point in the future the amount of money created will be excessive with regard to the actual needs of the marketplace , which in turn will tend to lead us towards a state of price inflation , or bubble inflation .
Another article by Javier Blas on the early signs of this in the commodities markets is a fun read on the subject .
As the Fed sees the problem , then , they must feed us with money supply while the banks are frozen in a state of rigor vivus , and then in future , just at the right moment , they will take steps to prevent the normal outcome of price or bubble inflation by reversing the process .
[ Thanks to 1stchoicecufflinks.com for the nice photo . ]
This sounds logical .
As an obscure economist named Edward C. Harwood wrote during our last episode of purposefully inflationary Federal Reserve intervention ( " the ill - fated Operation Twist in the 1960s " ) , during a time when we were still trying to adhere to a modified form of the global gold standard :
" Once inflationary purchasing media have been placed in circulation , there are two ways in which sound money - credit relationships may be restored : ( 1 ) by means of devaluation , that is , reducing the gold weight of the monetary unit so much that the increase in the number of ( smaller ) gold dollars equals or exceeds what had been the inflationary portion of total purchasing media ; or ( 2 ) by means of deflation , that is by removing inflationary purchasing media from circulation . "
[ See this article from the American Institute for Economic Research website [ AIER .]
Let 's take these in order .
In the 1960s during the last years of the gold standard era , the word " devaluation " had by definition a specific political action attached to it .
We could say it was an official public confession to a previously committed inflationary crime , the central bank 's admission of guilt and acceptance of their incapacity to rectify the situation .
To devalue a currency was ripe with ominous significance , and central banks were supposed to take pains to avoid the embarrassment by not inflating the currency in the first place .
Today , however , the devaluation of our currency takes place painlessly for most of us ( except for importers ) , and effectively the Fed gets away with it on a regular basis .
In fact , without a gold or any kind of standard , the inflationary purchases of debt instruments that the Fed has already made , plus those it intends now to make , are already devaluing the dollar as I write .
We do n't have to wait for an official recognition and adjustment of any standard ; it just happens on a day - to - day basis .
Under these circumstances , an official announcement of devaluation , therefore , will have no corrective effect .
Quite the contrary , inflation will take place simultaneously with the devaluation of the dollar - - a double whammy , if you will .
But we do n't want prices to skyrocket , so the inflation will still need correction .
Let 's turn to the other option , deflation .
Paradoxically , the Fed is taking its present inflationary action to fight fear of deflation .
They are afraid that a banking panic and a lack of credit could cause the system to collapse in what is called a " deflationary spiral . "
So it will be a while before they feel comfortable with using the deflationary tactic .
Nevertheless , the Fed scientists and governors do believe that it will be possible for them , at some appropriate moment in the future , to begin a controlled deflation of money supply that will not upset the apple cart .
Harwood does write this about the possibility of a controlled deflation : " That a period of gradually declining prices can be a period also of great economic growth has been amply demonstrated in the past .
For example , between 1875 and 1895 while prices decreased substantially , the Nation 's productive capacity and output of goods and services increased at a very rapid rate .
The often heard assertion that an economy cannot grow unless prices are rising has no basis in fact ....
" With gradual deflation , a longer time would be required to eliminate all inflationary purchasing media and reach an equilibrium between the remaining ( noninflationary ) purchasing media and prices and wages , but the traumatic events that are a feature of rapid deflation would not occur .
The Nation would ' outgrow ' the inflationary condition as part of the savings of individuals , businesses , and perhaps of the Government were used to pay off inflationary bank loans and thereby cancel both the loans and the checking deposits that the loans had created .
Although gradual deflation would be accompanied by decreasing prices , wages almost certainly would decline less or might even be sustained by greater productivity due to technological and other developments . " ( For more on why deflation is not always bad thing , read this research by David Beckworth at Cato .
)
So it would seem that a gradual well - timed deflation is what Bernanke and his cohorts are counting on .
But ... there are a few minefields here .
One is that we are no longer on a gold standard .
We have no point of reference as to where the dollar should end up .
I wo n't go into the reasons why this makes Bernanke 's task more difficult , but it does .
Second , how will we know when prices begin to inflate or when bubbles start to form ?
Alan Greenspan is famous for having remarked that it is impossible to detect when a bubble is appearing .
It 's true that we all knew the real estate mania was a bubble ( or at least I did ; did n't you ? ) , but our financial wonks at the Fed either preferred not to recognize it or could n't prove it to their own satisfaction , at least not to a point where it would have forced them to take action .
( I 'd add that they may have had incentives not to want to find reasons to take that action , but that would be unfair speculation , so I wo n't . )
And what if prices remain the same ?
Does this necessarily mean that we do n't have an inflationary maladjustment in the money supply that maintains prices at an artificially stable but too high level ?
What if the stimulus package spending turns out to be wasteful to some significant degree ?
Is n't that like blowing bubbles ?
Example : Bailout - funded Wall Street bonuses .
Third , and here 's the real rub , we have not practiced what Harwood calls " sound money - credit principles " since the Fed was created .
These principles mandate a specific equilibrium in the commercial banking system between true reserves , deposits , savings , and short - term commercial paper on the one hand ; and loans and investments that are speculative and / or based only on some form of collateral , on the other , where these more risky activities would be allowed only outside the strict commercial banking system .
( For more on sound commercial banking , find a copy of Harwood 's book " Cause and Control of the Business Cycle , " 1974 edition , at your local library , or in the AIER catalog .
I will delve into the idea of sound money - credit banking in a future blog . )
Fourth , the Fed cannot reverse its current trajectory and start to take deflationary action until the time is right and the worst of the credit crisis is past .
Will nothing unexpected disturb their plans ?
They are relying on deflationary scenario computer models where " all else is equal , " meaning when outside factors remain stable .
What if the market does something surprising that will make a controlled deflation either inadvisable or even impossible , at the very moment when it must happen ?
For example , US treasury bonds could become radically less popular among our foreign buyers as a result of the dollar devaluation the inflation will cause ; and as nations all over the world scramble to inflate their own currencies , we may find that we have a lot of competition in the bond market .
Personally , I 'm betting ( and I disclose that I have put a little money where my mouth is by investing in gold - related products ) that the Fed will be hard - put to time and measure the controlled deflation .
Why gold ?
Because , as I 've said many times :
You can take gold out of the standard , but you can't take the standard out of gold .

When he played Royal Albert Hall on May 16 , 2015 , Stewart talked about this song :
" This one came about in a really strange way .
Tim Renwick previously played in a band called The Sutherland Brothers , and they had a keyboard player called Peter Wood .
I was touring in America in 1975 and Peter Wood continually , at every soundcheck I ever went to , he played this riff on the piano .
After I heard it about 14 times I said , ' You know , there 's something about that .
It sounds kind of haunting and nice .
Can I write some lyrics to it ? "
And he said : " Sure , go and write some lyrics . '
But that was the easy bit .
The difficult bit was writing the lyrics .
Eventually , I came up with a set of lyrics about an English comedian called Tony Hancock and the song was called ' Foot of the Stage . '
He committed suicide in Australia and I saw him right before he went there and I knew there was something terribly wrong .
And so , I wrote this song about him and the chorus was :
Your tears fell down like rain
At the foot of the stage
The American record company said , ' We 've never heard of Tony Hancock .
We do n't know who he is . '
So , then I thought , ' Well , that 's annoying so I 'll take the piss out of them . '
So , I wrote a song about Princess Anne called " Horse of the Year "
Princess
Anne rode off
On the horse of the year
They did n't like that either .
I was beginning to lose my mind because I had this piece of music forever and I could n't think of any words .
I had a girlfriend at the time and she had a book on Vietnamese astrology , which was kind of obscure , and it was open at a chapter called ' The Year Of The Cat . '
Now that 's , I think , the year of the rabbit in Chinese astrology .
I 'm not too sure .
I do n't know a whole lot about a whole lot of things but I recognize a song title when I see one and that was a song title .
But then another problem : what do you do ?
' The Year Of The Cat . '
OK , well :
I used to have a ginger Tabby
And now I have a ginger Tom
The first one made me crabby
The new one ...
I thought , ' You can't write about cats , it 's ridiculous . '
And I was absolutely lost and then the Casablanca movie came on television and I thought , ' I 'll grab Humphrey Bogart and Peter Lorre and see where it goes . '
Somehow or other , in between all of that and Vietnamese astrology , we came up with this .
Thank you , Peter Wood , for writing the music .
He 's no longer with us but thank you , Peter . "
It ’s another week and another JRPG has been announced ; for exclusive release on the Playstation 3 .
This month ’s issue of Famitsu details a new game being developed by Koei .
The game is being dubbed Trinity Zill O’ll Zero .
Some of you may be familiar with the title , as the series has also made an appearance on Sony ’s prior consoles .
The PS1 original was simply titled , Zill O’ll .
A subsequent PS2 title was made , later being ported to the PSP .
Details are slim , but the franchise is known for being darker and a more mature JRPG .
Stay tuned with Playstation Lifestyle as we ’ll bring you all the details on this interesting game .

There 's a little book that has been on my desk for months , " Six - Word Memoirs on Love & Heartbreak , " inspired by Ernest Hemingway 's contention that a story can be told in half a dozen words ( His famous line ?
" For Sale : baby shoes , never worn . " )
The book is full of six - word tales , some good : " I thought we had more time " ; " I have never been in love . "
Some not so good : " I told you it affects me . "
" He sold his boat for me . "
These are my six words .
He sold his boat and it was a lifetime ago , ancient history now .
And it was a little boat .
But it was a big act of love that I did n't recognize for a long , long time .
Not until I wrote those words .
For the boat was just a boat in my eyes .
But in my husband's ?
He could tell you the horsepower and the color of the seats and how many people it held and how much he paid for it and how much he got for it - because it was his youth , his plumage , a speedboat that he hitched to the back of his shiny GTO .
It turned heads .
It made girls notice him .
He was 19 and he liked that .
He took it to New Hampshire sometimes but mostly to the lake in Sharon , where he took me now and then .
He tried to teach me to water - ski .
His other girlfriends skied .
But I continually failed .
We got married anyway .
He sold the boat a few years later in the middle of a summer in order to get the money we needed to turn our garage into a family room .
He was 24 and I was 23 and we had an 8 - month - old whose bedroom had been our family room .
I said , " We need more space . "
And he said , " I 'll sell my boat . "
And that was that .
He never moaned about giving up something he loved , and I never said , " Don't " or " Are you sure ? "
I called my uncle and asked if he'd help us build a room and he said OK , knowing full well that he'd be the one doing most of the building because my husband knew little about flooring and insulation , air ducts , and electrical work .
My husband gave up his boat and picked up a hammer to please me .
My uncle had five kids and a house of his own , but there he was every weekend , at my door at the crack of dawn .
The things we give up and take on for the people we love .
And then we forget .
I had a case of the flu the week before I got married .
My father went out and bought me a coat .
He 'd never bought me an item of clothing in his life ; that was my mother 's job .
The coat was wool , emerald - green , and beautiful .
" I want you to be warm , " he said .
I thanked him for that coat .
I loved him for that coat .
But it was n't too long after that I forgot about the coat because I got annoyed with him about something he said or did or something he did n't do .
And that something was all I could see .
This is what happens .
You get a coat or a guy sells his beloved boat for you .
But time goes by and life goes on and there are arguments over dirty dishes in the sink , laundry that needs to be folded , kids who need to be driven to the mall , and who is in charge of the remote .
It 's as if the boat thing never happened .
But it did .
It happens for everyone .
Everyone who is married or living together or just going together started off sweet - talking .
What do you need ?
How can I help ?
I can do that .
No problem !
Flowers for no reason .
Poems .
Chicken soup when you 're sick .
Ice cream just because .
Phone calls that are more than traffic reports .
It 's all sunshine and roses .
Until it is n't .
That 's when it 's important to remember the beginning .
" He sold his boat for me . "
This was my beginning .

Tödliches Liebesspiel Polizei ermittelt nach Leichenfund in Krefeld
Der bizarre
Tod eines jungen Liebespaars beschäftigt die Polizei in Nordrhein - Westfalen : Ein Jogger hat in der Nähe von Krefeld die Leichen einer Frau und eines Mannes in einem Auto entdeckt .
Die Ermittler gehen davon aus , dass ein im Internet arrangiertes Liebesspiel für die beiden tödlich endete .
Fresh off one of the worst quarters in company history , Microsoft offered investors little evidence that a beleaguered personal computer market would recover anytime soon .
On Thursday , Microsoft set the wrong kind of record , as it reported the first year - over - year quarterly revenue decline since it first sold stock to the public in 1986 .
In its third quarter , which ended March 31 , Microsoft said its revenue fell 6 percent , to $ 13.65 billion , from $ 14.45 billion .
It reported net income of $ 2.98 billion , or 33 cents a share  a 32 percent drop from the $ 4.39 billion , or 47 cents a share , reported in the period last year .
The company ’s Windows franchise has come under unprecedented pressure during the recession as consumers and businesses have shied away from buying new computers or have purchased cheaper machines .
While Intel , the chip maker , said last week that the worst of the PC decline had passed , Microsoft displayed no such confidence .
“ I did n’t see any improvement at the end of the quarter that gives me encouragement that we are at a bottom and coming out of it , ” Christopher P. Liddell , Microsoft ’s chief financial officer , said during a conference call to discuss the company ’s results .
“ They stopped getting worse , but that ’s different from they started getting better . ”

Comments on :
McCarthy , J. ( 1978 ) .
History of LISP .
ACM SIGPLAN Notices 13 ( 8 ) , pp. 217-223 . DOI =
http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/960118.808387
When discussing about conditional expressions ( in pg. 218 ) , McCarthy says that XIF ( M , N1,N2 ) had to be used sparingly since all three arguments had to be evluated even if M was either zero or not .
He says that it led to the invention of the true conditional expression which evaluated only one of N1 and N2 depending on whether M was true of false .
What is the difference between representing the value of M as either 0 or 1 , or True and False ?
How are True and False implemented in LISP ?
C does not have explicit True and False in which case we define True and False to be 0 and 1 if we ever need to use it .
It 's mostly an order - of - evaluation issue .
For a traditional procedure , you evaluate all the arguments before applying the procedure .
In the revised version , you only evaluate some of the arguments .
I was wondering whether or not data structures were prevalent during the time Lisp was developed .
It is evident why he makes lists the main data structure ( functions themselves are simply lists ) but why did he not include a way to make a struct or a similar data type ?
No , generic mechanisms for making compound data types had not really been invented at the time Lisp was first developed .
Were macros added after this paper was written ?
He does n't seem to mentioned them much , but the other readings seem to emphasize them a lot .
Macros were not part of the original Lisp .
I 'm not sure when they were added , but they were a central part of Common Lisp .
Also , what exactly is pornographic programming ?
I 'll get back to you on that .
When McCarthy discusses the creation of a " LISP environment " does he mean creating the interpreter for the language or is it something else ?
Assuming that is what he means , what reasons were there for LISP to be an interpreted language instead of a compiled language ?
McCarthy states that the concern was that producing the compiler would take too long , but were there any other advantages or disadvantages for favoring an interpreted language over a compiled language ?
Yes , he generally means the interpreter .
The big advantage is that it encourages experimentation - type a little , see the result , type a little more , see the next result , and so on and so forth .
There 's also a bit of encouragement in such a system to write small procedures , which many of us think are good .
McCarthy says that a large number of computer scientists and programmers regard the fact that LISP programs are lists to be a disadvantage .
Why is that so ?
And why does he go on to say that this same feature of the language may have contributed to its survival ?
Let me get back to you on that .
The writer of the History of Lisp says that one could conjecture that LISP owes its survival specifically to the fact its programs are lists .
He says that everyone including him have regarded as a disadvantage .
If it is a disadvantage , why is n't it changed especially considering its so central to Lisp ?
Because it 's also an advantage , and he 's exaggerating .
As the previous writer mentions , McCarthy also says that lists were key to Lisp 's survival .
McCarthy states ,
The first succesful LISP compiler was programmed by Timothy Hart and Michael Levin .
It was written in LISP and was claimed to be the first compiler written in the language to be compiled How is it possible to write a compiler in the same language as the language to be compiled ?
There are a number of ways , we 'll actually cover this issue on Friday .
In terms of the interpreter , seven key operations ( plus or minus ) are implemented in assembler .
Everything else can be implemented with those key operations .
In addition , if there 's an interpreter , then you can interpret the compiler and have that compile itself to get an executable compiler .
LISP puts the operator first in a mathematical expression because " any other notation necessarily requires special programming " .
When an operation is translated into machine code , why would it require special programming ?
It seems like it would be a very simple change .
Is it there for other reasons besides making the programming easier ?
It 's easier to parse things in which the operator comes first .
When you see the operator , you know its arity , you know the expected types , you know almost everything .
It 's also there because it makes the form of s-expressions a bit simpler , but I suppose that 's incorporated in the previous answer .
What are the possible downsides to building a programming language that revolves around lists ?
You need to do garbage collection , you need to chase pointers ( which means that things that are related may not be nearby in memory ) , you sometimes succumb to If the only tool you have is a hammer , everything looks like a nail . .
When the paper compares the LISP with Turing Machine , it does n't provide any example .
Generally , in this paper , I am not familiar with many things such as IBM 704 , SDS ....
It 's hard for students , who are from current programming world , to understand this paper .
Well , if understanding the thing seems central to the paper , then you probably need to a bit of extra research .
However , knowing the details of the computer on which LISP ran is probably not essential .
What kind of example would you like in the comparison of Lisp with a Turing machine ?
Church 's theorem shows them to be equivalent .
You must also realize the audience for whom he was writing .
Note that one of the things I want you to gain from this course is a better understanding of history , and , because I respect you as intelligent learners , I have no intention of spoon - feeding you that history .
John McCarthy credits his work with AI as very influential in his creation of LISP .
He explains that he chose to make a list - based language because of his work with AI .
This brought to mind one of our past readings about how software engineering has influenced the design of programming languages .
It seemed to me that McCarthy 's article also shows how the available hardware influences the design of a programming language ( e.g car and cdr ) .
It is natural to make a language reflect the hardware , at least a bit , particularly if you care about efficient code .
a
The 15 bit sections for address ond decrement make sense .
What are the prefix and tag sections of the word for ?
I 'll get back to you that .
Are the Glazers , the enigmatic family that owns Manchester United and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , strapped for cash ?
While most of the financial manoeuvrings of the Glazers are hidden from public view , circumstantial evidence suggests that problems may exist .
Not the least of which is their decision not to pay down their Manchester United debt , which has a double - digit interest rate .
Questions about their ongoing viability are openly discussed in Tampa Bay , where fans of the gridiron team fume as they feel the Glazers did not spend to make the team competitive for next season .
While Manchester United chase four trophies , Tampa Bay 's parallel universe is bleak .
Las Vegas bookmakers reckon they will have a losing 7 – 9 season this autumn , and no play - off prospects , after two mediocre campaigns of 9–7 .
The family rarely discuss finances but Joel Glazer was forced to explain their rationale regarding Tampa and new players .
" Sometimes you can throw money at a situation and it can get you in trouble .
We are big believers in building a sustainable franchise that is going to be in competition for many years for the ultimate prize , " he said .
Those words are not sitting well with Tampa fans .
There is a salary cap in the NFL , which is in place to try to ensure that all 32 teams can be competitive and have the same chance of reaching the Super Bowl .
This year 's salary cap is $ 127 m ( £ 83 m ) and at the start of the annual free - agency signing period in late February the Buccaneers organisation had nearly $ 62 m of cap space , the most of any team in the country .
The Glazers had made some stunning decisions in the few weeks between season 's end and the start of the free - agency period .
They fired the general manager Bruce Allen , the Super Bowl - winning head coach John Gruden and five high - salaried veterans , including arguably the franchise 's best ever player , the linebacker Derrick Brooks .
Brooks 's career in truth is winding down but his supposed replacement , Cato June , was released .
The household - name receivers Joey Galloway and Ike Hilliard together with the popular running back Warren Dunn , all of whom are near the end of top - notch careers , were also let go as the management went for lower - priced younger players .
High anticipation of new players rapidly turned to frustration as the Buccaneers were outbid for the signatures of several big names and an analysis by ESPN is that the Bucs have taken a step or two backwards in the quality of the team .
The recent signing of several rookies via the annual draft has done little to appease the naysayers .
With the best players in free agency now elsewhere the Buccaneers still have approximately $ 30 m in salary cap sitting unspent , the most in the entire league .
Salary - cap space and actual cash are of course completely different and internet message boards in Tampa and beyond are full of speculation about the Glazers ' finances .
According to Jim Flynn , the editor of Pewter Report , which claims to be the largest independent site following the team , there is no hard evidence although the signs certainly indicate they might be hurting .
" I can tell you there are a lot of frustrated fans , " said Flynn .
" Once the rumours started to leak and pick up some momentum – that there were cash - flow issues – I think a lot of fans started to buy in , and now it has gotten to the point where some fans are making more of it than should be made of it . "
Flynn said Tampa fans realise the purchase of Manchester United was a huge deal for the Glazers but only now with the lack of free - agency action and the structuring of contracts that have low up - front payments are they linking the events .
Fans are voting with their wallets .
The team had a 145,000 waiting list for season tickets in 2007 .
That list has disappeared and the Bucs now say anyone who wants a season ticket can buy one .
There is even talk that Tampa games will not sell out , something that has not happened for years .
Indeed , the team will travel to London for one of their eight " home " games to play the New England Patriots at Wembley .
In the UK , the Guardian recently reported that Manchester United 's massive debt was being sold at a 30 % discount by its holders because they believe that they may not be paid .
While the intrinsic value of the Manchester United and Tampa Bay Buccaneer franchises are holding up during this recession the same cannot be said for the Glazers ' holding company , First Allied Corp , which owns and manages nearly 7 m sq ft of community and neighbourhood shopping centres located throughout the US .
First Allied is a private company so there is no access to its financial information but there is no doubt that shopping centre owners are being badly affected by the economic downturn , with retailers shutting down in droves .
New stats show the vacancy rate at neighbourhood and community shopping centres rose to 9.5 % in the first quarter of 2009 from 8.9 % the previous quarter and 7.7 % a year ago , according to the research company Reis .
Victor Calanog , director of research at Reis , believes the situation will get worse before it gets better .
He is projecting a continued increase in vacancy for neighbourhood and community centres into 2011 .
Shedding a little light on their empire , the Glazers also own a small publicly listed company called Zapata , which invests in other companies .
Those investments went south in late 2008 and have continued in that direction .
The company reported a fourth - quarter 2008 loss of $ 456,000 as opposed to a net profit of $ 909,000 the previous year .
And for the first quarter of this year Zapata reported a consolidated net loss of $ 727,000 compared with a net profit of $ 320,000 in 2008 .
Neither the Glazers nor Manchester United responded to interview requests and the Buccaneers ' director of public relations , Jeff Kamis , said : " We are not going to speculate on cash - flow problems based on what a couple of fans wrote on message boards . "
Certainly fans of Manchester United and the Buccaneers care little or nothing about the Glazers and any cash - flow woes .
They want only to be assured that their teams will be contenders in the coming season .
While Manchester United could wrap up the Premier League title this weekend and have a Champions League final to look forward to , there is no such assurance for Tampa fans .
When times are tough , people typically rein in their budgets .
While most people cut everyday extravagances like gourmet coffee or premium cable channels , others take frugality to the extreme .
Here are some unusual ways people are trying to save money :
Toilet training your cat : Buying kitty litter will put a dent in your wallet .
Cleaning up the box is another pain .
The ultra -frugal are addressing the issue by toilet training their cats .
If that seems like too much work ( or Lord Fluffington proves uncooperative ) , you could try making your own kitty litter instead .
Reusing toilet cloths :
Some penny - pinching consumers have switched from toilet paper to cloth napkins , which have the added benefit of helping the environment .
The same principle applies to paper towels , though with less of the ick factor .
Green - minded savers say that wiping with cloth in the bathroom is similar to using cloth diapers on babies instead of disposable ones .
Wallypop , a family business in Des Moines , Iowa , sells colorful wipes in a variety of fabrics .
The reusable towels are machine washable .
Picking up plants from funeral homes :
Fresh flowers can brighten up a home , but they can be expensive .
The obvious solution is to grow your own , but that 's messy and takes time .
Some people have tried calling local funeral homes to see if they can take plants left over from funerals .
Mourners seldom take home all their flowers , and funeral directors might be happy to unload the bouquets .
Turning pet hair into clothing : Knitting can be a wonderfully frugal way to outfit your family .
If you 're an extreme saver , there 's a way to avoid buying yarn .
Kendall Crolius tells readers how to turn extraneous pet hair into yarn in her book Knitting With Dog Hair .
The book 's tagline says it all : " Better a sweater from a dog you know and love than from a sheep you 'll never meet . "
Baking cookies in cars :
If you have a sweet tooth and live in a warm climate , you could cut the cost of your treats by making them in a solar oven .
These metal rigs use the sun 's rays to cook food for free .
The Baking Bites blog takes this idea a step further by showing you how to bake cookies in your car on hot summer days .
The process might leave your vehicle smelling of chocolate chip cookies for the rest of the week , which some people might consider a good thing .
Although it 's wise to cut expenses when the economy spirals , some things should n't be discounted .
But it 's up to you to make that distinction .
Though many would like to think otherwise , the very existence of our society depends upon each individual contributing to the survival and well - being of all .
No one — except the old , the sick , the handicapped — has ever been exempt from leading a productive life .
In primitive societies , the good man hunted for the sustenance of the entire tribe and the good woman bore and reared children to ensure the survival of their kind .
In modern culture , the roles have changed in superficial ways , but until recently have remained essentially the same .
Good citizens led productive lives and brought children into the world to replenish the community with virtue .
Those who did not accept these responsibilities — who avoided work or failed to accept the “ sweet yoke ” of marriage and parenthood — were considered suspect and even vicious , depending on their capabilities and the degree to which they flouted the rules of society .
Bums and ne ’er - do - wells were but two examples of those who shirked their duty to make a positive contribution to the economy of the community .
Thieves and embezzlers were worse because they actively preyed on those who were honest and diligent .
Rakes and homosexuals were sexually selfish and irresponsible , not only because they were self - indulgent , but also because they saw sexuality as divorced from the responsibilities of parenthood .
Quite apart from Biblical injunctions , homosexuals have been considered non-productive and hence inimical to the well - being and even the survival of the community .
In addition , they have been regarded as dangerous , because they preyed on the young and perverted them from normal , healthy , productive lives .
In their selfish preoccupation with genital pleasure , they sought to rebel against the natural order of human life itself — the mutual responsibility of one for all that forms the basis of the social contract .
Anyone who opts out of that contract for reasons other than illness or disability is “ wrong headed , ” “ worthless , ” “ immoral . ”
One need only examine the world ’s great heroic tales — from the Iliad to the Aeneid to the Gospels to see the virtue of men and women portrayed in terms of their willingness to be productive and unselfish , as opposed to self - centered and destructive .
Now that many in our society have cast aside these ancient norms , we see the old warnings coming true .
Homosexuals are now more than non-productive “ sexual bums . ”
They are recruiting others , forming communities , beginning to mock and undermine the old pieties of loyalty to family , country , and God .
They have redefined “ good ” and “ evil ” and view with contempt the idea that honest work and sex within marriage are communal acts necessary for human survival .
Social - Psychiatric Theory
Traditional social - psychiatric theory argues that productive people will enjoy life , feel good about themselves , earn the respect of friends and co-workers , and feel connected with their families and society .
The non-productive will also have personalities shaped by their character and experience , namely , their worthless or counter - productive activities and life choices .
They are expected to feel dissatisfied with life and themselves , be stung from social scorn , and seek excessive distraction ( through amusements , risk - taking , drugs , sex , etc . ) .
The rebellious are expected to have “ adjustment problems ” because they do n’t follow society ’s prescription .
They will feel angry at and at odds with their family and society , even while blaming them for their problems .
Rebels , such as thieves and homosexuals , will tend to “ feel comfortable ” only in the company of their kind .
Though they may get satisfactions within their subcultures , their lifestyles preclude full participation in things that “ really count ” psychologically ( e.g. , parenthood , social honor ) .
In reaction , traditional theory holds that rebels will mock those who are productive , even as they envy and resent them .
Besides the preoccupation by homosexuals with sex , traditionalist psychiatrists have catalogued a higher incidence of personality characteristics suggesting psychological disturbance and an inability to interact successfully with others .
Dr. Edmond Bergler , who treated over a thousand homosexuals , concluded that gays tended to :
provoke attacks against themselves and then count these “ attacks ” as injustices they had suffered ,
display defensive malice toward others ,
exhibit a flippant attitude in order to cover underlying depression and guilt ,
display extreme narcissism and superciliousness ,
refuse to acknowledge accepted standards in non-sexual matters , on the assumption that the right to cut moral corners is due homosexuals as compensation for their “ suffering , ” and
be generally unreliable , also of a more or less psychopathic nature .
Dr. Irving Bieber , who performed one of the largest and most intensive psychiatric studies of homosexuals , characterized gays as “ angry , bitter people with low feelings of responsibility . ”
And Dr. Charles Socarides has emphasized the similarity of the obsessive - compulsive nature of homosexual sex acts to a drug “ fix . ”
As opposed to the traditional view , modern egalitarianism emphasizes the equivalent worth of everyone irrespective of their willingness to be productive ( after all , we share a ‘ common humanity ’ ) .
This ideology sees no ‘ linkage ’ between economic and sexual productivity and psychological well - being : those who choose to live on welfare are “ just as good ” and have the same mix of personality characteristics as those who choose to work .
The married are sexually and psychiatrically indistinguishable from those “ living together . ”
And homosexuals are psychiatrically and socially indistinguishable from heterosexuals .
Egalitarian social - psychiatric theory holds that if society would compel its members to accept everyone “ for what they choose to do or be , ” everybody ( including homosexuals ) would come to feel good about themselves .
In this ‘ brotherhood of humankind , ’ the job of creating adequate material wealth and rearing a sufficiency of well - socialized children would flow ‘ naturally ’ out of the general spirit of cooperation , decency , and acceptance that would prevail .
The Psychological Question
Are homosexuals troubled today because society unreasonably discriminates against them or are they more frequently pathological and distressed due to a psychology shaped by their choices and experience ?
Several lines of evidence suggest that the personality problems of gays are not a consequence of societal rejection , but ‘ part and parcel ’ of living the homosexual life .
Furthermore , discrimination against those with homosexual inclinations , like discrimination against the able - bodied who refuse to work , is both necessary for the greater good of society and the individual himself .
In fact , such discrimination is an attempt to prevent persons tempted by homosexuality from suffering the pathologies it induces .
The Reverse Socialization of Homosexuality
Becoming a homosexual involves a tremendous amount of reverse socialization .
Almost every child is taught to avoid feces .
Potty training explicitly teaches one to regard feces as ‘ dirty , ’ disgusting , and unhealthy .
Yet most homosexuals eventually learn to immerse themselves in feces .
Past surveys suggest the following typical sequential development of gay activity .
The median age for gays when their genitals are first manipulated by another male is 13 .
In about two more years the anus is first used for sex rather than biological relief ; and in another year or two the anus is licked for ‘ sexual fun . ’
By age 21 most gays “ have come a long way . ”
They have learned to seek and enjoy activities that would have sickened them as children .
Some go on to “ bigger thrills ” like sadomasochism , fisting ( where the fist is placed up the rectum ) , or eating feces or drinking urine .
Medically speaking , it does n’t matter whether you pursue such activity for “ fun ” or ingest waste because your salad was n’t washed — exposure to feces is unhealthy .
Psychologically , to undo the hygienic training of childhood in pursuit of adult sexual pleasure literally “ turns all the rules upside down . ”
Given the biologically and psychologically unhealthful nature of such activity , it is not surprising that the younger a person “ locks into ” a gay identity , the more disturbed he is apt to be .
Remafedi performed two studies of “ gay youth . ” A 1987 study of 29 such youngsters led him to conclude that the
“ very experience of acquiring a homosexual or bisexual identity at an early age places the individual at risk for dysfunction .
This conclusion is strongly supported by the data . ”
His 1991 study of 137 gay and bisexual youth aged 14 to 21 reinforced his previous finding :
“ For each year ’s delay in bisexual or homosexual self - labeling , the odds of a suicide attempt diminished by 80 % .
These findings support a previously observed , inverse relationship between psychosocial problems and the age of acquiring a homosexual identity . ”
Social Disruption
Over the past 50 years , 5 studies have compared substantial numbers of homosexuals and heterosexuals .
All generated results suggesting greater social disruption by gays .
In the Kinsey survey , general prison inmates ( excluding those incarcerated for sexual offenses ) were over 4 times more apt to have extensive homosexual experience than his control group .
Saghir and Robins compared 146 gays with 78 heterosexuals and reported less stability ( more lovers , more job - changing ) and more criminality among homosexuals .
Bell and Weinberg contrasted 979 gays with 477 heterosexuals and found more instability ( psychiatric , marital ) and more criminality among gays .
Cameron and Ross questionnaired 2,251 randomly - obtained respondents and reported that heterosexuals evidenced more social cohesion ( numbers and kinds of intimate relationships ) , less self - destructive behavior ( smoking , drug use , suicide attempts ) , and less endangerment of others ( via driving habits , deliberate killing ) .
The largest comparison of gays and straights on a wide range of topics and based on a random sample involved 4,340 adults in 5 U.S. metropolitan areas .
Comparing those of both sexes who claimed to be bisexual or homosexual versus those of both sexes who claimed to be exclusively heterosexual :
homosexuality was linked to lowered health
homosexuals were about twice as apt to report having had a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) ; and over twice as apt to have had at least 2 STDs ;
homosexuals were about 5 times more apt to have tried to deliberately infect another with an STD ;
homosexuals were about a third more apt to report a traffic ticket or traffic accident in the past 5 years
homosexuals were 3 times as likely to have attempted suicide , 4 times more apt to have attempted to kill someone , and about twice as likely to have been involved in a physical fight in the past year ;
homosexuals were about 5 times more apt to have engaged in torture - related sex ( sadomasochism , bondage ) ; and
homosexuals were about 4 times more likely to report having been raped .
homosexuality was associated with criminality
homosexuals were about twice as likely to have been arrested for a non-sexual crime and about 8 times more apt to have been arrested for a sexual crime ;
homosexuals were about twice as apt to have been convicted of a sexual crime and about twice as likely to have been jailed for a crime ;
homosexuals were about three times more likely to admit to having made an obscene phone call ; and
homosexuals were about 50 % more apt to claim that they had recently shoplifted , cheated on their income tax , or not been caught for a crime .
homosexuality resulted in weaker human bonds
only about half as many homosexuals had gotten married and , if married , were much less apt to have children ;
homosexuals averaged less than a year of sexual fidelity within either their longest homosexual or heterosexual relationship ( heterosexuals averaged between 5 to 10 years of fidelity ) ; and
if married , homosexuals were about 3 times more likely to cheat on their spouse .
These results echo the largest comparative study of straight and gay couples , which reported that the average length of time together averaged about 3 years for gay and lesbian couples vs. 10 years for married heterosexuals .
Additionally , “ cheating ” was inevitable :
“ all [ gay ] couples with a relationship lasting more than five years have incorporated some provision for outside sexual activity . ”
Importance of Social Cohesion
While reverse socialization explains a significant portion of the pathologies exhibited by homosexuals , their comparative lack of social cohesion is important also .
A national survey of 5,182 adults analyzed the gender , age , and kinds of people nominated as being intimately related to the respondent .
Compared to heterosexuals , homosexuals exhibited less “ relational connectedness ” to those of the opposite sex or in different generations .
70 % of the intimates reported by homosexuals were their sex as compared to 47 % for heterosexuals ( see Figure 1 ) .
And while 35 % of heterosexuals ’ intimates were more than 20 years older or younger than the respondent , only half as many of the homosexuals ’ intimates were .
Homosexuals more narrowly focused their affections and interests on those of their own age and sex ; they tended to be , like adolescents , peer oriented .
Fully 38 % of the intimates of heterosexuals were intergenerational blood relatives ( e.g. , parents , grandparents , children , grandchildren , etc. ) .
Only 17 % of homosexuals ’ intimates fell in the same categories .
By contrast , 47 % of homosexuals ’ intimates were unrelated friends or neighbors , compared to only 27 % of heterosexuals ’ intimates .
People have to learn to care for and care about those who are different than themselves .
Homosexuals fail to display the kind of connectedness between sexes , generations , and social classes that leads to social harmony .
If we are too focused on “ people like us , ” we help to divide society into competing groups instead of a fabric of interwoven and connected interests .
Does Societal Acceptance Make a Difference ?
Fecal exposure :
In the 1940s , Kinsey reported that about two - thirds of gays had engaged in anal / penile contact , and 59 % of gays and 18 % of lesbians had participated in oral / anal activity ( where the tongue is put in the anus ) .
San Francisco decriminalized and then accepted homosexuality .
When the Kinsey Institute did a survey there in 1970 , 96 % of gays admitted to anal / penile contact , and 89 % of the gays and 25 % of the lesbians to oral / anal activity .
Lifting the restraints upon homosexual activity appears to have increased the exposure to biological danger among those with homosexual desires .
Promiscuity : In the 1940s , 7 % of gays and 63 % of lesbians said that they had never had a ‘ one night stand , ’ while 42 % of the gays and 7 % of the lesbians said that “ over half of their partners had been ‘ one night stands ’ ( see Figure 2 ) .
By 1970 only 1 % of gays and 38 % of lesbians said that they had never had a ‘ one night stand , ’ and 70 % of gays and 29 % of lesbians reported that they had had sex only once with over half of their partners !
Acceptance did not necessarily make homosexuals ’ lives better : 35 % of gays ( vs. 11 % of heterosexual men ) and 37 % of lesbians ( vs. 24 % of heterosexual women ) had either seriously considered or attempted suicide .
Of homosexuals who had attempted suicide , the most frequent reason — which acounted for 47 % of all attempts — was disagreements with a lover .
Further , although these “ liberated ” gays reported many more lifetime sexual partners than the homosexuals interviewed in the 1940s ( a median of 250 + compared to a median of 20 ) , twice as many homosexuals as heterosexuals ( 15.6 % vs. 8.4 % ) reported having “ often ” felt “ very lonely ” in the past month .
This pattern of “ liberation and acceptance ” leading to greater excesses was echoed in the results of a 1991 survey by the San Francisco Department of Public Health on the sexual risk - taking of young gay men .
As the Los Angeles Times reported , each succeeding generation “ is behaving more dangerously than the one before . ”
Our culture has yet to totally accept homosexuality .
The limited evidence available suggests that where social and legal acceptance has been implemented , the problems associated with homosexuality have increased rather than dissipated .
Cutting the bonds of sexual restraint do not “ free ” the homosexual to live life to its fullest , but rather increase his chances of personal misery and isolation .
Impermanency
The gay lifestyle is strikingly impermanent .
Homosexuals are acutely aware that while their sexual desires will continue , few will be sexually interested in them after their 30th birthday .
Good health is frequently interrupted by bouts with alcoholism and STDs — and because their lifespan is so short ( the median age of death for gays and lesbians is probably 15 to 20 years younger than that for married heterosexuals ) , associates frequently die .
Unlike the relatively permanent satisfactions and attachments of traditional marriage and parenthood , those associated with homosexuality are fleeting .
It is far from surprising that half of gays expressed regret about their homosexuality or that four times as many would advise adolescents who were just beginning homosexual activity to stop rather than continue .
The “ gay life ” is short , lonely , and filled with cheating , insecurity , disease , and danger .
Although held captive by sexual addiction rather than brick and bars , homosexuals exhibit many of the same psychological traits as those imprisoned in death camps .
The pathologies of homosexuals fit the traditional social - psychiatric view : Happiness and well - being are earned through social and sexual productivity , not “ sexual freedom . ”
Burma 's generals have detained Aung San Suu Kyi for 13 of the past 19 years
By Jonathan Head
BBC News , Bangkok
The trial of Burma 's renowned opposition leader , Aung San Suu Kyi , is being held in secret , behind the walls of the country 's most notorious jail , the aptly named Insein Prison .
Anyone approaching the prison had to pass through two lines of barbed - wire barricades , manned by armed police .
Very few did .
Four EU diplomats were refused entry .
A small handful of sympathisers were allowed to stage a silent vigil between the two cordons .
Her lawyers were instructed not to repeat any of the testimony given in court .
It sounds like the trial of a dangerous , terrorist suspect .
But the defendants are a waif - like 63 - year - old woman and her two female companions , accused of nothing more than allowing an uninvited well - wisher , an American , who had swum across the lake to reach her home , to stay until he had recovered from his exhaustion .
Aung San Suu Kyi has spent much of the past two decades under house arrest , the last six years in such severe isolation that she has had almost no opportunity to communicate with the outside world .
Her party , which resoundingly won the last election 19 years ago , has been weakened and divided by almost constant military harassment .
Meanwhile the army , her nemesis , has more than doubled in size , has extended its control into all areas of life and now consumes around 40 % of the national budget .
Powerful figure So Ms Suu Kyi does not appear to pose much of a threat .
Yet even as she has been increasingly isolated , her potency as a symbol of the hunger so many Burmese clearly have for change and an end to military rule seems to have grown .
Aung San Suu Kyi is being held at the Insein prison in Rangoon Qualities that have sometimes provoked quiet criticism of her leadership style when she was free , like her aloofness and her stubborn adherence to principle , have made her appear more heroic as a prisoner .
Her lonely stand has won her passionate admirers across the world , including , presumably , the hapless American John Yettaw whose misguided attempt to meet her has now got her into such trouble .
There is simply no political figure in Burma who can match her crowd - pulling charisma .
And that worries the military as it prepares the ground for the country 's first election in 20 years .
Widely dismissed outside Burma as a sham , because it guarantees to preserve the predominant role of the armed forces in politics and society , this election matters a great deal to Than Shwe , the ageing , secretive general who still calls most of the shots in Burma .
It will allow him to cast off the stain of illegitimacy which has haunted Burma 's military rulers for the past two decades and give them a veneer of legitimacy .
Electoral legitimacy is something I have heard Burmese ministers go on and on about at length during my own visits there .
Their main complaint is the legitimacy Aung San Suu Kyi's party , the National League for Democracy , has always claimed from its 1990 election victory , an election the military later annulled .
This seems to infuriate them , and these ministers go to extraordinary lengths to try to discredit these claims .
Legitimacy , it seems , is a big issue for the generals , as is security .
' Than Shwe 's succession ' " Next year 's election is all about Than Shwe 's succession , " says Aung Naing Oo , a former student activist now living in exile in Thailand .
Profile : Aung San Suu Kyi
" He is obsessed with assuring his security once he steps down after the election .
So he is being very careful about who is put in key positions .
He has to make sure nothing goes wrong . "
Than Shwe has not forgotten the last time he released Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest , in 2002 , in the mistaken belief that Western sanctions would be eased in return .
They were not and she was greeted as a national saviour , mobbed by huge crowds as she travelled around the country .
A year later , dozens of her supporters had been killed or jailed by military - backed thugs , and she was back under house arrest .
That is why there is a clause in the military - drafted constitution barring anyone " who enjoys the rights and privileges of a foreign citizen " from running for office - Ms Suu Kyi , through her marriage to the late British academic Michael Aris , falls into that category .
There was never much realistic hope that she would be released before the election .
A criminal conviction now would disqualify her from contesting the election even as a candidate .
The chances are she will still be in custody when it takes place .
So what about afterwards ?
Once the generals have , in their own view , consigned the 1990 election to the history books by holding an election they are more or less guaranteed to win , perhaps then they will have the confidence to release Aung San Suu Kyi .
And perhaps , once Than Shwe , who is 76 and often in poor health , has left the scene , Burma may see a gradual softening of its repressive political climate .
But no - one is counting on it .

MAY 11 -- Meet Steven Gilmore .
The wannabe rapper tried to rob a Florida convenience store Friday night and shot an employee in the head with a BB gun in a bid to establish ' street cred ' for his nascent hip - hop career .
The 21 - year - old Gilmore , seen in the mug shot at left , admitted his harebrained scheme after he was arrested Saturday night , according to Gainesville police .
Gilmore , who also copped to a stickup of the Hungry Howie 's restaurant , told police that he thought the robberies would provide him the kind of reputation he apparently believes is required in the rap world .
According to a Gainesville Police Department report , Gilmore , wearing a bandanna over his face and carrying a BB gun , fled empty - handed from the Super Store convenience outlet after struggling with a store clerk over the weapon .
During the encounter , the clerk , Dharmedra Patel , was shot in the temple and suffered a laceration and bleeding .
The Hungry Howie 's heist netted Gilmore about $ 900 , records show , and he departed the crime scene on a moped driven by a 16 - year - old accomplice .
The aspiring rap performer 's career is now on hold as he faces attempted armed robbery and aggravated assault charges .
He is currently being held in the Alachua County Jail on the felony counts .

Have you heard about Burger King 's new Texican Whopper ?
The taste of Texas and a little , spicy Mexican " “ and they do mean little .
The ad for the new product ran only briefly in Spain and the United Kingdom before the Mexican government demanded it be pulled .
Seems they do n't like having their countrymen depicted as three - foot - tall wrestlers who wear the Mexican flag as a cape .
A flop ?
You decide .
The ad has been viewed about a half - million times on YouTube .
Here are a few more promotions that did n't go the way the marketing gurus had planned .
1. McDonald 's gives away free virus
You would n't normally expect McDonald 's to run a promotion giving away free Trojans ( Trojan viruses , that is ) .
In Japan , McDonald 's gave away 10,000 MP3 players , fully loaded with 10 free songs .
Problem is , many of them were also loaded with a QQPass Trojan virus that captured user info and sent it to hackers as soon as it was plugged into a computer .
That 's 10,000 folks who were n't necessarily lovin ' it .
2. Hell Pizza brings out the dead
This one 's kinda creepy .
New Zealand - based chain Hell Pizza ran a Halloween ad on their website depicting the skeletal remains of Sir Edmund Hillary and Heath Ledger , just months after their deaths .
The spot obviously drew complaints , but was n't pulled until November 3rd " “ definitely enough time to associate Hell Pizza with a whole lot of bad taste .
3. Pepsi's ballgame blowout
Here 's one that just happened .
Earlier this month , Pepsi offered to give away 250 pairs of Yankee Stadium opening day tickets .
But when the Pepsi reps showed up in Times Square , instead of the 250 pairs of the promised tickets , they showed up with just 100 sets , and most were for a game in June .
As one would expect , this basically led to a mob scene , with angry fans yelling " Pepsi sucks ! "  and pouring cans of soda out on the street .
Now is this the kind of hope they were talking about ?
4. Domino's has their own bailout
Have you noticed the recent trend of companies giving something back in these trying economic times ?
Car companies who suspend payments if you lose your job , restaurants that offer free food , and Domino 's giving away pizzas to anyone that types in the code " bailout . " 
Only problem is the promotion had n't actually been approved before the code got out and 11,000 free pies were given out .
Company reps blamed the error on a computer glitch , or hackers .
But Domino 's actually looked pretty good after this one for honoring the giveaway .
5. Everyone 's a Pepsi winner in the Philippines
This is an honest mistake , but it 's still pretty interesting .
In 1992 , Pepsi offered 1 million pesos to anyone finding a bottlecap with 349 printed on it .
The problem " ¦half a million bottlecaps got printed with 349 , which would have cost 18 billion dollars .
Pepsi ended up paying winners $ 19.00 , which still cost them ten million dollars .
Not only that , but bottling plants were attacked , and many Pepsi execs had to leave the country .
And you thought Yankee fans could get angry .
6. McDonald's McAfrika Burger
Also in 2002 , Norwegian McDonald 's restaurants had the bright idea to name a burger after a place where millions of people were facing starvation .
Reps said the McAfrika sandwich was based on an authentic African recipe , but that did n't stop many in Norway from accusing McDonald 's of extreme insensitivity .
McDonald 's considered donating proceeds to famine relief , but ended up allowing relief agencies to place collection boxes in participating restaurants .
I think that was the same year they considered the McTsunami filet - o- fish .
7. Carl 's Jr's winning code goes viral
And finally , file another one under the " whoops "  category .
A recent Carl 's Jr. online promotion for a free $ 2.75 " Famous Star " hamburger coupon went a little too viral .
276 winning contestants were texted a passcode and a 48 - hour - only URL where they could download their coupon .
And as the saying goes , they told two friends " ¦who each told two friends " ¦and so on " ¦and so on .
A day later , hundreds of websites were posting the URL and passcode , and the company had to shut down the promotion .
Apparently viral is n't always a good thing .

A group of conservative politicians is making headway towards a ban on topless bathing on some of Australia 's best known beaches .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Christian lawmaker and veteran morals campaigner Reverend Fred Nile has won backing from key politicians in New South Wales state , home to Sydney and its famed ocean beaches , to tighten existing laws covering nude sunbathing .
The move has provoked strong reaction from easy - going sunworshippers .
For iceowl .
It was just inside the new millennium .
In year 2000 .
Out of nowhere , I had decided I would be going to participate in a talent competition for youth .
Of course , being completely devoid of any proper talent , I decided to pool all my assets together , towards a single performance arts piece .
The culmination of my stupidity , some would say .
They were probably right .
This is a true story .
However , it has been nearly three years since it happened , so this is as true a story as my memory allows .
Which does n't necessarily mean that what is written here is exactly what happened .
Should n't be too far off though .
If you were there , and remember differently , feel free to correct me .
Background
Preparations .
Between 1999 and 2000 , I took my pyrotechnics licence .
My poetry got ( slightly ) better , and I got considerable stage and performance art experience when I was touring with a youth culture group .
I was gonna show those judges .
I teamed up with Magnus .
Now , Magnus is your non-average high school kid .
He was the guitarist in the most popular band in the place where I lived .
He was one of those communist - to - the - bone type people .
Like me , but arguably slightly less reasonable .
I would love to have called him my friend at the time , but that would be lying .
I knew of him .
I got to know him .
And , one day , out of nowhere , I walked up to him and asked if he wanted to participate in the UKM with me .
To my surprise , he said " yes " .
Which was how I ended up teamed up with one of the more popular guys in my school , to do my thing .
We talked about practicing .
We talked about it in October .
We talked about it in November .
And in December .
We met once in January , and talked it over .
In January , I suddenly realised that the UKM was less than a month away .
And despite having teamed up with Magnus , I still had n't thought out what Magnus could do for the performance .
I had already gotten a permission from the fire services to use pyro tech indoors , but what would Magnus do ?
Then I thought about it ; Magnus can do what he does best ; Talking .
So I sat down with a dictionary , and started writing down words .
Powerful words .
Words about revolutions .
Words about torture .
Names of dictators .
Words describing happiness .
Words describing beauty .
Words about discrimination and horror .
Biblical names .
References to arcane television shows .
All of these words were unconnected .
I put them on pieces of paper , and picked them out of a bowl one by one .
Then I added words to turn the random words into sentences .
The result was n't poetry .
It was pretty damn horrible .
But the words were strong .
And if everything went to plan , people would be more than busy with looking , rather than listening .
The words would be background noise .
The words , the random words that were a parody of my poetic sufferance from the year before , would be nothing but noise .
Powerful noise , but still just noise .
January went by .
I had given Magnus the " poem " , and he loved it .
He started practising to read it .
But we never practiced together .
February 3 .
Four days until the UKM , and we still had n't practiced .
We met , and had a talk .
We goofed about , and he came up with the idea of shocking as many people as possible .
Going on stage naked , or something .
I disliked the idea , but said that we should just take things the way they wanted to go .
Let the show run itself .
Then I spent 5 minutes instructing him how to use my Pyrotechnics controller and the angle grinder , and asked him kindly not to blow up any pyro while I was standing anywhere near it , as it would reduce me to a howling pile of skin and bones .
The Day of the Show
The day before the show , I was in Oslo , and had the presence of mind to walk into a theatre shop .
I purchased some white and black theatre make - up .
And I picked up a few thousand Norwegian Kroner worth of pyrotechnics devices .
The day of the show , it turned out that the fire alarm could not be turned off .
-
No , there will be so many people that we cannot turn it off
- Bad plan , missus .
- No , I am serious , we cannot turn off the fire alarm
- But it will go off .
- Well , why do n't we discuss this IF it goes off
- I am sorry to say that you obviously have no clue what you are talking about .
The room will be filled with smoke .
As a matter of fact , we will have to ask people with asthma , allergies or a weak heart to leave the room
- Eh..
You are # 4 on the programme , right ?
The one right before the break ?
The * reads * Poetry and Performance Arts ?
I am sure it will be okay .
It is normal to be a little nervous .
So I told the lady to ( gently and politely ) shove it , and called the fire department , explaining that the fire alarm would be going off in about 3 hours , but that there was nothing to worry about , and that it would be down to incompetence .
I met Magnus about 40 minutes before we were to go on stage , and we decided to paint each other .
He painted my face and upper body , and we slit the back of my T - shirt , so it could be easily ripped off .
He was dressed up in some kind of Dracula outfit .
Which seemed to fit nicely to the occation .
Before we knew of it , we were called to the stage .
My heart went from 200 to 300 bpm , and adrenaline was seeping out through every pore in my body .
But ..
We still had n't practiced !!
We do n't need no water , let the motherfucker burn
So , very unceremoniously , we walked on stage .
I lit a single candle on the front of the stage , while Magnus rigged up some sort of podium , and stood behind it .
I wired the last pyrotech things that we had unwired for safety purposes , and the audience was getting uneasy .
Please , may I have your attention .
Whatever happens to me on stage will not affect you .
I am a trained professional , and I have practised this type of shows many times .
We would , however , like you to take note of the safety exits .
Please note that there are three members of the audience who are sitting with fire extinguishing equipment .
These people are trained to do their job , but if anything should happen , please do not obstruct them .
If we turn on the lights in the room , that means you will need to leave the hall in a calm and orderly fashion .
Anyone with asthma or allergies to smoke , and anyone with a weak heart would be well advised to go drink coffee in the lobby right about now .
You are about to see the show of a lifetime .
I tossed the note with my safety announcement aside , and was smiling as I noticed that , rather than moving away or leaving the room , people were moving closer .
Suddenly , Magnus started reading the first line of the poem .
The Pain of Grueling Fires of Doom
The single strands of Hitler 's Beard
...
He was n't reading the poem .
He was proclaiming it .
The words flowing from his mouth as if he meant every word of it .
Trying to convince the audience .
Trying to evangelise its message .
Feeling proud , I bent forward to light my torches in the candle .
While reading the poem , Magnus turned towards me , and started walking .
I remember being thoroughly surprised at him obviously having learned the poem by heart .
Then I noticed him saying words I definitely did n't write .
He was ad - libbing seamlessly between my poetry and whatever showed up in his mind there and then , something he did several times during the show .
Reaching for me with his right hand , he nodded towards the bottle of petrol standing on the floor .
I understood , and threw a splash of petrol on my shirt .
Then , gently touching my shirt with my torch , I set myself on fire .
With the sound of a small dog barking , my whole shirt went up in flames .
Magnus grabbed it at my chest , which was also where the flames were strongest .
He continued ad - libbing the poem as he ripped the shirt right off my back , and held the black , burning piece of fabric above his head , as I was screaming off the top of my lungs , pretending to be hurt .
At the end of the scream , we both looked over at each other .
And the show began .
Hysterically screaming each line of the poem , Magnus started setting off pyrotech effects .
He had forgotten which effect was where , and just fired them at random .
The first effect blasted off three feet away from my leg , while I was juggling with three burning torches .
And the poem kept droning on .
I dipped my hand in petrol , and set my hand on fire .
I breathed fire off my burning hand , as Magnus started sending burning shreds of metal all over the stage with the angle grinder .
Burning sparks of metal were bouncing off my body ( and , I discovered , burning their way into my skin , but I was too high on adrenaline to notice ) , as the odd word from the poem sifted through the noise .
After ripping the angle grinder from Magnus ' hands , I did the same thing to him .
Then , as if we had practised it , we stopped , and straightened up from our fighting stances .
Letting the angle grinder spin down , the room was filled with an eerie silence .
The soft flapping sound of the flames of the torches could be heard .
Suddenly , he stuck out his tongue , and we bowed forward , touching his tongue with mine , for everybody to see .
Marilyn Manson style .
Gene Simmons style .
We noticed a photographer from the local newspaper line up to take a picture of us .
Magnus nodded at one of our major pyro effects , and I nodded back .
Standing spread - eagled on the edge of the stage , holding a torch in each hand , I felt , more than heard or saw , the blast from the pyrotech device behind me go off .
The scolding heat behind me nearly pushed me off the stage .
Already off balance , I decided to jump .
Diving face - first off a stage is not something that is generally recommended .
Especially not when you are holding firebreathing liquid in your mouth , and if you are holding two brightly - burning juggling torches .
Magnus , cuing the CD player connected to the concert - grade PA system , had Coal Chamber 's Sway ( " The Roof . .
The roof ..
The roof is on fire " , a cover of the Bloodhound Gang song . ) blasting at a disgustingly loud volume .
I was crashing towards the floor in front of the stage , in the 3 meter wide gap between the stage and the judges table , almost flattening the photographer that was kneeling to get her best shot .
On the floor , I breathed fire in the general direction of the judges , before sinking together in a big pile , and climbing , with much bravado , back on stage .
On stage , I curled to a ball , with burning torches splayed around me .
My hair was on fire .
I lay there , breathing heavily , while Magnus set off our last few pyro props ( fireballs ) .
Then , I held my breath , while Magnus bowed and took the applause from the audience .
It seemed to go on and on and on .
The curtain was drawn , and I got up .
Show is over .
The verdict
Judges panel ; " We liked your performance .
It was very powerful , but badly planned ;

SAN FRANCISCO  RealNetworks says it wants to help increase DVD sales by allowing people to copy their movie discs .
Hollywood studios say that idea will only hurt their already struggling business .
The two sides square off in a federal court here on Friday to determine who prevails .
The case is ostensibly about RealDVD , a $ 30 software program that allows users to save digital copies of Hollywood DVDs to their computers  a capability the movie industry strenuously objects to , worrying that it will stimulate piracy and undermine the budding market for digital downloads .
But the outcome of the trial , set against the backdrop of plummeting DVD sales , could also have more far - reaching effects on the future capabilities of the DVD player  a device connected to millions of television sets .
Before it started making RealDVD software for computers , Real was also developing DVD - saving software that it hoped to license to manufacturers of DVD players , according to the company ’s executives and legal filings in the case .

The Ubuntu development team has decided to change the plans and not include Plymouth technology for Ubuntu 9.10 , which means they will keep the current USplash system .
The purpose of this change is to improve the current boot time ( 35 seconds on a normal hard drive and less than 20 seconds on a disk SSD ) to less than 10 seconds in any disk .
Other features to be included in Ubuntu 9.10 are :- Kernel 2.6.31 - Default EXT4 File System -

President Obama 's speech to Congress last night might have emphasized urgency over historical accuracy when he stated , " And I believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it . "
Many inventors contributed to the rise of the car in modern - day life .
But the U.S. Library of Congress credits German inventor Karl Benz with creating the first true automobile that ran on an internal combustion engine .
Benz came out with his patented car around 1885 , or about the same time when fellow Germans Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach produced a four - wheeled automobile with a four - stroke engine .
The names of these inventors live on in modern car companies such as Daimler AG and its Mercedes - Benz division .
By contrast , U.S. automotive pioneer Henry Ford did not start rolling out his mass - produced Model T cars until 1908 .
His claim to fame lies in popularizing automobiles as a common form of transportation , according to the Henry Ford Museum .
Pedestrians and bikers may not thank him as much .
Obama 's words came during a time when struggling Detroit automotive manufacturers have cut thousands of workers .
General Motors and Chrysler have received $ 17.4 billion from Congress since December , and are asking for a further $ 21.6 billion .
Meanwhile , Americans have already begun shifting their driving habits by flocking to car - sharing services such as Zipcar .
Some even try to squeeze every possible mile out of each gas gallon by practicing hypermiling .
Those automotive manufacturers that survive seem increasingly focused on electric cars as the roadmap to the future .
But far from the placid - lookingToyota Prius and other hybrid cars of today , some of those future cars could boast a mean , green punch .
How “ The NAFTA Flu ” Exploded
Smithfield Foods Fled US Environmental Laws to Open a Gigantic Pig Farm in Mexico , and All We Got Was this Lousy Swine Flu
By Al Giordano
Special to The Narco News Bulletin
US and Mexico authorities claim that neither knew about the “ swine flu ” outbreak until April 24 .
But after hundreds of residents of a town in Veracruz , Mexico , came down with its symptoms , the story had already hit the Mexican national press by April 5 .
The daily La Jornada reported :
Clouds of flies emanate from the rusty lagoons where the Carroll Ranches business tosses the fecal wastes of its pig farms , and the open - air contamination is already generating an epidemic of respiratory infections in the town of La Gloria , in the Perote Valley , according to Town Administrator Bertha Crisóstomo López .
The town has 3,000 inhabitants , hundreds of whom reported severe flu symptoms in March .
CNN ’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta , reporting from Mexico , has identified a La Gloria child who contracted the first case of identified “ swine flu ” in February as “ patient zero , ” five - year - old Edgar Hernández , now a survivor of the disease .
By April 15 – nine days before Mexican federal authorities of the regime of President Felipe Calderon acknowledged any problem at all – the local daily newspaper , Marcha , reported that a company called Carroll Ranches was “ the cause of the epidemic . ”
La Jornada columnist Julio Hernández López connects the corporate dots to explain how the Virginia - based Smithfield Foods came to Mexico :
In 1985 , Smithfield Foods received what was , at the time , the most expensive fine in history – $ 12.6 million – for violating the US Clean Water Act at its pig facilities near the Pagan River in Smithfield , Virginia , a tributary that flows into the Chesapeake Bay .
The company , according to the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) dumped hog waste into the river .
It was a case in which US environmental law succeeded in forcing a polluter , Smithfield Foods , to construct a sewage treatment plant at that facility after decades of using the river as a mega - toilet .
But “ free trade ” opened a path for Smithfield Foods to simply move its harmful practices next door into Mexico so that it could evade the tougher US regulators .
The North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) came into effect on January 1 , 1994 .
That very same year Smithfield Foods opened the “ Carroll Ranches ” in the Mexican state of Veracruz through a new subsidiary corporation , “ Agroindustrias de México . ”
Unlike what law enforcers forced upon Smithfield Foods in the US , the new Mexican facility – processing 800,000 pigs into bacon and other products per year – does not have a sewage treatment plant .
According to Rolling Stone magazine , Smithfield slaughters an estimated 27 million hogs a year to produce more than six billion pounds of packaged pork products .
( The Veracruz facility thus constitutes about three percent of its total production . )
Reporter Jeff Teitz reported in 2006 on the conditions in Smithfield ’s US facilities ( remember : what you are about to read describes conditions that are more sanitary and regulated than those in Mexico ) :
Smithfield ’s pigs live by the hundreds or thousands in warehouse - like barns , in rows of wall - to - wall pens .
Sows are artificially inseminated and fed and delivered of their piglets in cages so small they cannot turn around .
Forty fully grown 250 - pound male hogs often occupy a pen the size of a tiny apartment .
They trample each other to death .
There is no sunlight , straw , fresh air or earth .
The floors are slatted to allow excrement to fall into a catchment pit under the pens , but many things besides excrement can wind up in the pits : afterbirths , piglets accidentally crushed by their mothers , old batteries , broken bottles of insecticide , antibiotic syringes , stillborn pigs — anything small enough to fit through the foot - wide pipes that drain the pits .
The pipes remain closed until enough sewage accumulates in the pits to create good expulsion pressure ; then the pipes are opened and everything bursts out into a large holding pond .
The temperature inside hog houses is often hotter than ninety degrees .
The air , saturated almost to the point of precipitation with gases from shit and chemicals , can be lethal to the pigs .
Enormous exhaust fans run twenty - four hours a day .
The ventilation systems function like the ventilators of terminal patients :
If they break down for any length of time , pigs start dying .
Consider what happens when such forms of massive pork production move to unregulated territory where Mexican authorities allow wealthy interests to do business without adequate oversight , abusing workers and the environment both .
And there it is :
The violence wrought by NAFTA in clear and understandable human terms .
The so - called “ swine flu ” exploded because an environmental disaster simply moved ( and with it , took jobs from US workers ) to Mexico where environmental and worker safety laws , if they exist , are not enforced against powerful multinational corporations .
False mental constructs of borders – the kind that cause US and Mexican citizens alike to imagine a flu strain like this one invading their nations from other lands – are taking a long overdue hit by the current “ swine flu ” media frenzy .
In this case , US - Mexico trade policy created a time bomb in Veracruz that has already murdered more than 150 Mexican citizens , and at least one child in the US , by creating a gigantic Petri dish in the form of pig farms to generate bacon and ham for international sale .
None of that indicates that this flu strain was born in Mexico , but , rather , that the North American Free Trade Agreement created the optimal conditions for the flu to gestate and become , at minimum , epidemic in La Gloria and , now , Mexico City , and threatens to become international pandemic .
Welcome to the aftermath of “ free trade . ”
Authorities now want you to grab a hospital facemask and avoid human contact until the outbreak hopefully blows over .
And if you start to feel dizzy , or a flush with fever , or other symptoms begin to molest you or your children , remember this :
The real name of this infirmity is “ The NAFTA Flu , ” the first of what may well emerge as many new illnesses to emerge internationally as the direct result of “ free trade ” agreements that allow companies like Smithfield Foods to escape health , safety and environmental laws .

Today the BBC published the first episode of R&DTV , a Creative Commons licensed show that users are allowed to remix , redistribute and share .
The first episode of the monthly technology show features Digg 's Kevin Rose , among others .
The BBC hopes to use BitTorrent for the distribution of future episodes .
Like many broadcasters today , the BBC is open to experimenting with online video distribution , allowing viewers to watch shows online .
However , due to complex copyright issues people are not generally allowed to share or remix the videos – until now .
For their new R&DTV production , the BBC is using a Creative Commons license , giving the viewer the freedom to redistribute and re-use the show .
To add to the excitement there are also plans to use BitTorrent to distribute the show and source material .
The BBC is one of the partners in the EU funded P2P - Next research project that uses BitTorrent technology to shape the future of web based TV delivery .
BitTorrent is very effective in reducing bandwidth costs and thanks to technology developed by the P2P - Next team it can also be used to stream TV - shows , and even live video .
The BBC is not offering BitTorrent downloads or streams for R&DTV just yet , but they do hope to use P2P - Next ( and therefore BitTorrent ) for future episodes .
This could be done by embedding BitTorrent powered streams in their site or alternatively they could offer regular . torrent downloads .
R&DTV is published in a full 30 minute version and a brief 5 minute edition offering just the highlights .
Both are available in various video formats but that ’s not all .
For every episode , all of the source material – including raw footage not used in the full show – is also included in the so - called asset bundle .
In true BitTorrent style the downloads come with a ASCII art Scene - inspired NFO file disguised as readme .
txt .
“ We ’re pretty excited and ask you to please tell us what you do end up doing with the asset bundle , so we can learn what works and what does not work and fix it next time we release another asset bundle , ” the BBC writes on the download page where the show is posted .
BBC ’s official BitTorrent compatible ASCI Logo .
We applaud the BBC for being one of the few content publishers not to shy away from BitTorrent and file - sharing in general .
We ’ve previously written about Norwegian state TV that launched its own BitTorrent tracker , but unfortunately they forbid people from redistributing or remixing their shows .
By using a Creative Commons license the BBC seems to understand that this is one of the key elements of 21st century broadcasting , and we hope to see more initiatives like this in the future .
Little - known fact : I played the pants off of Virtua Tennis 3 .
I really love the simple controls and the concept of winning by out - smarting your opponent and setting them up over several shots .
Simplicity in a sports title is really rare these days and should never be a reason to write the game off as too casual .
This year , we ’ll see online play added and even more ( sometimes better than the game itself ) mini-games .
What we wo n’t see , despite the official website ’s now outdated banner , is Virtua Tennis 2009 released in May .
According to RubyEclipse , site administrator for the Sega of America forums , the multiplatform game is delayed and will have an early June ship date .
Sega will update the game ’s information pages accordingly .
Although we ’ve received no official word on the delay , RubyEclipse mentions they are probably polishing off the Wii version .
We have seen three Virtua Tennis 2009 videos on the PlayStation Network , and I ’ll admit – the game does n’t look that much better than the first PS3 version .
But it ’s really never been about looks with this series .
I ’m excited about all of the new features and can’t wait to get my hands on the full game in June .
In the meantime , maybe Sega will release an early demo on the PSN if we ask nicely .
Their previous demo for Virtua Tennis 3 was stellar , so here ’s to hoping we ’ll see one soon .

It was one of those mornings when you wake up , smile at the blue sky , flick through the papers , and gently sink your head into your hands and weep .
Here 's what happened .
Yesterday afternoon , a London PR firm called Markettiers4dc sent the Guardian a press release promoting a documentary due to air on the Discovery Channel tonight .
The programme being touted is called Human Cloning .
In it , the press release gushed , we'd go behind the scenes with " the hugely controversial fertility scientist , Dr Panayiotis Zavos , throughout his continuing attempts to create the first cloned human being . "
The release goes on :
Reporter Peter Williams MBE – who thirty years ago made a film about the world 's first test - tube baby – was given unrestricted access to Dr Zavos ' work .
The last time Zavos was in London in January 2004 , he outraged the medical establishment by announcing that he had already transferred a cloned human embryo into the womb of an unnamed surrogate .
Later in the release , we 're told how Zavos has been forced to continue his work in a secret lab in the Middle East .
That 's mostly because what he 's trying to do is – in many countries – considered unethical , illegal or both .
Zavos has , the release continued , implanted 11 cloned embryos into four women , though none has gone on to produce a live birth .
We 're not told what did happen to them .
This is familiar publicity - grabbing territory for Dr Zavos .
In 2001 , he teamed up with the controversial Italian embryologist Severino Antinori to announce they had 10 women lined up who wanted to have cloned embryos implanted .
The two parted in acrimony some time later .
In 2004 , Zavos said he had implanted a cloned embryo into a 35 - year - old woman , so she could give birth to a clone of her husband .
Because Zavos gave no details and had not published the work , many scientists dismissed him as a charlatan .
Some of Zavos 's patients have reportedly been told that treatment would cost the same as IVF , only for the figure to rise to nearly £ 50,000 later on .
Zavos re-appeared in 2006 , when he told the Guardian he had transferred cloned embryos to five women , including one 52 - year - old Briton .
This kind of history makes enormous alarm bells clang whenever you see the person 's name again .
And so back to that press release .
I sent a note back to the PR agency saying I needed a lot more information to judge whether or not Zavos had really created cloned embryos .
I got a reply from the agency saying they would try and get some more credible evidence for the claims .
None arrived .
This morning they sent me a video clip of some embryos filmed down a microscope .
It 's impossible to tell if they are cloned embryos .
The Independent decided to splash the story on its front page this morning , and it will very probably help shift a few newspapers .
I do n't think it was wrong to cover the story .
It 's interesting .
What I despair of is that the tale that emerged is purest , spoonfed PR .
The Discovery Channel can't be faulted for wanting publicity for its programme , but for the media to play along and present it as credible and factual without anything approaching sound evidence is disappointing .
It 's galling too that I 'm only succeeding in giving it more attention now .
The media 's part in this is a sideshow of course .
The real issue is that reproductive human cloning is not remotely safe with today 's technology .
For this reason , it is illegal in the UK .
A cloned baby is likely to be miscarried , or be stillborn , or delivered with significant birth defects .
When the technology behind test tube babies was introduced in the 1970s , research in animals had already shown the technique was safe .
Conversely , almost every attempt to clone a new animal species has been marred with birth defects or worse .
To try and clone humans with today 's rudimentary expertise is reckless .
In the documentary , Zavos claims to have created cloned embryos of three dead people , including a 10 - year - old girl called Cady who died in a car crash .
The mother has , we are told , expressed an interest in having the child cloned .
This is another car crash in the making , albeit a psychological one .
A cloned baby – if it survives – will be a very different person to whoever donated the cells from which it was created .
Bringing a child up expecting it to be someone it is not is a sure - fire disaster .
It will look similar , but it wo n't behave the same way , despite its parents ' expectations .
We 'll no doubt be hearing more from Zavos in the future .
One thing I would like to see from him are the records of his failures .
What happens to the embryos that are transferred ?
How many fail to implant ?
How many are miscarried later on ?
If any grow into foetuses , what abnormalities do they have ?
If human cloning were safe , the arguments against using the technology in reproductive medicine would change rapidly and dramatically .
Attempting it with today 's imperfect technology is simply exploiting those vulnerable and desperate enough to pay for it .
Ah , the modern marvels of being able to type a few things in , click your mouse , and have a desired object delivered to your place in a few days .
Even tumultuous economic conditions do n't mean so - called ecommerce is going away ; rather , it stresses being a savvy , frugal shopper , and opens up opportunities for businesses to attract your attention .
Whether it 's buying or building , being resourceful helps you score the same great stuff at lower prices , and possibly faster delivery .
( Think MacGyver marrying the A - Team . )
The following is n't an exhaustive guide to each and every to - do under the sun , but it is experience - worn advice which I 'll gladly impart for your benefit .
It mainly concentrates on buying in the US of A , but the principles are mostly true worldwide .
I 'll also specify for the scope of this article , by " Stuff " , I mean possessions you can carry ( like a microwave ) or at the most , can transport around ( like a car ) — so , not a new house .
Let 's dive in with the spirit of Scrooge McDuck , then !
Know where you 're looking
Some questions have very easy answers .
If you 're looking for books and other sundry merchandise , you 'll almost always go right with Amazon.com .
Yes , I know it has competitors — as well as other sellers which 've partnered with it — but 2 special things call it out :
Amazon Prime -
If you 're a shopaholic , even a thrifty one , it 's currently US $ 80 / year for free 2 - day shipping .
Other details apply , but if you buy frequently enough — say , at least a dozen times a year — this will have you covered both cost - and convenience - wise .
Of course , they do this to make you buy more !
So do n't spend just because you want to , but consider how it fits your lifestyle , and try their free 1 - month trial .
Amazon 's service -
It 's not just about the raw dollar , it 's about the smile on your face .
I 've had questions about my orders and confusion about pricing , and I 've consistently received timely , pleasant replies .
That peace of mind pays for itself , and serves as a model of what you should expect elsewhere .
I give the obligatory disclaimer that I 'm not professionally affiliated with Amazon — just a happy customer many times over that cites them as an " example megahub " for many goods .
Let 's open it up …
You 'll want to be familiar with the major deals sites .
There are many out there which duplicate the same style and deals , so here are a few I check daily — they 're all stored as bookmarks in my Firefox toolbar , highly recommended for saving time via " Open All in Tabs " :
Woot - I was drawn to their flavorful copywriting .
Aside from their famed " Woot - Offs " and " Bags of crap " , they sell ONE thing a day .
Sometimes it's what you 're looking for .
Often it 's not .
But they 're full of whimsy and fun , and fill a great niche .

In the " More text but not so much that it makes your eyes fall out " dept. , they also provide a very thumbnail - ish view , with a vertically - designed navigation .

dealnews.com - Again , good use of thumbnails ( I find they make browsing a lot easier ) .
Wider layout than Dealhack , and as you gain experience , you 'll notice when the same popular deals appear on different sites .
But what I like here is the quick summary of the hottest stuff at the very top .

SlickDeals.net Forums - Disparate deals sites have forums .
Among the best is SlickDeals .
They also have their own front page , but I heart their forums because of the unadulterated spontaneity of excitement that punches through the hype .
You can smell it in the air — like the inevitable scramble for cheap hard drives before they 're OoS ( Out of Stock ) !
And to make this sound more like a restaurant guide , be sure to check out the offerings of the legendary Selma , a gothy deal - sharer who 's posted 50,000 + times .
If you feel lost , look for the thumbs - up ratings and # of thread views you can sort .

FatWallet - Finally , a site without " deals " in the name .
They tend to broadcast deals which are broadly advertised by stores themselves ( as opposed to " secret coupons " ) .
Part of the reason behind this is that they offer cashback & coupons .
I have n't really used their cashback , but I think FatWallet 's a fine overview of the more commercial ( for lack of a better term ) bargains .
Be brave to explore beyond these , and let me know what gems you uncover and have missed !
For example , RedFlagDeals.com reigns surpreme in Canada .
The jungle o' deals is thick , indeed .
By immersing yourself in deals sites , you 'll become familiar with which stores are favored by veteran dealhunters .
E.g. , you 'll often see buy.com and NewEgg mentioned for computer gear .
And a sensible way to get a grasp on various stores is to see their customer feedback on eBay ( if they have a presence there ) , or search ResellerRatings .
Do n't zoom in on outliers ( the occasional bad review ) , look for consistency .
Beyond mere observation , do chat up with your fellow dealhunters — especially those who know a lot more .
They 'll save you dollars and hardship .
Know what you 're looking for
Were you expecting something less obvious ?
That 's coming up soon !
But for now , I 'll say …
It 's fun to browse bargain sites .
It 's also time - consuming if you do it too much , and while it may inform you of what fair prices are for various items , it also tends to be unfocused .
Give yourself a direction , and at the very least , take advantage of the " deal alerts " most bargain sites make available .
These come in varying forms , but tend to work like this : you enter keyword (s ) and frequency of when you want to be notified .
They 'll ping ( via onsite notice , email , and in some cases SMS ) you when new deals are available .
This is useful , by the way , if you just missed a substantial rebate on an item and are waiting for it to come around again .
Chances are high it will ( unless an item 's being discontinued ) .
If you do n't really want a gadget , do n't fall for ad pressure to " ACT NOW BECAUSE SUPPLIES ARE LIMITED ! " because if something 's really in demand , they 'll want to sell more of it .
I rebate - waited and got my Logitech diNovo Edge keyboard for US $ 50 cheaper — a price that 'd command a fair meal !
Emphasis on rebate - waited , because …
Mail - in rebates will make you wait
a LONG time .
Not always , but often enough for it to be a point of consideration , especially if finances are tight .
You may see estimated expectations of " 6 - 8 weeks " , and these tend to be pretty common .
Thankfully , some companies like Logitech do email you to check your rebate status online , along with an estimated mail date for your cheque .
That 's why if you can't wait , do n't depend on mail - in rebates .
And be wary of companies that 've been called out by expert dealhunters as scams , because while the majority are n't , lack of communication does create that perception .
Thus , my fave kind of rebate is the instant rebate .
You may be wondering then , besides the understandable processing time , why so long a wait for MIRs ?
Wikipedia has the backstory .
Be smart about coupons & price comparison
RetailMeNot.com is n't just a beautiful site , it makes it very easy to look for discount coupons .
I 've regretted not checking here in the past because I discovered a substantial savings after I bought something — talk about buyer 's remorse !
So whenever I have a significant ( obviously relative , but a good rule of thumb is above US $ 200 ) purchase , I fire up RetailMeNot and do the groundwork .
For price comparison , Shopzilla and PriceGrabber.com are your friends .
Use them and if they 're really useful , you 'll keep using them .
Major search engines , like Google , also have their own price comparisons , and links to many others .
Through experience , naturally find what works for you .
After practicing coupons & price comparison for a few weeks , odds are high you 'll spot diminishing returns .
For instance , it 's not healthy to spend half an hour trying to save US $ 2 .
Aim for the big savings , stack coupons whenever possible ( mmmm , compound discounts ) , and be quick .
Be quick ( Part II )
Hot deals often sell out very quickly .
( Not to be confused by artificial pressure like " ACT NOW ! " mentioned above . )
That 's why it 's important for you to have a solid understanding of the context you 're involved in : for example , on deals forums , you 'll notice a few of the same posters grab deal after deal and boast about it .
( There 's a certain social bonding that comes when you become an involved member of deal - communities . )
This , like any other acquired skill , comes with extended practice .
Have your alerts set up so you can pounce on deals that matter .
The most advanced dealhunters use automation , like macros , to cut down on tedious steps and jump to the front of the virtual checkout line .
What also counts for a lot : have accounts pre-setup with payment info at the sites you want to shop from .
You want to be selective with who you give your personal info to , but if it 's a reputable store , your data should be safe , in all practical likelihood .
This saves you the trouble of having to fumble with a credit card # when it comes down to crunch time .
I once missed out on a hot MP3 player sale at Woot because I had n't signed up for an account yet — I learned my lesson !
Do n't be fooled by fake free shipping
If an item is a fine price and has free shipping , then praise be !
But , sometimes " free shipping " is deceptive , because the shipping cost is absorbed in a jacked - up item cost .
For example , I saw a pair of headphones on eBay for US $ 20 that claimed " free shipping " .
The same pair could be found elsewhere for US $ 15 with approx .
US $ 5 shipping clearly stated , so it 's really not a better deal .
The inverse is also true : beware of inordinate shipping costs .
And taxes .
A number of stores charge sales tax if you buy in - state / province / region — see Amazon 's policy — and while sometimes this is unavoidable due to a lack of alternatives , it 's worth keeping in mind .
While tax laws are out - of - scope of this article , you wo n't ever regret being prepared and being aware .
Do your best to find out a store 's shipping costs beforehand so you can factor that in ASAP .
Look for gems with eBay 's Buy It Now
eBay is synonymous with popularizing and dominating online auctions .
While it 's still famous for auctions , gems ( not just in the mineral sense ) can be found by way of many smaller stores which are trying to build their presence and business via eBay 's big visibility .
Often , this is new or refurbished / B- stock material with warranty which is sent to you not from an individual , but a company .
And it has a " Buy It Now " graphic to indicate such .
( It may or may not have a corresponding auction if you want to try your hand at getting it for lower . )
Buy It Now can be good for rarer , but not highly obscure goods .
There 're sometimes package deals — like a digital camera that comes with a case + memory card + mini - tripod + extra battery at the same cost of the camera alone elsewhere .
In my web browser , I often have one tab opened on eBay and another opened on Amazon , and I do searches and compare .
To supplement my info when it 's tough to tell , I use the comparison shopping resources mentioned above .
While it 's past , much of a dealhunter ballyhoo was made about Microsoft Live.com 's 25 % cashback through eBay ( apparently , it was 35 % last time it came ' round ) .
Being on top of opportunities like these can sweeten already honey - soaked deals .
Make sure you read the terms and conditions and revel in the savings .
Do your best to assure the clothing fits
Measure yourself accurately .
My wife stresses how important this is , because we 've been subject to inaccurate pictures and vague sense of scale when buying clothes online .
I thought a pair of pants , despite the specs , would fit me snugly .
Turns out they 're baggy as heck !
While I have n't opted for an accompanying pair of suspenders since they 're surprisingly comfy , my position still stands .
A good " fit " is also transferably applicable to non-clothing goods which you may feel compelled to see in - person , like TVs and flat panel monitors : a JPG picture can't give you its actual display quality , but if your local store 's stock costs much more than what 's online , it 's fair to compare .
( A store 's physical presence can add to the cost . )
Some stores offer 3D 360 - degree views of their merchandise , but this is still a novelty , rather than a common staple .
Still worth looking out for .
Keep customer service and return policy close
I 'll often tell you : it 's not just about the $ $ $ .
Saving a few bucks is n't worth it if you have a problem with your order and the merchants turn out to be jerks !
You 'd rather much have prompt , friendly " service with a smile " than being unheard or being treated rudely .
Consumer reviews often keep track of this , combining real stories with numerical ratings .
And your own experiences will be the most visceral .
If you 're cautious , why not send an email or make a phone call before buying anything ?
Test the waters .
See how they respond and if that makes you comfortable .
Above any human - constructed currency , feeling good and expressing our identity through what we buy is an intriguing psychological phenomenon , and great customer service goes a long way towards reinforcing our beliefs .
If a store has a brick - and - mortar presence ( like Old Navy ) , then you 'll likely be able to return merchandise to a nearby store .
If you live in the boonies , it may not as be as convenient , but good to know .
If a store only allows you to mail a package back , verify who'd be responsible for postage costs beforehand , and be intimate with their RMA policy .
A key keyphrase is : hassle - free .
Get ready to recycle
If you buy stuff online , it 's going to come in a box .
And if it arrives at your house , soon , you 'll have a whole extended family of boxes , yes sirree , with itty - bitty baby boxes , and big grandparent boxes .
So you 'll either want to use those boxes to do something else , or have them recycled or otherwise disposed of .
It 's an omnipresent , yet understated part of getting great deals .
Time - shift your holidays
Lastly , I 'll suggest something unorthodox which you may not be able to do , especially if you 're under social pressure from your family & friends .
But consider liberating yourself because of this : when is Halloween and Easter candy cheapest ?
No , not in the stretch leading up to the holiday — look at the markdown prices after !
This is easily observable in both offline and online stores , but it goes to show : when something 's out of style / season and perceived value is less , prices plummet .
By being " out of sync " with society at large and other cultural waves , you can create your own opportunities to acquire the same stuff at much - reduced prices .
Granted , I feel strongly about this because my family used to wait until after Christmas to grab boxes of bonbons and ornaments to prepare for the next year , but there 's much truth … once you break free of generic trappings .
( And I 'm partially referring to Boxing Day sales , but saturated marketing of Dec. 26th has created its own traps . )
This is awesome news if you 're flexible about traditional holidays .
Clearly not for everyone — but if you can be an exception , consider yourself exceptional .
Happy buying !
While the above should never be considered an end - all or be -all since the Art of Getting Great Deals Online will continue to adapt and evolve , I hope my personal experiences and specific suggestions will enlighten you to discover the joy of consumerism in refreshing and eclectic ways .
Devoted dealhunters know that saving money goes beyond lopping off a fraction of the price — it 's a way of life .

In an effort to “ modernize ” police tactics and surveillance , UK ’s home secretary has called for the implementation of a system that records internet contact between users , according to BBC News .
This comes in the wake of Britain ’s ruling out of a controversial proposal to set up a government database to store Internet and telephone traffic including phone numbers and email addresses .
The new system would track all emails , calls , and internet use , yet according to Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , there would be no government - run database .
“ Communications data is an essential tool for law enforcement agencies to track murderers , pedophiles , save lives , and tackle crime , ” Smith proclaimed .
Under this plan , communication service providers will be required to record internet contacts between people .
According to Smith , the new system would not record content : “ What we are talking about is who is at one end [ of a communication ] and who is at the other — and how they are communicating . ”
There is substantial opposition to this plan .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne spoke of the need for a “ careful balance between investigative powers and the right to privacy . ”
Moreover , according to Conservative home affairs spokesman Chris Grayling : “ The big problem is that the government has built a culture of surveillance which goes far beyond counter terrorism and serious crime .
Too many parts of government have too many powers to snoop on innocent people and that ’s really got to change . ”
Liesel Flashenberg grew up poor in post - World War II Detroit , but she did n’t know it .
Her mother taught her how to dress like a million bucks from month - end sales and eat like a queen on chicken necks .
Bargain hunting came as naturally as breathing .
Even after she married a well - paid corporate lawyer , she shopped at thrift stores anyway .
So it was n’t a stretch when Flashenberg , an incurable child of the ‘ 60s , decided to start teaching down - and - out women how to live richer , healthier lives .
“ Gourmet cooking on a food - stamp budget ” was her motto .
Soon hundreds of women on the ropes were learning how to turn vegetables gleaned from a farmer ’s market into pate , stretch tuna salad with white beans , and find a Cuisinart at the Salvation Army .
The food produced in the cooking school was so good , Flashenberg and her husband launched a nonprofit catering business to teach their graduates a job skill and fund the mission at the same time .
They called it Through the Kitchen Door , a social entrepreneurship that has now helped women for five years .
Then something unexpected happened :
The country plunged into a recession , and all of a sudden it was n’t just poor people interested in gourmet food at food - stamp prices .
Advertisement
Catering calls started coming in from upscale clients : a cocktail party at one of Washington ’s most prestigious law firms , a bat mitzvah for a MacArthur genius , two fancy rooftop weddings , and a Super Bowl party hosted by the bon vivant mayor of Somerset , Md. , known as much for his philanthropy and proudly gay lifestyle as for his fabulous soirees .
While professional caterers are projecting as much as a 10 % to 30 % drop in sales , business at Flashenberg ’s small company -- which operates out of a church kitchen in a remote corner of the capital near Abe Lincoln ’s summer cottage -- is booming .
Sales tripled in the last year .
“ It looks like very high - end stuff , but it ’s grounded in bargains , ” said Flashenberg , 63 , standing one recent afternoon in the bustling kitchen near a stainless - steel refrigerator donated by a Chinese restaurant that went belly up .
“ People are cutting back , so they look for quality at a more reasonable price .
With us they get a double bang for the buck -- good food and they are supporting community development . ”
The recession put a crimp in the party circuit ; whether because of shrunken portfolios or conspicuous - consumption guilt , extravagance is out , restraint is in .

“ The New York and Washington splurge parties are over , ” said Joe Dunbar , a food service industry specialist who monitors trends in the catering business .
“ Before it was caviar on canapes and the big shrimp .
Now it ’s bacon - wrapped chicken livers . ”
That is not to say thrift spells the death of elegance , as Flashenberg ’s presence attests .
Her hair is cut in a naturally silver bob .
Her outfit -- a red wool French couture coat , black Ralph Lauren pants , a silk blouse and matching geometric glass earrings -- came from thrift stores and a rummage sale .
Total cost : about $ 13 .
The same frugal ingenuity is at work in her kitchen , where students are taught cooking basics in a 20 - hour course that emphasizes flavor , health and bargains .
Such as where to find good beef tenderloin for less than half the going rate ( at a Korean supermarket ) .
Or how to turn a 4 - pound chicken purchased on sale for $ 8 into 12 meals .
( Poach the whole chicken in a soup with spices , a little white wine and plenty of cheap , seasonal vegetables to serve four .
Remove the chicken and use all but the breast with rice and more roasted vegetables for arroz con pollo that also serves four .
Take the breast and add celery , radishes , cucumbers , mayo and curry powder for curried chicken salad that serves four more .
Total cost : about $ 1 a meal . )
Balancing more expensive meats and seafood with cheap but healthful vegetables and making it all look chic on the hors d’oeuvre table is one of Kitchen Door ’s strongest selling points :
“ You put a roasted pepper spread on a little cucumber slice and pile up marinated baby shrimp , which costs next to nothing , and people think they ’re getting an expensive shrimp appetizer , ” Flashenberg said .
Advertisement
The other selling point is a clear conscience .
Much of the Kitchen Door ’s revenue goes to pay the people the company exists to help -- mostly poor immigrants , although Flashenberg recently conducted a class at a battered women ’s shelter and is starting after - school programs for at - risk teenagers .
On this afternoon , the kitchen at St. Paul ’s Episcopal is buzzing .
Trays of empanadas -- the house specialty , derived from her grandmother ’s cream cheese and butter crust -- are in the oven .
Pumpkin tiramisu filling for a conference of divorce lawyers sits in a big silver bowl .
And in the freezer , there are coconut - spiked brownies that have moved some men to propose marriage .
It ’s lunchtime , and plates of angel hair pasta with a fresh tomato sauce ( about 50 cents per serving ) begin to line up on the counter .
This is part of the tradition :
The women not only earn money working for the catering end -- $ 11 an hour , sometimes more -- they eat lunch together in the church reception hall .
Their English is strained , their stories heroic .
There is Gladys Lopez , 62 and a widow ; she abandoned her business as an aesthetician in Colombia five years ago when guerrillas threatened to kidnap her year - old grandson .

Pilar Obando , 48 , could n’t find work in Ecuador .
She worked herself into a permanent staff position and does much of the shopping .
Nancy Almeida - Hinojosa , 48 , came from Ecuador because she could n’t have a baby .
Here , she had two .
( It was n’t fertility treatment , she says , but getting away from her in - laws that did it . )
Now she dreams of owning a bakery .
It was women like these who drew Somerset Mayor Jeffrey Slavin to Flashenberg three years ago when he decided to throw himself a 50th birthday bash .
A successful real estate developer for whom money was no object , he authorized the most expensive menu the Kitchen Door staff had tackled to date : fresh figs with Gorgonzola and prosciutto , deviled quail eggs , bruschetta with smoky eggplant caviar .
He felt good about the cause he was supporting .
“ She ’s really all about the mission and not about making a profit .
She is n’t pushing the jumbo prawns , ” Slavin said in the dining room of his stone cottage as guests mingled at his annual Super Bowl party .
They were less interested in the game than in what was coming out of the kitchen : bowls of seafood paella ( Obando shopped for the vegetables ) , empanadas stuffed with wild mushrooms ( Almeida - Hinojosa made the crust ) and mini crab cakes ( Lopez served them ) .
Advertisement
“ Croob , uh , crob , uh , crab cake ? ”
Lopez stammered , working on her English as she offered guests a sample from a tray of perfectly golden morsels the size of a 50 - cent piece .
It was her first event , but she looked like a pro .
Her grandson was safe at her home in Maryland .
And her tiny frame darted happily about the room , in black pants , white shirt and red apron marked with the company logo that pretty much told the story : a joyful stick figure , kitchen utensils in hand , dancing .

Doctors have issued a warning about excessive cola consumption after noticing an increase in the number of patients suffering from muscle problems , according to the June issue of IJCP , the International Journal of Clinical Practice .
" We are consuming more soft drinks than ever before and a number of health issues have already been identified including tooth problems , bone demineralisation and the development of metabolic syndrome and diabetes " says Dr Moses Elisaf from the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Ioannina , Greece .
" Evidence is increasing to suggest that excessive cola consumption can also lead to hypokalaemia , in which the blood potassium levels fall , causing an adverse effect
on vital muscle functions . "
A research review carried out by Dr Elisaf and his colleagues has shown that symptoms can range from mild weakness to profound paralysis .
Luckily all the patients studied made a rapid and full recovery after they stopped drinking cola and took oral or intravenous potassium .
The case studies looked at patients whose consumption ranged from two to nine litres of cola a day .
They included two pregnant women who were admitted with low potassium levels .
The first , a 21 year - old woman , was consuming up to three litres of cola a day and complained of fatigue , appetite loss and persistent vomiting .
An electrocardiagram also revealed she had a heart blockage , while blood tests showed she had low potassium levels .
The second also had low potassium levels and was suffering from increasing muscular weakness .
It turned out she had been drinking up to seven litres of cola a day for the last 10 months .
In a commentary on the paper , Dr Clifford Packer from the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Centre in Ohio relates the strange case of the ostrich farmer who returned from the Australian outback with muscle weakness .
He had been drinking four litres of cola a day for the last three years and drank up to 10 litres a day when he was in the outback , causing a rapid reduction in his potassium levels .
He also relates a puzzling case he saw in his own clinical practice , which was solved when the patient turned up at his office with a two - litre bottle of cola in the basket of his electric scooter .
It turned out he routinely drank up to four litres a day .
He refused to stop drinking cola , but halved his consumption and the muscle weakness he had been complaining of improved .
In 2007 the worldwide annual consumption of soft drinks reached 552 billion litres , the equivalent of just under 83 litres per person per year , and this is projected to increase to 95 litres per person per year by 2012 .
However the figure has already reached an average of 212 litres per person per year in the United States .
It appears that hypokalaemia can be caused by excessive consumption of three of the most common ingredients in cola drinks - glucose , fructose and caffeine .
" The individual role of each of these ingredients in the pathophysiology of cola - induced hypokalaemia has not been determined and may vary in different patients " says Dr Elisaf .
" However in most of the cases we looked at for our review , caffeine intoxication was thought to play the most important role .
This has been borne out by case studies that focus on other products that contain high levels of caffeine but no glucose or fructose .
" Despite this , caffeine free cola products can also cause hypokalaemia because the fructose they contain can cause diarrhoea . "
The authors argue that in an era when portion sizes are becoming bigger and bigger , the excessive consumption of cola products has real public health implications .
" Although most patients recover when they stop drinking cola and take potassium supplements , cola - induced chronic hypokalaemia can make them more susceptible to potentially fatal complications , such as an irregular heartbeat " says Dr Elisaf .
" In addition , excessive consumption of any kind of cola can lead to a range of health problems including fatigue , loss of productivity and muscular symptoms that vary from mild weakness to profound paralysis .
" We believe that further studies are needed to establish how much is too much when it comes to the daily consumption of cola drinks . "
Dr Packer agrees that the problem needs to be addressed .
" Cola drinks need to be added to the physician 's checklist of drugs and substances that can cause hypokalaemia " he says .
" And the soft drink industry needs to promote safe and moderate use of its products for all age groups , reduce serving sizes and pay heed to the rising call for healthier drinks . "

WASHINGTON Most Americans seem to reject the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba .
According to a Washington Post / ABC poll , 57 percent of Americans now oppose the policy .
A survey by Bendixen & Associates shows that only 42 percent of Cuban - Americans continue to back it .
I have been conflicted on this issue for years .
Until not long ago , I favored the embargo .
As an advocate for free trade , I would normally have called such a measure an unacceptable restriction on the freedom of people to trade with whomever they pleased .
But I thought that trading with a regime that had killed , jailed , exiled or muzzled countless of its citizens for decades was not a worthy objective , as it would also preserve that dictatorship .
Any transaction with Cuba would also benefit the government .
After all , the authorities were already skimming 20 percent of the remittances from Cuban - Americans and 90 percent of the salary paid to Cubans by non-American foreign investors .
Eventually , I admitted to myself that there was an intolerable inconsistency in my thinking .
No democracy based on liberty should tell its citizens what country to visit or whom to trade with , regardless of the government under which they live .
Even though the Castro brothers , Fidel and Raul , would obtain a political victory in the very short run , the embargo could no longer be justified .
But this is not the reasoning coming from the most vocal critics of U.S. sanctions these days .
Many of them fail to even mention the fraud that is a system which bases its legitimacy on the renunciation of capitalism and at the same time implores capitalism to come to its rescue .
There is also an endearing hypocrisy among those who decry the embargo but devote hardly any time to denouncing the islands half - century tyranny under the Castros .
Another risible subterfuge attributes the catastrophe that is Cubas economy on Washingtons decision to cut off economic relations in 1962 after a wave of expropriations against American interests .
The amnesiacs conveniently forget that in 1958 , Cubas socioeconomic condition was similar to Spains and Portugals and the standard of living of its citizens was behind only those of Argentines and Uruguayans in Latin America .
Many of the critics also seem to suffer what French writer Jean - Francois Revel used to call moral hemiplegia a tendency to see fault only on one side of the political spectrum : I never heard Cubas champions complain about sanctions against right - wing dictatorships .
Sometimes , sanctions work , sometimes they dont .
A study by Gary Hufbauer , Jeffrey Schott , Kimberly Elliot and Barbara Oegg titled  Economic Sanctions Reconsidered  analyzes dozens of cases of sanctions since World War I .
In about a third of them , they worked either because they helped to topple the regime ( South Africa ) or because they forced the dictator to make major concessions ( Libya ) .
Archbishop Desmond
Tutu told me a few months ago in San Francisco that he was convinced that international sanctions were crucial in defeating apartheid in his home country .
In the cases in which the embargo worked , the sanctions were applied by many countries and the affected regimes were already severely discredited or weakened .
In the cases in which sanctions have not worked Saddam Hussein between 1990 and 2003 , and North Korea today the dictatorships were able to isolate themselves from the effects and concentrate them on the population .
In some countries , a certain sense of pride helped defend the government against foreign sanctions which is why the measures applied by the Soviet Union against Yugoslavia in 1948 , China in 1960 and Albania in 1961 were largely useless .
In the case of Cuba , the Castro regime has been able to whip up a nationalist sentiment against the U.S. embargo .
More significantly , it has managed to offset much of the effects over the years in large part because the Soviets subsidized the island for three decades , because the regime welcomed Canadian , Mexican and European capital after the collapse of the Berlin Wall , and because Venezuela is its new patron .
But these arguments against the U.S. embargo are mostly practical .
Ultimately , the argument against the sanctions is a moral one .
It is not acceptable for a government to abolish individual choice in matters of trade and travel .
The only acceptable form of economic embargo is when citizens , not governments , decide not do business with a dictatorship , be that of Burma , Zimbabwe or Cuba .
Teaching copyright to schoolkids is a recent innovation , one spurred in large part by the fantastical growth and amazing ease of digital copying — both legal and illegal .
Most such programs have been drawn up by rightsholders in a not - so - subtle attempt to bolster their business models .
For instance , " Think First , Copy Later : Respecting Creative Ownership " may have some educational value , but the title makes clear that this is not the kind of dispassionate material that belongs in our nation 's classrooms .
Now , the Electronic Frontier Foundation has launched a curriculum of its own in an effort to " give students the real story about their digital rights and responsibilities on the Internet and beyond . "
But if the rightsholder - produced material stresses the " responsibilities " side of the equation a bit too heavily , the EFF leans predictably the other way .
The Web - based EFF curriculum is called , simply , " Teaching Copyright . "
It makes clear that students should not infringe copyright , but this is secondary to extended discussions about the VCR , the photocopier , audio cassettes , and blank CDs — technologies that each posed challenges to copyright holders .
In a classroom exercise on P2P music sharing , the class is asked to consider the case of a " 12 - year - old girl in Toledo " who is sued for file - sharing .
" The 12 - year - old girl downloaded the songs , but she did n't know she was doing anything illegal , " we are told .
" She found the files on a site that was free to access , but there were no warning signs that the bands did n't authorize the site .
She 's a huge fan of these bands — she owns all of their CDs and just wanted to hear the new songs . "
As for the bands she downloaded , we learn that one wants her to pay for the music but the other " has a different perspective and supports music file - sharing technology , even encouraging fans to download its latest album of MP3s for free or for whatever they want to pay .
Band B believes P2P file - sharing helps promote its music and encourages an even wider spectrum of music to be heard . "
Needless to say , these are not the sort of perspectives stressed in " Think First , Copy Later . "
The material is all accurate , as is the curricula of most rightsholders .
But it 's striking just how different the emphases are in these materials .
The EFF 's curriculum rightly says that P2P is n't just for copyright infringement because " NASA is using BitTorrent to distribute massive photographs ; BitTorrent is used to cheaply distribute the Linux operating systems that are free to users . "
This is absolutely true , and absolutely important .
But the material glosses quickly over the absolutely epic levels of infringement taking place on P2P networks .
Perhaps those are just " fair use , " perhaps they should be monetized through a blanket license , but they are the major concern of rightsholders and seem at least worth discussing in more depth .
Instead , the EFF curriculum suggests that students read Cory Doctorow , Lawrence Lessig , or a paper called " Why Would Thomas Jefferson Love Napster ? "
Again , great ideas , but not necessarily a complete picture of a complex debate .
The curriculum seems to presuppose , in fact , that students have already been bombarded with rightsholder concerns to the point that these can almost be left out of the discussion .
An included " copyright quiz " does make clear that copying entire chapter of Harry Potter novels would not be fair use and that downloading one 's favorite music is likely copyright infringement .
And the EFF perspective helpfully educates kids about Creative Commons licensing , fair use , and the public domain — topics that too often get short shrift in such material .
The stakes in the " curricula wars " are high , since states like California have now mandated copyright education in the classroom .
Whoever writes the textbooks can influence what students will learn ; even if it's all technically correct , emphasis counts for a lot .
