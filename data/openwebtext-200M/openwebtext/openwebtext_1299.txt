In this case , it looks like Amazon is attempting to pull off the first , but in fact it 's hard to tell whether they are serious , or just adopting a flawed strategy .
Either way , I believe they will eventually have to admit defeat .
What 's the " same old " part all about ?
There are two alternate behavioral flavors : ( 1 ) try and set a de facto standard that you control , perhaps even obtaining a near monopoly in the process ( the " winner takes all " strategy ) , and ( 2 ) pit your standard against another , where your standard gives you some relative , if not absolute , advantages ( the " our team vs. their team " strategy ) .
Ah yes —
" The more things change , the more they stay the same . "
Is n't that how the old saw goes ?
Or , in the more impatient parlance of today , simply " Same old , same old . "
So perhaps it should be no surprise that the old proverb would also hold true in the rough and tumble world of standards .
And that is the case , not only generally , but more particularly in the suddenly hot war over eBook reader formats .
This time around , though , there are a few new and interesting twists ( on which more later ) .
Here 's the background , if you have n't been following the eBook contest .
For years , some companies have tried to sell the public on the concept of electronic books with little success , largely because reading a book on a laptop or desktop simply is n't as appealing as reading from the old fashioned paper format .
What was needed was a brand new " form factor " ( as the consumer electronics industry calls it ) that made sense .
Which is what eventually came along .
Just as Apple 's iPhone validated the concept of the Smart Phone , leading dozens of other vendors to accelerate their own development efforts to hop on the bus , Amazon 's addition of wireless capabilities ( and low book prices ) to its Kindle eBook reader finally hit the right buttons .
The Kindle sold enough units to prove that the public would indeed read eBooks if they had the right platform , and the land rush towards exploiting this new digital device opportunity was on .
Just how successful has the Kindle been ?
Jeff Bezos reports that in the case of titles Amazon offers in both paper and electronic form , 48 copies are now digitally shipping for every 100 that leave the loading dock in tangible form .
That ominous creaking sound you hear is the sound of a venerable paradigm shifting .
There 's just one catch : if you buy a book from Amazon , you 'll only be able to read it on a Kindle ( unless you can find another device that has licensed the rights to use Amazon 's proprietary formats ) .
That 's because Amazon decided to use a proprietary format , called AZT , to display the books it sells for viewing on the Kindle .
And that , of course , is where the " same old , same old " part comes in .
Did Amazon need to come up with it 's own format in order to sell books ?
Of course not .
There have been a number of open standards , and standards sets , developed over the years , one of which ( ePub , a suite of publication , packaging and container standards created by the IDPF ) is both mature and widely implemented in other devices .
The Sony Reader supports ePub .
So does the new Barnes & Noble Nook .
Even the iPhone supports ePub .
Adobe Digital Editions ?
Yup , even though Adobe obviously supports its own PDF formats for eBooks as well .
But not Amazon .
Why ?
Perhaps Jeff Bezos is trying to take a page from the Steve Jobs playbook .
After all , the Apple App Store has been a huge success .
Apple Apps are sold only by Apple , and developed only to run on Apple products .
But there are a number of significant differences .
Consider these , for example :
Apple makes its money selling hardware ; Amazon hits its revenue numbers by selling books .
iTunes and Apps are bringing real money to the Apple bottom line , it 's true , but their principle value is to increase the attraction of the far more profitable iPhone and Touch ; the Kindle 's biggest value is as a way to lower Amazon fulfillment costs and increase the number of books each customer buys each year .
You can buy music from anyone and play it on an iPhone , so there is no reason not to buy an iPhone even if you already own music ; but for now you can only buy books from Amazon if you want to read them on a Kindle .
And there 's where the clue about Amazon 's standards strategy presumably comes in : a customer will only be likely to buy one Kindle , but will hopefully buy many books , year after year , from Amazon .
If that customer does n't want to buy multiple eBook readers ( who would ?
They 're expensive ) , that means that she will need to buy all of her books from Amazon .
Conjoin that with Jeff Bezos ' stated desire to offer every book every written in electronic form , and there you have it : a plan to set a standards - baited trap to conquer the world of book selling .
One format .
One seller .
One dominant vendor — Amazon as the Google of book selling .
Can Amazon pull it off ?
The answer , I think , is no .
And by trying to go for the gold , Bezos may throw away his early lead in eBook sales to boot .
The reasons rate another short list , again using Apple for comparison :
Apple 's business model has always been to make lots of money per unit sale , pulling in fat margins on products that have become commodity items for its competitors .
That means that even if Apple only gains a small percentage of the global smart phone market it can still be enormously successful — as it already has been .
It can sustain this edge by out - designing and out - innovating the competition , exploiting a competence it has consistently demonstrated for many years .
Amazon , on the other hand , can only sell books on eBook readers — a commodity item susceptible tailor made for a race to the bottom price war .
Unless Amazon can be as successful at designing eBook readers as Apple is at designing computers of all sizes , Amazon will lose .
Apple , of course , has been designing hardware and software since the dawn of the PC Age , while Amazon , well , you get the picture .
Result ?
Amazon will only be able to compete on price , using the Kindle as a very expensive loss leader .
e Book readers are n't the only platform on which people will read books — they are already doing so on cell phones and smart phones .
There are not only formidable competitors in the smart phone marketplace ( including Apple ) , but the phone market has other drivers and players ( most notably the telecom companies ) that are far larger than Amazon .
On this chess board , Amazon barely rates pawn status .
There 's another little company out there called Google , and Google has launched its own smart phone operating system — it 's called Android , it 's taking off , and it could run an eReader , too .
Google is launching its Chrome operating system soon as well .
Finally , Google is well along in the process of digitizing every book in the world — and it is n't doing so out of public spirit .
It 's planning on you and me actually reading those books — in the Cloud — and it's expecting you to read some Google ads on your way to get there .
But wait — there 's more .
Remember that new twist I mentioned ?
As it happens , two of the most implacable enemies in the world are also uniting behind the ePub standard .
I refer , of course , to the Peoples Republic of China ( a/k/a , " Mainland China " , to those that live in Taiwan ) and Taiwan ( a/k/ a " Formosa " to those that live in the PRC ) .
It seems that the two arch enemies have decided to ignore their differences when it comes to , yes , eReader standards .
That 's what the two governments announced last week , and the facts of interest run deeper .
For example , Prime View International , a Taiwanese company , is the contract manufacturer of the Kindle .
It also recently bought E-ink Corporation , the developer and patent holder behind the displays used by just about every eReader today .
Prime View and other Taiwanese manufacturers are already selling eBook readers in China .
One sales partner is China Mobile — with 513.5 million subscribers .
In short , the world is moving to the ePub standard , with Amazon as , apparently , the primary holdout .
That means that it will be in everyone 's best interests to optimize every device ( except the Kindle ) to the ePub standards , and to convert every book to the ePub standard .
Amazon , on the other hand , will need to support its hardware and format standard all by itself .
Of course , not being a hardware or software company , it will need to rely on…oh yes …the Taiwanese to supply them with the sort of cutting edge technology to be able to beat … .
Hmmm .
That may be a problem .
The moral of the story , of course , is the usual one : standards are a great way to create big markets fast , for everyone 's benefit , vendors and customers alike .
If competitors get together and all adopt the same standard , they can then compete in other ways — cooler hardware and software features , better service offerings , and so on .
The result ?
Everybody competes for a fair share of a much bigger pie , and customers get a broader and less expensive range of products and services to choose from .
There 's another old proverb that goes like this : those that forget history are doomed to repeat it — and that holds true in commerce as well .
So I 'd think twice before spending too much of your Christmas budget on a Kindle for that someone special .
It 's a shame , though , that Jeff Bezos does n't get it .
And it will be an even bigger shame for Amazon 's stockholders if he does n't wise up soon .

Germany ’s Reichstag in Berlin is set to become the first parliamentary building in the world to be powered 100 percent by renewable energy .
Soon the entire country will follow suit .
Germany is accelerating its efforts to become the world ’s first industrial power to use 100 percent renewable energy — and given current momentum , it could reach that green goal by 2050 .
A new Roadmap published by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment sketches out the route the world ’s largest exporter plans to take to switch over completely to renewable energy , and add 800,000 to 900,000 new cleantech jobs by 2030 as it does so .
To overhaul key parts of the German economic juggernaut while it is hurtling down the highway , the roadmap lays out an integrated approach , involving measures for greater energy efficiency as well as a steady expansion of all types of renewable energy and a stronger focus on research and development into the next generation of green technologies .
“ It ’s ambitious , but Germany can be running on renewable energy by 2050 if there is the political will , ” said David Wortmann , Director of Renewable Energy and Resources at Germany Trade and Invest , a government body supporting the country ’s renewable energy sector .
In 2008 , the percentage of renewables in Germany ’s primary energy consumption was 7.3 , but that figure is predicted to increase to 33 percent by 2020 as the country thunders on ahead of other European countries in renewable energy development .
According to the plan laid out in the roadmap , a raft of new energy efficiency measures , including the construction of a smart grid , should reduce the country ’s primary energy consumption by 28 percent in the next twenty years from 13,842 PJ ( peta- joules ) in 2007 to 12,000 PJ in 2020 and 10,000 PJ in 2030 , slashing billions off the bill that the country has to pay for increasingly costly energy imports .
By 2020 , 30 percent of the electricity consumed in Germany is set to be coming from renewable energy sources , with wind energy contributing the most at 15 percent , bioenergy second with 8 percent and hydropower third with 4 percent .
By 2015 , photovoltaics are expected to reach price parity and so become commercially viable .
Making optimal use of Germany ’s natural wind resources concentrated along the northern coastlines , huge offshore wind parks , placed in the North Sea , should have the capacity to generate as much as 10,000 MW , feeding electricity into a smart national grid able to transport the energy from the north and east of the country or from the south and west with optimal efficiency using high voltage direct current ( HVDC ) .
The Roadmap estimates that by 2030 , as much as 50 percent of Germany ’s electricity will be coming from renewable energy sources .
In twenty years time , a smart grid interconnected with the entire European electricity grid will be in place .
Solar energy will be imported via Italy from the solar thermal plants operating in the sun drenched deserts of North Africa .
At a cost of € 6 billion [ US $ 8.12 billion ] the national power grid comprising 60,000 kilometers will have been expanded by 850 kilometers and upgraded by around 2015 .
It is estimated that introducing tighter energy efficiency measures will reduce total electricity demand in Germany by 10 percent to 550 TWh per year by 2020 .
Electric powered cars will be racing down the country ’s Autobahns using batteries charged from renewable energy sources , slashing the need for oil and reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
David Wortmann concedes that the current economic crisis has hit the country ’s renewable energy sector , but believes that the industry will emerge leaner and fitter .
“ The technical capacity is available for the country to switch over to green energy , so it is a question of political will and the right regulatory framework .
The costs are acceptable and they need to be seen against the huge costs that will result if Germany fails to take action to cut its carbon emissions , ” he said .
He said that Germany plans to use all the renewable energy sources at its disposal — wind , solar , geothermal , hydropower and biomass — in an optimal mix .
Wortmann had strong praise for government plans to invest more into research .
“ Germany has been a center of innovation in renewable energy technologies for years .
There is a real desire to see it continue to be a place where new central renewable energy technologies are developped .
Not only the government , but also companies are focussing more resources on research , ” he said .
He predicted that bioenergy would play a key role in the country ’s future energy mix , but only where it was sustainable and did not compete with food crops or supplies .
Biomass in Germany is currently growing at the fastest pace of all the renewables , and has , for the first time , overtaken hydropower as a source of electricity .
In 2008 , biomass supplied 3.7 percent of the electricity consumed in Germany , up from 3.1 percent in 2007 , while wind power ’s share increased by 0.1 percent , up from 6.4 percent in 2007 to 6.5 percent in 2008 .
Biomass ’s share is predicted to grow rapidly thanks to continuous innovations and new technologies .
One example is a biogas electricity plant developed by Dr. Michael Stelter of the Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems in Dresden that uses only compost and waste .
The plant not only produces 30 percent more biogas , but it also does it in about a third of the time of conventional plants using food crops .
And thanks to a new procedure for breaking down cellulous molecules in compost and waste using enzymes , the period needed for fermentation has been reduced from around 80 days to 30 days .
( See lead image of the plant , above . )
To optimize efficiency , the biogas is pumped into fuel cells that operate at 850 degrees centigrade , allowing the plant to achieve a conversion rate of biogas to electricity of 40 to 55 percent .
When taking the plant ’s electricity and thermal efficiency together , the fuel cell has a conversion rate of 85 percent .
A pilot plant with a generating capacity of 1.5 kilowatts of electricity will debut at the Hannover Fair this April , but the researchers plan to develop a 2 - MW biogas plant .
With new research institutes and projects constantly being launched across Germany , many more breakthroughs can be expected , helping Germany to become the world ’s first green energy economy .

Team Assignments Hootsuite is one of the oldest and most popular social media management tools .
But we recommend Hootsuite to smaller companies .
Larger corporations are likely to be better served by programs with a few more features and greater functionality than Hootsuite can offer ( right now ) .
The other reason we recommend this service primarily to small businesses is the user limitations that come with each account .
Depending on your subscription type you may only be able to have 1 user , and Hootsuite caps out at 10 authorized users .
That said , Hootsuite is a powerful and versatile productivity tool .
The dashboard is user - friendly and designed so that , no matter how small your social media team , you can produce a lot of high - quality content very quickly .
Social media calendars , post monitoring , and custom analytics make it easier to see what your most successful social media campaigns have been .

I received an e mail from “ Ernie ” this morning ( whose database of rightwing conspiracist sources can be found in the blogroll on the right ) :
Conspiracy theorists will love this !
If you reverse the letters in the word “ I - L- L - U - M - I - N - A - T - I ” it comes out “ I - T - A - N - I - M - U - L - L - I ” ….
Type http://www.itanimulli.com/
into your browser and hit “ enter ” and you ’re taken to the home page of the National Security Agency !
I tried it and it works , which sent me on a Google chase .
First up was a spookily crepuscular You Tube video , in which a heavily shadowed figure murmurs about some of the mystical semantical properties of the mirror form of the word “ Illuminati ” : break it up into syllables and it says “ It and I am You ” ; the two “ L ”s with their final “ I ” can be construed to mean “ to hell with I . ”
As the commentator says , “ this is an interesting way to look at words … .
I think more people should look into the purpose and nature of words and you could find a lot more than looking for sentences .
A sentence is like a prison sentence–when you start on that path , you ’re looking into too much information and too much of it is wrong and and too much of it is opinion and so forth .
But it ’s right in front of your eyes , if you actually really look for it and look for it in the simplest way . ”
A graphic on the screen points out that the mirror form of “ evolution ” phonetically spells out “ know it you love . ”
But what about the NSA link ?
Is this or is this not proof that the United States government is a bought - and - paid - for subsidiary of the New World Order ?
“ Anonymous Coward , ” a poster at Godlike Productions.com , figured out that someone had purchased the domain name “ itanimulli.com ” and is redirecting clickers to the NSA site .
The owner of “ itanimulli.com ” ( he traced him through http://www.who.is.com) turns out to be John Fenley of Provo , Utah , a robot enthusiast and inventor .
But lest you think that settles the matter , Anonymous Coward notes that spelling words backwards is a :
A basic Illuminati technique – a left / right mirror image .
Remember George Dubya holding the book upside down on the morning of 9 - 11 ?
Yup – another up / down mirror image .
Oh , and btw , the name of that book was “ My Pet Goat ” .
Goat – get it ?
Bapho ’s nic..
Do n’t understand “ nic ” but Bapho is Baphomet , of course , the goat - headed demon that the Templars supposedly worshipped .
A variation of the 19th century French occultist and magician Eliphas Levi ’s famous image of Baphomet appeared on the cover of Leo Taxil ’s sensational book Les Mystères de la franc - maçonnerie dévoilés ( 1886 ) –a book that supposedly revealed the existence of Masonic Palladism or devil worship , but which its author revealed was a colossal hoax in 1897 .
( See my Boing Boing post on Hoaxes , Celebrities and the Net for more . )
Perhaps John Fenley is following in Taxil ’s footsteps .

Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina is under investigation for possible violations of the law in a letter and robo - call campaign it launched to oppose health care reform .
As Raw Story reported last month , the insurer — the largest in the North Carolina market — sent out letters to its customers informing them of an average 11 percent increase in their premiums .
ADVERTISEMENT
Shortly after , those customers received a mailer from BCBS urging them to write to Sen. Kay Hagan ( D - NC ) and ask her to oppose health care reform .
That drew outrage from some BCBS customers , who marked up the insurer ’s postage - paid form letter to Sen .
Hagan so that it would read as a letter of support for health care reform ( see picture below ) .
The Institute for Southern Studies reported this week that BCBS ’s letter campaign , and a follow - up robo - call campaign , are now the focus of North Carolina legislators , 20 of whom wrote to the state ’s attorney general asking for an investigation .
FacingSouth reports :
20 North Carolina lawmakers — 19 Democrats and one Republican — asked the state attorney general and insurance commissioner to examine the mailers and follow - up automated “ robo- calls ” requesting that Blue Cross customers urge US Sen .
Kay Hagan to oppose the creation of a public option to compete with private insurers .
According to the letter … the lawmakers are concerned that Blue Cross violated the intent of the Do Not Call Registry by using an exemption for a prior business relationship to engage in political advocacy .
They also say they believe the company may have violated the law by failing to provide contact information in the phone message .

Nick Pinto and Zachary Roth at TalkingPoints
Memo report that the the state ’s insurance commissioner is looking into the mailing campaign , while the state ’s attorney general is focusing on the robo-calls .
TPM reports :
Robo-calls are illegal in most situations in North Carolina .
Tax - exempt charitable and civic organizations are allowed an exception to this law — BCBS - NC is organized as a non-profit — but only if their calls clearly identify the caller , state the nature of the call , and provide contact information .

How tall would that make Bayonetta ?

The Japanese internet , bless them , has created this comparison .
The little girl is 100 centimeters — we do n't know this for sure , but , as I mentioned earlier , let 's say .
A female is then 160 centimeters and a male is , just for example , 170 centimeters .
And by the totally unscientific , totally unfounded assumption , that Bayonetta would be 250 centimeters high —
That 's over 8 feet tall !
Eight feet or over 11 heads high .
Eleven heads ?
Even SNK characters max out at about 8 or 9 heads high .

You thought AT&T was screwing unsuspecting customers into paying obscene bandwidth bills with ridiculous claims of stuff you can't do ?
Time Warner says you can't have 3 people on the internet without at least 15 M bps .
Oh , it gets worse .

According to Time Warner , unless you have at least 7 M bps internet , you can't download music , or even " Windows Media Player software . "
And you need their most expensive plan for " Super Fast Shopping Concert Tickets & Online Auctions " and watching videos .
No wonder I could n't snag Momofuku Ko reservations when I still had Time Warner !

And then there 's Cox .
By being vague , they 're a little less bad , but still perpetuating the idea you can't share photos or download music without at least a 10 M bps connection .
And WTF is PowerBoost ?
( DOCSIS 3.0 ? )
Update : Okay , it 's not some marketing name for DOCSIS 3.0 , but a tech Cox licenses from Comcast to give a little extra bandwidth for part of a download , if the tubes are clear .

Verizon is the least offensive here — while they still say you need at 7.1 M bps for streaming video , their other claims are n't totally unreasonable , and just below the chart they give you access to what the bandwidth translates to in real - world experience at each tier , like that a 50 MB album would take over 6 minutes to download with their 1 M bps connection , so you see what you 're paying for .
Advertisement
Here 's AT&T 's ridiculous chart again , which says you need at least 3 M bps to use Facebook , and at least 18 M bps to download movies .
Comcast does n't merit going into the wall of shame , surprisingly , since they just show you how fast stuff downloads at different ( theoretical ) speeds , so there 's no real fear - mongering involved .
Advertisement
The bottom line is that you have to know your own internet habits and what kind of speed you really need — do n't let your prospective ISP scare you into you paying for more bandwidth you 'd actually use .
Personally , I 'm pretty comfortable with around 20 M bps down , and 10 up .
But six is definitely tolerable , and I 'd wager for most people , unless you 've got a bunch of people watching Netflix and downloading music and playing games all at once ( like me ) .

Sanction busters are smuggling 40 tonnes of gold annually out of the Democratic Republic of Congo , a United Nations official has told the BBC .
Dino Mahtani said most of the gold was controlled by rebel groups who use the proceeds to buy arms .
Mr Mahtani , who is due to report to a meeting of the UN Security Council this week , said : " This money helps sustain them [ the armed groups ] in the field . "
Most gold is shipped to Dubai via a neighbouring state , he added .
Mr Mahtani , who co-ordinates UN arms embargo experts , told BBC File on 4 : " Recently there was a Congolese Senate report which talked of roughly $ 1.24bn ( £ 739 m ) worth of gold or 40 tonnes of material smuggled out on a yearly basis without any customs declaration . "
Rebel gold
He said the profits of this trade run into several millions of US dollars , which goes back to the armed groups in charge of the illicit trade .
" A lot of this gold is controlled by armed group networks , in particular the FDLR , which is a Rwandan - based rebel group partly composed by members involved in the 1994 genocide and who continue to operate in eastern Congo , " he said .
He added that the gold trade is one of the most significant avenues of direct finance for the armed groups .

The UN Security Council has had an arms embargo in place in DR Congo for six years following the peace accord between the government and armed groups .
Sanctions were applied to two gold - trading companies that operated out of neighbouring Uganda , but a UN investigator told File on 4 that it would be " quite easy " for people to evade the sanctions because they apply only to the companies and not to named individuals .
Secret trade Mr Mahtani , is this week to present evidence culled from travel documents , phone records and customs certificates to the Security Council , outlining how DR Congo 's gold is traded .
He is convinced that the trade is drawn from a small network of individuals and he added : " When you place companies on a sanctions list and you do n't sanction directors of those companies then it's very easy for them to simply change behaviour , set up new front companies and carry on operating .
" So this year we 've been looking at some of the directors of these companies and some of the other companies operating in this region and in this trade , and trying to focus on individuals rather than trying to nail companies against a wall , who could easily change names from one day to the next . "
The UN Security Council will have to decide whether to impose further sanctions .

President Obama took office at the height of the worst downturn since the Great Depression .
Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008 , both weak and strong financial institutions faced panic - induced runs , and by last November , job losses rose to over half a million per month .
Over the winter , any hope that the crisis might be limited to the United States was dashed as countries throughout the world began reporting breathtaking declines in GDP and trade .
The president 's first task was to stop the economic ...

The technical name for this is coitus interruptus .
Key components in the USA Patriot
Act are set to expire at the end of the year , but President Barack Obama is seeking to extend them , reversing his stark opposition in the past to the same provisions .
“ The president ’s reversal on Patriot Act reform is a major travesty , ” said Michelle Richardson , Legislative Counsel for the leading civil rights group ACLU , in an interview with Raw Story .
“ There have been many , many abuses of power in the last four years . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
These three main aspects in question allow the government to acquire private information about civilians through warrantless wiretapping of phone calls and emails , as well as seizure of records from credit reporting companies , banks , internet service providers and libraries .
Another component includes the loosening of conditions under which an individual can be accused of providing “ material support ” to terrorists .
In 2005 , then - Senator Obama pledged to filibuster a Bush - sponsored bill that included several of these exact components , calling it “ just plain wrong ” in a Senate speech .
“ Government has decided to go on a fishing expedition through every personal record or private document — through library books they ’ve read and phone calls they ’ve made , ” he declared , adding : “ We do n’t have to settle for a Patriot Act that sacrifices our liberties or our safety — we can have one that secures both . ”
ABC News reports that “ Four years ago , then Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , who taught constitutional law , voted down the same provisions along with all Senate Democrats who insisted on changes to the bill that better protected libraries , limited clandestine search warrants , roving wiretaps , and FBI gag orders . ”
“ This was the most opportune time for the surveillance authorities to reverse course , ” Richardson told Raw Story .
“ If these programs continue , more abuses of power are absolutely inevitable — there ’s no way around it .
The level of secrecy granted by Congress is very troubling . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Obama has championed the continuation of all three provisions until at least 2013 , a wish that has been granted by the Senate Judiciary Committee and two - thirds fulfilled by the House counterpart .
( The House version slaps greater oversight and restrictions on acquiring personal records of non-US citizens . )
While he has always been resolutely opposed to former President George W. Bush ’s vision of the Act , he has defended certain parts of it , and voted in 2006 to re-authorize an altered version .
“ Overall , the Obama administration has made marginal improvements but is largely a continuation of the Bush administration with respect to civil liberties , ” Richardson told Raw Story , referring to the president ’s rising acquiescence to his predecessor ’s approach .
The Patriot Act , initially pushed through Congress quickly after 9/11 by the Bush administration as an alleged necessity to combat future attacks , has long been fiercely criticized by the ACLU and other civil libertarians as a gross violation of privacy rights under the Constitution .

Salon ‘s Glenn Greenwald , a former civil rights litigator , recently wrote : “ Democrats spent so many years screaming bloody murder over Bush ’s use of indefinite detention , military commissions , state secrets , renditions , and extreme secrecy — policies Obama has largely and / or completely adopted as his own . ”
' You 've bankrupted my dad ' : 13 - year - old girl to sue Child Support Agency after legal battle left father with crippling debts
A girl of 13 is suing the Child Support Agency , which she claims is trying to destroy her ' hero ' father to pay off the mother she no longer wants to see .
Emma Chapelhow - the first child to take legal action against the CSA - says the agency has threatened to jail her father David and seize their home unless £ 43,000 in backdated payments is settled .
In a letter to the CSA , Emma said : ' I am happy living with my dad , who has spent ten years fighting for me .
He is a hero .
Landmark case : Emma Chapelhow claims legal battles have forced her father David , right , to live in a caravan to make ends meet ' I know he spent everything he had fighting for me and I know he has no money left .
My mum does not have to pay my dad for me and this is unfair . '
Mr Chapelhow , 42 , first began paying child support to his ex-partner Janette Plummer when Emma lived with her in Brighton .
He was handed the huge bill by the CSA in 2006 and told it was backdated payments based on regulations covering ' lifestyle being inconsistent with income ' .
This rule usually comes into force when one partner claims the other has undeclared income that has not been taken into account when benefit payments are first being calculated .
However , a year later - after a judge ruled Emma did not have to live with Mrs Plummer and she moved in with her father and his wife Gair - Mr Chapelhow was told he would still have to meet the bill .
The schoolgirl , who instructs her own solicitor , is now taking on the agency because Mr Chapelhow , a graphic designer , has been left with crippling debts following a ten - year legal battle in the family court .
Father and daughter claim the CSA have believed Mrs Plummer 's ' fantastical ' claims they live a luxury lifestyle without checking .
They point out that the family is currently living in a caravan while they rent out their farm house in Wellow , Nottinghamshire to make ends meet .
And the teenager claims that , four months ago , she was left in tears after bailiffs acting for the CSA allegedly threatened to take her pet pony Pringle to help meet the payments .
' Outrageous ' demands :
The CSA threatened to seize Emma 's pet pony , Pringle , to help pay £ 43,000 in backpayments it claims her father owes
Emma is suing under Article 2 of the Child Support Act 1991 , which orders CSA officials to ' have regard to the welfare of any child likely to be affected by their decisions ' .
She believes the agency 's actions breach the code because it will bankrupt her father and force her into poverty .
Emma said : ' I will take legal action because the CSA have failed to protect me and are still failing to protect me .
How can taking my home and financial stability away to pay the mother who the courts are protecting me from not affect my welfare ?'
Mr Chapelhow , who is taking joint legal action with his daughter , said : ' They are ignoring her needs as a child and putting both the CSA and the mother she no longer wishes to see before her .
' And to make matters worse , when she has written to them about possible legal action they have ignored her letters and keep writing back to me .
' Enforcement action will have no effect except to put Emma in child poverty . '
The National Association for Child Support Action said it believes Emma is the first child in England to sue the CSA .
Mrs Plummet , who lives in Brighton with her new husband - Lee , has not paid any maintenance to Mr Chapelhow since her daughter moved in with him .
She said she supported the decision to award custody to her exhusband but insisted that claims the backdated maintenance would bankrupt him are untrue .
Since it was created in 1993 the CSA has faced controversy .
According to the Department for Work and Pensions a quarter of its decisions are later ruled to be ' wrong ' .
A spokesman for the CSA said they could not comment on individual cases , but added it was not their policy to carry out enforcement orders which would affect a child 's living conditions .
About the author
( NewsTarget ) Research to further elucidate the connection between vitamin D and health is ongoing .
One major study in the works is called theamin D and Omeg - 3 Tria , or VITAL .
It is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and will enroll 20,000 participants .
Those eligible for the study are women aged 65 or older , and men aged 60 or older .
Participants must have no prior history of cancer , heart disease or stroke .
VITAL is scheduled to begin in January 2010 and will run for five years .
Vitamin D and fish oil are to be evaluated , alone and in combination , for their ability to decrease the risk of cancer , heart disease and stroke .
The impact of supplementation will also be measured for other conditions including osteoporosis , diabetes , memory loss and depression .
Another question that could be answered by this trial relates to health disparities .
African Americans are much more likely to be vitamin D deficient because of greater skin pigmentation .
They also experience higher rates of hypertension , diabetes and some cancers , compared to the general population .
Vitamin D supplementation may be one way to bring those rates down and bridge the health gap .
Participants will receive study supplements and instructions by mail .
They are asked to avoid taking any fish oil supplements of their own , and to limit their personal supplemental intake of vitamin D to 800 IU per day .
Questionnaires will be sent out annually to collect information on health , lifestyle habits and medication use .
No clinic visits are required .
This means that the accuracy of the data will depend on participant compliance with instructions and honest self - reporting .
Participants who are randomly assigned to receive vitamin D will be asked to take 2,000 IU daily , which is the current upper limit of intake set by the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) .
According to a report from the Annals of Epidemiology on vitamin D and cancer prevention , an intake of 2,000 IU of vitamin D per day will generally raise blood levels to 40 - 60 ng / mL .
Projections show that if everyone in the US and Canada attained such blood levels , approximately 58,000 cases of breast cancer and 49,000 cases of colorectal cancer could be prevented each year .
The current IOM recommendations were determined in the mid 1990 's based upon the amount of vitamin D necessary to prevent rickets and osteomalacia .
This was before epidemiological evidence had clearly shown that the amount required to achieve optimal vitamin D status and prevent chronic disease is much higher .
At present , the IOM is meeting to evaluate this new evidence and review their intake recommendations .
Monitoring blood levels of 25 ( OH ) D is the only reliable way to determine an individual 's vitamin D status , which should be used to guide dosing for that individual .
There are a number of factors , in addition to dosing , that influence blood levels , such as frequency and duration of sun exposure , distance from the equator , and skin pigmentation .
There is no mention of plans to check the blood level of participants in the VITAL study .

Anderson Cooper is fading in the ratings .
The respected CNN anchor has seen his numbers slip significantly through the past year .
His 10 p.m. show , " Anderson Cooper 360 , " has declined 62 % in total viewers and 70 % in adults 25 - 54 from November 2008 , according to Nielsen figures .
Last month , in Cooper 's time slot , Fox News ' " On the Record " attracted an average viewership of 1.9 million while " 360 " averaged 672,000 ; repeats of MSNBC's " Countdown " and HLN 's Nancy Grace show averaged 655,000 and 458,000 , respectively .
But in the ad - friendly 25 - 54 demo , those same repeats won out over Cooper with 224,000 ( MSNBC ) and 214,000 ( HLN ) .
Cooper -- who became an overnight sensation during his Hurricane Katrina coverage -- surely deserves better ratings .
From the start of 2009 , he began losing a huge chunk of his nightly audience .
So what happened ?
Let 's see :
There 's no presidential election to ramp up ratings ; there 's heavy competition from centrist CNN 's noisier rivals ( see : Fox News , the No. 1 cable news channel ) ; there 's people catching up on DVR -ed TV shows in the late evening ; then there 's the loss of Lou Dobbs in the 7 p.m. anchor chair , among other possible factors .
Work those blue eyes , Coop !

Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer passes along the latest trending estimates from the cable companies :
The first week cable estimate on UFC 106 was 330,000 , which is even lower than earliest projections we had .
UFC 104 with Lyoto Machida vs. Mauricio Shogun Rua came in at 450,000 in a cable estimate and 460,000 in a trending estimate .
Keep in mind the general rule of thumb by nature of how numbers are reported in the U.S. is that the final number since most UFC buys are in the U.S. will wind up 10 - 15 % above these original numbers , so it ’s likely Machida - Rua ends up at 500,000 , which is n’t bad , and UFC 106 winds up 360,000 to 375,000 , which for that fight is a gigantic disappointment .
Trending numbers right now are indicating about a 27 % drop from 104 .
The top per capita markets were Burlington , VT , Las Vegas , Halifax , Edmonton , Calgary , Vancouver , Toronto , Honolulu , Oklahoma City , San Diego , Los Angeles , San Antonio and Phoenix .
Payout Perspective :
UFC 104 looks to have outperformed most expectations , which is potentially a good sign for the Machida - Shogun rematch that ’s being targeted for May .
However , the results of Ortiz - Griffin have to be considered a disappointment .
Meltzer brought up an interesting point the other day in mentioning that it had been over 18 months since Ortiz last fought in the octagon , but Dana White spent the better part of the first 12 months trying to bury him in the media .
It ’s a tactic that ’s now coming back to bite him .
It also leads me to believe that the days of the classic promoter are slowly coming to an end .
The people that support MMA do so , in part , because they have a thirst for instant gratification .
However , that thirst also applies to information – they want everything at their fingertips this very second .
So , what can a promoter tell them that they can’t find out on their own ?
This is not a stupid or gullible consumer that we ’re talking about ; and , the results for Forrest - Tito support that .
The role of the new - age promoter is n’t necessarily going to change a great deal .
These individuals will still be the informational figureheads for their respective organizations , but the story telling is going to shift toward corollary or third - party content .
MMA traditionalists may scoff at the idea of comparing the sport to football , but MMA could learn a lot of things from America ’s most popular and socially accepted sport .
Who pushes the story lines and game themes that drive the NFL on a weekly basis ?
It ’s certainly not Roger Goodell , and to a large extent it ’s really not even the NFL itself .
It ’s ESPN , CBS , Fox , Sports Illustrated , Yahoo !
Sports , Rotowire , etc .
—-
Personally , I ’ve been waiting for these numbers for a while , because it gives me a chance to compare them with the regression .
Overall , I ’m somewhat satisfied .
Here ’s a comparison :
UFC 104 : 500,000
MMAPayout.com : 398,000 ( 366,000-437,000 )
UFC 106 : 360,000
MMAPayout.com : 447,000 ( 330,000 - 555,000 )
I noted in the UFC 106 Payout Perspective that a great deal of that discrepancy was due to the gate revenue being based partially on the sales for an anticipated heavyweight title fight featuring Brock Lesnar .
A weighted average more heavily skewed to the countdown figure would have been more accurate in this case .
It ’s a continual adjustment – especially with the weighted average – but it ’s a numbers - based analysis that ’s decent at predicting a solid ballpark range .

In mid-October , 2008 I found myself conducting a five day One - On - One workshop in Algonquin Park and the Muskoka region of north - central Ontario with a client from Ireland .
George was shooting with a Sinar medium format digital system while I was shooting with my Hasselblad H2 and Phase One P45 + back .
When I had a few free moments I was also testing the brand new Canon G10 and Nikon P6000 pocket digicams for an upcoming comparative review .
I had become very impressed with the Canon G10 after just a few days of earlier light - duty testing .
Each evening that week I would sit with my 15 " Macbook Pro reviewing the day ’s files .
At one point I found myself looking at raw files on - screen and not being sure if I was looking at Hasselblad P45 + files or Canon G10 files .
That includes at 100 % onscreen enlargements .
Now , I ’m no newbe .
After some 50 years in this industry I know what I ’m looking at , be it a screen blow - up or a print , and I certainly do n’t confuse how something looks on a 15 " laptop screen ( though properly profiled and calibrated ) with how it will turn out on a critically produced exhibition - quality print .
But nevertheless , I was curious about what I was seeing .
In fact I was more than curious , I was somewhat amazed .
____________________________________________________________________________________
In The Field
The next afternoon I hiked into the forest with my tripod , Hasselblad H2 and P45 + with the Hasselblad 55 - 110 mm lens attached , and photographed a lovely deep forest fall scene .
As I stood there wondering where to go next I put my hands in my vest pocket ( it was a chilly fall morning ) , and there was the Canon G10 .
Humm !
I wonder how the it would compare with the H2 /P45 + combo in a critically controlled side - by - side comparison .
Nahh !
Silly idea .
But – nothing ventured , etc , and so without a tripod mount for the G10 I simply held it firmly braced on top of the Hassy and did an exposure , framing the shot as closely as I could to what I ’d done on the Hasselblad .
That evening I looked at the files on my laptop screen , along with several other people , and we were amazed to see that the differences between the 39 Megapixel medium format system and the 15 Megapixel pocket digicam did n’t seem that dramatic – certainly not as big as one might have expected .
In fact , with the files in Lightroom I usually could n’t tell which was which without pixel - peeping .
Not having a printer on - hand , I decided to put any further evaluation on hold until I could do a critical processing of both images with my desktop system and 30 " Cinemadisplay , and then make comparison prints at my studio .
Shooting conditions :
The H2 was on a large Enduro tripod with RRS head .
Mirror lock - up was used , along with 3 second self timer and cable release .
Shots taken were critically focused by eye as well as with autofocus .
White balance was achieved through the use of a gray card , and prime focus was on the large knot in the foreground tree .
The G10 was hand - held , carefully braced atop the Hassy on the tripod .
I had no mounting plate for it , so could n’t use the tripod directly .
Also , the G10 has Image stabilization , so I guess that evens things out a bit .
Autofocus was used , as was autoexposure in Aperture priority mode .
Overall if there was any technical bias in the test it was in favour of the medium format system .
Both shots were taken at or close to each camera ’s optimum apertures to avoid quality loss due to diffraction .
____________________________________________________________________________________
At The Studio
Each file was processed from raw to the best of my ability .
Neither file was processed in either Canon ’s or Phase One ’s software , but rather in either Lightroom 2.1 for the P45 + file or a beta version of another raw processor , which I prefer to Canon ’s software .
I suppose it would have been more appropriate to use each maker ’s software , but I used what I prefer to work with , and in any event , the differences would likely have been a quibble .
I tried to match colour as best I could , but I did n’t really sweat it too much .
Different sensors reproduce colours differently , and without producing custom profiles there ’s not much to be done about it – and the difference would n’t have materially affected the results in any event .
I simply tried to make each print look as good as I could .

Figure 2
The above shows both files , sized to be roughly comparable , as one might see them side by side on a print viewing station .
Figure 3
Doing any comparison such as this is fraught with potential pitfalls because of the inherent differences in the file size and resolutions of the two cameras .
The screen grab immediately above , taken from my 30 " Cinemadisplay , is intended to show you how these files compare in Photoshop when imported at the same screen resolution .
In other words , what you ’re seeing is 15 MP vs 39 MP translated into image size rather than resolution .
____________________________________________________________________________________
On The Viewing Stand
Over a two day period I invited photographers and local industry professionals to come to my print studio and look at a series of 13X19 " prints from an Epson 3800 printer made on Ilford Gold Fiber Silk paper which were then hung side by side on my floor - standing print viewing box .
This collection of seven people included experienced photographers , people from the commercial print industry , and other trade professionals .
Between them there was at least 200 years of photographic industry shooting and printing experience .
In most cases I did not tell them what they were looking at , simply saying that I had been shooting with two cameras , and that they should divide the prints ( about a dozen ) into two piles – Camera A and Camera B .
They were asked to judge resolution , accutance , colour reproduction , highlight detail , dMax , and any other factors that they wished to consider .
The Results
In every case no one could reliably tell the difference between 13X19 " prints shot with the $ 40,000 Hasselblad and Phase One 39 Megapixel back , and the new $ 500 Canon G10 .
In the end no one got more than 60 % right , and overall the split was about 50 / 50 , with no clear differentiator .
In other words , no better than chance .
In fact it was the H2 system ’s narrower depth of field that occasionally was the only clear give - away .
Some viewers eventually figured out that the prints with the narrower depth of field were from medium format , while other photographers chose the G10 images because with its wider depth of field it created an overall impression of greater sharpness .
Needless to say there was much shaking of heads and muttering .
Could this be ?
Could a $ 500 digicam equal a $ 40,000 medium format digital system in image quality , at least in prints up to 13X19 " ( Super A3 ) ?

____________________________________________________________________________________
The Take Away
Here ’s my analysis – for what it ’s worth .
The top end of the industry has achieved very high image quality for some time .
The improvements that we ’ve seen over the past several years from medium format backs have slowed , though each new generation has given us not just more megapixels but also wide dynamic range , better high ISO performance , and other advantages .
But , the high end has now gotten so good , that the incremental improvements achieved with each new generation are smaller each year .
In other words , the graph has flattened .
On the other hand low - end cameras have had a long way to go .
In the past they have been noisy , the lenses on digicams have not been the best , and resolution as well as other aspects of image quality have often left a lot to be desired .
Each new generation of cameras though gets better than the last , and with the Canon G10 that company appears to have taken a significant step forward from its predecessor the G9 , and for that matter in my experience to any other comparable camera on the market .
The sensor and lens used in the G10 offer a marked improvement over anything comparable that ’s come before , and it shows .
To Be Clear
Let me be clear though , this comparison is not by any means definitive .
It was done for my own edification because I was having a hard time believing what I was seeing .
Now that I have had my observations confirmed by several industry pros , I am more confident in what I ’m seeing , and that those funny cigarettes that I smoked back in the ’ 60 ’s have n’t totally befuddled my judgment .
Please note that what I ’m describing here is really not new when it comes to comparing high - end 35 mm DSLRs to medium format systems .
We ’ve all done such comparisons for years , and know that the advantages of large sensors and MF systems are best seen in large prints and in critical applications .
The only thing that ’s different now is that instead of comparing an MF system with a DSLR I ’m comparing it to a digicam , though a 15 megapixel one to be sure .
Be aware as well that these comparisons fall down when prints over about 13X19 " are made .
Once the output resolution drops below 200PPI the advantages of a 39 Megapixel sensor over a 15 Megapixels sensor become evident .
And , even when smaller prints are made , cropping becomes an issue .
Also , though on prints up to 13X19 " differences are almost impossible to see , on - screen at 100 % one can fairly easily tell which files are from the G10 .
There are artifacts visible at the micro detail level and one can easily see other hints of what one is paying for .
But , where the rubber meets the road ( or more to the point where the ink hits the paper ) , in medium sized prints it ’s been almost impossible for experienced photographers who I ’ve shown these comparison prints to to tell the difference .
Scary .
One final comment .
Landscape and nature shots are one thing – models in a studio with fabrics , delicate skin tones and other challenging subjects are likely to be quite another .
Also , I have no idea how well these files might hold up to CMYK conversion .
We therefore need to keep expectations within reasons .
But , with all of these caveats , the take - away as I see it is that the new Canon G10 has crossed a threshold ; one in which an inexpensive pocket camera can produce very high quality images , at least on moderate sized prints , which is what most photographers end up making .
Will I be selling my Hasselblad and Phase One back ?
No , of course not .
Why would I ? Each system has its place and specialized function .
Indeed I ’m really excited about testing the new Phase One P65 + and to acquiring one as soon as it becomes available .
But , the next time I take a walk in the woods , or go on a family vacation , I know which camera is going to be along for the trip , nicely tucked away in my jacket pocket .
The Canon G10 .
Oh Yes – One More Thing Please do n’t write to me asking whether I think camera X or Y is as good as the G10 , or better than it , or how any of these might compare to a Hasselblad or Phase back .
That ’s not what this is about .
The point of all of this is simple .
As the industry matures the low end is improving rapidly while the high end ’s improvements are slowing down .
This is narrowing the gap , and that ’s good news for all of us .
Do n’t read too much more into it than that .
Figure 5 . Birch Tree. Algonquin Park .
Ontario .
October , 2008 Canon G10 @ ISO 80
18 mm ( 100 mm equiv ) – 1/13 sec @ f/4
The interesting side note about this shot is that it was taken hand - held at 1/13th of a second .
The combination of built - in stabilization and small focal length lenses means that slow shutter speeds –
much slower than those possible with 35 mm , and certainly medium format , are possible ,
making hand - held shots at low ISO feasible , leading to higher image quality than expected in poor light conditions .

Download Files
I ’d love to invite you over to my gallery to see these prints , but alas that is n’t possible .
So instead I ’m going to suggest that if this little experiment interests you that you make some prints for yourself .
I am therefore making the files shown for this article available for download .
These files are JPGs at maximum quality setting , and are rendered in ProPhoto RGB colour space .
Each has been processed the way that I normally would for printing , including the usual adjustments of tonality , colour and the like .
They have been input sharpened using Lightroom 2.1 , but they have not yet been output sharpened for printing .
These are NOT the raw files and each has also been slightly cropped for esthetic purposes .
Please note that these image files are intended for personal use by the viewer and may not be displayed , reproduced or used in any manner , whether in print or online , other than for the private use of the person doing the download .
These files are not public domain , and are Copyright 2008 by Michael Reichmann .
Each of these files is between between 10 and 18 megabytes in size , varying depending on content and JPG compression applied .
The anticipated bandwidth that will be used by tens of thousands of people downloading 70 Megabytes of files during the first 30 days is in the order of many Terabytes .
This is expensive for us , and though we are not charging for these downloads , we would appreciate it you would visit our online store and consider purchasing one of our download tutorials as a way of expressing your support for this site .

G10 Review
My full review of the Canon G10 , as part of a comparison with the Nikon P6000 , will appear on these pages by the end of October .
Watch for it .
____________________________________________________________________________________
The Lesson
I ’m not a moralist , in that I do n’t believe that everything is here to teach us a lesson .
But there is a lesson to be learned from this tale .
In other pursuits , let ’s take audiophile equipment for example , we have long known that it takes larger and larger amounts of money to achieve smaller and smaller incremental gains in sound quality .
Once you reach a certain plateau , the curve gets very flat , very quickly .
This is now happening ( as it was inevitable that it would ) in the field of digital photography .
Up until the last year or so it meant spending $ 5,000 to $ 8,000 to get the best DSLR image quality .
The next step above that were medium format backs at $ 15,000 to $ 30,000 .
Improved image quality to be sure , but at a serious cost .
Now , within the past six months , we have seen that trend accelerate more than ever before .
The Nikon D700 brings the D3 ’s stunning image quality to a camera costing half as much as before .
Shipping in November will be the Canon 5D MKII , which promises to offer image quality comparable to the 1Ds MKIII at a quarter the price .
This trend is inexorable !
So why should we be surprised that the just - released Canon G10 does something similar – pushing the price performance ratio even further downwards .
As Ray Kurzweil has illuminated in The Singularity is Near , once Moore ’s Law states to kick - in in earnest the rate of change becomes almost exponential .
That , my friends , is what we ’re now starting to see in the camera industry .
We can now find DVD players at the check - out counter at Best Buy for $ 20 .
Imagine what the price is leaving the factory .
That $ 20 DVD player ’s retail price includes components , manufacturing , R&D , packaging , documentation , licensing and royalties , shipping half - way round the world , import duties , and retailer margin .
Only a few years ago DVD players cost $ 1,000 .
Now they ’re $ 20 .
The camera industry is n’t going to be much different soon .
The lesson here , especially for newbies and amateurs ( the pros have always understood this ) is – stop fussing over each new camera ’s image quality .
Now , even sub - $ 1,000 cameras are able to produce exceptional image quality – likely far better than most photographers are able to execute .
Buy high end gear if you need it or want it .
But , do n’t think that the better camera is going to make you a better photographer .
As I ’ve written before – most cameras are better than most photographers .
This has always been true , and now simply more so than ever .
____________________________________________________________________________________
Postscript
And finally , to my friends in the industry – I intend no disservice or harm by this comparison .
I am not saying that a Mercedes and a Honda Civic are comparable , but I am saying that for some people they ’ll both get you where you ’re going .
The photographic industry is now the computer industry , and that means that Moore ’s Law largely holds sway .
It may appear at first read that I ’m taking a swipe at Phase One , or Hasselblad , or the medium format industry in general .
Trust me – I ’m not .
In 2001 I wrote that the 3 Megapixel Canon D30 produced files competitive with scanned 35 mm film at smaller print sizes .
I was derided and vilified then , but of course was ultimately proven correct – digital simply outperforms film , and few people today think otherwise .
Now we have a situation where pocketable digital cameras – at least so far in the form of the Canon G10 – have come of age and are able to produce professional quality images in some situations .
If I do n’t point this out someone else will , and this will happen sooner rather than later .
So be pissed off and disagree if you will , but I ca n’t do otherwise than state what I see , and what I know other knowledgeable observers will soon be seeing as well .
It ’s been said that if Moore ’s Law was applied to automobiles we ’d all be driving Rolls Royce ’s that cost $ 10 and got 1000 miles to the gallon .
As a more relevant analogy , I bought a one Terabytes drive the other day for less than $ 200 , while it was n’t that many years ago that a one Gigabyte drive cost $ 50,000 , was the size of a refrigerator , and needed to be housed in an air conditioned room .
Thats an increase of 1000:1 in storage capacity combined with a reduction of 250:1 in price .
Why should we therefore be surprised when similar improvements are seen in the photographic industry , which is now as much about silicon as anything else ?

Phil Jones , director of the research program at the center of " climategate , " temporarily stepped down from his post Tuesday .
And last week , Pennsylvania State University said it would launch an inquiry into the conduct of Michael Mann , one of its professors and perhaps the world 's most prominent paleoclimatologist .
Messrs .
Jones and Mann have both been key contributors to the U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .

OTTAWA–The great Canadian gold heist has turned out to be a $ 15.3 million combination of bad counting , bad cleaning and sales of gold slag below market value .
Royal Canadian
Mint executives will not get their bonus pay for last year after investigations into how millions of dollars ' worth of the precious metal was lost revealed it had never gone missing .
Rumours of a sophisticated heist were rampant this summer after an external audit ruled out sloppy bookkeeping as the reason there was 17,500 troy ounces more gold in the mint 's 2008 records than was actually found in its inventory .
The Crown corporation released the results of three third - party reviews Monday that management says fully account for the discrepancy .
The reviews showed more than $ 3 million worth of the government - owned gold had been unintentionally sold off as slag – gold by - products – to U.S. refineries while the rest was miscounted and never left the building .
Management at the mint blamed the situation on a volatile gold market that pushed sales of bullion up by 250 per cent .
That meant an " extremely busy " year with unprecedented amounts of slag .
Officials decided to ship a bunch out for external processing .
" Normal amounts of slag can be safely processed internally , but the large volumes in 2008 created health and safety concerns for employees , " management wrote in a summary of the external reviews .
The federal government is nonetheless displeased it cost $ 1.3 million in audits to uncover the errors .
" Despite the explanations , I am disappointed that errors have occurred , " Rob Merrifield , minister of state for transport , said in a statement Monday .
" During this time , I have held the mint accountable by ordering the mint to call in the RCMP , by suspending executive bonuses and by requiring the mint to fully explain this matter .
As a result of these findings , executives will not receive any discretionary bonuses for 2008 . "
One of the reviews discovered the errors meant profits for 2008 were actually $ 23.8 million – about $ 7 million less than what was initially reported – and that means about 800 employees were overpaid in performance bonuses for that year .
The mint is taking the money back .
Mint management has promised to do better after having learned " some valuable lessons , " according to a statement on its website .
It will count its precious metal stock every quarter instead of twice a year and also refine all its slag by - products internally .
It has hired a new metal comptroller and additional management staff , implemented a more robust accounting system , is updating how it estimates how much gold is lost during processing and will give staff more time to prepare for the counts .

Liberal MP Bonnie Crombie ( Mississauga - Streetsville ) , critic for Crown corporations , suggested third - party firms be called in regularly to oversee the counts .
" The good news is there is no theft at the mint .
Bad news ?
It ca n't count , " she said .
A new poll among 3,146 earth scientists found that 90 percent believe global warming is real , while 82 percent agree that human activity been a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures .
The survey , conducted among researchers listed in the American Geological Institute ’s Directory of Geoscience Departments * , “ found that climatologists who are active in research showed the strongest consensus on the causes of global warming , with 97 percent agreeing humans play a role ” .
The biggest doubters were petroleum geologists ( 47 percent ) and meteorologists ( 64 percent ) .
A recent poll suggests that 58 percent of Americans believe that human activity contributes to climate change .
“ The petroleum geologist response is not too surprising , but the meteorologists ’ is very interesting , ” said Peter Doran , University of Illinois at Chicago associate professor of earth and environmental sciences who conducted the survey late last year with former graduate student Maggie Kendall Zimmerman .
“ Most members of the public think meteorologists know climate , but most of them actually study very short - term phenomenon . ”
Doran said wide support among climatologists does not come as a surprise .
“ They ’re the ones who study and publish on climate science .
So I guess the take - home message is , the more you know about the field of climate science , the more you ’re likely to believe in global warming and humankind ’s contribution to it . ”
Writing in the publication Eos , Transactions , American Geophysical Union , Doran and Zimmerman conclude , “ the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long - term climate processes . ”
The remaining challenge , they write , “ is how to effectively communicate this to policy makers and to a public that continues to mistakenly perceive debate among scientists . ”
* The authors contacted 10,200 scientists listed in the 2007 edition of the American Geological Institute ’s Directory of Geoscience Departments and received 3,146 responses to their two questions : “ have mean global temperatures risen compared to pre-1800s levels ? ” and “ Has human activity been a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures ? ”
DVDs are n't the only TV gifts we can get , so here 's a list of what I want to see from my TV shows for Christmas .
I 'm almost 100 % sure the show will be canceled , and barring a truly magnificent Christmas miracle , the show will be canceled .
The ratings for the season premiere sucked , even compared to the lower end ABC shows , and the ratings were just as bad last spring .
It was a miracle even then that the show was renewed for a second season so I guess we can be grateful about .
The biting satire of the show is beyond anything on television right now , and the acting is above average .
Why wo n't people watch ?
The eighth season of the action thriller is starts on January 17 , but there no word whether the show will continue beyond the next season .
The show still pulls in decent ratings and does incredibly well for a show that has been on air so long , but the producers and actors do n't seem to be that interested in continuing the show .
While they continue making compelling stories full of twists year after year , they would be fine if they do n't come to an agreement with Fox .
But I and many others want more .
Even if there is n't Jack Bauer , I 'd watch .
After ABC promoted the show so much during the summer , I was expected something great , and instead was handed disappointment after disappointment .
There are fundamental flaws with the show that need to be resolved that I 've talked about in my reviews .
Hopefully it 'll get better when it comes back in March .
Fingers crossed !
The final scene of Alias was sweet , but lame as hell .
It was a happy ending with Sydney , Vaughn , and a random appearance of Dixon on an island .
After all the craziness of five seasons , all the writers could come up with was a scene with no real meaning .
Speaking of spy shows , I thought La Femme Nikita 's ending was better by 100 times .
It was bittersweet and fit well with the theme of the show .
With Lost winding down , I hope Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse do n't take the route of Jeff Pinkner .
Luckily the only constant is J.J. Abrams .
The new season has n't started yet and this may seem premature , but I 'm kind of a pessimist , so I do n't have high hopes for the show .
The ratings stabilized very low last season despite high hopes and promotion during prime events .
The season two finale pushed the show to the next level and from what we know about season three , the stories will be even better .
Build a wall of financial security around you and your family . . .
Judge KOs shelter kickback scheme
October 12 , 2009
By Carey Roberts
Every time we turn around , it seems , we hear of an abuse shelter being accused of discrimination , fraud , or other head - shaking irregularities .
And now a judge has ruled the entire abuse shelter industry in the state of West Virginia is wracked by conflict of interest , gender bias , and financial kickbacks .
The ménage a trois involves a government agency , a well - heeled trade organization , and 14 domestic violence shelters located around the state .
Here 's how the scratch - your - back scheme works ... Any time a couple gets married or divorced in West Virginia , they are required to cough up a $ 15 fee to the Family Protection Services Board .
That tallies up to $ 380,000 each year , a tidy sum for sure .
The Board then doles out the money to one of the 14 licensed domestic violence shelters around the state .
So far , so good .
And how does a domestic violence shelter become licensed ?
Actually , the Board does n't set its own standards  that responsibility was outsourced to the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence .
Now the plot thickens , because the Coalition was long ago hijacked by a radical feminist ideology .
I recently visited its website at www.wvcadv.org and was jolted by this neo -Marxist cant : " violence against women is a political problem , a question of power and domination .
" That 's right , shove aside the research showing women are just as likely as men to be the instigators of partner abuse .
Forget former NFL quarterback Steve McNair , shot in the chest four times in his chest by his ex-girlfriend as he slept .
Sweep under the rug the fact that alcohol abuse is linked to most cases of abuse .
In other words , the Coalition openly proclaims its belief that domestic violence is all about unfettered patriarchy .
And this group is no seat - of - the - pants operation  the trade organization 's annual budget of $ 1.2 million comfortably supports a staff of nine .
So if you 're looking for objective criteria for shelter licensure , you wo n't find it at the Coalition .
That 's because the group decrees that in order to become a certified domestic violence advocate , you have to swear fealty to the feminist catechism that " domestic violence is deeply rooted in historical attitudes towards women .
" Whether you believe that statement is laughable , bizarre , or merely one - sided , you can't become certified in West Virginia unless you take the loyalty oath .
So the ideologically - driven Coalition establishes the certification standards .
And the Board says before you can receive a penny of its money , at least one - third of shelter employees must be certified by the Coalition .
So where 's the kickback arrangement ?
Because all 14 abuse shelters around the state are members of and pay dues to  you guessed it !
 the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence .
This good - ol '- girls club does not take kindly to other groups that want to partake of the state 's abuse - prevention funding .
So finally a group called Men and Women Against Discrimination had to file a lawsuit .
The suit charged the policies of the Family Protection Services Board discriminated against male victims of domestic violence and deprived violence - prone women of access to perpetrator intervention programs .
When Judge James Stucky began to examine the case , he discovered bias pervaded the system from top to bottom .
Take Judy Smith , one of the five directors of the FPSB and head of the Rape and Domestic Violence Information Center in Morgantown .
Smith admitted  actually boasted  during her lawsuit deposition , " we do not shelter men in the shelter , even if it 's empty .
" Judge Stucky found the discrimination to be so widespread and egregious that last week he issued a summary judgment , taking all parties in the case by surprise : www.acfc.org/site/DocServer/WV_Findings_of_Fact.pdf?docID=2621
Noting the state legislature did not intend to restrict domestic violence services to the members of any one sex , he found the Board exceeded its statutory authority by delegating the standard - setting to a trade organization .
" In practice this rule excludes any persons who does not adhere to the gender biased fundamental beliefs of the Coalition , " ruled the judge .
Appalled by the illegal actions of an organization driven by a cult - like ideology , Judge Stucky concluded the Board 's policies " are null and void .
" Civil rights advocates across the nation were elated .
" Today , men and the women who love them have reason to celebrate , " notes columnist Teri Stoddard .
But she cautions the fight may not be over : " lawsuits like this will unfortunately need to continue across the country . " ©

According to a respected Old Testament scholar , it may be that the beginning of the Book of Genesis from the Bible has been mistranslated continuously ever since the book was made available in languages other than ancient Hebrew .
Professor Ellen van Wolde , who is also a respected author , adds that the sentence “ In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth ” is not an accurate translation of the meaning in the ancient texts , and that the correct translation would more closely resemble “ In the beginning God separated the Heaven and the Earth . ”
She reveals that the Hebrew verb “ bara ” does not in fact mean “ to create , ” but rather to “ spatially separate . ”
This would , in turn , imply that the planet was in fact already created before God breathed life onto it , and made the plants , animals and people , as the story in the Bible goes .
The new translation , if proven accurate , bears considerable implications for Judeo - Christian theologists and scholars , as it proves that God is not the maker of all things , as it has been painted to be over the ages .
Van Wolde , aged 54 , will present her thesis at the Radboud University , in The Netherlands , during a conference .
This is the same institution where she teaches , The Telegraph reports .
She says that the accurate translation does not imply that the Earth started with God .
The beginning of the book of Genesis is merely the introduction in a narration , she reveals .
“ It meant to say that God did create humans and animals , but not the Earth itself , ” the expert explains .
Christian scholars currently teach that God created everything around us , including the stars and the planet .
This no longer seems to be the case , according to the new translation .
“ Something was wrong with the verb .
God was the subject ( God created ) , followed by two or more objects .
Why did God not create just one thing or animal , but always more ? ”
“ There was already water .
There were sea monsters .
God did create some things , but not the Heaven and Earth .
The usual idea of creating - out - of - nothing , creatio ex nihilo , is a big misunderstanding , ” the expert says .
She concludes that the Bible is meant to say that God merely separated water from land , the sea monsters from the birds , and the Earth from the Heavens .
“ Maybe I am even hurting myself .
I consider myself to be religious and the Creator used to be very special , as a notion of trust .
I want to keep that trust .
The traditional view of God the Creator is untenable now , ” van Wolde admitts .
“ The new interpretation is a complete shake up of the story of the Creation as we know it , ” a Radboud University spokesman concludes .
USA TODAY 's Joan Biskupic reports that the Supreme Court has denied a stay of execution for John Allen Muhammad , the Beltway sniper .
Update at 12:55 p.m. ET : Muhammad , 48 , was convicted of masterminding the October 2002 random sniper killings that paralyzed the nation 's capital .
Muhammad and a minor , Lee Boyd Malvo , now 24 , were convicted of going on a three - week shooting spree that left 10 people dead and three injured .
The snipers fired at random at bystanders through a hole in the trunk of their car .
Update the 1 p.m. ET : Muhammad is scheduled to be executed in Virginia on Tuesday night .
Update at 1:05 p.m. ET : On a procedural matter , three justices wrote a separate statement -- not to dissent but to raise concerns about how the state case arrived at the court 's doorstep in this emergency fashion before the court had fully reviewed any constitutional challenge by Muhammad to his case ( in a habeas petition ) .
Justices John Paul Stevens , joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor , wrote :
By denying Muhammad 's stay application , we have allowed Virginia to truncate our deliberative process on a matter -- involving a death row inmate -- that demands the most careful attention .
This result is particularly unfortunate in light of the limited time Muhammad was given to make his case in the district court . … I do not dissent from the Court 's decision to deny certiorari .
I do , however , remain firmly convinced that no state should be allowed to foreshorten this Court 's orderly review of … first - time habeas petitions by executing prisoners before that review can be completed .

We movie - lovers are facing a problem : too much of a good thing .
A couple of films where morally flawed people are compelled to surgically remove their own limbs in order to free themselves from fiendish traps ( and learn a valuable lesson about friendship at the same time ) are fine .
Maybe three .
But we are now on Saw VI – released last month – and in my view , speaking as a fan of exposed innards , the once - scintillating formula is going stale .
The violence that was such a pleasant , mischievous innovation in the first movie is starting to seem rote , manipulative , and , yes , even a little bit sadistic .
The same could be said of the hedonists - in - the - abattoir genre .
The first time we were treated to the spectacle of innocent tourists , or hapless skiers , or self - absorbed vacationers being disembowelled by , say , renegade South American organ harvesters , it seemed like a fun idea – especially if the victims had it coming .
But lately the genre ( the Hostel and Turistas series are its leading exponents ) has begun to repeat itself .
We know the arc of the narrative , we know where it 's headed .
Changing the setting wo n't change the basic theme : the average vacationer deserves to die .
But in a few of the more recent offerings , the violence has taken on an uncomfortably gratuitous tone , as if the film - makers were depraved , diseased or in need of therapy .
However you slice it , the thrill is gone .
Going back to the same well one too many times is a problem that now afflicts film - makers in many other genres .
Examples ?
Movies with the words " Shaolin " or " Kung - Fu " in the title .
Movies based on revered graphic novels that the fans of the graphic novels start trashing when the films are still in the pipeline .
Movies about unlikely triumphs in competitions no one cares about ( ice skating , ping pong , dodgeball , air drumming ) .
Movies where everyone has to lie .
Or tell the truth .
Or say " yes " all the time .
Or something .
And , of course , teen vampire movies .
Does every US schoolgirl have to be a bloodthirsty vampire ?
Ca n't some of them be good , old - fashioned , home - grown sluts ?
Gosh , where 's Christina Ricci when you really need her ?
Finally , there have been quite enough documentaries purporting to explain what is wrong with America , as if anyone had any fresh ideas there .
The first time Michael Moore made a movie denouncing the economic system that would make him rich , it seemed amusing and powerful .
Now that he has once again stood in front of the soulless fat cats '
HQ with a bullhorn in hand demanding to see somebody really important , knowing full well no one is going to come out , the whole shtick has taken on the aroma of the graveyard .
Nobody outside of Hollywood seriously believes that Moore likes or cares about working - class people , and , for their part , working - class people are either oblivious to his existence or despise him .
Nor is anybody fooled by the faux prole headgear any more : a young man in a red baseball cap is an imp ; a middle - aged man in a baseball cap is a buffoon .
Paris is not the answer
It is said that , after three days , fish and house guests both start to stink .
The same is true of movies – by the time you get to the third in a series , the stench is palpable .
This is true whether the series is Halloween , The Ring , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or paranormal romances starring Sandra Bullock .
Around 30 years ago , New York 's Museum of Modern
Art held a brilliant film festival featuring movies that were the first flops in genres that had hitherto been packing them in .
Among the most memorable was The Yakuza , a fish - out - of - water affair about an American cop trying to solve a murder in Tokyo .
It was n't very good , but it was n't any worse than French Connection II .
Also shown was Orca , featuring Richard Harris as an amoral fisherman lured to his death by a freshly widowed killer whale .
There was nothing especially awful about either of these movies .
Orca , in fact , introduced the world to Bo Derek , and starred Charlotte Rampling as a marine biologist , which gave the profession a soupçon of glamour it had not known before and has not known since .
But each of these movies died at the box office .
Why ?
Because the public had already seen them – or movies just like them .
This is very much the situation we now find ourselves in : too much of a good thing is making us ill .
This is n't just a reaction against sequels ; it is a reaction against films that so closely resemble other films that they seem like sequels .
It is a reaction against films about shockingly articulate English gangsters .
It is a reaction against films where Juliette Binoche or Julie Delpy or Meryl Streep or Audrey Tautou or Kate Hudson discover the meaning of life in Paris .
The last film set in Paris where women did not discover the meaning of life was Taken .
In Taken they got drugged , abducted and shipped to the Middle East .
Come to think of it , maybe they did learn the meaning of life – at least in the Paris part .
It is also a reaction against films where Jennifer Aniston cannot find the right guy and never suspects that her hair may have something to do with it .
It is a reaction against films based on video games , or films where characters are trapped in video games , or films where people must enter video games to fully comprehend the evil that lurks inside video games and those that play them .
Not to mention films where young people did a bad , bad , bad thing and now must pay the price .
And , of course , it is a reaction against films that involve the war in Iraq .
Or just Iraq .
Another movie we have seen too many times is the one about a gigantic metal object floating around the edge of the solar system – something horrible has happened to its original crew , but we wo n't find out what for about 119 minutes .
Nor will its cast .
The only thing we do know about the haunted vehicle is that it looks exactly like the set from Event Horizon , which looked exactly like the set from Aliens , which looked exactly like the set from Leviathan , which looked a little bit like the set from Doom .
We can also be fairly certain the cast will consist of people we have never heard of , plus Sam Neill .
It has been said that , in space , no one can hear you scream .
This may have been true in the past , but it is no longer the case .
In space , everyone can hear you scream .
And what they can hear you screaming is this : stop making movies about places where no one can hear you scream .
Weddings from hell
What other genres have been worked to death ?
Mockumentaries .
Wayans Brothers send - ups .
Parodies in general .
Upscale remakes of downscale Asian horror films .
Films about journalists .
Films about charismatic schoolteachers .
Films where dancing or chess or cooking help save poor inner-city kids from their own worst instincts .
Honestly , folks , you can stop making these movies now .
You can stop making movies about weddings , particularly movies about women sabotaging other women 's weddings .
The formula worked well enough when Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz faced off in My Best Friend 's Wedding .
But The Wedding Planner was lame , and Bride Wars was horrendous .
Ditto Margot at the Wedding , where two of the most neurotic actresses in film history ( Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Jason Leigh ) competed to torpedo the nuptials .
Then , as if on cue , last year brought us Jonathan Demme 's Rachel Getting Married , about the perils of inviting a dysfunctional family member to the wedding .
In this case , the dysfunctional family member was the bride 's drug - addict sister who once drove off a bridge , and was too wasted to undo little brother 's seatbelt , so he drowned .
The subtext : I do n't mind you coming to the wedding , you skanky cokehead , but did you really expect to be the maid of honour ?
So what type of film should the industry be making instead ?
Well , think of what we have a shortage of .
There has n't been a top - class mob film since American Gangster .
There has n't been a sophisticated adult rom-com since Sideways .
There has n't been a really great scam film since The Spanish Prisoner .
There has n't been a full - costume , macho - man epic since Gladiator .
There has n't been a great sci - fi film since The Matrix .
And there has n't been a memorable movie about the perils of using public transport since Speed .
Actually , another film about a killer whale might not be a bad idea , either .
The genres we'd like to see
Convoluted heists
Ocean 's Twelve and Thirteen were so bad they obscured the virtues of Eleven , the last recent good caper movie .
Heists and scams are the most intellectual of crime movies , which is what makes them so tricky .
Look at Welcome to Collinwood for an example of how easily they can fail .
JG Ballard adaptations
Empire of the Sun and Crash , two masterpieces of very different kinds , showed that the late master of suburban sci- fi had a lot in him .
With numerous short story collections and 16 novels – all tiptoeing into unsettling areas no one else dared enter – surely there 's something else to be done .
Whatever happened to John Maybury 's Super - Cannes ?
Weird - female - friendship movies
What did Heavenly Creatures and Me Without You have in common ?
Both were about teenage girls who lived – unhealthily – in each other 's pockets and found rich drama therein .
A long way from the nauseating hug movies that have infested cinema for the last 20 years .
Puppet action
Team America : World Police was a one - of - a - kind stroke of genius – inspired , as we found out , by the Thunderbirds ' gronky puppet - on - a- string look .
In the age of Fantastic Mr Fox and Curse of the Were - Rabbit , when stop- motion and claymation are rendered digitally , can't we please go back to plain old wood and yarn ?
Slasher comedies
The combination of nastiness and giggles is hard to pull off – do it wrong and you 're inviting people to laugh at sadism .
Sam Raimi set the template with the 1980s Evil Dead films , Peter Jackson churned out Bad Taste and Braindead , and Shaun of the Dead was a fine recent example .
Now that we 're up to our necks in grim torture films , a little levity would be appreciated .
Andrew Pulver
I like turtles AND pizza .
Also , this is good news for me cause I could n't cook to save my life anyway ( do n't even think about it , Jigsaw ! ) .

Pictured : First direct image of planet orbiting a star similar to our Sun
An international team of scientists has made the first direct observation of a planet - like object orbiting a star similar to our Sun .
The finding marks the first discovery made with the world 's newest planet - hunting instrument on the Hawaii - based Subaru Telescope .
The object , known as GJ 758 B , could be a large exo-planet although it may also be a ' failed star , ' known commonly as a brown dwarf .
This August 2009 direct image of the potential planet GJ 758 B was taken with the Subaru Telescope 's HiCIAO instrument in the near infrared , which measures and records differences in heat .
Without the special technique employed here the star 's glare would overwhelm the light from the planet candidates
The faint companion to the sun - like star GJ 758 is estimated to be 10 to 40 times as massive as Jupiter and is a ' near neighbor ' in our Milky Way galaxy , hovering 300 trillion miles from Earth .
' It 's a groundbreaking find because one of the current goals of astronomy is to directly detect planet - like objects around stars like our sun , ' said Dr Michael McElwain , from Princeton University .
' It is also an important verification that the system - the telescope and its instruments - is working well . '
Images of the object were taken in May and August during early test runs of the new observation equipment .
The team has members from Princeton , the University of Hawaii , the University of Toronto , the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany , and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan .
The results will be published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
' This challenging but beautiful detection of a very low mass companion to a sun- like star reminds us again how little we truly know about the census of gas giant planets and brown dwarfs around nearby stars , ' said Alan Boss , from the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington .
' Observations like this will enable theorists to begin to make sense of how this hitherto unseen population of bodies was able to form and evolve . '
Brown dwarfs are stars that are not massive enough to sustain fusion reactions at their core , so they burn out and cool off as they age .
This figure shows the size comparison ( from left ) between the Sun , Earth , Jupiter , GJ 758 B and GJ 758
Aided by new varieties of viewing techniques , scientists started finding extrasolar planets ( planets beyond the solar system ) in 1992 and have located more than 400 planet - like objects so far .
Most , however , have not been directly observed , but inferred from viewing the star around which the planet orbits .
GJ 758 B is one of the first planet - like objects to be directly seen .
Of the others that have been directly viewed , most have been on larger orbits than the distance between GJ 758 B and its star , or around stars with temperatures far above the average temperature of GJ 758 or our sun .
Scientists were able to spot the object even though it was hidden in the glare of the star it orbits by subtracting out that brighter light .
To do this , they used a special advanced image attached to the Subaru Telescope .
Known as HiCIAO , it is part of a new generation of instruments specially made to detect faint objects near a bright star by masking its far more intense light .
' It 's amazing how quickly this instrument has come online and burst into the forefront , ' said Marc Kuchner , an exoplanet scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre .
' I think this is just the beginning of what HiCIAO is going to do for the field . '
Dr Michael McElwain , from Princeton University , was part of the team that discovered the potentially new planet
He added that the discovery also emphasizes that this new method of finding exoplanets - direct detection - is ' really hitting its stride . '
Finding these planets is a crucial step in answering the age - old question of the existence of extraterrestrial life .
The planet - like object is currently at least 29 times as far from its star as the Earth is from the sun , approximately as far as Neptune is from the sun .
However , further observations will be required to determine the actual size and shape of its orbit .
At a temperature of only 600 F , the object is relatively " cold " for a body of its size .
It is the coldest companion to a sun- like star ever recorded in an image .
The fact that such a large planet - like object appears to orbit at this location defies traditional thinking on planet formation .
It is thought most larger planets are formed either closer to or farther from stars , but not in the location where GJ 758 is now .
Discoveries such as this one could help theorists refine their ideas .
Telescope images also revealed a second companion to the star , which the scientists have called GJ 758 C .
More observations , however , are needed to confirm whether it is nearby or just looks that way .
' It looks very promising , ' said Christian Thalmann , one of the team 's lead scientists .

South Korean manufacturer Samsung Electronics announced this week that it has begun mass production of a new kind of memory chip that stores information by melting and freezing tiny crystals .
Known as phase - change memory ( PCM ) , the idea was first proposed by physicists in the 1960s .
Here , Nature explains how PCM works , why it has taken so long to develop and how it could change your mobile phone forever .
What 's the big idea behind PCM ?
PCM was first proposed by physicist and inventor Stanford Ovshinsky in 1968 .
It rests on a simple concept : atoms that are neatly arranged in crystals conduct electrons better than those jumbled up in a glass .
Using the crystal form as a binary ' 1 ' and the glass form as ' 0 ' it is possible to store electronic information in a crystalline cell .
Many such cells ,
Ovshinsky reasoned , could be used to create computer memory .
Unlike conventional memory , which involves moving electrons around a chip , PCM data would literally be frozen in place , even when the machine is off .
That means these devices could switch on nearly instantaneously .
So why have n't PCM chips been available before ?
PCM is simple in principle , but it is much harder to implement , says Matthias Wuttig , a physicist at RWTH Aachen University in Germany .
The main problem is with writing the information into the material .
To write in a one or a zero , the crystalline material has to be heated to high temperatures and refrozen , either in a crystal or glassy form .
In the 1960s , most of the materials that physicists tried for PCM required high currents and temperatures to crystallize .
What was the big breakthrough ?
In the 1970s and 1980s , scientists developed new classes of crystalline materials in which the atoms were held together by very weak bonds .
As a result , the materials could shift from crystal to glass very quickly .
But turning that breakthrough into a working device was not easy .
" At the time , the industry was still exploring basic transistors , " says Gregory Atwood , a senior fellow at Numonyx Memory Solutions in Rolle , Switzerland , another company that produces PCM memory .
As a result , other kinds of transistor - based memory , such as the flash memory currently installed in most mobile phones and mp3 players , were closer to the market .
The crystalline materials , notably germanium antimony telluride ( Ge2Sb2Te5 ) , were instead used to develop read - write optical discs , and they are still used in these discs today .
So why is PCM becoming more popular now ?
Flash memory , and other solid - state memory , stores information as small regions of charge -- effectively a little cluster of electrons -- on a transistor .
As the size of devices shrinks further , fewer and fewer electrons can fit , making flash and similar memories less stable at very tiny scales .
At transistor sizes of a few tens of nanometres , Wuttig says that a quantum mechanical phenomenon called " tunneling " begins to come into play .
Tunnelling allows electrons to leak out of the transistor , effectively destroying the memory .
Because PCM memory does n't rely on charge , it can theoretically be used to create ever smaller devices .
In fact , because the speed of PCM memory depends on how long it takes to melt and refreeze the crystal , the smaller each crystal cell in the device , the faster it becomes .
Wuttig 's group has recently conducted experiments with cells just 20 nanometres across .
These cells can be switched in just 16 nanoseconds -- far faster than existing technology .
Proponents hope that PCM could eventually take a substantial share of the flash memory market , worth more than $ 20 billion in 2008 .
When will these memory chips start appearing in my mobile phone ?
Very soon .
Numonyx began mass - producing 128 - megabyte ( MB ) PCM memory in December 2008 .
Although the chips are useable , they are still less powerful than the current generation of flash , and Atwood says that he thinks they will be used largely to build new prototype servers , cell phones and digital video recorders .
Samsung 's memory chip is 512MB , but that is still smaller than the current generation of flash memory .
However , the technology is developing quickly , and given the advantages of PCM and the increasing difficulties of shrinking flash , Atwood says that he thinks crystal memory will become commonplace in just a few years .
" We believe it is the next generation , " he says .
The gaming studio Electronic Arts maintains their own version of the Standard Template Library .
Despite the fact this is old news , I checked the LtU Archives and the new site , and there is no mention of EASTL anywhere .
There are quite a few good blog posts about EASTL on the Internet , as well as the the following paper , EASTL -- Electronic Arts Standard Template Library by Paul Pedriana :
Gaming platforms and game designs place requirements on game software which differ from requirements of other platforms .
Most significantly , game software requires large amounts of memory but has a limited amount to work with .
Gaming software is also faced with other limitations such as weaker processor caches , weaker CPUs , and non -default memory alignment requirements .
A result of this is that game software needs to be careful with its use of memory and the CPU .
The C++ standard library 's containers , iterators , and algorithms are potentially useful for a variety of game programming needs .
However , weaknesses and omissions of the standard library prevent it from being ideal for high performance game software .
Foremost among these weaknesses is the allocator model .
An extended and partially redesigned replacement ( EASTL ) for the C++ standard library was implemented at Electronic Arts in order to resolve these weaknesses in a portable and consistent way .
This paper describes game software development issues , perceived weaknesses of the current C++ standard , and the design of EASTL as a partial solution for these weaknesses .
This paper is a good introduction to a unique set of requirements video game development studios face , and compliments Manuel Simoni 's recent story about The AI Systems of Left 4 Dead .
This paper could be a useful inroad to those seeking to apply newer object - functional programming languages and ideas to game development .
“ A BELIEF in man -made climate change and the alleged resulting moral imperatives is capable , if genuinely held , of being a philosophical belief for the purpose of the 2003 Religion and Belief Regulations . ”
Those were the words of an English High Court judge , Mr Justice Burton , on November 3rd as he ruled that green beliefs deserve the same protection in the workplace as religious convictions .
A person 's right to believe in anthropogenic climate change , and not be hounded out of his job because of it , is now enshrined in law .
Tim Nicholson
The case on which the judge ruled was that of Tim Nicholson , who used to be “ head of sustainability ” for a residential - property firm called Grainger .
Mr Nicholson was relieved of his duties at Grainger in July 2008 and in March of this year was told by a tribunal that he could pursue an unfair - dismissal case , believing , as he did , that he had been sacked on the grounds of his eco-minded beliefs .
Mr Nicholson claims , for example , that other executives stymied his attempts to devise a carbon - management system for the firm by failing to give him the necessary data .
He also accused Rupert Dickinson , the firm 's chief executive , of “ contempt ” for his green views .
Mr Dickinson , for example , made an employee fly from London to Ireland to bring him a BlackBerry that he had left behind .
The rules on which Mr Nicholson 's case is built , namely the Equality and Employment ( Religion or Belief ) Regulations , were introduced in 2003 to protect employees from being sacked on the grounds of their religion .
They ban “ conduct which has the purpose or effect of creating an ... offensive environment ” for the employee and have since been used in many high - profile employment - tribunal cases .
One is that of Lilian Ladele , a former registrar of births , deaths and marriages , who is challenging the tribunal 's ruling in support of Islington Council 's decision to discipline her for refusing , on the grounds of her Christian beliefs , to register civil partnerships between homosexuals .
Other plaintiffs have used the rules to challenge decisions to sack them for such things as wearing a cross on a necklace , in breach of uniform rules banning jewellery .
At an earlier hearing on October 7th , Mr Justice Burton had asserted that “ if a person can establish that he holds a philosophical belief which is based on science as opposed , for example , to religion , then there is no reason to disqualify it from protection ” .
He provided a five - pronged test to shore up the ruling : the belief must be genuinely held ; it must be held for a long period of time ; it must relate to something of grave importance to humanity ; it must reach a certain level of cogency and seriousness ; and it must not trample on existing ideas of human rights .
By way of example , he said belief in the supremacy of the Jedi knights of “ Star Wars ” fame would be excluded , but he conceded that allegiance to the doctrines of Marxism or communism might not .
Whether this ruling will lead to outbreaks of unabashed socialism in accounts and Marxism in the mailroom , causing the courts to be jammed with reds , as well as greens and the pious , remains to be seen .
This correspondent has always believed in printing on both sides of paper and has been known to put paper printed on just one side back into the office printer , upside down .
Many colleagues found this practice confusing or downright annoying .
Who , then , has created an offensive environment for whom ?
The only thing that is clear is that if your correspondent should be shown the door , there is a sweeping legal precedent in his favour .
How many cyclists does it take to make a cup of tea ?
About 100 , if you run your home on pedal power .
This is the premise behind The Human Power Station , tonight 's episode of the BBC1 series Bang Goes the Theory , in which an army of cyclists provides the energy used by a typical family .
What 's interesting is not so much the amount we use , as the implication that the only way to have an eco–friendly future is to bring back slavery .
This is the conclusion of Tim Siddall of Electric Pedals , the company hired to supply the bicycles and cyclists .
For 11 hours , 100 volunteers rode furiously , getting no more than lunch and the chance to be on TV .
" They were dead excited at first , " says Siddall .
" But after five hours they had had enough of the boredom and the pain . "
One of the biggest problems was feeding the cyclists .
" You would use more energy feeding them than the energy they produced , " says Siddall .
Many of the cyclists were so exhausted that they were unable to walk for days .
But Siddall is still confident that volunteer slavery will be the future economic model .
" I have no doubt that slavery will return as the world 's energy resources get increasingly scarce . "
This proved a little " off- message " for the BBC .
" Its crew had a 20 megawatt generator to keep the lights and cameras going .
So you will need around 1,000 slaves to make an hour of TV . "
The BBC may want to revise its internship policy accordingly .

Manor Grand Prix 's first chassis should be completed by the end of November and testing at the beginning of February , according to designer Nick Wirth .
Manor has formed a partnership with the Wirth Research company and Wirth is confident that his design of the team 's 2010 F1 car is progressing well .
" We are already assembling components on a mock - up chassis , the first real chassis is being built and should be ready in four or five weeks ' time , " Wirth told Autosprint .
" I 'm very satisfied with the way crash tests are going and therefore I predict that the first car will be able to start running on the track at the beginning of February . "
Wirth admits that Manor is likely to be at the back of the grid to begin with , but believes the changes to the regulations next year will give the team an opportunity to move forward .
" We 'll start from the back but we hope to be in front of the other new teams , then we 'll begin to put pressure on the consolidated teams , " he said .
" The new regulations this year have mixed things up compared to 2008 and next year the rules will again be very different , and will require cars just as different - particularly with regards to the larger fuel tanks , heavier weight , tyres , aerodynamics ...
" This set of changes should not be underestimated because it means there will still be room for surprises .
" If the 2010 rules were the same as this year , I would have been very worried , instead I 'm a lot less so . "
He confirmed that the car would be entirely designed and constructed without using a wind tunnel .
" We use no wind tunnels .
We are developing the aerodynamics completely on the computer with the CDF system .
We wo n't do even one day in the wind tunnel , not even for a check . "
Manor GP is set to confirm a commercial partnership with Virgin next month and Wirth says that driver announcements could follow shortly afterwards .
" We 'll soon announce our commercial partner and , I think , also the drivers , since many have shown sizable interest in doing a programme with our team , " he said .
Thanks to the BBC , the missile defense debate can be greatly simplified .
Here 's what Bush proposed and what the neocons are hyperventilating over the ending of plans for :
And here 's the coverage of the AEGIS ship - based system proposed by Obama :
As you can see , coverage against actual , rather than imaginary , threats is marginal at best , and under the Bush plan was almost non-existent - unless you 're worried about Russian missiles .
" A better missile defense for a safer Europe , " my ass .
Contrary to both Bush and Obama 's statements , the Russians were right to be " paranoid " about missile defense all along .
Recall , too , that Iran has no current nuclear weapons program according to both the IAEA and US intelligence .
It would take at least three to five years for it to develop a nuclear - tipped missile from the day it kicks IAEA inspectors out , if it ever does .
We should be asking whether we need such a multi-billion boondoggle at all .

This year 's Kernel Summit saw Linux developers , led by Linus Torvalds , discussing the development process and gaining an insight into how Google uses the Linux kernel in - house .
Ulrich Drepper and Alan Cox think universal binaries in Linux are a step in the wrong direction .
Various graphics drivers have recently been updated to add new functionality .
Developers get - together
This year 's Kernel Summit was held in mid October in Tokyo .
The kernel developers invited to the event discussed a broad range of Linux kernel - related issues and kernel development .
Linux Weekly News has , as usual , published a detailed summary of the topics discussed at the meeting , which is now also available to non-subscribers .
As ever , one of the main topics of discussion was the development process .
According to the LWN . net report , kernel developers are broadly happy with linux - stable and linux - next , but there was criticism of the fact that a significant number of patches are not finding their way into linux - next before being merged into the main development tree .
The kernel hackers are also considering in future moving occasional obsolete kernel drivers to the staging area for immature drivers which do n't meet kernel development quality standards .
If they do not get picked up from there , they will then be removed from the kernel source completely a few months later .
Other points were also discussed , but , as the report stresses , in contrast to previous developer meetings , Linus Torvalds now appears to be broadly satisfied with the overall development process .
The article " How Google uses Linux " takes a detailed look at a Kernel Summit presentation given by a Google staff member on the search engine behemoth 's use of Linux .
To date , Google has been using older kernels , which it rarely updates and which have been extensively patched to optimise them for Google 's purposes .
Much of this work does not get submitted for integration into the main development tree , but efforts are under way to work more closely with kernel developers in future .
Not for the first time , the kernel developers discussed the best procedure for preventing regressions â problems fixed in previous versions which re-emerge in later releases .
Following Linus Torvalds attention - grabbing statement that the kernel is " bloated and huge " , there was also discussion of performance regressions .
The Kernel Summit also saw elections for five members of the Linux Foundation 's Technical Advisory Board ( TAB ) .
Jonathan Corbet from LWN.net , Greg Kroah - Hartman from Novell , Alan Cox from Intel , Thomas Gleixner from Linutronix and Theodore Y. Ts'o , seconded to the Linux Foundation from IBM , were all elected .
The kernel developers also clearly had some fun at the summit , at least it certainly looks that way in Chris SchlÃ¤ger 's photo of Linus Torvalds posing in front of a WindowsÂ 7 sales stand .
A group photo of the participants at the summit can be found on LWN.net .

Ryan Gordon 's recent presentation of the FatELF concept , which makes possible universal binaries under Linux , has attracted a great deal of attention .
Glibc maintainer Ulrich Drepper was less than enthusiastic in a posting to a Fedora mailing list , " It is a ' solution ' which adds costs in many , many places for a problem that does n't exist .
I do n't see why people even spend a second thinking about this . "
Gordon has since submitted a number of FatELF kernel patches to LKML for evaluation .
Alan Cox has spoken out robustly against the adoption of one of these patches in one posting on LMKL .
In another , the Linux grandee has taken a closer look at the supposed benefits offered by FatELF , explaining in some detail why he sees it as an irrelevance , with package managers having solved the problem back in the '90s .
There was also a question mark over whether FatELF , in its current form , may infringe certain patents â Gordon had asked for help in clarifying this issue , but has now decided to abandon his attempt to get FatELF adopted and has archived the project .
In Brief : The Kernel
One developer recently proposed designating the IDE subsystem , taken under the wing of David Miller several months ago , as deprecated , in order to encourage people to switch to more modern drivers in the Libata subsystem .
There are strong signs that this proposal is likely to be adopted , but the issue of when is still under discussion .
The Android drivers added to the staging area of Linux 2.6.29 may be given the boot because Google developers are no longer maintaining them .
A Google employee has , however , announced that in the longer term they are hoping to increase their contribution to the main Linux development branch .
The GRUB development team has recently released version 1.97 of the GRUB2 boot loader .
It is now able to load kernels for various BSD derivatives , supports x86 - 64 EFI and offers enhancements for GPT .
Storage devices can also now be addressed using UUID .
The latest stable kernel versions , 2.6.27.38 and 2.6.31.5 , were released on 23Â October .
Kernel developer Rusty Russell will in future be doing more work on Samba , but will also continue to maintain the Virtio drivers
Following a lengthy lull in the process of merging the Lirc drivers ( used in many remote controls ) into the main Linux development tree , Jarod Wilson is taking a second shot at it .
Neil Brown , MD kernel code maintainer , has released mdadm versions 3.0.3 and 3.1.0 .
While the former contains minor enhancements and bug fixes , the latter includes numerous new options for setting up and modifying software RAID arrays .
It now allows RAIDÂ 1 to be converted to RAIDÂ 5 and from there to RAIDÂ 6 and back again , and can be used to shrink RAID levels 4 , 5 and 6 .
Some of this functionality requires very new , or as yet unreleased , kernel versions .
Users should therefore only use version 3.1.0 if they require the new functionality or wish to test the new version .
Brown has since found the odd bug , which he plans to remedy by releasing version 3.1.1 .
He expects the latter to be suitable for general use .
Driving Graphics
NVIDIA late last week released version 190.42 of its proprietary graphics driver for x86 - 32 and x86 - 64 Linux .
New features include support for OpenGL 3.2 , X - Server 1.7.0Â RC1 and many new graphics cards .
There were also enhancements in the Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix ( VDPAU ) .
The driver can now also be used to control fan and energy - saving behaviour ( " GPU PowerMizer Mode " ) .
A few days earlier , AMD released a new version of its proprietary Linux graphics driver , which it has designated as version 9.10 .
New features include ' early look support ' for Ubuntu 9.10 , which uses Linux kernel 2.6.31 .
The release notes list various bugs which should no longer occur with the latest driver .
Intel developers have recently released version 2.9.1 of Intel 's open source driver for Intel graphics chip sets , which is primarily a bug fix release .
The radeonhd driver development team released version 1.3.0 shortly after the last Kernel Log .
Driver developer Matthias Hopf has published a blog entry listing the major changes , including support for newer Radeon models , HDMI audio and some of the power - saving functions offered by Radeon graphics hardware .
Ben Skeggs has meanwhile summarised the changes and enhancements to the Nouveau driver over the last six months on his blog .
In Brief : Graphics
Peter Hutterer has once again summarised the major changes in the recently released X11R7.5 ( Xorg 7.5 ) on his blog .
They include version 1.7.1 of X server which fixes numerous bugs from version 1.7.0 , released in early October .
With kernel - based mode setting having already delivered a largely flicker - free boot experience , systems with a cooperative BIOS and various patches submitted by Jesse Barnes should now be able to go completely flicker - free .
In recent days , various developers have been making big changes to the X.org Wiki 's table of X driver functionality for Radeon hardware .
The column for the radeonhd driver has been removed and a new column added for the Evergreen GPUs used in the Radeon HD 5000 series .
An NVIDIA programmer working on the company 's proprietary Linux graphics drivers recently gave an interview with Phoronix , in which he offers some insights into the drivers , driver development and the significance of these drivers for the company .
Further background and information about developments in the Linux kernel and its environment can also be found in previous issues of the Kernel Log at The H Open Source :

Finding tuna the easy way ( Image : Seawifs )
TIMES are tough for tuna .
The guidance of scientists that advise groups that manage tuna stocks is falling on deaf ears .
The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas meets this week in Brazil to set catch limits .
ICCAT ’s scientific advisers have told it that stocks of the giant bluefin tuna are plummeting towards collapse .
Catches in 2008 were at three times the ICCAT limit , which is itself more than what its scientific advisers consider sustainable ( see “ Tigers of the sea ” ) .
“ It ’s like the year before the collapse of the northern cod , ” says Dan Pauly at the University of British Columbia , Canada . …
Prompted by Verizon 's recent increase in early termination fees for some users , Senator Amy Klobuchar ( D - MN ) has , along with three colleagues , introduced a bill in the Senate to specifically address " budget - busting " early termination fees .
The bill would limit ETFs to no more than the subsidy offered on a particular handset , and require that the fee be prorated equally every month until the end of a service contract ( typically two years ) .
This is n't the first time Klobuchar has tried to address ETFs .
Her Cell Phone Empowerment
Act of 2007 mandated prorated early termination fees , as well as the elimination of other hidden fees .
The bill would have required carriers to provide the FCC with data on dropped call rates and coverage gaps , and would have given consumers a minimum 30 - day notice to cancel a contract extension .
In addition , the bill required that consumers be provided with detailed coverage maps so they could determine whether they would have coverage at home or work .
Unfortunately , that bill has since languished in committee , though AT&T announced shortly after the bill was introduced in 2007 that it would voluntarily offer pro-rated ETFs .
Eventually the rest of the industry followed suit , addressing at least one of the main concerns of the bill .
However , Verizon recently announced that users that buy an " advanced device " — in other words , a smartphone — would have their early termination fee arbitrarily doubled to $ 350 , and the fee would only be reduced by $ 10 every month .
Such an arrangement nets Verizon $ 230 if a contract is cancelled after 12 months ; it would still net Verizon $ 120 if the contract were cancelled after 23 months .
Klobuchar blasted the move , calling it " anti-consumer and anti-competitive . "
She then called on the FCC to review the decision .
" Verizon Wireless ' decision shows us once again that the wireless industry cannot police itself and will not , on its own , make its practices more competitive and consumer - friendly , " she wrote in a letter to the FCC Last month .
Though the Cell Phone Empowerment
Act would certainly address many consumer issues with wireless carrier practices , Klobuchar , along with Senators Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) , Jim Webb ( D - VA ) , and Mark Begich ( D - AK ) , has introduced the Cell Phone Early Termination Fee , Transparency and Fairness Act to specifically address ETFs .
In addition to limiting ETFs to a maximum of a handset 's subsidy , it would require carriers to prorate the ETF by an equal amount each month based on the length of the contract .
So , if you cancel your contract halfway through the contract period , you 'll only pay one - half of the ETF .
Furthermore , carriers will be required to provide " clear and conspicuous disclosure " at the time of purchase , and require carriers to disclose the current ETF on users ' monthly bills .
" Changing your wireless provider should n’t break the bank , " Klobuchar said in a statement .
" Forcing consumers to pay outrageous fees bearing little to no relation to the cost of their handset devices is anti-consumer and anti-competitive . "

Mobile phones can take as little as ten minutes to trigger changes in the brain associated with cancer , scientists claimed yesterday .
They found even low levels of radiation from handsets interfere with the way brain cells divide .
Cell division encourages the growth of tumours .
Although the researchers did not come up with evidence that mobile phone signals are harmful , the findings suggest they could be .
Several major studies have also found no link between mobile use and brain tumours , nor a dramatic rise in cancer rates .
But campaigners insist the discovery undermines official advice that the devices are safe .
The guidance is based on the assumption that the phones emit too little radiation to heat the brain dangerously .
However , the new study by the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel suggests " nonthermal " radiation could pose a risk .
The Israeli scientists exposed human and rat cells in a laboratory to low - level radiation at 875 megahertz - a similar frequency to the one used in many mobile phones .
Although the radiation was far weaker than emissions from a typical handset , it began to switch on a chemical signal inside the cells within ten minutes , the researchers report in the Biochemical Journal .
The chemical signals they detected were involved in the division of cells .
The researchers say the reaction was not caused by heating and claim they have found a separate way in which mobile phones could damage health .
Dr Rony Seger , a co-author of the study , told the magazine New Scientist : " The significance lies in showing cells do react to cellphone radiation in a non-thermal way . "
Although changes in the chemical pathway seen by the Israeli scientists have been linked to several cancers , the researchers say there was no sign of a cancer - causing effect .
Dr Simon Arthur , a health expert at Dundee University , said the effect was ' unlikely to cause cancer ' .
Dr Dariusz Leszczynski , of the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority in Helsinki , said : " If cell - phone radiation cannot induce biological effects then there will never be any health effects .
" On the other hand if we can show this radiation is able to induce biological effects then we have a different story . "
A major review of mobile phone safety is due to be published by the Health Protection Agency next month .
The agency 's last major report , in 2004 , found no evidence mobiles were a serious health risk .
It did , however , caution against excessive use , especially by the young .
Dr Michael Clark , a spokesman for the agency , said : " Because of findings like this that pop up from time to time , a precautionary approach is justified . "
Graham Philips , of campaign group Powerwatch , said : " Safety guidelines assume health effects from mobiles can only occur when significant heating of body tissue occurs .
" This study shows biological changes in response to low - level mobile phone radiation - something that could potentially have implications for health .
" Further research is required , however guidance based purely on thermal effects is clearly out of date . "

Behold the world 's tax dollars at work .
A Russian professor at the Saint Petersburg Technological University has developed a process that allows him to take almost any kind of alcohol , turn it into a powder , and then pack it into a pill for easy transport .
Yeah , someone actually took the time and the research money to figure this out .
Why bring a bottle of wine to your next dinner party when you can just drop a few tablets of whisky on the kitchen table and call it a night ?
" We have developed a technology that allowed us to turn any liquid solution into powder , " the scientist was quoted as saying by a web portal .
The mastermind behind the technique is Evgeny Moskalev , who was first able to produce vodka into a " dry " form , supposedly to make it easier for consumer to calculate an exact dosage .
After the transformation , the " dry " vodka ( or whiskey , or beer ) can fit easily into bag or even your pocket .
An act of brilliance or sheer stupidity ?
We 'd say its a perfectly blended cocktail of the two .
This was going to be a " quick " post on the pending bankruptcy of YRC , the nation 's largest trucking company .
Instead , I have been digging around for several hours as the story morphed into a spiderweb of pension obligations culminating in a Ponzi scheme sponsored by representative Pomeroy to bailout private pension plans at taxpayer expense .
Let 's kick this off with the headline that first grabbed my attention .
Bloomberg reports YRC Has Until Yearend to Corral Bondholders , Avert Bankruptcy .
YRC Worldwide Inc. has less than two weeks to persuade bondholders to accept a debt exchange and prevent a bankruptcy filing that its employees ’ union says may force the biggest U.S. trucking company to liquidate .
YRC , which has pushed back the deadline for the swap three times this month , must complete the tender by Dec. 31 to avoid a $ 19 million payment of interest and fees that would leave the trucker in an “ unsustainable ” position , the Overland Park , Kansas - based company said yesterday in a regulatory filing .
“ Bondholders are in the driver ’s seat , ” said David Ross , a Baltimore - based analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. who has a “ sell ” rating on the stock .
“ They could force the company to file if they do n’t tender enough notes , and then there is a high chance the business is liquidated . ”
YRC took on debt when Yellow Corp. acquired Roadway Corp. in 2003 for $ 1.07 billion and then bought USF Corp. in 2005 for $ 1.37 billion .
The company has $ 1.6 billion of loans and bonds , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
Concern is growing that the company would n’t survive a bankruptcy filing because customers would defect , said Iain Gold , a director in the strategic research department of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , which represented about 40,000 YRC employees as of January .
YRC ’s $ 150 million of 8.5 percent notes due in April fell 1.25 cents on the dollar to 59.75 cents yesterday , according to Trace , the bond - price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority .
The shares declined 7 cents , or 6.8 percent , to 94 cents , after earlier rising as much as 15 percent , on the Nasdaq Stock Market .
The trucker must complete the exchange as part of agreements with its banks , the Teamsters and multi-employer pension funds , according to a Nov. 24 regulatory filing .
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was creating derivatives trades that would profit from a bankruptcy , Teamsters President James Hoffa wrote in a Dec. 16 letter to Lloyd Blankfein , chief executive officer of the New York - based bank .
Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally confirmed the bank received the letter and said in an interview “ Goldman does not have a position in the company , nor are we making markets in the company ’s bonds or credit - default swaps . ”
YRC Seeks $ 1 Billion Pension Bailout From TARP
Struggling No. 1 U.S. trucking company YRC Worldwide Inc plans to seek $ 1 billion in bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to help it cover pension obligations , a move analysts say is unlikely to succeed as the company has no financial charter .
YRC , which has been shedding jobs and closing facilities to cut costs in the face of the U.S. recession , faces an estimated $ 2 billion in pension obligations over the next four years .
YRC will submit an application to the Treasury as early as Friday , a move that was first reported by the Wall Street Journal .
Pension Fund Problems
Company Chief Executive Bill Zollars complained in the WSJ article that the Central States multi-employer pension fund that it pays into is unfair because YRC ends up paying for truckers who never worked for the company .
Multi-employer pension funds were set up decades ago prior to the deregulation of the trucking industry to ensure that workers ' pensions were protected even if they changed companies .
Over the past 20 years , thousands of trucking companies have collapsed , leaving their pension obligations to be funded by those left in the fund .
The Central States fund has been in trouble for years as a result of this problem .
The world 's largest package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS ) , which had more than 40,000 employees in Central States , paid a $ 6.1 billion fee to withdraw from the fund in 2007 and have those employees covered by a single - employer fund jointly managed by UPS and the Teamsters union .
UPS ' move was widely regarded by analysts as a smart one , given the poor condition of the Central States fund .
YRC Terminates Pension Contributions
Trustees ' terminate ' carrier 's participation ;
Move wo n't affect accrued benefits
The largest Teamsters pension fund dropped YRC Worldwide , the largest unionized trucking company , as its Teamster employees prepare to vote on whether to accept a 15 percent wage cut and a suspension of company pension contributions .
The Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund notified the principal officers of Teamster union locals last week that its trustees had decided to “ terminate the participation ” of YRC and USF Holland in the fund , effective July 9 .
The move wo n’t affect employee pension benefits accrued before July 9 , but there will be no additional accruals “ unless and until YRCW resumes participation , ” Central States Executive Director Thomas C. Nyhan said in a letter attached to the notice .
Central States is one of the nation ’s largest multiemployer pension plans , providing monthly benefits to over 210,000 retirees and their surviving spouses .
Since 1955 it has provided more than $ 40 billion in retirement benefits to Teamsters and their families .

Central States Pension Fund - A Guaranteed Train Wreck
As of June 30 , CSPF assets stood at $ 17.5 billion , almost exactly the same as the $ 17.4 billion in assets at the start of 2009 .
The fund made 15.0 percent on its investments in the second quarter , thanks to the big run-up in the stock market .
Central States now holds 69 percent of its assets in stocks and 28 percent in bonds .
The number of active participants ( full - time equivalents ) is down to 80,000 , while the number of retirees holds steady at 212,000 .
The new problem for the fund is Yellow Roadway Corp.
YRC was allowed to defer six months of past - due payments , amounting to about $ 125 million that it owes the fund .
The fund , along with some other Teamster funds , now holds a lien on 150 terminal properties of YRC as collateral .
YRC is required to start paying back the deferred amount in January 2010 , over a three year payment period .
Even worse , YRC is now terminated from the fund for 18 months , and thus not liable to make pension contributions until January 2011 .

Beware The Taxpayer Bailout
Official Summary
10/27/2009 --Introduced .
Preserve Benefits and Jobs Act of 2009 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ( ERISA ) and the Internal Revenue Code to :
(1 ) allow a sponsor of a single - employer defined benefit pension plan to elect in 2009 or 2010 extended amortization periods ( 9 or 15 years ) for investment losses incurred in prior years ;
( 2 ) allow an increase in the valuation range of plan assets ;
(3 ) use the funded status of a plan in 2008 to determine benefit restrictions in 2009 and 2010 and prohibit the use of credit balances by pension plans that are under 80 % funded in the prior year ;
( 4 ) exclude plan- related administrative expenses ( including investment expenses ) from normal cost targets ;
( 5 ) delay until 2012 the application of certain benefit restrictions to collectively bargained plans ; and
( 6 ) require a 120 % funding target for plans adopting ad hoc amendments that allow lump sum benefits payments and increased plan liabilities .
Revises rules relating to information reporting and reportable events .
Calculates the amount of any pension plan guarantee by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( PBGC ) using the date of plan termination rather than the date of a plan bankruptcy filing .
Amends ERISA provisions relating to multiemployer pension plans to :
(1 ) allow such plans to elect alternative amortization plans and valuation methods in 2009 and 2010 for investment losses ;
( 2 ) extend by five years the funding improvement period for plans in endangered or critical status ;
( 3 ) permit multiemployer plans to merge or form alliances with other plans ; and
( 4 ) increase PBGC guarantees for insolvent plans to increase participant benefits .
Replenishing Pension Funds From Taxpayer Pockets
Rep. Earl Pomeroy , North Dakota Democrat , is drafting legislation that would amount to a massive , employer - crippling bailout for struggling union pensions .
The congressman is trying to spin this as a cheap , proactive way to shore up said pensions .
He claims that his bill is a response to an " urgent plea [ from employers ] for manageable and predictable pension funding rules as the nation works [ its ] way back to recovery . "
In reality , the bill as currently drafted would be a costly sop to unions , which have done so much to get Mr. Pomeroy elected .
( Twelve out of his top 21 donors are unions , according to opensecrets.org . )
It would allow the unions , which have badly mismanaged pension funds in the past , to make new companies liable for the pension obligations of workers at other companies , in other industries .
It also would create an explicit taxpayer guarantee if it all comes crashing down .
The devil is in the details of the draft , the text of which can be found on the congressman 's Web site .
The changes it introduces are chilling .
The draft would allow union - controlled multiemployer pension plans to form alliances with one another .
It also would create something known as a fifth fund that the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. , with taxpayer help , would use to prop up failing union pension plans .
Multiemployer union pension alliances might sound innocent enough , but consider what that actually means .
Moody 's Investors Service recently warned of a vast underfunding problem with multiemployer pensions .
Many employers fear being shackled into them .
Even though the funds are controlled by unions , employers are liable not just for their own employees , but for every worker in the plan regardless of how the plan is managed or mismanaged .
The so - called last - man - standing rule holds that if every other company in a multiemployer pension plan goes bankrupt , closes or pulls out of the plan , the one survivor is responsible for every single employee covered by the plan , even those who never worked for him .
UPS paid $ 6.1 billion in withdrawal fees just to escape the Teamsters Central States pension fund .
Earlier this year the Teamsters were required to send out a letter to participants of the Central States pension alerting them that the plan was in " critical status " - funded at 65 percent or less .
Not wanting to wait for a PBGC bailout , Mr. Pomeroy proposes putting the taxpayer on the hook now .
In a stark departure from the traditional role of PBGC , the draft bill states that " obligations of the corporation that are financed by the [ fifth fund ] shall be obligations of the United States . "
For the first time , PBGC liabilities will be borne by taxpayers .
The fifth fund could make available billions of dollars to prop up union pensions .
The bill does not include a statutory limit for how much taxpayer money could be shoveled into failing funds .

Follow - up to " Functional Programming Does n't Work "
Not surprisingly , Functional Programming Does n't Work ( and what to do about it ) started some lively discussion .
There were two interesting " you 're crazy " camps :
The first mistakenly thought that I was proposing fixing problems via a judicious use of randomly updated global variables , so every program turns into potential fodder for the " Daily WTF . "
The second , and really , the folks in this camp need to put some effort into being less predictable , was that I 'm completely misunderstanding the nature of functional programming , and if I did understand it then I 'd realize the true importance of keeping things pure .
My real position is this : 100 % pure functional programing does n't work .
Even 98 % pure functional programming does n't work .
But if the slider between functional purity and 1980s BASIC - style imperative messiness is kicked down a few notches -- say to 85 % -- then it really does work .
You get all the advantages of functional programming , but without the extreme mental effort and unmaintainability that increases as you get closer and closer to perfectly pure .
That 100 % purity does n't work should only be news to a couple of isolated idealists .
Of the millions of non-trivial programs ever written -- every application , every game , every embedded system -- there are , what , maybe six that are written in a purely functional style ?
Do n't push me or I 'll disallow compilers for functional languages from that list , and then it 's all hopeless .
" Functional Programming Does n't Work " was intended to be optimistic .
It does work , but you have to ease up on hardliner positions in order to get the benefits .

For the first time a mainstream British television program has tackled the Zionist lobby head - on .
Channel 4 ’s Dispatches , broadcast on 16 November , promised to hold the pro-Israel lobby up to rigorous public scrutiny and it succeeded .
Presented by Peter Oborne , former political editor of the right - wing weekly The Spectator , Dispatches revealed the cozy relationship between Britain ’s pro-Israel lobby and both the Conservative and Labour parties as well as its attempts to stifle criticism of Israel in the press .
Given that there is a general election looming in which the Labour government is expected to be swept aside by a Conservative ( Tory ) landslide , Dispatches opened with an examination of the Conservative Friends of Israel ( CFI ) , an organization that claims that 80 percent of Tory MPs are members .
The CFI annual lunch is held at a major central London hotel and the current
Tory leader is usually the keynote speaker .
Last June , Conservative party leader David Cameron and shadow foreign secretary William Hague attended the dinner , scenes of which were captured on film for Dispatches .
Oborne explained that during Cameron ’s speech he “ made no reference at all to the invasion of Gaza , the massive destruction it caused , or the 1,370 deaths that had resulted .
Indeed , Cameron went out of his way to praise Israel because it ‘ strives to protect innocent life . ’ ”
When he criticized Cameron for his pointed omission in a Daily Mail column published after the lunch , Oborne was promptly rebuked by Stuart Polak , the longstanding CFI director who stated that “ the snapshot of our lunch concentrating on the businessmen and David ’s alleged comments was really unhelpful . ”
Robert Halfon , the CFI political director , complained that Oborne was making a “ moral equivalence ” between Israel and Iran .
Oborne explained in his introduction to a pamphlet published to accompany the Dispatches program that “ he resolved to ask the question : what led David Cameron to behave in the way he did at the CFI lunch at the Dorchester Hotel last June ?
What are the rules of British political behavior which allow the Tory Party leader and his mass of MPs and parliamentary candidates to flock to ” the CFI lunch after the Israel ’s devastating winter invasion of Gaza ?
Dispatches goes a long way toward answering these questions .
It exposes the breadth and scope of the lobby ’s reach and the relationship between the Israeli foreign ministry , the Britain Israel Research and Communications Centre ( BICOM ) , the Board of Deputies of British Jews , the CFI , Labour Friends of Israel ( LFI ) , the Zionist Federation , the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America ( CAMERA ) , HonestReporting and other manifestations of Israel ’s well - funded propaganda offensive .
As Dispatches reports , scores of MPs and journalists are regularly flown to Israel to be pampered by one or several of these organizations .
Sometimes a “ Palestinian businessman ” will be produced to give the illusion of balance .
While many of these parliamentarians may have no interest whatever in the Middle East , they seem unable to resist these jaunts as the recent scandal over MP ’s expenses has shown .
If they say a kind word about Israel on their return , a check ranging from # 2,000 to # 15,000 will shortly be in the post .
As for the journalists , Oborne provides examples of articles in which the authors parrot Israeli spin doctors , without disclosing the source of their stories .
Dispatches reveals how conservative politician William Hague was given an ear - bashing and was targeted in a critical letter to The Spectator from major Tory donor Lord Kalms after using the taboo word “ disproportionate ” about Israel ’s 2006 attack on Lebanon .
More recently , the CFI imposed its will to stiffen Tory opposition to the UN resolution on the Goldstone report .
Dispatches also examines the relationship between Tony Blair and his former pro-Israeli Middle East envoy , Lord Levy .
Levy is estimated to have raised over # 15 million for Blair before the “ cash for peerages ” affair put an end to his fundraising activities in the summer of 2006 .
The accompanying pamphlet by Peter Oborne and James Jones , which can be downloaded from the Channel 4 website or openDemocracy .net , provides tables listing MPs ’ names , dates and quantities of cash supplied by the CFI .
They give the historical background to the formation of both the CFI and LFI .
According to Oborne , many individuals who privately told Dispatches of their concerns about the lobby simply felt they had too much to lose by confronting it .
Dispatches approached Jonathan Dimbleby , the doyen of BBC presenters , who authored a powerfully argued article for the UK - based website Index on Censorship , criticizing the BBC ’s betrayal of Jeremy Bowen , its Middle East editor .
Dimbleby was keen to be interviewed by the show ’s producers and the Dispatches team were baffled when he abruptly backed out .
In 2000 , Bowen witnessed an Israeli tank near the Lebanese border incinerate his local colleague and driver , Abed Takkoush .
Bowen was shot at himself .
Andrew Balcombe , Zionist Federation Chair , immediately wrote to the BBC Trust demanding Bowen ’s removal as Middle East editor , claiming this incident was a “ tragic mistake ” that “ may have colored [ his ] views about Israel . ”
Ever since , Israel ’s allies have targeted Bowen .
The BBC Trust caved in to Jonathan Turner , attorney for the Zionist Federation , and CAMERA .
Turner complained that Bowen ’s online analysis “ How 1967 defined the Middle East ” and his 12 January 2008 report “ From Our Own Correspondent ” for BBC Radio 4 , were “ chronically biased . ”
Bowen was accused of using language that “ appears to be calculated to promote hatred of the Jewish state and the Jews . ”
However , Dispatches points out that Bowen had an article titled “ Israel still bears a disastrous legacy , ” ( 31 May 2007 ) published in The Jewish Chronicle a week earlier than one of BBC pieces that were successfully targeted by CAMERA .
The BBC Trust upheld a complaint that Bowen had breached their standards of accuracy and impartiality by stating : “ Zionism ’s innate instinct to push out the frontier ” and “ the Israeli generals , mainly hugely self - confident Sabras in their late 30s and early 40s , had been training to finish the unfinished business of 1948 for most of their careers . ”
Yet The Jewish Chronicle article contained exactly the same wording without being challenged by the paper , sympathetic to Israel , or its readers .
Oborne comments , “ Perhaps the BBC Trust ’s interpretation of due impartiality is different to that of Britain ’s Jewish community . ”
Moreover , Dispatches discovered that the BBC ’s Dimbleby is now experiencing exactly the same process of complaints that he described in the Bowen case .
After attacking Bowen , the Zionist Federation ’s Turner is now arguing that Dimbleby ’s defense of his colleague makes him unfit to host the BBC ’s popular radio program Any Questions .
In addition to the BBC , Dispatches discovered other members of the media that have been targeted by the Zionist lobby .
Alan Rusbridger , editor of the Guardian newspaper , described a 2006 visit from Gerald Ronson , chairman of the Community Security Trust , a charity for British Jews , and Henry Grunwald , the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews .
The meeting was triggered by an article in the Guardian by Chris McGreal that compared Israel to apartheid South Africa .
After an emergency meeting at the Israeli ambassador ’s residence that was also attended by BICOM chairman Poju Zabludowicz , Grumald and Ronson were dispatched to confront the Guardian editor .
Ronson accused the Guardian of fomenting anti-Semitic attacks , stating that “ There is a line which ca n’t be crossed , you ’ve crossed it , and you must stop this . ”
Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the program are those who refused to talk on camera .
Oborne describes how while gathering material for the show , he was subjected to taunts from a Member of Parliament who stated that “ You would never have the guts to make a television program about the pro-Israel lobby . ”
The MP explained that it was “ the most powerful lobby by far in parliament .
It ’s a big story .
If you have any balls you ’ll make a program about it . ”
Like many others approached , the MP who made those comments declined when Oborne asked to interview him on camera .
One can only hope that this is will be the first of many programs to expose the influence and implications of the pro-Israel lobby on British politics and policies .

You have to hand it to Michele Bachmann :
She has succeeded in turning the GOP into one big Tea Party .
This past weekend , the Minnesota Republican went on Fox News and called on viewers to show up on the Capitol lawn on Thursday at noon for a press conference and a last ditch attempt to kill health care reform .
The gathering that resulted was marked by the now - routine extremism of the Tea Party conservatives .
“ I ’m a bitter gun owner who votes , ” read one sign .
Others questioned President Obama ’s citizenship , portrayed him as Sambo , or called him a traitor .
One said , “ Obama takes his orders from the Rothschilds . ”
Old ladies wore red T - shirts decrying “ Obamao care . ”
The crowd also took spirited swipes at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
At one point someone yelled , “ Put down your Botox and show yourself . ”
But what was most noteworthy was that the entire House Republican leadership was also in attendance — and their rhetoric was just as over - the - top as some of the protesters .
House Minority Leader John Boehner declared the health care bill the “ greatest threat to freedom I have seen . ”
In essence , Congressional Republicans were merging with a movement that gives open expression to racist and anti-Semitic sentiments .
The crowd was several thousand strong , many bused in by Americans for Prosperity , a group created by the owners of Koch Industries , a huge oil and gas conglomerate .
The AFP chapter from New Jersey reportedly sent 29 buses .
Four AFP buses came from Maryland ’s Eastern Shore , and more came from Richmond and North Carolina .
Lots of people in the crowd carried AFP signs or stickers warning “ Hands off my health care . ”
During the rally , all the prominent House GOP legislators wanted a shot at the mike , including Boehner , whip Eric Cantor of Virginia , Roy Blunt of Missouri , presidential aspirant Mike Pence of Indiana , and what seemed like the entire Texas GOP delegation .
There were so many Republicans blow - bagging that dozens of hungry patriots were heading for the exit long before the speeches ended .
But aside from Bachmann herself , only South Carolina Rep .
Joe Wilson won overwhelming adoration from the crowd — he could barely get a word in over the rousing cheers of “ Thanks Joe ! ”
Most attendees looked old enough to have already experienced government - run health care themselves .
( Walking to the Hill from Union Station along with people headed to the rally , I could hear some of them wheezing and joking that their aging spouses should have rented Segways to get them to the event . )
This demographic was reflected in the celebrity lineup apparently arranged by Bachmann , who said that her “ good friend , ” the actor Jon Voight , was the first person to call her at home after her Fox appearance .
Voight and John Ratzenberger — better known as “ Cliff from Cheers ” — shared the same message : The Democrats ’ health care plan will send the country down the path to European socialism .
The crowd erupted with chants of “ Nazis ! Nazis ! ” Ratzenberger insisted that the Democrats ’ philosophy does n’t come from America but from “ overseas , ” where , he said , quoting Churchill , they embrace the idea of the “ equal sharing of misery . ”
Voight warned darkly that President Obama wants to use the health care bill to create national socialism , and that Americans would end up like Europeans where health care “ leads to many deaths . ”
Standing in front of them was a protestor who carried an enormous sign that read , “ National Socialist Health Care — Dachau , Germany 1945 ” over a large photo of a stack of naked bodies piled up at a Nazi death camp .
But Voight and Ratzenberger ’s speeches were mild stuff compared with that of talk show host Mark Levin .
After ranting about the various things “ they ” want to take over and ruin — everything from Social Security to the banking system to the auto industry — Levin proclaimed : “ Now they want to control health care .
They want to play God and decide who lives and who dies . ”
The crowd responded with cheers of “ Impeach Obama ! ”
( At about this time , President Obama was making a surprise appearance at the White House press briefing to praise the American Medical Association and the AARP for endorsing the health care bill . )
Many people I spoke with said they came because of “ the babies , ” and their belief that the health care bill will fund elective abortions .
Tony Perkins , the head of the evangelical group the Family Research Council riled up the crowd with claims that the bill is “ another bailout of the abortion industry with your money ” and that Planned Parenthood had helped draft the measure .
Aside from the abortion foes , most protesters seemed to be focused not so much on the specifics of the bill , but on its price tag .
“ The deficit is the thing I ’m most against , ” said Dr. Jo Allen Jones , an ER doctor from West Virginia who showed up in her white coat and proudly pointed out the blood spots on it .
She had heard about the march from Glenn Beck and Americans for Prosperity .
She was standing with two other doctors from Alabama , also in white coats , who were concerned about future reimbursement rates and the lack of malpractice lawsuit relief in the bill .
Sharon Johnson , from Williamstown , New Jersey , had driven down in the morning simply because she had seen Bachmann on Fox .
She came with her wheelchair - bound friend , a retired teacher who now suffers from a rare degenerative nerve disorder much like Parkinson’s .
The trip , Johnson said , was a bit of a sacrifice because she had stayed up late watching the World Series , and “ after a half a case of beer ” she was n’t feeling so great this morning .
She ’s an Army veteran and gets her health care from the Veterans Administration .
“ I guess you could say I ’m on the public option ! ” she said with a laugh .
But she ’d had some experience with a government - run health care system in the Army , where she was unable to get an operation on her shoulder for a year .
She ’s afraid these types of problems will expand if the reform bill passes .
Her friend , who had trouble speaking because of her disease , was attending simply because she was afraid she would lose her health care under the bill .
She , too , has government - provided health care , via the state of New Jersey .
These sorts of contradictions were apparent everywhere .
But one thing about the rally proved sparklingly clear : Michele Bachmann is a major star .
When she stepped up to the podium on the Capitol steps , the crowd went wild .
It was n’t too hard to imagine the event as a warm up for the 2012 presidential election , where Bachmann might prove a far more viable candidate than Sarah Palin .
The rally confirmed her primacy as a leading voice of the Republican Party — a party that , with this protest , has fully embraced the conservative movement ’s most extreme elements .

WASHINGTON --
The Obama administration is encouraging key Arab states to boost oil exports to China in order to reduce Beijing 's reliance on Iranian energy and pare Chinese resistance to tougher sanctions over Tehran 's nuclear program .
The administration 's strategy has yielded a gain : in a step coordinated with Washington , the United Arab Emirates recently agreed to boost oil exports to China to between 150,000 to 200,000 barrels a day from a current level of 50,000 over the next six months , according to U.S. and Emirati officials .

THERE are people all around the world -- from the deserts of Sahara where temperature climbs to well over 500C to the permafrost Arctic regions where temperature dips below - 500C .
Human beings are extremely adaptable animals .
But that does not mean that lives in the extremes are comfortable or endurable .
The human population had been flourishing on the planet over the past couple of centuries within the comfort zone of 200C to 300/350C , primarily as a result of advances in medical sciences , better health care and enhanced food production .
And that is where lies the present problem .
The lives of each one of us are intimately tied to the earth and the resources it provides .
The water we drink , the food we eat , the air we breath , the energy we use , the homes we live in are all part of nature 's resources .
The higher the population , the higher the demand is on these resources .
With earth 's limited resources ( although we may devise more efficient production methods and better utilisation ) , there is inevitably a shrinkage of resources per head of population .
But when we forcibly extract more resources out of this planet , we come to a point when it becomes unsustainable .
We are nearly at this point now .
We are using up more resources than we can possibly put back , and virtually decimating nature by massive deforestation , aggressive fishing , unsustainable ground water extraction , etc .
In short , we are ravaging the earth for our benefit without any regard to its capacity to maintain its intrinsic climate .
As David Attenborough had put it in his Living Earth documentary , the earth is now fighting back for its survival .
The recent spectacle at the COP15 gathering in Copenhagen bears testament to the seriousness of the problem as viewed by the scientific community and the world leaders .
The leaders of the world 's industrialised , industrialising and fringe population groups wrestled with the climate change problems for 12 days , almost non-stop , but could not come up with an effective solution which would overcome them .
Climate change is a serious problem by itself , but now I would like to throw a spanner into the mix -- the problem of over - population .
The root cause of climate change lies not so much in industrialisation , but in sheer number of people undertaking industrialisation at the same time .
Every country wants to improve the living standards of its population by offering adequate food , proper housing , education , health care etc. , through increasing production and speeding up industrialisation .
At the same time , the population in almost every country is increasing and so the economic development must outpace the population growth to have any impact on standard of living .
When pressed at the Copenhagen conference to cut greenhouse Gas ( GHG ) emission by a certain amount and that the agreed emission reduction must be verifiable , China ( the biggest polluter in the world ) took exception to it as a blatant attempt by the West to put a stop to its industrialisation process and , by implication , to deny the improvement of living standards of its population .
The US ( under George W. Bush ) did not sign the Kyoto Protocol because that would deny or curtail the exploitation or exploration of hydrocarbon resources ( oil , gas and coal ) in America and thereby stunt the growth in living standards of the Americans .
The EU , comprising 27 countries , has only agreed to cutting emission by 20 percent by 2020 when , it is thought , it would be good for the economy to use renewable sources of energy and that the emission reduction could be managed by technological innovation without risking the living standard of the population .
Neither population nor climatic conditions are static .
But the driving force is the population growth , some would even dub it " population explosion . "
It is obvious that the sheer volume of people would place an unbearable demand on the limited resources of the earth , even though the demands are not uniformly spread across the globe .
Let us look at population growth .
At the start of the industrial revolution in Europe , ca 1750 , following the discovery of the steam engine , the world population was a meagre 791 million , of which the European population constituted only 20 percent .
Between 1750 and 1950 , the world population increased by over 215 percent ( to 2521 million ) and the European population increased by about 235 percent to 547 million .
This period also saw the rise of science and technology , which resulted in improved medical science and health care and the corresponding reduction in death rates , child mortality etc .
The benefits of these improvements were largely confined to European countries and latterly to North America .
Asian countries had always had a large proportion of world population .
In 1750 , Asian countries had nearly 63 percent of world population .
By 1950 , it dropped to about 55 percent , as Europe enjoyed the benefits of industrial revolution , better hygiene , higher standard of living and so forth ; whereas much of Asia under the colonial rules of the West was deprived of such benefits .
Since 1950 , and particularly after the end of WWII , these industrial benefits started to cascade down to Asian as well as African and Latin American countries .
The result was a spectacular increase in population worldwide .
Within just 50 years , from 1950 to 2000 , the world population increased by 135 percent .
It may be noted that over the last two centuries population increased by 75 percent per century , whereas in 50 years , between 1950 and 2000 , the world population more than doubled .
This increase was largely driven by the Asian population growth .
In fact , Asian population in 2000 recovered to over 60 percent of the world population
With the increased awareness of the impact of population growth , the increase right across the world has been brought down by better education of the population .
But once population goes up , it is well nigh impossible to bring it down .
The proportional increase may be reduced , but still the sheer number will go up .
For example , it is projected that over the next 50 - year period , from 2000 to 2050 , the world population will increase by 50 percent to 8.9 billion ( an increase of 2.8 billion , which is higher that the entire world 's population in 1950 ) .
During this 50 - year period , the Asian population will increase by 45 percent .
What is the implication of population growth on climate change ?
It should be noted that the European and largely American population , constituting just 17 percent , had virtually completed their industrial processes within the last two and half centuries and now have very high standards of living .
The large majority of the world population , over 80 percent ( including 60 percent Asian ) , is now at the threshold of industrialisation .
If a small fraction of the population , numbering 1,000 million , can cause a devastation of the global climate to such an extent as to initiate melting of the ice caps , increases in sea levels etc. due to global warming , what the 80 percent of the population can do if similar industrialisation process is undertaken is simply too awful to contemplate .
It is not the intention at all to advocate restraint by the developing countries from industrialisation , which is an essential step to alleviate the poverty of the masses .
But there are other ways to improve the economy of the country and raise the living standards of the population than by following traditional hydrocarbon route to generate energy .
For example , the energy need can be adequately met by green energy solutions , which will not only cut the GHG emission but also be sustainable .
Developing countries should seek not the financial handout from the rich developed countries to tackle global warming , but technology transfer so that they can solve their own problems .
Of course , there would be an upfront cost for the technology transfer and the development of technological infrastructure .
They should seek such assistance , rather than register vociferous demands for hundreds of billions of dollars , as had been done at the Copenhagen meeting .

A Brazilian toddler found with 42 sewing needles inside him has been airlifted for emergency surgery .
Doctors have rushed him to a specialist cardiac unit in Salvador after discovering two needles in the left ventricle of his heart .
Police earlier said his stepfather had confessed to sticking the needles into the two - year - old boy .
Roberto Carlos
Magalhaes told them his mistress had told him to ritually kill the child to take revenge on his wife .
Doctors plan to extract the most dangerous of the needles - but removing them all will be too risky .
" We discovered that there seem to be two needles in the left ventricle , " said paediatric surgeon Fabio Contelle .
" This makes surgery a little more complicated ... that 's why we opted to transfer the boy to a specialised centre , " he said .
The toddler was taken to hospital in the north - eastern Bahia state by his mother , complaining of stomach pains and vomiting .
X - rays showed scores of sewing needles inside his neck , torso and legs .
' Revenge attack '
Police said Mr Magalhaes had broken down and confessed after being arrested .
" He did that for revenge , to get back at his wife , " the police chief in the town of Ibotirama , Helder Fernandes Santana , was quoted as saying by AFP news agency .
" His mistress told him to kill the child through a macabre ritual , " Mr Santana said .
The boy 's mother told police she suspected the child had been the victim of a black magic ritual after she found suspicious objects in the home she shared with Mr Magalhaes - her husband of six months - and her six children .
Doctors said there were no signs of wounds on the boy .
Reports say the boy is in a serious condition , but that he has shown some improvement since being admitted to hospital on Sunday .
Satire : Mockery and Compassion as One
in Honore Daumier and Duane Hanson
by Chaim Koppelman
Aesthetic Realism and its critical principles have enabled me to see how two satirical works of art I have cared for — created more than a century apart — are beautiful , show respect for mankind and also can teach us how to be kinder people .
Aesthetic Realism describes the fight that goes on in every person between the hope to respect the world and people and the desire to have contempt — “ the addition to self through the lessening of something else . ”
Contempt , including the way we are satirical and make fun of people different from ourselves in ordinary life , is what , intensified , causes the horrors of a Buchenwald , the ethnic warfare in Europe , and racism in our own country .
Satire as art is criticism that makes us laugh at what is contemptible in behalf of more respect .
For contempt to be defeated this great principle stated by Eli Siegel must be studied : “ All beauty is a making one of opposites , and the making one of opposites is what we are going after in ourselves . ”
In two strikingly related works — a 19th century print and a 20th century sculpture , the artists looked at people one might easily have contempt for and instead had large respect .
Honoré Daumier ’s ( 1809 - 1879 ) lithograph , Fruitless Search for the Planet dates from the great French artist ’s “ Pastorals ” series of the mid-l840s in which he gently satirizes middle class Parisians on holiday trying to commune with nature .
Tourists , by the American sculptor Duane Hanson , dates from 1970 and is now in the National Gallery at Edinburgh .
Honore Daumier , Fruitless Search for the Planet , 1846 .
Lithograph
The aesthetic and ethical problem dealt with and resolved so memorably in both these works and in all good satire is described clearly by Eli Siegel : Man wants to find deep meaning in the world ; and he also wants to make fun .
Man wishes to be kind , to honor the true meaning of pity ; but he also wishes to sneer , to jeer , to have contempt , to have a wonderful , self - enhancing time through mockery .
[ He ] has to ask how mockery and compassion have to do with each other .
1
This is the only way we can like ourselves for how we see other people : Humor can have good will in it .
There is the jest that is imaginatively , aromatically benevolent .
When man sees that his gift for contempt can go along with flexible justice and great kindness , man will at last think well of himself ....
Satire and flowers will be in the same world .
2 “ Mockery and compassion ” and “ satire and flowers ” are made one so beautifully in Daumier .
I think this is what Charles Baudelaire felt when he said , “ His caricature is without bile or rancor ... there is a foundation of honesty and good - naturedness . ”
3
Daumier makes fun of our foibles with respect and great affection for mankind and its meaning .
That is what made him beloved by the people of Paris and by this New Yorker more than a hundred years later .
We are all deeper than we know , and yet can sometimes appear not only awkward , but , like this couple , silly .
The situation is ludicrous .
A rather stout , elderly , middle - class couple , dressed for a stroll in the Champs - Elysees , stand in the middle of a deserted field at night , cozily arm in arm and looking up at the stars .
The husband wears a black jacket and hat — and Daumier ’s blacks have great depth — jauntily holding his umbrella at a sharp diagonal in the twilight evening sky .
His plump wife wears a black wrap and her bonnet is tied demurely under her chin .
This print is beautiful because it is a oneness of opposites — the high and low , near and distant , heavy and light .
Their forms begin with rather tiny feet , swell into rotundity and as they arch backwards with heads raised the forms taper again .
As they look with wonder into the sky they have depth , majesty and mystery .
Daumier has us look up at this couple , not condescendingly down .
We laugh and are moved simultaneously .
Daumier has evoked respect .
The couple is close and seen in relation to all space .
Daumier relates the figures in the foreground to the tree shapes in the background .
They stand in the spotlight and their shadows extend beyond them .
They are dark and light like the world they are in .
They are on their toes , their whole bodies lift , with heads raised , mouths open in wonder , looking up beyond themselves .
This relation shown by Daumier of the depths of a person to a boundless universe is the way of seeing which is necessary for contempt to be defeated .
Aesthetic Realism has been crucial to my happiness and to my career as an artist .
I have done many satirical prints and I had the honor of having my work discussed critically by Mr. Siegel in Aesthetic Realism classes .
When I was n’t sure whether I was having contempt or not in my work , Mr. Siegel asked me — and every artist should be asked this : “ When you are n’t in your workshop , have you enjoyed too much making fun of people in your mind ? ”
Unfortunately , I had , and Mr. Siegel showed that contempt was making for technical difficulty in the engraving I was working on .
He asked : “ If you are satirizing are you regretful that you are ? ” I learned from Mr. Siegel and from how he himself was all the time what it means to put together beautifully compassion and criticism .
I am very grateful to teach what I have learned to students in my printmaking classes at the School of Visual Arts , to distinguish between respect and contempt in an artist ’s idea and technique .
I think that the unforgettable Tourists by Duane Hanson ( 1925 -1996 ) is his best work because he was impelled by imaginative respect .
Tourists is “ benevolent , ” even though at first these life - size painted and clothed figures seem to invite contempt .
The sculptor saw reality ’s opposites here — “ satire and flowers ” are made one .
Decked out so tastelessly — he in his green Hawaiian shirt , tan checkered shorts , leather sandals , and actual camera paraphernalia , and she with her bright red stretch pants , her blue and white striped shirt , big beads , yellow hair net , big sun glasses , and finally , her patch worked , overstuffed beach bag — they too , like Daumier ’s couple , look up in wonder into deep space .

I had a large art experience when I first came upon this couple exhibited at the Whitney Museum .
My first response , like other museum visitors , was to laugh at this blatant display of bad taste .
As we approached the two people however , saw their lovely expressions — he with his hand to his brow , both standing firm and looking up — tears came to people ’s eyes .
“ Mockery and compassion ” were one .
People have always wanted to see and to be seen with the good will that is art .
That is what is taught by Aesthetic Realism : the art way of seeing the world , other people and ourselves as a co-presence of opposites .

Family brawl erupts at children 's pizza place
Arlington Heights police are investigating a " family ordeal that got out of hand " Sunday night at the Chuck E. Cheese restaurant , 955 W. Dundee Road .
According to Sgt. Tom Boggs , a family was apparently celebrating the birthday of a young man in his early teens when other members of the family showed up , and an argument began .
" There was a pushing match and things were thrown , " said Boggs .
One person was taken to Northwest Community Hospital with a cut below an eye and another person went to a clinic for a cut on a hand .
" We tried to talk to everybody there last night , " Boggs said .
" It 's hard to say at this point whether there will be charges . "
Boggs said he believes some of the participants had been drinking .
He is not sure how many people were involved , but officers talked with five or six Sunday night .
While the altercation created a mess in the restaurant , no physical damage was done there , the sergeant said .
Boggs said the people involved were from the Northwest suburbs .
The restaurant has pizza , arcade games , shows and other things that appeal to young children .
A woman who answered the phone Monday afternoon declined to comment on the record .

What are we getting in return for the bailout ?
So far , predatory credit card rates , exorbitant bank fees and obscene Wall Street bonuses .
But we ’re being robbed in other , sneakier ways , too .
It seems that taxpayers in the poorest , most vulnerable parts of the county are getting plundered by the same institutions they bailed out .
One example is AIG ’s underhanded fleecing of residents of rural Kentucky .
Middlesboro and Clinton are two tiny , impoverished towns in southern Kentucky with a combined population of 12,000 .
In 2008 , Middlesboro ’s per capita income was $ 13,189 a year , only a few hundred dollars more than the average worker earned in third - world Mexico .
That is if they were lucky to even get a job .
Real unemployment hovers somewhere around 30 % , and the state is so broke that half the people eligible for unemployment benefits can’t receive them .
Life may be tough and most people live in poverty , but that does n’t mean they ca n’t be made a little poorer .
That ’s the lesson locals learned after bailed - out insurance villain AIG took over their water utility and instantly raised rates to squeeze an extra $ 1 million in profits out of its new customers , forcing some to consider choosing between running water and food .
The towns are so rural , their residents have yet to be touched by the Internet revolution .
Forget comment sections or forum threads .
In Clinton , you have to track down actual hand - written notes that residents filed with city hall to read their complaints about the rate increase .
Luckily , city officials were nice enough to scan some of them .
Here ’s one , dated August 8 , 2009 :
My husband and I are on a fixed income and with everything going up in price this would be very a very large burden on us as well as most of the citizens of Clinton .
Our town is mostly of people like us and this would be such a hardship for us .
A 50.8 % raise is outrageous on anything .
Please do not let this happen .
It would mean the difference in bringing buying food and medicine or paying a high water bill to make someone else ’s life easier .
Here is how the AIG takeover went down :
In 2005 , flush with cash from its shady dealings in the mortgage derivatives market , AIG announced that it was in the process of acquiring Utilities Inc. , a holding company that controlled scores of small water utilities across 17 different states .
With just 300,000 customers , the company was n’t huge , but it boasted of being the largest privately held water utility in the country .
“ We have long considered water infrastructure as an attractive investment opportunity and an excellent complement to [ our ] existing energy infrastructure portfolio .
Utilities Inc. is a leader in this industry and we are pleased that [ we have ] the opportunity to acquire this business , ” AIG Chairman and CEO Win J. Neuger gloated in a press release .
AIG had reason to be pleased with its purchase .
Water utilities are one hell of a profitable business , with international corporations easily making a 20 to 30 % profit margin , according to a 2007 report by Food and Water Watch .
In the US , federal regulations limit profits to 10 % , a pesky rule that companies easily subvert by shuffling their income around and “ investing ” it in side businesses .
These kinds of returns would be the envy of the pharmaceutical and oil industries .
How do water companies do it ?
According to Food and Water Watch , they charge 50 % more for services than public utilities and pocket the difference , thereby unleashing the potential of the free market .
People who have been ripped off by bailed - out banks ’ schemes to trick late fees out of their customers will recognize what Utilities Inc. did to the people of Middlesboro and Clinton .
In the summer of 2008 , as AIG was teetering and desperate for funds , it “ upgraded ” its billing system , and suddenly a slew of late fee charges hit the struggling locals .
Residents had been getting their water bills like clockwork for as long as anyone could remember , but confusion and disorder set in as soon as Utilities rolled out its new and improved billing system .
Monthly statements started coming late or did n’t come in for months at a time .
People were double - billed and double - penalized for bills that never arrived .
One month , a bill would include sewer fees , the next month it would n’t — and you ’d be charged if did n’t catch the omission .
It ’s obvious the new invoice system was designed for pure harassment , creating chaos and reaping the rewards of the late fees it generated .
Internally , Utilities referred to their revamp of the billing system as “ Project Phoenix . ”
It sounded eerily similar to the CIA ’s “ Phoenix Program , ” which was designed to terrorize , kill and torture uppity Vietnamese villagers into submission during the Vietnam War .
One month after Project Phoenix started wreaking havoc on locals , AIG collapsed and took the first of over $ 150 billion in taxpayer bailout funds .
That meant Project Phoenix could still go on terrorizing locals — which it did .
Here is how a local newspaper described the new billing program in Clinton in March , 2008 :
It was n’t until the summer of 2008 that the new bills began to arrive and from Day One , they were messed up .
Few customers here in Clinton [ called ] the water company because they got multiple bills .
One business thought it got a break when its bill went down somewhat , only to discover that the bill had n’t included sewer costs .
This went on for several months .
Finally , the [ sewer bill ] showed up – due in full – on one bill .
Requests to spread out the payment fell on deaf ears .
. . .
Some of us were so confused by the bills , we paid them every time they came in .
. . .
Fears of bad credit reports and shut offs kept most customers paying whenever a bill arrived .
To make it harder for Clinton residents to file complaints , AIG closed the utility ’s local office as soon as it took over the company .
Pleas made by phone were rejected .
Local citizens are angry , upset and fearful .
Many senior citizens on fixed incomes are already stretched past the breaking point .
Others living below the poverty line without hope of getting a job are worried about how to pay another rising utility bill .
Customers we ’ve talked to “ want to do something , ” but say they cannot afford to file to intervene in the case .
The trip to Frankfort is daunting and expensive .
Some dare not leave the jobs or businesses they have for the time it would take to travel …
In November 2008 , right as AIG was recieving the second installment of its bailout and the economy was in a free - fall , AIG ’s water utility notified Middlesbro and Clinton residents that it would be raising rates by 51 % .
It would mean more than $ 750,000 in additional revenue a year , just from 8,000 customers .
The money would n’t be used to fund infrastructure improvements — none had been made and none were planned .
No , according to a company spokesman , the utility was trying to recoup money it had invested in its “ improved ” billing system , in effect forcing the victims of the billing system to pay for their own fleecing .
It seems Utilities was quite honest about explaining that a good chunk of the $ 750,000 would be transferred straight into the pockets of its investors , according to the West Kentucky Journal of Politics and Issues .
[ Another ] reason came from [ the ] company ’s financial expert , Pauline M. Ahern , who opined that a rate increase will allow [ the utility ] to “ earn a range of common equity cost ratio of 11.60 % to 12.10 % . ”
In the present market , that is an attractive return on investment .
One million dollars may not seem like much these days , but it sure meant a lot to the poverty - stricken residents of Middlesbro and Clinton .
There were quite a few bleak handwritten statements filed with Clinton ’s city hall during a public hearing on the water rates increase .
It makes sense to quote them to get a feel for the level of despair that exists in rural communities like this all over the United States .
Here ’s one from August 8 , 2009 :
I get $ 675.00 a month , if they raise the water , or utilities , I ca n’t pay them .
I would have to go without water , etc. or gas .
I ’m disabled and I can’t walk .
Raising the utilities hurt a lot of people here in Clinton .
Not just me but everyone .
As it is I ca n’t pay the water bills because its high .
But I pay what I can .
And here is another from August 12 , 2009 :
I feel that a rate increase of 50.8 % will add a heavy burden on our small rural community .
Our citizin [ sic ] that lives in our city are on Social Security , have full time jobs that pay barely minimum wage or are working as many as 3 part time jobs to make their monthly budget .
And another from May , 2009 :
“ I always have a high bills [ sic ] to pay .
I pay what I can .
I am on disable . [ sic ]
I try not to use too much water .
But yet I have a high water bill .
If the bill goes up , I will be lucky to pay them $ 10.00 instead of $ 80.00 .
In the end , Kentucky ’s regulatory commission reduced the water rate increase from 50.1 % to 30 % .
How long before they try raise the rate again ?
Or until the energy company decides to follow suit ?
It ’s hard to say .
But one thing is for certain : AIG ’s takeover shows again that the American people were screwed by the bailed - out billionaires , who , instead of showing gratitude or willingness to reciprocate , have been preying upon the most vulnerable Americans like they are 15th century barons soaking the peasants .
And as our cities and states start leasing out and selling public infrastructure to pay off their municipal debts , we can expect banks to gain more control of public wealth .
Middlesbro and Clinton are a glimpse into the future of post - privatized America .

A Philadelphia teenager turned himself into police after his self - portrait was captured on a cell phone he 's accused of stealing during an armed robbery .
Cook turned himself after this self - portrait was sent to police
The incriminating photo showed 18 - year - old Kadeem Cook holding a large handgun to his head , according to news reports .
The phone had been programmed to zap pictures to its owner 's home computer .
The phone and other belongings were allegedly stolen at gunpoint from a 20 - year - old woman .
Sometime after that , she received the photo and turned it over to police .
Cook turned himself in after the photo was splashed across numerous television and newspaper reports .
" We really appreciate him taking a picture of himself , " a police spokesman said .

A Church of England bishop has criticised some Christmas carols as nonsense and suggested others exhibit " Victorian behaviour control " .
The Rt Rev Nick Baines , the bishop of Croydon , sets out his views in his book Why Wish You a Merry Christmas ? , which aims to return to the Christmas story " at its heart " .
In the book , Baines says " most carols are OK " , and accepts they have a difficult task .
" They try , within the constraints of several verses and an easily memorable tune , to capture something of the story of Christmas or the mind - boggling idea of God becoming human and living among us , " he writes .
But even accepting these lyrical hindrances , the bishop believes some carols are lacking in substance .
He is particularly critical of nativity play favourite Away in a Manger , asking : " How can any adult sing this without embarrassment ? "
" I always find it a slightly bizarre sight when I see parents and grandparents at a nativity play singing Away in a Manger as if it actually related to reality .
I can understand the little children being quite taken with the sort of baby of whom it can be said ' no crying he makes ' , but how can any adult sing this without embarrassment ?
I think there are two problems here : first , it is normal for babies to cry and there is probably something wrong if they do n't ; secondly , are we really to believe that a crying baby Jesus should be somehow theologically problematic ?
Or , to put it more bluntly , is crying supposed to be sinful ? "
The bishop stresses that there is another serious problem with the content of some popular carols : " If we sing nonsense , is it any surprise that children grow into adults and throw out the tearless baby Jesus with Father Christmas and other fantasy figures ? "
Baines takes a verse of Once in Royal David 's City as an example of a carol with lyrics which have seemingly little relevance to the story of Christmas .
" Once in Royal David 's City has Jesus as ' our childhood 's pattern ' – even though we know almost nothing of his childhood apart from one incident when he was 12 years old and being disobedient to his parents – and invites children to be ' mild , obedient , good as he ' – which means what exactly ?
This sounds suspiciously like Victorian behaviour control to me . "
The bishop says O Come , All Ye Faithful also poses a problem : according to gospel accounts of Jesus 's birth it was " not the ' faithful ' , but rather the ' faithless ' " who came to see the infant .
He cites the shepherds , " who cannot fulfil the regular religious rituals because they are always up on the hills " , and the wise men , who " were not good Jews .
They were not Jews at all .
They were pagans – men who were outside the covenant people of God " as contradictions to the carol 's lyrics .
Baines does not hate all Christmas carols – " There are carols and poems that express in a single line what most of us struggle to put into a hundred or a thousand words , " he writes – but believes not enough of them remember that " Jesus spent time with people on all sides of the ' faith ' or godliness lines , " mixing with people from varying backgrounds .
Well here you have it folks , honest - to - goodness pics of the Google Phone ... AKA , the Nexus One .
As you can see by the photos , the design of the device is largely similar to those we 've seen , but the graphic on back is slightly different , and that piece of tape is covering a QR code ( how very Google of them ) .
Just like we 've heard before , the updated OS features new 3D elements to the app tray , as well as an extended amount of homescreens , though it looks like the lock screen / mute is the same as in Android 2.0.1 .
Additionally , there 's now a new grid icon at the bottom of the homescreen , which when pressed brings up a webOS card - style preview of all homescreen pages -- which raises some interesting possibilities .
Apparently there 's been a new software update for the device pushed tonight , and sure enough the phone is identified as the Nexus One on the system info page .
Quite clearly this device is running on T - Mobile , and is also using WiFi , so there 's two other questions you 've got answers to .
The phone also appears to come loaded up with Google Navigation ( a bit of a no- brainer ) and the brand - spanking - new Google Goggles .
Hardware wise , the Nexus does look incredibly thin and sleek , and while there 's not a slew of buttons ( those four up front are clearly touch sensitive ) , there is a dedicated volume rocker along the side .
Oh , and note this ... no HTC logo anywhere to be found .
We 'll update the post as / if we get more info , but for now , feast your eyes on the gallery below !
One item of interest .
In the packaging there 's a quick start guide which points users to a " questions " page at google.com / phone / support .
The page is a dead end right now , but it certainly gets an eyebrow raise from us .
If there is a real Google Phone in the offing , that seems a likely landing page for support .
In case you 're interested , here 's Android 2.1 's boot animation for Nexus One .
Eerily familiar , no ?
[ Thanks , RD ]
I was n't sure what I was going to get ( as I did n't put much info in ) but I got a great gift !!
A copy of Cosmos by Carl Sagan dated 1980 ( a first edition ) and a great T - shirt .
( Now I just gotta lose some weight to fit into it ! ) =D
Thanks Steve !
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer is known for his antics , but — if a video recently uploaded to YouTube is to be believed — this incident takes the cake .
Apparently , Ballmer fired a Microsoft employee for not being enthusiastic enough about Bing .
The video shows a man claiming to have been laid off by Ballmer at a Microsoft meeting related to Bing .
As the story goes , Ballmer was excitedly and repeatedly yelling Bing at the meeting , even pointing to staffers , putting them in the hot seat and telling them to say " Bing . "
When the man in question did n't exude the right enthusiasm , Ballmer fired him on the spot .
We can't verify if the video is authentic in nature , but we have contacted the guy who uploaded it for comment , and we 'll update this post when we know more details .
What do you think : real or fake ?
( Warning : strong language )
It would appear that " fake " is the correct answer .
The video 's creators now tell us " This video is a teaser for our new comedy screenplay about what it means to be a little guy in the land of giants .
This is our Christmas gift to the working class . "

This document is talking about deprecated feature .
The tracing JIT in SpiderMonkey consists of a generic , low level component called nanojit which is co-maintained between Adobe and Mozilla , and a SpiderMonkey - specific high level component called jstracer .
The nanojit component is language agnostic , and contains no knowledge about SpiderMonkey or any other part of the Mozilla codebase .
The jstracer component consists of a monitor and a recorder .
The monitor watches the executing SpiderMonkey interpreter .
When the monitor determines that the interpreter has entered a region of code that would benefit from native compilation , the monitor activates the recorder .
The recorder records the activity of the interpreter , using nanojit to build an efficient , native representation of the execution called a fragment .
The monitor then calls into the native code stored in the fragment .
A schematic diagram of the components of the tracing JIT follows :
Generic low level component : nanojit /*
The files in the nanojit directory define the nanojit component .
nanojit / LIR .*
The nanojit / LIR.cpp and nanojit / LIR.h files define the intermediate representation LIR , which is used as input to nanojit .
LIR is a conventional three - address , linear SSA code .
A single instruction of LIR is called a LIns , short for " LIR instruction " .
LIns values are depicted in blue in the schematic diagram .
In contrast , a single native instruction is called a NIns , and is depicted in red in the schematic diagram .
The recorder in jstracer inserts LIns values into a LIR buffer held in a page , itself contained within a logical fragment , and the nanojit compilation pipeline and Assembler transform the LIns values into NIns values .
nanojit / Fragmento .*
The nanojit / Fragment.cpp and nanojit / Fragmento.cpp files define the Fragment and Fragmento classes .
A Fragmento is a resource - management object that allocates and stores a set of Fragment s and Page s , and manages their lifecycle .
A Fragmento owns its associated Fragment s.
A Fragment represents a single linear code sequence , typically terminating in a jump to another Fragment or back to the beginning of the Fragment .
A Fragment 's code is stored in a set of associated Page s and GuardRecord s allocated from the Fragment 's owning Fragmento .
A Fragment initially holds no pages .
As the compilation pipeline inserts LIR instructions ( LIns values ) into the Fragment , it allocates Page s to store the LIR code .
Later , when the Fragment is assembled , it will allocate Page s for the native code ( NIns values ) produced by the Assembler .
When the Fragment is destroyed , it returns its Page s to the Fragmento for reuse .
nanojit / Assembler .*
The nanojit / Assembler.cpp and nanojit / Assembler.h files define the class Assembler , which transforms LIns values into NIns values .
In other words , an Assembler transforms LIR code into native code .
An Assembler is also able to modify existing fragments of native code , by rewriting native jump instructions to jump to new locations .
In this way the Assembler can " patch together " multiple fragments , so that program control can flow from one fragment into another , or back out of generated code and into the interpreter .
An Assembler is the only component of the tracing JIT that reads or writes native code .
Therefore an Assembler contains several machine - specific methods which are implemented in the accompanying nanojit / Native *.* files .
An Assembler runs in a single pass over its input , transforming one LIns value to zero or more NIns values .
It is important to keep in mind that this pass runs backwards from the last LIns in the input LIR code to the first , generating native code in reverse .
Running backwards sometimes makes the logic difficult to follow , but it is an essential factor in maintaining the Assembler 's high speed and small size .
In the SpiderMonkey tracing JIT there is only ever one Assembler active at a time , associated with the currently active Fragmento .
nanojit/ RegAlloc .*
Nanojit 's register allocator .
This is a local register allocator , meaning that it does not allocate registers across basic blocks .
It is correspondingly very simple : register allocation is done immediately , step - by - step as code is being generated .
A running tally is kept of assignments between registers and LIR operands , and any time a new LIR operand is required in a register a new one is assigned from the list of free registers .
When all registers are in use , the least - often - used register currently in use is spilled .
nanojit / Native *.*
The files Nativei386.h , Nativei386.cpp , NativeARM.h , NativeARM.cpp , etc. each define architecture - specific methods within the Assembler class .
Only one architecture - specific variant is included into any given build of the Assembler ; the architecture is selected and fixed when the build is configured .
The architecture - specific methods found in these files are the only functions within nanojit or TraceMonkey that emit raw bytes of machine - code into memory .
SpiderMonkey - specific high level component : jstracer .*
The files jstracer.cpp and jstracer.h contain a the mechanisms of monitoring and recording the activity of the interpreter .
Each SpiderMonkey JSContext holds a trace monitor of type JSTraceMonitor .
The trace monitor maintains some book - keeping information , as well as the collection of recorded Fragment s , held in a hashtable keyed by the interpreter 's program counter and global object shape at the time of recording .
At any moment , the trace monitor is in one of three major states : monitoring , recording , or executing .
The transitions between these states are somewhat complex and delicate , but the overall picture is simple :
Monitoring
The trace monitor 's initial state is monitoring .
This means that SpiderMonkey is interpreting bytecode .
Every timeSpiderMonkey interprets a backward - jump bytecode , the monitor makes note of the number of times the jump - target program - counter ( PC ) value has been jumped - to .
This number is called the hit count for the PC .
If the hit count of a particular PC reaches a threshold value , the target is considered hot .
When the monitor decides a target PC is hot , it looks in a hashtable of fragments to see if there is a fragment holding native code for that target PC .
If it finds such a fragment , it transitions to executing mode .
Otherwise it transitions to recording mode .
Recording
When the trace monitor enters recording mode , it constructs a new trace recorder , of type TraceRecorder .
It then passes control back to the SpiderMonkey interpreter .
The interpreter continues interpreting bytecode , but with an important difference : each bytecode it interprets is also sent to the trace monitor and recorded in the monitor 's trace recorder .
Recording mode is temporary -- ideally it only lasts as long as it takes to record a single iteration of a loop in the interpreter -- and can end in a number of ways .
All transitions out of recording mode eventually involve returning to monitoring mode :
If the recorder is asked to record a bytecode that it cannot , for various low - level reasons , faithfully record , the recorder may choose to abort the recording .
Aborting a recording is always an option in tracemonkey , and on abort the monitor simply discards the recorder and its fragment and returns to monitoring mode .
The monitor also keeps track of how many times it has attempted to record a trace starting at each PC value , so if a particular PC causes too many aborted recordings , the monitor blacklists the PC and will not attempt recording it any longer .
mode .
The monitor also keeps track of how many times it has attempted to record a trace starting at each PC value , so if a particular PC causes too many aborted recordings , the monitor blacklists the PC and will not attempt recording it any longer .
If the recorder completes recording at a backward branch back to the initial PC value that triggered recording mode , it is said to have successfully closed the loop .
A closed loop is passed through the nanojit Assembler and thereby compiled to native machine code .
The associated fragment is placed in the monitor 's fragment table and the monitor returns to monitoring mode , with a high likelihood of immediately transitioning to executing mode on the next bytecode interpreted .
The compiled fragment of code returned to the monitor on successful loop - close is called a trace .

A closed loop is passed through the nanojit Assembler and thereby compiled to native machine code .
The associated fragment is placed in the monitor 's fragment table and the monitor returns to mode , with a high likelihood of immediately transitioning to mode on the next bytecode interpreted .
The compiled fragment of code returned to the monitor on successful loop - close is called a trace .
If the recorder is asked to record a bytecode that implies a call to a native function elsewhere in SpiderMonkey -- some helper function written in C -- and that native happens to re-enter the interpreter to interpret yet more bytecode , and furthermore if that bytecode itself contains a hot PC that has not yet been traced , the trace monitor may be asked to begin nested recording .
This is the same as normal recording mode , except that the outermost recorder is placed on a deferred - abort stack .
When the innermost recorder completes -- successfully or otherwise -- every recorder on the deferred abort stack is aborted .
This process is called deep aborting the suspended recorders .
Executing
When the monitor interprets a backward jump to a PC that it has a compiled trace of machine code for , the monitor enters executing mode .
This mode is relatively simple compared to recording mode .
First the monitor allocates a native stack for the trace to use , and a state structure containing various key pointers into the SpiderMonkey interpreter 's state , including a pointer to the native stack .
It then imports the set of jsval values from the SpiderMonkey interpreter that the trace is known to read or write during its execution .
This set was determined during recording , and the imported values are stored locally within the native stack during execution .
values from the SpiderMonkey interpreter that the trace is known to read or write during its execution .
This set was determined during recording , and the imported values are stored locally within the native stack during execution .
The monitor then calls into the native code of the trace , passing in a pointer to the state structure as the sole argument .
The native code of the trace runs , modifying the state structure and native stack , as well as calling native SpiderMonkey C functions , and reading from and writing to objects in the SpiderMonkey heap .
The native code returns a pointer to a structure called a side exit .
The monitor inspects the side exit and , depending on the exit condition , reconstructs a certain number of interpreter frames and flushes a certain set of writes back to the SpiderMonkey heap .
Frame reconstruction is necessary because a trace may inline a number of function calls , and may exit before those function calls return .
Write flushing is necessary because all writes to imported values in the native stack are deferred until trace - exit , as an optimization .
If the side exit condition indicates that the trace exited successfully -- simply running out of native code or hitting a branch condition that no native code yet exists to handle -- the monitor will inspect the hit count for the trace - exiting PC .
If that PC has itself grown hot , the monitor will immediately transition to recording mode starting with the exiting PC .
Otherwise it will return to monitoring mode .
mode starting with the exiting PC .
Otherwise it will return to mode .
If the side exit condition indicates that the trace exited unsuccessfully -- due to encountering sufficient memory pressure to trigger a garbage collection , running out of native stack space , expiring a timer or any similar abnormal condition -- the monitor returns to monitoring mode .
Some other terminology may be helpful when reading the code :

On being Lebanese
“ We do n’t live in a vacuum .
Ideas have to come from somewhere .
Is it possible to be an Arab , a Lebanese , and a woman today , and not be affected by the tragedies that unfold every day ? ”
“ Typography is means to an end .
Arabic typography is half Arabic and half typography .
It is not possible to seperate letterforms from the reality in which they will appear .
To understand Arabic typography is to understand first what is Arabic . ”
I wrote this three years ago when Lebanon was going through a tough political and cultural crisis .
Very little has changed since then .
I wrote this on my blog which is dedicated to Arabic typography , but I found that I could not dissociate letterforms from the environment that they are designed for .
And so design , culture , and politics , go hand in hand .
On being Arabic
Can we really define what Arabs are like ?
I am not so sure .
The Arab world stretches over a huge area and encompasses many different cultures and traditions .
We all read the same language , but we have our own distinct dialects .
We are conservative and liberal , traditional and modern , illiterate and well - educated , deeply religious and ( yes ) atheists .
We are all of these things so how can one really define what is an Arab ?
To my mind , it is the common experience of growing up in such context , and the common visual memory that many of us share .
It is the Grandiser cartoons that we watched as kids , the Fairouz and Abed al - Halim songs that we listen to , the black - and - white Egyptian movies , the hand written signs across town , and the great food …
It is hard to pinpoint , but there are definitely issues that deeply touch and affect many of us .
One of these is the continuous political turmoil in the region .
Passions run high , tension prevails , and storms are constantly brewing .
This is the one river that flows underneath Arab cities .
And so , current and past events shape our visual memory and this is true of any script .
The typefaces in which our newspapers are set are tinged with the news of today .
To appreciate this , just pick up a newspaper from 50 years ago and you will be transported in time .
You will not only read of the news that made the headlines that day , but you will come face to face with the visual memory of that period .
On Arabic typography
Finally , a resting place .
This I can talk about easily .
Arabic calligraphy is beautiful , diverse , and often simply breath - taking .
Arabic typography is most often not .
And this is just sad .
Thankfully , many of the technological hurdles have been removed .
The design standards of new typeface releases have been greatly improved .
It is definitely an exciting time to live in .
When I joined Linotype , the company where I like to work , I had the support and back up to explore our Arabic library and recommend a way forward .
This was certainly the most exciting task in my career so far .
Is n’t it great to be a library architect ?
Over the last years we released several new Arabic typefaces , many of which proved to be popular .
This gave further impetus to the drive to continue to explore the world of Arabic typography .
What more could we do ?
For a library that includes the world ’s most popular typefaces , some of the answers are quite obvious .
And one day , I came face to face with my Everest .
I had suggested that an Helvetica Arabic would be a valuable addition to the Arabic library .
The colleagues agreed .
On Neue Helvetica Arabic
Now how would you translate an iconic design into a script that defies neutrality ?
Is this even possible ?
To make things more complicated , Arabic calligraphic styles are many and some are more suited for headlines , others for text .
Helvetica functions on both platforms so the Arabic needs to do so as well .
It needs to be commanding , professional , authoritative , composed , well - crafted , stable , and most important , neutral .
The design process of Neue Helvetica Arabic was like taking a hot iron to a Naskh - Kufi hybrid design .
Now that ’s a tough negotiation .
You see , I had to make sure not to iron what is Arabic out of it as well !
On the design brief
The design brief was very clear :
1. Design a typeface that would be the Arabic companion to Neue Helvetica .
2 . The Arabic version would be true to Arabic script aesthetics and be able to function on its own as well .
3 . The Latin and Arabic can be used at the same point size , with the same weight and optical size .
4 . The typeface would translate the Helvetica concept into Arabic , especially its neutrality , formality , and ability to be used for a multitude of projects .
On the design of Neue Helvetica Arabic
One would think that all one has to do is to import the curves of the Latin into the Arabic script structure and the work is practically done .
This is not the case .
The design approach here is quite different : Look at what Neue Helvetica does as a typeface , how it functions , what visual message does it carry , and then see how to achieve that function and message in Arabic .
It is not about how similar the curves are , but how similar the typefaces function .
This is at the heart of multi-script type design .
The typeface family consists of 3 weights : Light , Regular , and Bold .
Neue Helvetica Arabic is a mono - linear design with very little contrast .
Its design is a clean hybrid of Kufi and Naskh structures and this enables it to function in both text and headline settings .
Its curves are very low on contrast and have been designed to be formal , well - crafted and robust in appearance .
This is a no nonsense typeface .
Its voice is calm and authoritative .
Its design is , finally , neutral .
Wishing on a typeface
Can a typeface go beyond the present and into the future ?
Is it possible to bring Swiss neutrality into the Middle East ?
Peace and prosperity ?
The inspiration for Neue Helvetica Arabic does not come from type specimens or calligraphy books , but from the reality of life in Lebanon .
This is a typeface for hard - working and motivated professionals .
This is the only way forward .
But life is not only about work .
And so we need many more typefaces , and many more ideas .
More to come soon so stay tuned !
UC Berkeley police arrested 66 protesters - some in stocking feet and underwear - at Wheeler Hall on campus early Friday , ending a weeklong occupation to draw attention to fee hikes and budget cuts throughout the University of California system .
Officers from the Berkeley campus and some from UCSFbegan arresting the protesters at Wheeler Hall at 4:40 a.m. , said campus spokesman Dan Mogulof .
" There was no force , no confrontation , nobody resisted , " Mogulof said .
" At most , it was a wake - up call : They were sleeping . "
The university had originally planned to let the demonstrators stay through Friday evening , when students had indicated they expected to leave .
Final exams were scheduled for this morning in Wheeler Auditorium , where the demonstrators had camped out .
But when the students distributed flyers and sent out word via Facebook about an all - night hip - hop party Friday nightthat would continue " until the cops kick in the doors , " according to one blog , police decided to roust the occupiers , Mogulof said .
" We acted in the best interest of the 34,900 students who were not participating in the protest , " he said .
Of the 66 people arrested for trespassing , it appeared that 38 were students , he said .
They were taken to Santa Rita Jail in Dublin , where all but five were cited and released , Mogulof said .
One remained in jail because of an outstanding warrant , and four were kept in custody because they had no California address , which makes them ineligible for quick release .
The arrests came a day after another building occupation ended with 25 arrests at San Francisco State University .
Students participating in the takeover on Wheeler Hall said it was a way for them to show that UC remains a public university at a time when the state is reducing tax - funded support of the school , and as students are forced to spend more on tuition .
They said they were determined to keep the auditorium clean , and never intended to disrupt classes or review sessions going on at Wheeler Hall .
" This was an experiment in student self - government , " said Zhivka Valiavichareska , who participated in the occupation but was n't at Wheeler during Friday 's arrests .
Sociology Professor Louise Fortmann , among many faculty members who sympathize with the students ' anger at fee hikes and education cutbacks , criticized the raid in an e-mail Friday to Chancellor Robert Birgeneau and Provost George Breslauer .
" I 'm sorry , but they forced our hand , " Breslauer told Fortmann in reply .
" We were tolerant and patient for four days . "
He explained that the planned concert on the eve of finals could have drawn many people from surrounding areas , and " Wheeler could well have been trashed , and still occupied , by morning .
" The occupiers abused our tolerance , " Breslauer said .
This is a simple test / benchmark I wrote to test out the new urllib3 library that I found on the internets today .
I currently use the excellent httplib2 , so I used it for comparison .
A typical run looks something like this :
simple sequential download , first run : urllib3 took 2.396 seconds httplib2 took 1.851 seconds simple sequential download , second run : urllib3 took 1.705 seconds httplib2 took 0.104 seconds now , urllib3 with 4 threads and 4 connections : took 1.124 seconds
Each timed run downloads 15 URLs , all from the same google domain .
In the first sequential benchmark , httplib2 and urllib3 are pretty even .
Sometimes one is faster , sometimes the other is .
It 's a wash .
This makes sense because they both have persistent connections .
In the second sequential benchmark , httplib2 is always much faster , due to it pulling everything from its on - disk cache .
In the last benchmark , urllib3 tends to execute in 1/3 to 1/ 2 the time it would sequentially , by using a thread pool and a connection pool , each with a size of 4 .
There is no comparison with httplib2 here , because httplib2 currently is not thread - safe .
Conclusions
urllib3 is no faster than httplib2 if used in a sychronous , sequential manner , even if fetching from the same domain over and over .
httplib2 is incredibly faster than urllib3 if you are fetching the same content over and over and can take advantage of caching .
urllib3 is much faster than httplib2 if you run multiple threads , which httplib2 is currently not capable of .
This is urllib3 's killer feature .
The speed benefits from caching vs. multi - threaded downloading may be hard to accurately predict , and it's not trivial to swap out one library for the other to do a test run ( see next item ) .
urllib3 is a bit more primitive in its API , forcing you to create a separate HTTPConnectionPool object for every domain you want to connect to .
You might want to construct a " pool of pools " which would transparently cache these pool objects , expiring ones that have n't been used in a while , or something similar .
httplib2 already does this for you .
Other Options
D.C. Council approves same - sex marriage 11 - 2
In a second and final vote on the measure , the D.C. Council officially passed a bill that would legalize same - sex marriage on Tuesday afternoon .
The bill awaits Mayor Adrian M. Fenty 's signature -- which is expected before Christmas -- and then will go through a congressional review period .
If the bill passes that hurdle , same - sex marriages could begin as early as spring 2010 .
To block the legislation , the Democratic - controlled House and Senate and President Obama all would have to sign off on a disapproval resolution within 30 legislative days , which advocates say is not likely .
The vote followed statements by each Council member , including sponsor David Catania ( I - At Large ) , who forgave those he knew would vote against the measure , and Marion Barry ( D - Ward 8 ) , who explained why he would not support it and expressed admiration for the city 's gay community .
Barry and Alexander again were the two votes against the same - sex marriage bill .

What a year we ’ve had , ladies & gentlemen !
It ’s time to look back on some of the most defining moments of 2009 in the U - S - of - A , which is now popularly considered one of the worst years ever .
Howevs , because the gays really have nowhere to go but up , several sparkles shone upon our homosexual horizon this year .
Ready ?
These are in no particular order , FYI .
No order .
Just random .

There is a theory that Oprah actually only had them on the show so that later , backstage , she could ask them to babysit .
( JK does Oprah even have kids ?
Probs not , maybe she needs them to babysit Dr. Phil )
Ellen ’s biggest success this year , however , was on her own show , when Portia ’s new sitcom Better Off Ted provided the couple with an opportunity to be totally adorable on television .
AfterEllen.com :
“ The whole episode was another one of those quietly revolutionary moments .
You just have to read all the gushing tweets about the interview from people across America to see how many people , gay and straight , were charmed by their appearance on the show together today .
For many straight people , Ellen and Portia are the only same - sex couple they know , and that ’s why this episode , and Friday ’s “ rehearsal ” episode , will arguably do more for improving the visibility of same - sex marriage than all the Prop.
8 PSAs put together . ”
WORST : Lilo & Samro , Cherry Jones & Sarah Paulson AND Rosie & Kelli call it quits
Lindsay and Sam more or less officially separated this year , which breaks all of our little bisexual hearts .
If a DJ and an actress / model with substance abuse problems can’t find true love , WHO CAN ?
Lindsay , of course , entertained us all year long with her pining @ replies to Sam .
We ’re still pretty sure that they ’ll get back together soon though , and we ’ve had just about enough of the entire mass media trying to prove Lindsay ’s going back to men .
In other breakup news , Rosie & Kelli confirmed rumors that the couple was having trouble , though we were assured that the split would have no affect on the children or their togetherness as a family .
Meanwhile , Cherry Jones & Sarah Paulson quietly broke up , sans drama and @ -replies .

The heartland finally got on the equality bandwagon and Vermont soon followed , becoming the first state to legalize same - sex marriage by legislative , not judicial , action .
Massachusetts says WELCOME TO THE PARTY , Y’ALL .
WORST : California Supreme Court upholds Prop 8 ( May 26 )
What is there to say ?
We made clever signs and cried and tried to talk reasonably to all the crazies that we did n’t the first time , and ultimately , that still did n’t change America so that a majority could n’t vote on the rights of a minority .

Obama spoke to the HRC the night before the National Equality March and repromised a lot of things , including ending DADT and fighting DOMA .
And then Lady Gaga sang , which was obvs the best part of the night !
Also speaking of great speechmaking , Wanda Sykes became the first out lesbo to address the White House Correspondents Dinner .
She did a good job !
WORST : DADT continues / Obama does n’t deliver on campaign promises ( all year long )
Despite more and more people coming out against DADT ( including the American Medical Association , military higher - ups , and Obama himself ) , the policy still stands and continues to make gay soldiers ’ lives difficult .
And though Obama has backtracked from offensive statements made from his administration about gay marriage , Obama has yet to take action on DOMA .
NEXT :
Maine , the untimely death of Jennifer Schecter ,
and where ’s our equal rights , bitches !?!

Meredith Whitney 's comments this morning sounded like something right out of " American Apocalypse I " :
The government is running out of ways to help the economy as the US faces major issues regarding credit and employment ahead , banking analyst Meredith Whitney told CNBC .
" I think they 're out of bullets , " Whitney said in an interview during which she reinforced remarks she made last month indicating she is strongly pessimistic about the prospects for recovery .
Primary among her concerns is the lack of credit access for consumers who she said are " getting kicked out of the financial system . "
The book is reminiscent of other post - apocalyptic stories - like " Alas , Babylon " following a nuclear war - except the financial and social crisis of American Apocalypse builds slowly throughout the story , adding tension to the challenges of survival .
Gardener lives in a suburb of D.C. that faces cutbacks in services , creating more hardships for the homeless and unemployed .
Eventually the town goes bankrupt , and an Old West style of justice becomes the norm - and Gardener discovers a Charles Bronson " Death Wish " like talent .
American Apocalypse I Buy it Now !
I am sure that someday a history will be written of our times , I am just not sure from whose perspective it will be written .
Eventually there will be a Gibbons to write the Decline and Fall , but I am positive it will not be Europe or America that produces the author .
The fragmentation of information sources was accelerating .
Print had failed as a business model , at least of the daily news ; digital broadcast news was homogeneous for the most part .
The only difference in the networks was what shade of the official color you wanted .
Online news was the least regulated and most interesting ; the only problem was the amount of noise one had to sift through to find a reliable source .
I was still reading Calculated Risk then , this was before the ' Information Consolidation Act ' shut him down .
Disclosure : Nova sent me an unsolicited proof copy of his book .
I ’ve received no compensation for this review .
In American Apocalypse , Nova imagines the economic recovery stalling , leading to the collapse of another major financial firm , the unemployment rate rising to 14 % and the fabric of society starting to unravel .
Nova 's protagonist , Gardener , loses his job , and is forced to face the challenges of the street .
Almost vacant strip malls , " car people " , " tree people " and tent cities are all part the scenery .
Here is an excerpt :
Oh no , watch out for the ICA !
Nova has a website where he is currently posting chapters from Part II .
The book is fast paced and gripping ; a terrifying portrait of what seems a little too possible .
With the accessibility of Kindle and eBook reading devices , our readership habits have changed measurably over the last few years .
Many of us are returning to the types of fiction we read as kids .
Comic books are becoming popular again .

File Size : 7087 KBPublisher : Robot Comics KIDD MILLENNIUM is the unofficial heir to R.F. Outcault ’s 19thcentury newspaper comic sensation , THE YELLOW KID .
In this epic Graphic Novel sized outing , the kidd goes after the “ War on Terror ” , Energy Committee , the no-bid contracts , the PSAs ( Production Sharing Agreements ) , Government - employed mercenaries , outing a CIA Agent , the firing of U.S. Justices , the relinquishment of Civil Liberties , the failings of the US ' 43rd President and the continuous havoc wreaked by his nefarious VP .
The denouement actually unveils the creators ’ best guess for the next president of the United States to be elected in 2008 ( and which , now , after you read this Graphic Novel , you ’ll know if their prediction came true or not ! ) .
Since this is a parody , some identifiable real life celebre - du - jours are interwoven into this tale .
Any resemblance to a White House intern , an Iraqi stand up comedian and a Left Coast teen gone Mullah … is purely intentional .
While the creators doubt that these micro-celebs had any direct relationship to the history that unfolds in CRUDE BEHAVIOR , they embedded them into the story for pure comic relief and as architects in moving the plot along .
CRUDE BEHAVIOR is one of the first books to expose the current geo-political scene in vibrant color ( or in this Kindle edition ’s case , in 16 slick shades of gray ) .
Illustrations were provided by the award - winning artist , Jon Donohoe .

This cartoonist 's memoir of growing up in a family in which his brother 's grand mal epilepsy regularly took center stage is packaged here in its entirety .
He reports on the childhood adventures and interests he and his siblings shared –including warrior fantasies , a fascination with World War II , and drawing –and the family 's increasing involvement in seeking help for coping with the disease of epilepsy .
His brother 's failure to respond for any duration to any form of treatment or to adjust to life with a chronic disease is presented with unsentimental but humane forthrightness .

While the final difficulties revolve around the author and his inability to become a father , most of the book should appeal to both teen and adult readers .
( UPDATE : No longer available as e-book , buy paperback here ) File Size : 5285 KBPublisher : Pantheon Previously published in the independent comic - book series Eight Ball , this is a darkly comic romp through the small Midwestern town of Ice Haven .
The basic story is pretty straightforward : a sad , quiet little boy named David Goldberg vanishes .
But instead of delivering a pulp - inspired detective story , the author uses the child 's tale mostly as a backdrop .
His real interest is in the lives of the bizarre , yet all - too - real townsfolk .
They include a lovesick teen , an irritable private detective , a poet , and a schoolyard bully .
Although the characters are types , the author / illustrator embellishes them enough to make them unique and memorable .
Through vignettes that jump perspective every few pages , readers witness their lives and individual reactions to David 's disappearance .
As the point of view shifts , so does the artwork .
In showing how the event affects the boy 's classmates , the panels take on a style inspired by Charles Schultz's , but the author moves into satire with a bleakly funny schoolyard of kids talking quite openly about sex , drugs , and violence .
Other vignettes pull from the motifs of detective strips , teen romances , and .
While well - read comics fans will get most of the jokes , some references may frustrate or confuse readers .
Overall , though , there is plenty here to enjoy . (

I am an ordinary man who for over twenty years has been the target of extraordinary persecution by the U.S. - based Scientology organization .
My case exemplifies a new type of " religious " persecution being perpetrated by Scientology , persecution reinforced by the American justice system and government .
But my case is not unique .
There are thousands of people , including many here in Europe , who are similarly persecuted by Scientology .
Mine , however , is the best - documented example , because of its duration and because of the steadfast refusal God has given me to be crushed or shuddered into silence .
This synopsis can but scratch the surface of my story .
Inside Scientology
I was inside Scientology for over twelve years , from 1969 , to when I escaped in 1981 .
For eleven years I was in the organization 's inner pseudo - military core , the Sea Organization ( SO ) .
There I held a number of key positions , including the Legal Officer , Public Relations Officer and Intelligence Officer on board the organization 's " Flagship Apollo , " from which Scientology was managed and controlled internationally .
I worked with Scientology founder and director and SO Commodore L. Ron Hubbard on board the ship , and later in Florida and California .
Hubbard 's Biography Researcher
In my final two years in the SO , I had the task of collecting and assembling an archive of Hubbard 's personal documents , and doing research for his biography .
During the course of my research , I discovered and documented that Hubbard had lied about virtually every part of his life , including his education , degrees , family , explorations , military service , war wounds , scientific research , the efficacy of his " sciences " - Dianetics and Scientology - along with the actions and intentions of the organizations he created to sell and advance these " sciences . "
When I attempted to get Scientology executives to correct the lies that the organization was promoting about Hubbard , and which Hubbard promoted about himself , I was attacked and ordered to be security checked .
A " sec check " is an invasive , incriminatory Scientology interrogation technique using its E - meter lie detector .
During my years in the SO , I had been subjected to hundreds of hours of sec checks , and had twice been ordered by Hubbard to the Rehabilitation Project Force ( RPF ) [ 1 ] , the organization 's punishment and reprogramming camps , for a total of twenty - five months .
Rather than being again locked up and forced to submit to further abuse and degradation , I fled .
Fair Game
Immediately after leaving the organization , I became a target of Scientology 's basic philosophy , policy and practice for dealing with criticism or opposition , which the organization calls " Fair Game . "
In one short description of this noxious concept , Hubbard wrote :
" ENEMY - SP Order .
Fair game .
May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist .
May be tricked , sued or lied to or destroyed . " [ 2 ]
An " SP " in Scientology terminology is a " Suppressive Person , " considered by the Scientologists to be supremely evil , without any rights , and meriting destruction .
Scientology declared me a Suppressive Person in early 1982 and has been subjecting me to Fair Game ever since .
Pursuant to its Fair Game doctrine , Scientology or its agents have :
assaulted me on multiple occasions ;
terrorized me on the freeway ;
stolen photographs from me ;
broke into my car and stolen documents , a manuscript and original artwork ;
spied on me ;
threatened to assassinate me ;
threatened my family ;
harassed my neighbors ;
paid a corrupt police officer for a fake authorization to eavesdrop on me and my attorney and tap our telephones ;
illegally videotaped me ;
attempted numerous times to have me prosecuted on false criminal charges , including with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation ;
sued me six times ;
driven me into bankruptcy ;
carried out covert intelligence operations against me ; and
defamed me with hundreds of Black PR publications .
Black PR or Black Propaganda is Scientology 's policy and practice of destroying a person 's reputation or public belief in him by willful and relentless slander and libel . [ 3 ]
Scientology 's First Lawsuit
The first case in which Scientology sued me went to trial in 1984 in Los Angeles , California Superior Court , and resulted in a scathing judgment against the organization and Hubbard , later affirmed on appeal :
" In addition to violating and abusing its own members civil rights , the organization over the years with its " Fair Game " doctrine has harassed and abused those persons not in the Church whom it perceives as enemies .
The organization clearly is schizophrenic and paranoid , and this bizarre combination seems to be a reflection of its founder LRH .
The evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history , background and achievements .
The writings and documents in evidence additionally reflect his egoism , greed , avarice , lust for power , and vindictiveness and aggressiveness against persons perceived by him to be disloyal or hostile . "  Judge Paul G. Breckenridge Jr.
An Unconscionable Settlement
In December 1986 , in the process of settling my own lawsuit against Scientology for years of fraud , Fair Game , and emotional devastation , I was coerced and tricked into signing a " settlement contract " with the organization , which is patently onerous , unfair and immoral .
My attorney , who then represented some twenty organization victims , had himself been fair gamed for several years , and was desperate to have the organization 's attacks on him and his family stop .
I was part of a group settlement involving all of his clients , who also wanted the attacks on themselves to stop .
My attorney insisted that the prohibitory conditions of the " contract , " which prevented me from communicating about my Scientology experiences or knowledge , and which punished me with $ 50,000 per utterance , were illegal and judicially unenforceable , but that I had to sign to have Fair Game end for everyone .
Scientology did not cease its Fair Game and Black PR attacks on me following the " settlement , " however , but continued without letup .
When , after enduring these attacks for some time , I finally responded to defend myself and my reputation , the organization filed suit against me to enforce its " contract . "
I then learned that my attorney had himself signed a " contract " with Scientology that prevented him from assisting me in my defense in this lawsuit or against any other attacks .
California Court Enforces the Unconscionable Settlement
In 1995 , without a trial , and ignoring my Constitutional defenses , a Marin County , California Superior Court issued a judgment assessing $ 50,000 in " damages " against me for every instance when , to defend myself , I spoke out about my experiences in or knowledge of Scientology .
The California Court stated that every Scientology " church , " entity or front group around the world , and all of their personnel , lawyers or agents may say whatever they want about me , no matter how false or perverse , and I may not say one word in response .
This judgment forced me into bankruptcy , and made me subject to jail and fines if I continued to speak out to correct lies the organization and its personnel and agents were continuing to disseminate , or if I in any way helped any other victims of the organization 's abuse or targets of its Fair Game .
Scientology 's IRS Tax Exemption
In early 1997 , I discovered that Scientology had filed several pages of Black PR and lies about me with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) in the application that resulted in the granting of the organization 's tax exemption in the U.S.
In previous years , the IRS had based its denial of Scientology 's application for tax exemption in part on the judgment against the organization in their first lawsuit against me .
Being prohibited from communicating about this situation in the U.S. , or even communicating about the unjust judgment against me , and facing imprisonment and fines if I did communicate , I left my home in California and fled to Canada .
I felt that in Canada , where I had grown up , and where Scientology was known as a criminally convicted organization , I would be safe to oppose the organization 's persecution and correct the lies and injustices the organization and its agents were perpetrating .
I wrote and spoke to the IRS , and to other U.S. agencies or officials about the fraud in Scientology 's tax exemption application , and about the organization 's " religious " persecutions , without success or response .
Court Orders Against Freedom of Opinion
Some months after I fled to Canada , Scientology , without proper notice , obtained an order of contempt against me in the California State Court for sending a declaration to a U.S. Federal Judge .
I had been subpoenaed by a person defending himself against the organization , and I was then threatened with prosecution by a Scientology lawyer if I responded to the legal subpoena .
The purpose of my declaration was to advise the Federal Judge of the illegal threat from the organization lawyer .
The California Court sentenced me to jail and fined me , and Scientology had a warrant issued for my arrest .
From Canada , I filed an appeal of the judgment of the California Court , but Scientology had the appeal dismissed by arguing I had not served my jail sentence , and thus was not entitled to an appeal .
I believe that if I did return to California I would never get out of jail , but would be brutally silenced by Scientology 's agents , and even if in jail I could not appeal from the organization 's unjust judgment nor have any physical security .
In 1998 , the organization obtained another court order to jail and fine me for additional instances of communicating about the judgment and my Scientology experiences , specifically :
Internet postings made from Canada ;
public statements in Europe , including : an interview broadcast on British television ; a speech in Berlin ; an interview with Berliner Zeitung ; an appearance at a public event in Hamburg ; interviews resulting in broadcasts on German channels N - TV , B1 TV
and SAT 1 TV ; an interview with Die Tageszeitung . [ 4 ]
Scientology then had a second warrant issued for my arrest .
In 2001 , Scientology obtained a third order of contempt against me for 131 Internet postings I made from Canada .
New Lawsuit Against Freedom of Opinion in Canada and Europe
In April this year , 2002 , Scientology filed yet another lawsuit against me , and included as co-defendants Robert S. Minton , an American critic of the organization , and the Lisa McPherson Trust ( LMT ) , a cult victims assistance organization that Minton founded .
The LMT is named after a Scientology victim who was locked up by the organization in 1995 , and died after 17 days of agony while being held in isolation .
The new suit seeks $ 50,000 from me for each of 204 instances of my communicating about persecution by the organization or my experiences as a Scientologist , for a total of $ 10,050,000 .
Scientology has sued Minton and the LMT because Minton loaned me money and provided me with a computer .
The organization claims that this facilitated my being able to communicate about Scientology and its persecutions , and thus breach the " settlement contract " and the California " judgment . "
These claimed breaches consist of :
165 Internet postings made from Canada ;
several pickets of Scientology organizations in Canada ;
communications with Canadian and American cult critics ; and
the following European " violations : " a telephone interview with German TV ARD ; a TV interview with ARD ; an award ceremony in Leipzig ; two interviews with news media in Berlin ; an interview with a Christian newspaper in Denmark ; a conversation with Hamburg Government official Ursula Caberta ; participation in a conference on totalitarian cults in Nizhny Novgorod , Russia ; an appearance on Russian TV ; a request to speak to an executive at a Scientology office in Moscow ; a picket of organization headquarters in Copenhagen ; an appearance on Russian TV show TNT ; a picket of Scientology in Paris ; a picket of Scientology in Lyon ; another award ceremony in Leipzig ; and a web site created by someone in Holland .

In Germany
Because of the way Canadian officials are acting in another case , there are indications that the Canadian Government has reversed its previous opposition to Scientology and now supports the organization 's persecution of its victims and targets , as the U.S. Government has done and is doing .
Consequently , and as a precaution , I recently left Canada with my fiancée Caroline Letkeman and am in Germany .
I believe that in Europe , where Scientology is generally not considered a religion but a totalitarian psychocult , I will be free to continue to communicate about its persecution and to address the support it gets from the North American governments .
Even while here , however , I am still a target of Scientology 's persecution as the organization 's latest lawsuit shows .
According to the U.S. " judgment , " every European Scientology organization and every European Scientologist or their lawyers or agents may say whatever they want about me , no matter how defamatory , and I may not say one word in response or in my defense .
Just for saying the word " Scientology , " or the name of any European Scientologist , or mentioning one word about my now more than 33 - year relationship with the organization , I am subject to a $ 50,000 " damage " assessment , imprisonment and a fine .
As Scientology 's latest suit also shows , anyone facilitating my defense against the organization 's attacks is also subject to the U.S. " judgment , " and is also at risk of being sued , bankrupted and jailed .
Potentially , anyone giving me money , a job , an Internet connection , a telephone , a bed or even a meal or a drink of water , knowing that I will survive another day to communicate about Scientology and its persecutions , becomes Fair Game , subject to its " judgment , " and target of its U.S. - supported litigation machine . [ 5 ]
My Position
Judicially prohibiting people from responding to Scientology 's attacks , and punishing them with imprisonment and fines if they do respond , creates a new type of slavery , which Scientology , with U.S. Government support , is attempting to export around the world .
Since the U.S. Government considers the organization a religion , and confers upon it all the privileges and benefits conferred on traditional religions , including tax exemption , Scientology 's attacks on critics and its extreme measures to silence them amount to a new form of State - sanctioned religious persecution .
There is no freedom of religion where there is no freedom to criticize , oppose or reform religion .
Ironically , it is only in the U.S. , which claims to be a bastion of religious liberty , where a person can be jailed just for mentioning a " religion " or his " religious experiences " in it .
If the U.S. and its courts apply this concept equally to all religions , a person could be jailed just for saying the word " Christianity , " or " Buddhism , " or " Hinduism , " or " Islam , " or mentioning any " religious experience " in any of those religions .
If the U.S. is applying this concept only to Scientology , then that organization has by this favoritism become the American State Religion .
Salman Rushdie was sentenced by a totalitarian theocratic government 's legal edict , and is being threatened world wide , for writing a book that the theocrats do n't like .
I am attacked and hounded around the world by Scientology 's totalitarian religious poseurs , using the U.S. legal system , for writing and speaking what the poseurs dislike .
The Islamic fatwah is directed not only against Rushdie but also against all persons associated in the publication of his book .
Scientology 's fatwah targets all persons acting in concert with me or in any way facilitating my speaking and writing .
Iran is offering a $ 2,500,000 reward to the murderer who silences Rushdie .
Scientology has already paid that to U.S. lawyers to silence me .
Going the theocrats one better , however , Scientology 's commercial cultists want their investment back , quadrupled .
I am being persecuted by Scientology , with its official U.S. support , not for speaking lies or defaming the organization , but for speaking the truth .
I am speaking the truth in response to Scientology 's lies about me , lies which are demonstrated even by the organization 's latest lawsuit , which is riddled with lies .
I am speaking out to prevent Scientology from rewriting its history of lying and of persecuting people who speak the truth .
Because I am persecuted for speaking is precisely why I should speak .
Because other people are persecuted for helping me to speak is precisely why they should help .

10 . Black Adder Remastered : The Ultimate Edition
Rowan Atkinson may be best known stateside as Mr. Bean , but this brilliant series was the true launching pad for his fame .
Set in multiple time periods , each series of Black Adder takes place in a different era , ranging from medieval times to World War II .
In each , Atkison plays a variation on the Edmund Blackadder character , an often hapless individual who nonetheless remains entwined with the progression of history .
Watch out for supporting roles by Stephen Fry , and better yet , a young Hugh Laurie .
9. Fawlty Towers : The Complete Collection Remastered
John Cleese will forever be remembered for his role as a member of the Monty Python troupe , but by departing the Flying Circus early to move on to other projects , he ended up with one of the most popular British sitcoms of all time on his hands .
Fawlty Towers is nothing short of a UK institution , despite consisting of a scant 12 episodes .
As Basil Fawlty , Cleese runs one of the most mayhem - plagued hotels around , with his wife and staff splitting their time between controlling the chaos and making it worse .
8. The Steve Coogan Collection
Steve Coogan is a one - man British comedy institution , so it ’s only fitting that he receive his very own box set .
You might recognize him from his lead roles in 24 Hour Party People and Tristram Shandy , but it ’s Coogan ’s UK TV series that let his genius truly shine .
His most high - profile character , Alan Partridge , is a man of questionable morals ( and intelligence ) , but also disturbingly funny enough to feature in two separate series : Knowing Me , Knowing You and I ’m Alan Partridge .
Both are included here , along with pretty much everything else Coogan has done for British TV , collected on a whopping 13 discs .
7. Spaced : The Complete Series
If you ’ve been paying attention to comedic cinema in the last few years , there ’s no way to avoid Simon Pegg .
Shaun of the Dead brought him ( and partner - in - crime Nick Frost ) to international audiences , while the subsequent release of films like Hot Fuzz and Run Fat Boy Run has kept him in the spotlight .
It was inevitable , then , that the rest of the world would discover the turn - of - the - century series that started it all .
Spaced tells the tale of two young people , Tim and Daisy , who pretend to be a married couple in order to get an apartment .
And while the premise may sound simple , the execution is anything but .
The show ’s zany crew finds itself in increasingly bizarre situations , told via equally creative narrative devices .
If there ’s a 20th - century pop-culture touchstone close to your heart , chances are Spaced gives it more than a nod .
6 . The Office : The Complete Collection
Sure , we all love Steve Carell ( and Dwight ) , but if it was n’t for Ricky Gervais , your whole Thursday night NBC fix would have a different taste .
If you have n’t seen the original series that gave birth to the US version of The Office , you need to watch this immediately .
The setup is very much the same , and many of the characters will feel more than a little familiar , but the slightly drier tone and Gervais ’ flawless performance as regional manager David Brent give this one the edge up .
Better yet , they knew when to call it quits , meaning that the entire series run never hit a down note .
Gervais went on to star in Extras
after this , which you might also want to have on hand , for when you need just a little bit more .
5. The Mighty Boosh Special Edition DVD
This is the most recent series to make the list , as well as the only one that remains active .
Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt are two of the most surreal comedians the UK has seen in , well , ever , and along with their cohorts , they are the Mighty Boosh .
Their self - titled TV series has aired three seasons to date , and a fourth will be a while yet , so this collection features the whole caboodle so far .
Internationally , the series has had the most exposure through the viral takeoff of the Mighty Boosh short “ Old Gregg , ” while a pickup from Adult Swim has further raised its profile .
Watching too much of this at once will definitely make your head hurt , but you probably wo n’t mind .
4. The Young Ones : Extra Stoopid Edition
There ’s never been another show quite like The Young Ones .
Taking a hippie , a psychotic punk , a wussy anarchist , and a self - styled ladies man and putting them all together in the same house , the series created some of the most over - the - top insanity of all - time .
The laughs come so fast and from such unexpected quarters that repeated viewings are often essential just to figure out what the hell you just saw .
Adding random musical performances from real bands like Madness and Motörhead within the storylines , along with fourth - wall breaking monologues and a boatload of non-sequiturs , this show marks the pinnacle of the ’ 80s for UK television .
3. Absolutely Fabulous : Absolutely Everything
Being a complete mess has never been as appealing as in the capable hands of Patsy and Edina , the ultimate walking disasters with a taste for the high life .
Jennifer Saunders flipped the traditional script on its head with this immense show , playing the irresponsible parent to the down - to - earth , no -nonsense daughter .
Along with Joanna Lumley , she brought the concept of human trainwreck to a new level — perhaps enough so to make people think twice before having those last six drinks .
As you may know , Roseanne loved this show so much that she wanted to recreate it for a US audience ; thankfully , this was one time everyone ended up being smart enough to leave perfection alone .
2. Planet Earth : The Complete BBC Series
Okay , we admit it , this list skews pretty hard toward the funnier side of UK TV .
But the BBC is also known for airing some truly groundbreaking and informative material , and this is the cream of the crop in that department .
Chances are you ’ve already seen some , if not all , of this series exploring the endless wonder of the cosmic sphere we call home , but no matter how many times you see it , it never ceases to amaze .
These investigations into the myriad experiences of life on Earth are best experienced as big as possible , which makes it a no- brainer that this collection would also receive HD DVD
and Blu - Ray
releases .
Even on a small screen , though , this is huge stuff .

There ’s no way around it .
No list of this nature would be complete without Monty Python , and denying the legendary troupe the top slot would be nothing short of heresy .
Together , Eric Idle , Michael Palin , Terry Jones , Graham Chapman , John Cleese , and Terry Gilliam set the bar for sketch comedy at a level that has yet to be topped in all the years since .
There is n’t a troupe around that wo n’t pay tribute to their impact , or fail to cite them as an influence .
And before the big - screen films that truly broke them on a global - level , their TV series , Monty Python ’s Flying Circus , was subversively changing the way people would look at their television screens for generations to come .
At 16 discs , this is the true elephant of the bunch , but also the most essential of all the essentials .
* Note : Giveaways include all of the above box sets , with the exception of Steve Coogan and Monty Python .
Books are having their iPod moment this holiday season .
But buyer beware :
It could also turn out to be an eight - track moment .
While e-reading devices were once considered a hobby for early adopters , Justin Timberlake is now pitching one on prime - time TV commercials for Sony Corp .
Meanwhile , Amazon.com Inc.'s
Kindle e-reading device has become its top - selling product of any kind .
Forrester Research estimates 900,000 e-readers will sell in the U.S. in November and December .
But ...
Finally , my Santa included a very friendly and cheerful letter explaining some rationales and such .
And apparently , I have some Steampunk magazines still coming ...
This woman is out of control !
Could newly - minted turncoat Parker Griffith get teabagged to death ?
It 's looking like a real possibility .
You'd think that if the NRCC could score a party switch ( always a big deal ) , it would come with assurances that the primary field would be swept clear .
And just a few years ago , when the Republicans were in the majority and promoting conservatism was equated with supporting Bush , I have no doubt that would have happened .
( After all , no GOPers complained when Rodney Alexander changed parties . )
But today , with wingnuts demanding absurd levels of purity , it 's a different ballgame :
Madison County Commissioner Mo Brooks ( R ) said Tuesday afternoon that he wo n't be clearing out of the GOP primary in Alabama 's 5th district to make way for Rep.
Parker Griffith , who announced earlier in the day that he was switching parties and joining the Republican Conference .
Brooks also warned the Congressman that his party switching ways will not go over well with GOP primary voters , who make up the vast majority of the 48 percent of the 5th district electorate that voted against Griffith in the 2008 general election .
" That 's a tough jury to sell , particularly when you 've voted with [ Speaker ] Nancy Pelosi [ D - Calif . ] 85 percent of the time , " Brooks said .
" It 's unbelievably good fortune that Parker Griffith would jump into our pool and want to play .
...
He has just propelled us to favored candidate status . "
This just goes to show you :
You can vote against the Democrats on every single big - ticket item - the stimulus , the Obama budget , cap - and - trade , healthcare , finacial regulatory reform , and even equal pay for women - and they 'll still find something to hit you on .
In this case , Mo Brooks is smacking Griffith for his WaPo " Voting with Party " score .
Nevermind that Griffith has one of the lowest scores on the list - trying to fight from a defensive crouch is almost always a recipe for failure .
The GOP would surely have used this number against him had he stayed a Dem ; it 's nice to see he 'll still get whaled on with it as a Republican .
( And let that be a lesson to other conservadems who think they can hide behind lousy voting records . )
But do n't worry - Griffith 's new Republican buddies have plenty more ammo :
But just five years ago , Griffith donated $ 1,500 to the presidential campaign of liberal icon Howard Dean — with one donation coming when Dean ’s campaign was already faltering in February 2004 .
( Griffith also gave $ 1,000 to Sen. Harry Reid [ D - Nev. ] in December 2003 — something his conservative detractors will be sure to point out . )
Howard Dean !
LOL !
Who knew that me and Grif had so much in common ?
I was a big Dean supporter back then , too !
But I think that even I knew it was time to jump ship by February ( hell , his campaign folded in the middle of that month ) .
You can bet that if a guy pretending to be a Southern - fried conservative was at one point a Dean backer , he 's said and done a lot of other libruhl shit over the course of his career .
Like this :
A Dem source noted that while all of his back - and - forth with GOPers was going on , Griffith actually took the time to attend the 12/9 DCCC holiday party , an event that featured Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
That does n't exactly paint the picture of a man wavering in his party commitments .
You can bet that is n't the only time Grif has hobnobbed with Pelosi .
But wait - there 's more !
Plenty more .
I think Griffith 's primary opponents could run this old ad - courtesy of the NRCC , circa 2008 - without changing a single word :
I know you did n't think I was done yet .
Our compadres at the Club for Growth is happy to Scozzafava good ol ' Grif , too :
Griffith 's voting record is far from conservative , too .
Granted , he voted against the Big 4 - Obama 's first budget , the Stimulus , Cap and Trade , and ObamaCare .
However , his vote on the budget is slightly deceptive since he originally voted for 9 of the 12 spending bills that make up the budget .
And he voted against all the Stimulus amendments that would reduce its size .
But just a quick perusal of 2009 shows that he voted YES on the 2009 pork - filled Omnibus ; YES on Cash for Clunkers , NO on waiving the harmful Davis - Bacon provision , and had a pathetic 0 % score on the 2009 RePORK Card .
This party switch signals Griffith 's nervousness , but it does n't signal that his incumbency is safe .
Zing !
I think it 's very possible that it will be easier for Brooks to beat Griffith in a primary rather than a general .
The DCCC is squeezing Grif to get back their money ( something they did successfully with Rodney Alexander ) , so that 'll hurt him on the financial front .
What 's more , he 's got a bit of a " damned - if - he - do , damned - if - he - don't " situation on his hands :
If the NRCC decides to openly support Griffith , it would almost certainly provide major fodder to the teabaggers - Charlie Crist 2.0 .
On the flipside , if they do n't back him ( very possible , since they have to care more about blue seats than red ones ) , well , then , he loses out on major institutional backing .
Not a good problem to have .
It 's important to remember that to remain a member in good standing of the conservative movement , it is n't enough just to vote a certain way .
You have to evidence a very particular tribal belonging - you need to hate the right people , be ignorant of the right facts , be fearful of the right bogeymen , and be arrogant about the whole enterprise .
If you somehow fail this tribal litmus test , it does n't matter how right - wing you are - that 's how , for example , a wildly conservative guy like former Rep.
Chris Cannon could lose a primary to another wildly conservative maniac .
And Parker Griffith is no Chris Cannon .
Good luck , li'l buddy .
As a developer , I often wonder which Android platforms my applications should support , especially as the number of Android - powered devices grows .
Should my application only focus on the latest version of the platform or should it support older ones as well ?
To help with this kind of decision , I am excited to announce the new device dashboard .
It provides information about deployed Android - powered devices that is helpful to developers as they build and update their apps .
The dashboard provides the relative distribution of Android platform versions on devices running Android Market .
Android Platform Percentage of Devices 1.1 0.3 % 1.5 27.7 % 1.6 54.2 % 2.0 2.9 % 2.0.1 14.8 %
The above graph shows the relative number of Android devices that have accessed Android Market during the first 14 days of December 2009 .
From a developer 's perspective , there are a number of interesting points on this graph :
At this point , there 's little incentive to make sure a new application is backward compatible with Android 1.0 and Android 1.1 .
Close to 30 % of the devices are running Android 1.5 .
To take advantage of this significant install base , you may consider support for Android 1.5 .
Starting with Android 1.6 , devices can have different screen densities & sizes .
There are several devices out there that fall in this category , so make sure to adapt your application to support different screen sizes and take advantage of devices with small , low density ( e.g QVGA ) and normal , high density ( e.g. WVGA ) screens .
Note that Android Market will not list your application on small screen devices unless its manifest explicitly indicates support for " small " screen sizes .
Make sure you properly configure the emulator and test your application on different screen sizes before uploading to Market .
A new SDK for Android 2.0.1 was released two weeks ago .
All Android 2.0 devices will be updated to 2.0.1 before the end of the year , so if your application uses features specific to Android 2.0 , you are encouraged to update it to take advantage of the latest Android 2.0.1 API instead .
In summary , Android 1.5 , 1.6 , and 2.0.1 are the 3 versions of the platform that are deployed in volume .
Our goal is to provide you with the tools and information to make it easy for you to target specific versions of the platform or all the versions that are deployed in volume .
We plan to update the dashboard regularly to reflect deployment of new Android platforms .
We also plan to expand the dashboard to include other information like devices per screen size and so on .
Capitol Hill , this might be our happiest holiday travel season … ever .
By way of fellow community news site B - Town Blog covering lovely Burien , CHS has learned that we ’ll all get a great present from Uncle Google this year — free wireless Internet at Sea - Tac :
When you ’re traveling this holiday season , you can enjoy free WiFi at 47 participating airports and on every Virgin America flight .
Just bring a WiFi - enabled laptop or mobile device and stay connected to family and friends for free while you travel now through January 15 , 2010 .
We also talked to Bruce Gray of Sound Transit about the start of light rail airport service which is scheduled to happen ‘ late in 2009 ’ according to the airport link project page .
Gray says the announcement on the start of service will come later this week and said the trains will be continuing through to the Sea - Tac stop “ in time for the holidays . ”
“ Which holidays ? ” CHS asked .
Just wanted to be sure .
Gray said we ’ll find out this week .
The Nintendo Wii is a money - making console for Nintendo – no one can deny that .
However , publishers after noticing how the Wii was the fastest selling console in the market decided they wanted to cash - in .
The results have been less than stellar .
Yes , there have been a lot of party - games made for the console as quick cash - ins , but there have also been good third - party games that have failed to deliver the goods .
Now companies like Ubisoft and Electronic Arts ( EA ) , who are big supporters of the Nintendo Wii , are pulling out and focusing their efforts on the Xbox 360 and PS3 .
The Nintendo Wii has recently seen a sales slow - down keep in mind though that everyone and their grandmother – quite literally – own a Wii .
So sales are bound to slow down .
Although , this does n’t mean that Nintendo is n’t doing well .
EA recently announced , that in order to save money , they will have to lay off 1,500 employees and will close Pandemic Studios .
John Riccitiello , Electronic Arts ’ CEO , has publicly expressed his frustration with Nintendo , because of their lack of spurring interest in the console .
“ To be honest with you , I think the Wii platform has been a little weaker than we had certainly anticipated .
And there is no lack of frustration to be doing that at precisely the time where we have the strongest third - party share , ” John Riccitiello , Electronic Arts ’ CEO
Ubisoft also announced that it ’s games sales are low , however , it ’s big titles such as the recently released Assassin ’s Creed II are doing great .
What seems to be the issue ?
The Nintendo Wii .
As Kotaku reported : [ Ubisoft ]
Reporting its full first - half 2009 - 10 financial results today , Ubisoft stresses its confidence in franchise titles like Assassin ’s Creed II , while its Wii titles continue to under - perform .
Nintendo should consider their strategy carefully , they may be getting tons of revenue out of selling the Wii , however , as Nintendo and other hardware / software developers know , the big money comes from selling software and Nintendo is doing a horrible job at that .
They may boast that their games are for everyone , but when companies like EA and Ubisoft start seeing their game sales go down – and in this economy – you can expect less support of them in the future .
For example , Ubisoft has already announced ten new games that will take advantage of the Xbox 360 Natal controls and five new games that will take advantage of the PS3 motion controller .
That ’s 15 new games – none of them – coming to the Nintendo Wii .
Nintendo had a good thing in their hands with the Nintendo Wii .
They wanted to change the way we play , and they did .
They did it so well in fact , that other companies want a piece of the action and they will get it .
In ways that Nintendo wo n’t be able to match with it ’s current console .
It ’s time for Nintendo to listen to their consumers , both new and old – even those who they alienated – and bring the Nintendo Wii up to current console standards such as : HD , real online gameplay , voice - chat and better games .
They also have to start marketing more “ obscure titles ” better .
Advertising for “ games ” such as Wii Fit and Wii Sports Resort should be as much as advertising for Dead Space : Extraction and The Conduit .
As I said earlier , they need to bring the Wii up to standards with other consoles , so they can alsobring back those “ hardcore ” gamers that they have lost .
Not only that , but shift – even if it ’s slightly – their focus to keep working on franchises such as Zelda , Mario , Metroid and Star Fox .
Yes , it has been announced that there ’s a new Zelda game in development and a new Mario Galaxy will be released next year .
This was after all , gamers complaining that there was nothing for them on E3 2008 .
Even with these franchises , which wo n’t be able to be released every year without them being rushed and sloppy , Nintendo needs to focus on creating new franchises to give both new , old and future gamers more reason to keep / buy the Nintendo Wii .

The American media 's bad science is making us sick .
The results ?
Frightened and ill - informed parents who do n't vaccinate their children .
Self - righteous blowhards who demand their religion be taught in my kids ' science classes as a scientific theory .
Politicians who deny the overwhelming evidence that human beings are causing global warming .
Of course , when you come right down to it , everyone is responsible for her own actions .
But when we depend on the media for guidance in making those decisions , we are depending on a deeply flawed presentation of the facts .
Well , reporters , what do you have to say for yourselves ?
Why do you allow unscientific people to spout their harebrained schemes side by side with genuine doctors and scientists who follow the scientific method ?
Is it in the name of balance ?
When was it written into journalistic theory that each story has two equally legitimate sides ?
When did fact - checking become too odious ?
There are some givens in science :
The theory of evolution .
The origin of global warming .
The lack of any connection between autism and vaccines , despite exhaustive studies searching for one .

A gift of $ 17 makes a difference .
Perhaps you can find one person with an M.D. or Ph.D. after his name who will say otherwise .
But this does not mean he or she belongs in your stories , especially when this supposed expert has no credibility in the scientific community .
You are spreading misinformation , and this misinformation kills .
Do I sound melodramatic ?
It 's a fact : Measles outbreaks have become a problem in communities with low vaccination rates , and measles , mumps and rubella infections have killed people .
Recently .
Like , this year .
I do not know how many children have been killed or damaged by parents and doctors attempting to chelate them for nonexistent mercury poisoning , or subject them to pressurized oxygen chambers due to unscientific claptrap .
My child has Asperger 's and Tourette's .
I understand the panic parents feel when a child reacts to the world in frightening and unpredictable ways .
I understand the instinct to go with emotional reactions rather than scientific evidence .
But let me tell you something : I do not appreciate these parents risking my children 's lives so that they can indulge their superstitions .
Vaccinating a kid is not just about that individual child .
It 's about herd immunity .
Because people all react differently to vaccines , my fully vaccinated kids could still come down with polio if someone else 's unvaccinated children exposed them to it .
Babies who have not completed their vaccinations are particularly at risk of dying from measles and mumps .
Just to be clear : A parent 's decision to take healthy skepticism and twist it into some bizarre inability to comprehend basic scientific principles , or to trust the preponderance of scientific evidence , could very well kill the neighbors ' baby .
All because some parents think vaccinations will make their kid turn out like mine .
( For the record : They wo n't .
And also , my kid is awesome -- you should be so lucky . )
Perhaps parents would n't be so easily misled if more reporters actually did some hard - nosed reporting on this and other scientific topics .
But what I mainly see and hear are vapid point / counterpoints in which the real scientist becomes more and more frustrated with the evangelist , or the writer uncritically reports a totally unsubstantiated claim made by a celebrity like Jenny McCarthy -- who got her " doctorate from Google " ( her words , not mine ) -- with no follow - up or refutation .
We need fewer debates about whether humans have caused global warming and more vigorous work on stopping it before we destroy the planet -- if it is n't too late .
We need genuine research into possible environmental triggers for autism that is not muddied by bad science and hysteria .
And for our intellectual and physical health , not to mention that of our planet , we need kids to learn science in school and religion in their homes and places of worship .
If I can't have what I really want -- a solid and respectable education in the sciences for every person in America -- can I at least get the journalistic profession to do its job ?
Anybody ?
Anybody willing to just do your job ?

Caroline Radtke , of San Antonio , Texas , scrapped her Trooper for a Jetta .
Traded : 2000 Isuzu Trooper ( 15 mpg )
Bought : 2009 Jetta Sportwagen TDI ( 40 mpg )
With two children , big grocery purchases and a drive to save the planet , we 'd been considering getting a new car even before the Cash for Clunkers program .
The Trooper was a good car , but I felt bad about the environment every time I filled that guzzler .
And I wanted something safer for my kids .
Some people think we 're trying to be big ol ' cowboys with a diesel vehicle , but the Sportwagen fit our needs perfectly .
We had to educate ourselves about it , but diesel is so much cleaner now .
It 's a great little car for only about $ 26,500 after the trade - in .
Diesel may not be the best choice for someone with a lead foot , but it works for my family -- without us sacrificing gas mileage or paying a nutty premium for a hybrid .
And it 's cute !
I like a car with some sass .

A Green Party politician has declared that part of being Swedish is the opportunity to swing both ways during the course of a single day in the interests of free speech .
Sofia Bothorp delivered that could well be the Swedish tourist board 's new slogan during a local council debate on Swedishness .
According to The Local , Bothorp declared that part of being Swedish is being able to “ lick pussy in the morning and suck cock in the evening if you want to ” .
While this may appear to be a rather narrowly fixed definition of Swedishness , Bothorp was in fact referring to the country 's proud tradition of freedom of expression .
Then to further illustrate her point she said this meant she was able to make jokes about God and / or Allah .
The remarks , inevitably were videoed and found their way onto YouTube .
Which is ironic as the site does not look kindly on showing pussy licking or cock sucking - once it 's been made aware of either .
Bothorp was forced into immediate explanation mode , saying that she was seeking to show that , contrary to the views of the country 's far right , Sweden is not a culturally homogeneous nation , and needed to uphold its traditions of free speech and tolerance .
" I said it in the heat of the moment and it just slipped out , but I think it 's important that the point I was trying to make does n't get lost , " Bothorp told The Local .
Well , most of it should n't get lost , and we 're sure that many non-Swedes will be beating a path to the country to help its citizens fully express themselves . ®
LANSING , Mich . -
With one of the highest incarceration rates in the country and a budget that reflects it , Michigan state lawmakers are considering a plan that would allow prisoners to get credits for good behavior and have their sentences reduced by as much as 15 percent .
The move would end Michigan 's decade - old truth - in - sentencing law , which mandates that inmates must serve 100 percent of their minimum sentences .
The Department of Corrections says it could save the state 100 million dollars .
Victims ' rights advocates strongly oppose the plan , but Penny Ryder , co-director of American Friends Service Committee , says that with proper rehabilitation programs , the risk of re-offending is greatly reduced .
" Considering the fact that we are releasing more people from prison and we have so many people out of work , we kind of would have suspected that our crime rate would have kind of escalated a lot , and that has not happened .
So , this truth - in - sentencing is really a waste of money . "
Michigan 's incarceration rate has been the fifth - highest in the country , but during the first half of this year , 3000 more prisoners were released than in the comparable period a year earlier .
Many lawmakers want to save money with the proposed good behavior plan but , they say , not at the cost of violating victims ' rights .
Michigan is one of just a few states that do not allow credits for good behavior .
Ryder says such credits are not only a way to save money , but also make the prisoners safer .
" Statistically , it shows that when prisoners are given an incentive to behave , to do the programming they need and to put their 100 percent into that , they do much better .
Number two , the insides of the prisons are much safer . "
Ryder says that , despite popular belief , violent offenders are not likely to re-offend .
She says those convicted of property and drug crimes are most likely to return to prison .
There are political considerations for the Nutter administration to weigh as well .
City Council - which has been on track to approve the legislation dismantling the BRT - rose as one last week in defense of the patronage workers , with some members suggesting they would vote against the bill if Nutter did not protect the School District employees on the board .
Close to the heart of Brisbane City , the Brisbane Quaker Arboretum in Hampson Street , Kelvin Grove is a surprising .5 ha of rainforest , rare and endangered species in the heart of surrounding urban blocks of lawn and shrubs .
The backbone of this hidden inner-city landscape are the 100 grand 80 - year - old hoop pines emerging from the native woodland that surrounds the purpose - build 45 - year - old Quaker Meeting House .
This year , the Brisbane Quaker Arboretum will be open to the public on the weekend of 21 - 22 November as part of the Open Gardens Scheme .
Careful husbandry of existing native forest plus close to two decades of dedicated bush regeneration and revegetation has developed the Arboretum as a haven for native flora and fauna that might otherwise be unknown in Brisbane 's dense inner city development .
The first step for the Quaker volunteers who began work on the Arboretum in the early 1990s was to remove weed species .
Gradually , they removed camphor laurels and Chinese elms , ochna , Madeira vine and cat ’s claw and replanted with a number of rare and endangered species that can be viewed via walking paths .
The paths are supported by dry walling painstakingly brought in by wheelbarrow .
The fragrant Backhousia citriodora is a living memorial to the work of 19th century Quaker naturalist James Backhouse , who recorded and sketched native species as he travelled through eastern and southern Australia preparing a report to the British government on the treatment of convicts and the Indigenous peoples .
Visitors during the Open Gardens weekend may take hourly guided forest tours , or undertake self - guided walks at any time .
Brochures are available for specialist plants and Indigenous uses .
Other activities on site include a self - directed kids ’ forest treasure hunt , solar power demonstrations and talks , stalls run by the Society for Growing Australian plants , sustainability and solar power information , and a Quaker book and plant stall .
Food includes morning and afternoon teas and lunch including lemon and anise myrtle bush teas , or lemon myrtle rice pudding .
The Open Gardens weekend will also see the launch of the Meeting House ’s solar grid , a 3KW system to supply about 60 per cent of the overall use for the two buildings on site .
Brisbane Meeting House is the third Meeting House in Australia to ‘ go solar ’ , part of a Quaker commitment to walk lightly on the Earth .
Quakers share a way of life , not a set of beliefs .
The first Quaker , George Fox ( 1624-1691 ) preached in the open air in English towns and countryside .
Fox believed there was no need for ‘ steeple houses ’ or paid clergy , as each person could find ‘ that of God within ’ wherever they may be .
Quakers seek to live lives of simplicity , peace , integrity , community and equity .
In 2008 , Australian Quakers agreed on an Earthcare statement that concludes : ‘ We commit to the demanding , costly implications of radically changed ways of living .
Let us do so out of joy , celebration , reverence and a deep love of life ’ .
There is no need to book for the Open Gardens weekend , simply turn up at 10 Hampson Street , Kelvin Grove between 10 am and 4.30 pm .

PARIS —
It seemed like a good idea at the time , one for the annals of great publicity gimmicks .
An ambitious Internet marketing company would sponsor a double - decker London bus to drive around central Paris , throwing cash from the windows in a promotional stunt .
But it did n’t quite work out as planned .
Minutes before the event was to have started late Saturday morning , the police decided they did not like the look of the hard - jostling crowd of around 7,000 people that had formed near the Eiffel Tower in search of instant riches , and they ordered the event stopped before even a single centime had been handed out .
Some in the crowd then ran amok .
In the ensuing mayhem , about a dozen people were arrested , store windows were broken , a car was overturned and at least one man was beaten by thugs .
The riot police were called in to restore order .
Instead of the middle - class Parisians the organizers had hoped for , witnesses said the crowd , overwhelmingly young , male and poor , appeared to be made up mostly of residents of the tough suburbs that ring the French capital , as well as poor students and homeless men .
The baby is laughing .
And now he is not .
He ’s seated in a high chair , dressed in a white suit and a large blue bib .
His father is in the kitchen with him .
In a high - pitched voice , Dad says , “ Bing ! ” The baby laughs hysterically .
Dad waits a few beats , until the baby is calm , and then , in a low voice , he says , “ Dong . ”
This catches the baby by surprise .
He laughs even harder .
Dad hits him one more time with the high voice : “ Bing ! ”
The baby sputters , he wheezes , he ca n’t take it .
He is helpless with laughter .
And we love him for it .
The clip , titled “ Hahaha , ” is one of the most watched YouTube videos ever , with close to 100 million views since it went up , in 2006 .
It ’s a classic of the form , so perfectly representative of the YouTube aesthetic that Google executives showed it to Queen Elizabeth during her visit to the company ’s central - London headquarters .
“ Lovely little thing , is n’t it ? , ” Her Majesty said .
Lovely , indeed .
But it ’s also true that the “ Hahaha ” video is part of a broader cultural movement defined by a special fascination with all things cute — a movement that has sprung to life against a backdrop of war , economic breakdown , and more Wi-Fi .
Cootchie - coo behavior used to be reserved for private moments in the home .
But now , with the Internet ’s help , people feel free to wallow in cuteness en masse , in the company of strangers .
The serious political blog Daily Kos , for instance , is awash in cute pictures of kittens and panda bears .
The Web site Cute Overload , which gets 100,000 visits a day , is all photographs and videos of puppies ( “ puppehs ” in the site ’s own particular argot ) , kittens ( “ kittehs ” ) , and baby rabbits ( “ bun- buns ” ) , who are said to go nom - nom - nom as they munch their little meals .
“ It ’s part of our DNA to react to cute things , ” says Meg Frost , who founded Cute Overload in 2005 .
“ What makes me post certain pictures is if I have an audible reaction — a squeal — when I see the picture .
I ’m kind of annoyed at myself for having no control over thinking these things are so cute .
It ’s like ‘ Oh , why do n’t you just kill us with your fur ? ’ ”
The popularity of Cute Overload ( and the more than 150 other cute - animal sites catalogued by the recommendation engine StumbleUpon , including Stuff on My Cat , Cute Things Falling Asleep , Kittenwar , and I Can Has Cheezburger ) reflects a growing self - infantilization that is also in evidence at the social - networking site Facebook , where countless subscribers have posted photos of themselves as babies on their profile .
Vice , a hipster publication and Web site based in Brooklyn , has also gotten in on the cute act , with a Web channel called The Cute Show .
With an un-ironic focus on cute animals , The Cute Show would not seem to belong in the company of other Vice programming , such as Inside Afghanistan and The Vice Guide to Sex .
It ’s not just a digital thing .
In this cuteness - crazed environment , Time Warner ’s People magazine decided it was good business to shell out an estimated $ 6 million for photos of Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony ’s newborn twins .
At the same time , Britney Spears , Angelina Jolie , Madonna , Katie Holmes , Gwyneth Paltrow , and Gwen Stefani have kept the supermarket tabloids afloat through the power of their spawn .
And it ’s no accident that the biggest tabloid saga of the year concerns Jon and Kate Gosselin , who rode to fame on the backs of their eight little cuties .
If you have root access to a linux server and you do n’t have the root mysql password , but need it , then you can easily reset the root mysql password in just a few commands .
These commands probably differ depending on what linux distro you use .
I was using Ubuntu 9.04 ( Jaunty Jackalope ) when I wrote this .
Firstly you will want to turn the mysql service off .
codytaylor@server :~$ sudo
/etc/init.d/ mysql stop * Stopping MySQL database server mysqld
codytaylor@server :~$ sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking &
codytaylor@server :~$ mysql -u root mysql mysql > UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD(' password ')
WHERE User='root ' ; mysql > FLUSH PRIVILEGES ;
codytaylor@server :~$ sudo /etc/ init.d/ mysql restart
Now we restart the mysql server with the ‘ skip - grant - tables ’ option which basically allows anyone to do whatever they like .
It ’s usually preferable to include the ‘ skip - networking ’ option so that only localhost ( you ) have access to the naked database .

Delegates rest on Saturday after a 24 - hour period of plenary sessions at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen .
( ( Heribert Proepper / Associated Press ) )
The UN climate conference in Copenhagen formally closed Saturday after two weeks of divisive negotiations , which produced an agreement that seeks to cut greenhouse - gas emissions while giving participating countries more time to work out the details .
The three - page document , referring to a " strong political will " to fight climate change , was struck in the final hours of the summit Friday night after talks between U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao .
The agreement recognizes that an increase in global temperature should be kept to two degrees Celsius — the threshold that UN scientists say is needed to avert serious climate change — but the deal is not legally binding and has no long - term global targets for emissions cuts .
The Copenhagen Accord , put forward by a U.S. - led group of five nations — including China , India , Brazil and South Africa — also promises to deliver $ 30 billion US in aid over the next three years to help developing nations reduce emissions .
Industrialized countries could channel $ 100 billion US a year to poorer nations by 2020 , but the money is contingent upon them submitting to UN monitoring .
The agreement includes a method for verifying each nation 's reductions of heat - trapping gases — a key demand by Washington , because China has resisted international efforts to monitor its actions .
It requires industrial countries to list their individual targets and developing countries to list what actions they will take to cut global warming pollution by specific amounts .
Obama called that an " unprecedented breakthrough . "
Prime Minister Stephen Harper called the agreement " realistic " and said Canada was " very comfortable " with it .
" It is an excellent accord and is good for the environment , and it is good for Canada , " Environment Minister Jim Prentice told CBC News on Saturday .
" In terms of Canada , this agreement really achieves all of the negotiating objectives we set going over to Copenhagen . "
Obama left Copenhagen before the final text was issued .
Soon after he boarded a plane for the U.S. , environmental groups denounced the failure of wealthy countries to announce their final 2020 targets for cutting emissions .
Several countries , including Bolivia , Cuba , Nicaragua , Venezuela and Sudan , called the document unacceptable and said it had not been reached through a proper process .
UN chief calls agreement an 'essential beginning '
Although the agreement was not formally approved , the conference president said that delegates at a late - night plenary session — which extended the 12 - day summit past its scheduled ending by four hours — agreed to " take note " of the document , or recognize that it exists .
Ban Ki-moon , the secretary general of the United Nations , welcomed the climate deal as an " essential beginning , " but said it must be transformed into a legally binding treaty next year .
Kim Carstensen , director of the World Wildlife Fund 's global climate initiative , said the deal has a number of shortcomings .
" I would have liked to see a clarity that we 're moving toward a legally binding outcome .
I would have liked to see a mandate and a timeline for when we 're going to get it , " he said .
" How do we help the poorest countries adapt to climate change ?
We did n't get the details . "
Kumi Naidoo , international executive director of Greenpeace , said world leaders have shown they 're not taking the threat of global warming seriously .
" What we have here is not a fair , not a binding and not an ambitious outcome , " he said .
" For two years , since Bali , we have been working to actually urge our leaders to agree on the kind of set of agreements that will prevent catastrophic climate change .
And sadly our leaders have not acted with the urgency that the situation calls for . "
LONDON - Nov 30 ( Reuters ) -
There is clear evidence that climate change is contributing towards rising natural catastrophe losses and ambitious climate protection targets are needed to tackle the increase , according to Munich Re .
The world 's biggest reinsurer MUVGn .
DE said its NatCatSERVICE database , a global record for natural catastrophes , shows the average number of major weather - related catastrophes such as windstorms , floods or droughts is now three times as high as at the beginning of the 1980s .
Losses have increased by 11 percent per year since 1980 , and overall losses due to weather - related events total $ 1.6 trillion in original values , with insured losses amounting to approximately $ 465 billion , it said in a statement last week on Thursday .
In the period from 2000 - 2008 , overall losses totalled over $ 750 billion , whilst insured losses came to around $ 280 billion due to the impact of climate change .
Munich
Re said to what extent the increased losses are due to climate change is not yet clear .
But preliminary analyses suggest that it accounts for a low single - digit percentage of annual overall losses .
“ Our statistics clearly show that the loss burden from weather - related natural catastrophes is increasing .
A year like 2009 , with relatively low losses to date , in no way contradicts this ” , said Torsten Jeworrek , member of Munich Re ’s Board of Management responsible for reinsurance business .
“ Something must be done .
Even if an all - embracing agreement does not seem feasible in Copenhagen , at the very least fundamental framework conditions should be established .
We cannot afford a delay at the expense of future generations . ”
The reinsurer called for significant progress to be made at the Copenhagen climate summit to lay the cornerstones of a strict climate agreement .
Peter Höppe , Head of Munich Re ’s Geo Risks Research , said a binding commitment in Copenhagen will have to be defined to limit global warming to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels .
" This can be done only if global carbon emissions are cut to 50 percent of 1990 levels by 2050 , " he said .
" That means the industrial countries will have to achieve 80 percent , and that globally there will have to be a real fall in emissions within the next few years .

Trevor Davies , University of East Anglia pro-vice chancellor with responsibiltiy for research and enterprise , recently condemned the use of “ stolen ” emails on behalf of the University of East Anglia e.g. here .
In email 0925823304.txt on May 4 , 1999 , Trevor Davies wrote to Phil Jones , Keith Briffa , Mike Hulme , Jean Palutikoff and Mick Kelly ( who are referred to as the “ CRU5 ” in the email ) saying that he is in posession of a “ leaked document ” regarding funding from the research council , which he needs to keep secret to avoid “ compromising the source ” .
On this earlier occasion , Davies did n’t appear to have any pangs of conscience about using leaked documents nor to have reported the source of the leaked document to local police .
Davies :
I now have a leaked document which spells out some of the research councils ’ thinking .
I will get a copy over to CRU today .
Please keep this document within the CRU5 , since it may compromise the source .
NERC and EPSRC are signed up .
ESRC are not yet .
Given the EPSRC stake , it will certainly be be useful to get RAL etc involved .
The funding might be 2 million per year .
That might imply that the Councils favour multi-site , clusters , etc , but they stress they have no preconceptions .
The full letter is here .

By Andrew Newburg | Yawn .
Go ahead : Laugh if you want ( though you ’ll benefit your brain more if you smile ) , but in my professional opinion , yawning is one of the best - kept secrets in neuroscience .
Even my colleagues who are researching meditation , relaxation , and stress reduction at other universities have overlooked this powerful neural - enhancing tool .
However , yawning has been used for many decades in voice therapy as an effective means for reducing performance anxiety and hypertension in the throat .
Several recent brain - scan studies have shown that yawning evokes a unique neural activity in the areas of the brain that are directly involved in generating social awareness and creating feelings of empathy .
One of those areas is the precuneus , a tiny structure hidden within the folds of the parietal lobe .
According to researchers at the Institute of Neurology in London , the precuneus appears to play a central role in consciousness , self - reflection , and memory retrieval .
The precuneus is also stimulated by yogic breathing , which helps explain why different forms of meditation contribute to an increased sense of self - awareness .
It is also one of the areas hardest hit by age - related diseases and attention deficit problems , so it ’s possible that deliberate yawning may actually strengthen this important part of the brain .
For these reasons I believe that yawning should be integrated into exercise and stress reduction programs , cognitive and memory enhancement training , psychotherapy , and contemplative spiritual practice .
And , because the precuneus has recently been associated with the mirror - neuron system in the brain ( which allows us to resonate to the feelings and behaviors of others ) , yawning may even help us to enhance social awareness , compassion , and effective communication with others .
Why am I so insistent ?
Because if I were to ask you to put this magazine down right now and yawn 10 times to experience this fabulous technique , you probably wo n’t do it .
Even at seminars , after presenting the overwhelmingly positive evidence , when I ask people to yawn , half of the audience will hesitate .
I have to coax them so they can feel the immediate relaxing effects .
There ’s an unexplained stigma in our society implying that it ’s rude to yawn , and most of us were taught this when we were young .
As a young medical student , I was once “ caught ” yawning and actually scolded by my professor .
He said that it was inappropriate to appear tired in front of patients , even though I was actually standing in a hallway outside of the patient ’s room .
Indeed , yawning does increase when you ’re tired , and it may be the brain ’s way of gently telling you that a little rejuvenating sleep is needed .
On the other hand , exposure to light will also make you yawn , suggesting that it is part of the process of waking up .
But yawning does n’t just relax you — it quickly brings you into a heightened state of cognitive awareness .
Students yawn in class , not because the teacher is boring ( although that will make you yawn as well , as you try to stay focused on the monotonous speech ) , but because it rids the brain of sleepiness , thus helping you stay focused on important concepts and ideas .
It regulates consciousness and our sense of self , and helps us become more introspective and self - aware .
Of course , if you happen to find yourself trapped in a room with a dull , boring , monotonous teacher , yawning will help keep you awake .
Yawning will relax you and bring you into a state of alertness faster than any other meditation technique I know of , and because it is neurologically contagious , it ’s particularly easy to teach in a group setting .
One of my former students used yawning to bring her argumentative board of directors back to order in less than 60 seconds .
Why ?
Because it helps people synchronize their behavior with others .
Yawning , as a mechanism for alertness , begins within the first 20 weeks after conception .
It helps regulate the circadian rhythms of newborns , and this adds to the evidence that yawning is involved in the regulation of wakefulness and sleep .
Since circadian rhythms become asynchronous when a person ’s normal sleep cycle is disturbed , yawning should help the late - night partygoer reset the brain ’s internal clock .
Yawning may also ward off the effects of jet lag and ease the discomfort caused by high altitudes .
So what is the underlying mechanism that makes yawning such an essential tool ?
Besides activating the precuneus , it regulates the temperature and metabolism of your brain .
It takes a lot of neural energy to stay consciously alert , and as you work your way up the evolutionary ladder , brains become less energy efficient .
Yawning probably evolved as a way to cool down the overly active mammalian brain , especially in the areas of the frontal lobe .
Some have even argued that it is a primitive form of empathy .
Most vertebrates yawn , but it is only contagious among humans , great apes , macaque monkeys , and chimpanzees .
In fact , it ’s so contagious for humans that even reading about it will cause a person to yawn .
Dogs yawn before attacking , Olympic athletes yawn before performing , and fish yawn before they change activities .
Evidence even exists that yawning helps individuals on military assignment perform their tasks with greater accuracy and ease .
Indeed , yawning may be one of the most important mechanisms for regulating the survival - related behaviors in mammals .
So if you want to maintain an optimally healthy brain , it is essential that you yawn .
It is true that excessive yawning can be a sign that an underlying neurological disorder ( such as migraine , multiple sclerosis , stroke , or drug reaction ) is occurring .
However , I and other researchers suspect that yawning may be the brain ’s attempt to eliminate symptoms by readjusting neural functioning .
Numerous neurochemicals are involved in the yawning experience , including dopamine , which activates oxytocin production in your hypothalamus and hippocampus , areas essential for memory recall , voluntary control , and temperature regulation .
These neurotransmitters regulate pleasure , sensuality , and relationship bonding between individuals , so if you want to enhance your intimacy and stay together , then yawn together .
Other neurochemicals and molecules involved with yawning include acetylcholine , nitric oxide , glutamate , GABA , serotonin , ACTH , MSH , sexual hormones , and opium derivate peptides .
In fact , it ’s hard to find another activity that positively influences so many functions of the brain .
My advice is simple .
Yawn as many times a day as possible : when you wake up , when you ’re confronting a difficult problem at work , when you prepare to go to sleep , and whenever you feel anger , anxiety , or stress .
Yawn before giving an important talk , yawn before you take a test , and yawn while you meditate or pray because it will intensify your spiritual experience .
Conscious yawning takes a little practice and discipline to get over the unconscious social inhibitions , but people often come up with three other excuses not to yawn : “ I do n’t feel like it , ” “ I ’m not tired , ” and my favorite , “ I can ’t . ”
Of course you can .
All you have to do to trigger a deep yawn is to fake it six or seven times .
Try it right now , and you should discover by the fifth false yawn , a real one will begin to emerge .
But do n’t stop there , because by the tenth or twelfth yawn , you ’ll feel the power of this seductive little trick .
Your eyes may start watering and your nose may begin to run , but you ’ll also feel utterly present , incredibly relaxed , and highly alert .
Not bad for something that takes less than a minute to do .
And if you find that you ca n’t stop yawning — I ’ve seen some people yawn for thirty minutes — you ’ll know that you ’ve been depriving yourself of an important neurological treat .

Among Senate candidates currently serving in the House , four Democrats voted for the bill , while one voted against it .
Rep. Michael Capuano ( D - Mass . ) voted for the bill last weekend but now says he would oppose a bill with the Stupak language .
Among the other supporters , Reps. Paul Hodes ( D - N.H. ) and Kendrick Meek ( D - Fla . ) are both running in swing states , while Rep. Joe Sestak ( D - Pa. ) is challenging Sen.
Arlen Specter ( D - Pa. ) from the left .
All three proudly cast their votes on the bill , and all three were met with criticism from the GOP opponents .
The lone dissenter , [ reactionary Blue Dog ] Rep. Charlie Melancon ( D - La. ) , is running against Republican Sen. David Vitter in deep red Louisiana .
Melancon was highly critical of the bill , saying : “ I ca n’t support a government - run insurance option that the people of Louisiana do n't want . ”
... Among House candidates , some running in swing or conservative districts have expressed support for the bill , including physicians Ami Bera and Manan Trivedi , who are running against Rep. Dan Lungren ( R - Calif . ) and for the seat of Rep. Jim Gerlach ( R - Pa. ) , respectively .
“ It ’s a good first step that ’s starting to move the conversation forward , ” Bera told The Hill .
“ There ’s still obviously a lot that needs to be worked through . ”
Trivedi said the bill was a “ strong step in the right direction , ” but that system - wide clinical reform is needed .
Conversely , candidates like Palm Springs , Calif. , Mayor Steve Pougnet are hedging their bets and waiting to see what bill comes out of the Senate and conference committee .
Pougnet is challenging Rep. Mary Bono Mack ( R - Calif . ) .
“ Mayor Pougnet is committed to reform and , although he believes there are many more questions to be answered , he wants to ensure the process advances and looks forward to seeing what develops in the Senate , ” said spokesman Jordan Marks .

Blake seems like a decent enough writer atbut sometimes ...
I just get the idea those headlines come right from the RNC communications department .
Like yesterday's : Few Dems In Big Races Jump Headlong Into Backing Health Bill .
Unless he meant " Few Blue Dogs , " he sure has that wrong , wrong , wrong .
The suicidal Blue Dogs and fellow travelers ( like Artur Davis , the cowardly conservative making a hopeless run for the Alabama governor 's mansion ) are hell bent on following the Creigh Deeds campaign strategy of turning off the Democratic base and hoping Republicans will forget they 're Republicans who vote for other Republicans when they get to the ballot box .
It did n't work for Deeds -- in fact it did n't work for him spectacularly , as his dumbass remark about opting out of the public option kept Democrats home on Election Day while an Obama 6 point margin over McCain turned into an 18 point deficit for the hapless conservative quasi-Dem .
But Democrats from that ( home ) school -- like John Barrow ( Blue Dog - GA ) , Parker Griffith ( Blue Dog - AL ) , Larry Kissell ( D - NC ) , Travis Childers ( Blue Dog - MS ) , Mike Ross ( Blue Dog - AR ) , Suzanne Kosmas ( D - FL ) , and Charlie Melancon ( Blue Dog - LA ) seem determined to ride that strategy to political oblivion .
They wo n't be missed -- not even by John Boehner , who has come to count on their perfidy for his own ends .
Blake starts his story by admitting that the only reticence respectable , non-Blue Dog candidates have is the hideous billing - killing anti-Choice amendment that Bart Stupak worked with the U.S. Conference of Roman Catholic Bishops to put into the bill .
Within minutes of the House passing the bill , Senate candidates like Jennifer Brunner and Lee Fischer in Ohio , Mike Capuano and Martha Coakley in Massachusetts , and Kirsten Gillibrand and Jonathan Tasini in New York were on the warpath against it , though all three pairs are major supporters of meaningful health care reform .
Blake points to Senate candidates , Robin Carnahan in Missouri , flirting with the Creigh Deeds strategy , and two conservative non-starters in Texas , Bill White and John Sharp , who have fully embraced it .
Pougnet is a social liberal -- he's an upfront gay man legally married to another man -- but he's a frightened and confused conservative who would be a surefire recruit for the Blue Dog caucus in the extremely unlikely event that he can rescue himself from Creigh Deedsism , a strategy that is tailor - made for him .
Meanwhile , I 've been barraged with e-mails from dozens and dozens of Democratic incumbents and challengers campaigning for healthcare reform .
Blake has to either stop letting the RNC write his headlines ... or stop mixing up Blue Dogs with real Democrats .

Guardian environment editor John Vidal examines the final frantic hours of Copenhagen 's climate summit , including fury toward the US president and the world 's richest countries
More than three decades into the AIDS epidemic , the story of women in KwaZulu - Natal — an impoverished region with one of the highest AIDS rates in the world — is not an easy one .
Living under patriarchal cultural and religious traditions makes women especially vulnerable to the disease , and they continue to suffer much higher rates of HIV infection than men .
Encouragement of male promiscuity , the high incidence of rape , and the myth that sex with a virgin will cure AIDS are just some of the factors why it can be difficult for women to protect themselves .
Meanwhile , in the Christian churches that dominate life in the region , women are taught to subjugate themselves to male power ; frank talk of sexuality , especially that of women , is frowned upon .
Some recent HIV / AIDS statistics out of South Africa paint a harsh picture : Nationally , about 11 percent of the population are infected , 7.9 percent of men and 13.6 percent of women .
( In KwaZulu - Natal the rate surges to almost 16 percent , the highest in the country . )
Younger women are especially vulnerable .
Among 20 - to 24 - year - olds nationwide , 21 percent of women are positive compared to 5 percent of men .
Women 25 to 29 are more than twice as likely to be positive as men in the same age group .
Dr. Beverley Haddad has been on the frontlines of the AIDS epidemic in her native South Africa since the late ’90s and knows the realities behind these grim statistics firsthand .
A development expert with a long history of social justice activism within the Anglican Church , Haddad was ordained by Bishop Desmond Tutu in 1993 , one of the first wave of South African women to be admitted into the priesthood .
She is currently director of the Theology and Development Program at the University of KwaZulu - Natal in Pietermaritzburg , where her work focuses on gender , AIDS , and social transformation in the church .
In a recent talk at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley , California , where she is teaching a course on AIDS and the church , Haddad imparted her own harsh statistics : over 39 percent of pregnant women in the KwaZulu - Natal town of Vulindlela are HIV positive , for example .
In the face of this overwhelming health crisis , coupled with endemic poverty , how do these women survive ?
And what are the prospects for overcoming this epidemic as we observe the 21st annual World AIDS Day ?
A Theology of Retribution : Suffering for Your Sins
Haddad ’s answers to those questions contain some hope and a lot of despair .
And they are nuanced , not the kind of easy inspirational slogan you might find in a brochure for an international aid agency .
While Anglican , Catholic , Protestant , and other “ mainline churches ” operate important HIV / AIDS programs nationally , such as one run by Hope Africa , which grew out of the social justice work of Haddad and other Anglicans in the 1980s , the role of churches , especially the smaller “ indigenous churches , ” in the day to day ground battle against AIDS is mixed at best .
Here women face the brunt of what Haddad calls “ a deeply patriarchal culture , ” and churches ( the dominant institutions in daily life in rural areas ) do little to combat this .
Men are assumed to control women ’s sexuality and sexual practice , so “ it ’s really difficult for women to negotiate safe sex with a condom , especially with their husbands . ”
Rape and sexual violence are also extremely high , which also “ renders women more vulnerable to HIV transmission . ”
The congregations in the pews on Sundays are 80 percent women , while it ’s almost exclusively men behind the pulpits .
In a recent study of 16 male clergy in Vulindlela ( most of whom have had very little formal theological training ) , Haddad found that in the face of the AIDS crisis , these men tend to resort back to “ a theology of retribution . ”
In terms of AIDS sufferers , they assume “ if something bad happens to you , you must have done something wrong . ”
In other words : you ’re suffering for your sins .
While the message delivered from the pulpits is often one of retribution and contributes to the “ stigmatization and discrimination ” against HIV - positive women , inside the powerful manyanos , or women ’s prayer unions , it is often more enlightened .
In her decade of AIDS work in the region , Haddad has n’t seen much improvement in the systemic problems at the root of the AIDS crisis — the poverty and gender violence — but “ the change in awareness is phenomenal . ”
This is especially true for women , more of whom understand that “ people really are dying of AIDS - related illnesses ” and are n’t “ bewitched or something . ”
In some instances , the manyanos are emerging as safe sites for discussion of taboo subjects such as HIV / AIDS and sexuality using the Bible as the point of departure .
For example , Haddad reports that in one group , reflection on the passage on the rape of Tamar ( 2 Sam. 13:1 - 22 ) spurred a conversation among the women about the issue of rape in their communities .
The manyanos , as well as the growing network of health clinics , which women attend in much greater numbers than men , has contributed to a gender gap in HIV / AIDS knowledge that Haddad says must be addressed by the church and in public education campaigns .
“ Allowing a Holocaust to Happen ”
As a member of the Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians , Haddad has also been a key player in the development in academia of “ survival theologies of poor and marginalized women . ”
Closely linked to African - American “ womanist theology , ” including the writings of Patricia Hill Collins and Delores Williams , survivalist theology focuses on ordinary women ’s “ survival strategies as a form of agency . ”
It also embraces the tendency of poor women to approach Christianity and the Bible as vehicles of hope and tools for survival .
In contrast , traditional male - dominated Christian theology is more retribution - based .
For Haddad , it ’s essential to understand that for poor rural women of faith in South Africa , the spiritual and the material , the sacred and the secular , are n’t separate entities .
Information they get from the clinic and from the manyano , for example , is interwoven into their experience of God .
As feminist theologians , “ there ’s a danger of doing our theorizing in isolation from the lived reality of ordinary women who do n’t make these kinds of distinctions . ”
Dr. Haddad , who was an activist in South Africa ’s freedom struggle , is a veteran of uphill battles , but she admits to being “ overwhelmed ” by the realities of the AIDS epidemic .
“ It ’s one thing to be involved in the liberation fight …
You kind of thought , this is going to end in my lifetime . ”
But after attending the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City last year , she realized “ there is no obvious sign of the epidemic diminishing until at least 2030 . ”
Since teaching in the United States for the last five months , Haddad has been further sobered by “ just how ignorant Americans are about Africa in general and the AIDS epidemic specifically . ”
She wants her students to understand that “ the epidemic is a justice issue , not a moral issue . ”
While African leadership holds its share of the blame , global economic equality is an even bigger issue , as is the exorbitant cost of anti-retroviral medicines .
“ I think the biggest indictment of the so - called developed world is that they are allowing a holocaust to happen in Africa … when there are drugs available to save people ’s lives . ”
Although condoms are widely available in health clinics in South Africa , their effectiveness against the epidemic is hugely stifled by cultural and religious attitudes both inside and outside the country .
Adding to local custom among males , which eschews condom use , especially between married couples , President Bush made his massive AIDS relief program “ entirely conditional on messages of abstinence and not condoms . ”
( The Obama administration has only recently updated the guidelines for the program , known as PEPFAR , to lighten the restrictions on family planning . )
And on his first visit to Africa , to Cameroon in 2008 , Pope Benedict reiterated the Church ’s extremely conservative stance against condoms .
“ Ordinary people just get on and do what they have to do , deal with it in a hidden way , but the Pope is a powerful person and it would be really nice if he would say things differently , ” Haddad said with a sigh .
“ People are trapped in theologies of retribution , ” Haddad said .
“ What we need are theologies that are life - giving . ”
Australia 's federal government has announced that it is proceeding with controversial plans to censor the Internet after government - commissioned trials found that using a blacklist of banned sites was accurate and would not slow down web use .
Critics , including Google , Electronic Frontiers Australia and Greens communications argue that the censorship policy is fundamentally flawed and the trial results are not surprising .
Stephen Conroy , Australia 's Communications Minister , will introduce legislation just before next year 's elections designed to force ISPs to block a blacklist of refused classification , or " RC " websites for all Australians using the Internet .
What will be Blocked ?
The blacklist would be comprised of material that includes illicit child photos , violence and other criminal activity and would be compiled using complaints from the public , government censors and URLs that are provided internationally .
It 's unknown what specifically would be blocked and who decides the fate of web sites .
What is known is that such blocking will not reduce performance : results of ISP - level Internet studies found that blocking banned material " can be done with 100 percent accuracy and negligible impact on Internet speed . "
( Source : com.au )
Top -Secret List Reveals Extensive Filtering
How , or if , ISP filters will distinguish between illegal ' refused classification ' material and material that is perfectly legal to view is not yet clear .
The government 's top - secret list of banned sites leaked on the Internet in March revealed that filtering extended beyond illicit images of children .
Instead , almost half of the sites on the government 's top - secret list had nothing to do with this kind of content .
Many of the links included online poker sites , YouTube links , regular adult sites , Wikipedia entries , euthanasia sites , fanatical religious sites , a tour operator 's website and the website of a Queensland dentist .
Improving Accountability and Transparency
Conroy noted that the government would partake in public consultations and released a discussion paper on additional measures allegedly aimed at improving the accountability and transparency processes that result in sites being blacklisted .
Appeal mechanisms , notification to website owners of RC content , and review by an independent expert are some of the options being considered .
Google notes that Germany and Italy have mandatory , limited - scope ISP filtering in place , but Australia 's proposed censorship would combine a mandatory framework and a wide scope of content .
Google Against Mandatory ISP Filtering Regime
Google is concerned about Australia 's plans to introduce mandatory filtering for ISPs in Australia , primarily that the scope of content to be filtered is too wide and Google believes that moving to a mandatory ISP filtering regime with a scope that goes well beyond child abuse material is heavy handed and can raise genuine questions about restrictions on access to information .
( Source : blogspot.com )
RC is a broad category of content that includes socially and politically controversial material in addition to child abuse material .
Because of the broad content , Google believes that the government should not have the right to block information that can inform debate on controversial issues .
The openness of the Internet makes public debate more possible and should be protected , it says .

Home » Earthquakes » New Madrid Seismic Zone Earthquake Hazard in the New Madrid Seismic Zone
Scientists remain concerned about a major destructive earthquake
Republished from United States Geological Survey Fact Sheet 2009 - 3071 of August 2009 .
New Madrid Seismic Zone Map
About two hundred years ago three of the most powerful earthquakes in the recorded history of North America occurred along the Mississippi River in southeastern Missouri .
They shook the Mississippi Valley and much of eastern United States on December 16 , 1811 ; January 23 , 1812 ; and February 7 , 1812 with estimated magnitudes between 7.0 and 8.0 .
Vulnerable Communities in the Mississippi Valley
There is broad agreement in the scientific community that a continuing concern exists for a major destructive earthquake in the New Madrid seismic zone .
Many structures in Memphis , Tenn. , St. Louis , Mo. , and other communities in the central Mississippi River Valley region are vulnerable and at risk from severe ground shaking .
This assessment is based on decades of research on New Madrid earthquakes and related phenomena by dozens of Federal , university , State , and consulting earth scientists .
Considerable interest has developed recently from media reports that the New Madrid seismic zone may be shutting down .
These reports stem from published research using global positioning system ( GPS ) instruments with results of geodetic measurements of strain in the Earth ’s crust .
Because of a lack of measurable strain at the surface in some areas of the seismic zone over the past 14 years , arguments have been advanced that there is no buildup of stress at depth within the New Madrid seismic zone and that the zone may no longer pose a significant hazard .
As part of the consensus - building process used to develop the national seismic hazard maps , the U.S. Geological Survey convened a workshop of experts in 2006 to evaluate the latest findings in earthquake hazards in the Eastern United States .
These experts considered the GPS data from New Madrid available at that time that also showed little to no ground movement at the surface .
The experts did not find the GPS data to be a convincing reason to lower the assessment of earthquake hazard in the New Madrid region , especially in light of the many other types of data that are used to construct the hazard assessment , several of which are described here .
The Geological Record
There are historical accounts of major earthquakes in the New Madrid region during 1811 - 12 .
The geologic record of pre-1811 earthquakes also reveals that the New Madrid seismic zone has repeatedly produced sequences of major earthquakes , including several of magnitude 7 to 8 , over the past 4,500 years .
These prehistoric earthquakes caused severe and widespread ground failures in the New Madrid region , much like those caused by the 1811 - 12 earthquake sequence .
The key evidence for large earthquakes that occurred in the past are sand blows that formed when underground sand and water erupted to the surface as a result of violent shaking .
Numerous large sand blows over a wide area were created by strong ground shaking during the 1811 - 12 earthquakes .
Similarly large , widespread , and abundant prehistoric sand blows were produced over the same area during ground shaking from previous clusters of large earthquakes around A.D. 1450 , A.D. 900 , and 2350 B.C.
The sizes and areal distribution of the prehistoric sand blows indicate that the older earthquakes were similar in location and magnitude to the 1811 - 12 shocks .
Continuing Seismic Activity
The New Madrid seismic zone is a source of continuing small and moderate earthquakes , which attest to the high stress in the region and indicate that the processes that produced the large earthquakes over the previous 4,500 years , are still operating .
It is the most seismically active area of the United States east of the Rockies .
There is no sign that the rate of these smaller earthquakes is decreasing with time , as would be expected if they were aftershocks of the 1811 – 12 earthquakes .
GPS Data From the New Madrid Seismic Zone
It has been known for several years that GPS measurements made since about 1996 do not show significant deformation across part of the New Madrid seismic zone .
The new results reported on recently are not substantially different from those derived from previous GPS data .
These short - term observations , though important , must be tempered by the context of tectonic processes developed over many thousands to millions of years .
Such long - term processes are unlikely to switch off in a few decades with an accompanying decrease in the earthquake hazard .
The New Madrid region is located in the middle of the vast North American tectonic plate .
In contrast to plate boundary settings like the coasts of California or Alaska where continuous deformation can be measured at the surface , some models predict that little deformation will occur during the period between large earthquakes in seismic areas within a plate .
The USGS has carried out an extensive consensus - building process in the development and updating of the national seismic hazard maps .
These maps are the basis for the seismic provisions in the model - building codes adopted in almost all of the United States .
Many workshops were conducted involving hundreds of scientists and engineers , and a thorough peer review process was undertaken in the development of the seismic hazard maps .
Scientists at some workshops evaluated the New Madrid GPS results of the past 12 years and debated their meaning .
They also considered the clear geologic evidence of large earthquakes occurring over the past 4,500 years and the continuing moderate earthquakes in the area .
It was the consensus of this broad group of scientists that ( 1 ) the evidence indicates that we can expect large earthquakes similar to the 1811 - 12 earthquakes to occur in the future with an average recurrence time of 500 years and that ( 2 ) magnitude 6 earthquakes , which can also cause serious damage , can be expected more frequently than the large 1811 - 12 shocks .
Based on this history of past earthquakes , the USGS estimates the chance of having an earthquake similar to one of the 1811 - 12 sequence in the next 50 years is about 7 to 10 percent , and the chance of having a magnitude 6 or larger earthquake in 50 years is 25 to 40 percent .
Likely Impacts from Future Large Earthquakes Earthquake hazards involve more than just strong ground shaking from passing seismic waves .
The 1811 - 12 earthquakes caused many types of ground failures including landslides along the Mississippi River bluffs from Mississippi to Kentucky .
Ground failures also included lateral spreading and ground subsidence by soil liquefaction across the Mississippi River flood plain and along tributaries to the Mississippi River over at least 15,000 square kilometers .
Today , a repeat event could be expected to produce similar effects in northeastern Arkansas , southeastern Missouri , western Tennessee and Kentucky , and southern Illinois .
Roadways in the Mississippi Valley of Arkansas and Missouri ( such as Interstate 55 ) could become impassable because of bridge failures and fissuring of road surfaces .
Venting of large quantities of water , sand , and mud as a result of liquefaction could flood fields and roads and disrupt agriculture for weeks to months .
Flooding of farmland , where agricultural chemicals are stored onsite , could contaminate rivers and streams .
Failure of levees , especially during high water , would contribute to flooding , and failures of riverbanks could make the Mississippi River and its tributaries difficult to navigate for many weeks .
The City of Memphis and the surrounding metropolitan area of more than one million people would be severely impacted .
Memphis has an aging infrastructure , and many of its large buildings , including unreinforced schools and fire and police stations , would be particularly vulnerable when subjected to severe ground shaking .
Relatively few buildings were built using building codes that have provisions for seismic - resistant design .
Soil liquefaction and related ground failures are likely to occur in downtown Memphis along the Mississippi River and along the Wolf River that passes through Memphis .
The older highways and railroad bridges that cross the Mississippi River , as well as older overpasses , would likely be damaged or collapse in the event of a major New Madrid earthquake .
Some of the bridges and pipelines crossing the Wolf River might be damaged or destroyed .
Although Memphis is likely to be the focus of major damage in the region , St. Louis , Mo. , Little Rock , Ark. , and many small and medium - sized cities would also sustain damage .

Continuing Preparedness Needed
The geologic record of repeated large earthquakes , the historical accounts of the 1811 - 12 large earthquakes , and the continuing earthquake activity in the area are compelling evidence that the New Madrid region has high earthquake hazard .
The preponderance of evidence leads us to conclude that earthquakes can be expected in the future as frequently and as severely as in the past 4,500 years .
Such high hazard requires prudent measures such as adequate building codes to protect public safety and ensure the social and economic resilience of the region to future earthquakes .
Some of the critics ’ complaints had merit , said the committee chairman , Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut .
Still , Mr. Dodd added , “ Chairman Bernanke must also receive credit for the critical role he played in the events of last fall . ”
Had he and others not acted , Mr. Dodd said , the nation probably would have faced “ utter economic catastrophe  and I believe nothing short of that was at risk . ”
Instead , Mr. Dodd added , “ I believe better days do lie ahead . ”
A Republican , Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , offered a strong endorsement of the nominee .
While “ mistakes were made ” under his purview , Mr. Gregg said , Mr. Bernanke ’s swift reaction to the financial crisis had proved crucial .
“ I tell you , it worked , ” he said .
“ It ’s that simple . ”
But Senator Bernard Sanders , independent of Vermont , strongly opposes Mr. Bernanke ’s nomination because of his role in the bailouts and has put a hold on the nomination .
That means it will require 60 votes , not a simple majority .
Although his confirmation appears likely , a number of no votes are expected from members of both parties when the full Senate votes and if Mr. Bernanke is not confirmed by Jan. 31 , when his term ends , then the Fed ’s vice chairman , Donald L. Kohn , would temporarily take over .
President Obama , in announcing his nomination of Mr. Bernanke in August , said he had led the Fed through “ one of the worst financial crises that this nation and this world have ever faced ” and , because of his background , his expertise on the Depression and his unflappable personality , was ideally suited to help lead the recovery .
During his four years , Mr. Bernanke has emerged as a favorite target of liberals and conservatives alike .
Critics have tried to portray him as cozy with Wall Street elites and slow to react to signs that the financial system was on the brink of collapse .
Mr. Bernanke , a former professor at Princeton , was initially criticized as too academic , but he has since spearheaded some of the most interventionist actions by the Fed in its history .
Megachurch Asks for Nearly $ 1 M in 48 Hours Pastor Rick Warren posts " urgent " letter to raise $ 900,000 before year 's end .
Dec. 31 , 2009  --
The clock is ticking for members of pastor Rick Warren 's California megachurch after the evangelical leader posted an " urgent " letter on his Web site Wednesday calling on congregants to donate a total of $ 900,000 before the New Year to make up for a massive holiday giving deficit .
" This is an urgent letter unlike any I 've written in 30 years , " the blog post said .
" I have some thrilling news to share with you below but first , some seriously bad news . "
Warren said that despite the recession , Saddleback Church managed to stay on budget all year until last weekend when " the bottom dropped out . "
" On the last weekend of 2009 , our total offerings were less than half of what we normally receive -- leaving us $ 900,000 in the red for the year , unless you help make up the difference today and tomorrow , " the post said .
The church 's usual non-holiday Sunday offering is estimated at $ 600,000 coming from more than 80,000 members at five different church locations , according to a 2009 Reader 's Digest profile on Warren .
The letter , signed " Pastor Rick , " goes on to detail the church 's accomplishments including its food pantry , homeless shelter and financial coaching , despite 10 percent of the congregation being jobless .
" It 's basically having to do more with less , " church spokesman A. Larry Ross told The Associated Press .
" The seasonal Christmas offering was down significantly and , commensurately , the need for services the church is expected to provide is up . "
Warren and spokespersons for Saddleback Church did not immediately respond to interview requests from ABCNews.com .
Members ' Confident ' in Church Support
Members Kim Offhaus and her husband said they were happy to help out .
" I know that many people are affected by job loss and that Saddleback Church is not immune , " Offhaus told the Orange County Register .
" I 'm confident we 'll support the church .
It 's there to meet the needs of the people spiritually , physically and emotionally . "
It 's not the first time Saddleback 's members have mobilized to raise large sums in a hurry .
According to the church 's
Web site , members raised $ 1.7 million for victims of Katrina in the Gulf Coast in 2005 and $ 1.6 million for victims of the 2004 tsunami in the Pacific islands .
Offhaus said the funds for the tsunami were raised " in one offering . "
" People at Saddleback are very generous , " she told the Register .
Warren , who rocketed to stardom with his best - selling book " The Purpose Driven Life , " became a focus of controversy in January when Barack Obama chose him to deliver the invocation at Obama 's inauguration .
Warren had come under fire from critics for his anti-gay views in the weeks leading up to the inauguration .

Dome of Rock , East Jerusalem , 2001 .
A classified European Union report for 2009 says Israel is actively pursuing the annexation of east Jerusalem .
The report accuses Israel of implementing an intricate policy including expanding Jewish settlements and demolishing Palestinian homes .
It says policies " are undermining prospects for a Palestinian capital in east Jerusalem and incrementally render a sustainable two - state solution unfeasible " ; this is described as , " an integral part of a broader Israeli strategy . "
Israeli Foreign ministry spokesperson , Yigal Palmor , told AFP that the report was " dishonest " , " reflects the Palestinian propaganda " and " is based exclusively on Palestinian versions and figures . "
This comes as EU foreign ministers prepare a statement on the Middle East .
To allow for US initiatives , EU foreign ministers have not commented on the stalemate between Israel and the Palestinians over past months ; but , diplomatic sources say there are “ sensitivities ” over a Swedish proposal to divide Jerusalem in any peace deal .
Israel is , by practical means , actively pursuing its illegal annexation of east Jerusalem by weakening the Palestinian community in the city , impeding Palestinian urban developments and ultimately separating east Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank .
Citing official Israeli statistics from the Ministry of Interior executive director of Israel ’s HaMoked ( Center for the Defence of the Individual ) said Wednesday that , " Israel has stripped Palestinians of Jerusalem residency status last year at a faster rate than at any time in the history of the state " .
4,577 residents of East Jerusalem have had their residence revoked in 2008 , this is more than half the total revoked in the past 40 years .
The Jerusalem municipality places severe restrictions on issuing building permits for Palestinian houses in east Jerusalem , since 2000 over 600 Palestinian - owned structures have been demolished and Palestinians receive fewer than 200 of the 1,500 building permits needed per year .
Developments in east Jerusalem in 2009 were marked by the continued expansion of Israeli settlements and a considerable number of Palestinian house demolitions and eviction orders .
The 14 - page annual report dated November 23 was drafted by European envoys and consuls in Jerusalem and Ramallah and presented to Brussels EU institutions a few days ago .
This is the first time the annual report has been made public .
Haaretz says , in the past , Israel has pressed the EU not to publish fearing it would undermine the European public 's view of Israel .
The report was leaked to Israel 's Haaretz daily newspaper and obtained by AFP yesterday .
HAVE YOUR SAY
What measures should the EU take to protest Israeli policy , help Arab residents and stop " settlement activity " in East Jerusalem ?
Add or view comments
The expansion of Israeli settlements has sparked a trend of settler violence against the Palestinian population in East Jerusalem .
Such criminal actions have been witnessed by Israeli police but are not met with adequate intervention .
The EU report claims the Israeli government and Jerusalem municipality discriminate against Arab residents with regard to building permits , health services , education , sanitation and more .
Allegations of assisting private right - wing Jewish organisations , such as Ateret Cohanim and Elad , to alter the city 's demographics are included .
The report advises sanctions against people and groups involved in " settlement activity " , and taking other measures to protest Israeli policy and to stop the harming of the Arab population , including an " EU presence at Israeli court cases on house demolitions or evictions of Palestinian families when there is a risk of demolition or eviction of Palestinian families " , and " information sharing on violent settlers in East Jerusalem to assess whether to grant entry to the EU . "
The report also recommends implementing measures to strengthen the Palestinian National Authority 's presence in the city .
Archaeological excavations in Jerusalem near the Temple Mount are mentioned , suggesting " archaeology in this case has become an ideologically motivated tool of national and religious struggle carried out in a manner that modifies the identity and character of the city and threatens to undermine its stability . "

Phil Jones , the main criminal according to this correspondence , has personally confirmed that the website was hacked and that the documents are authentic .
See Briefing Room .
He says that he " ca n't remember " what he meant by " hiding the decline . "
Well , let me teach him some English .
First , dictionaries say that hide means
1. to conceal from sight ; prevent from being seen or discovered :
Where did she hide her jewels ?
2. to obstruct the view of ; cover up :
The sun was hidden by the clouds .
3. to conceal from knowledge or exposure ; keep secret : to hide one 's feelings .
4. to conceal oneself ; lie concealed : He hid in the closet .
5. British .
a place of concealment for hunting or observing wildlife ; hunting blind .
6. hide out , to go into or remain in hiding :
After breaking out of jail , he hid out in a deserted farmhouse .
Here Are A Few Choice Emails
The Reference Frame
Hadley CRU says leaked data is real
The director of Britain 's leading Climate Research Unit , Phil Jones , has told Investigate magazine 's TGIF Edition tonight that his organization has been hacked , and the data flying all over the internet appears to be genuine .
In an exclusive interview , Jones told TGIF , " It was a hacker .
We were aware of this about three or four days ago that someone had hacked into our system and taken and copied loads of data files and emails . "
" Have you alerted police ? "
" Not yet .
We were not aware of what had been taken . "
Jones says he was first tipped off to the security breach by colleagues at the website RealClimate .
Alert The Police ?
Market Ticker On The Scam
.....
Yes , I have the file .
So do a few million other people .
There 's enough evidence in there , in my opinion , of outrageously fraudulent conduct to make this the scandal of the 20th and 21st century .
Sorry folks , there 's no science here - this is , from what I see , a massive and outrageous fraud , and now that the documents have been confirmed as authentic , it is time to pull the curtain down on this crap and start locking up all of the proponents - starting with AL GORE .
Here are some interesting " meta statistics " on the documents , and the number of times the words referenced appear : Fraud : 79
Falsify : 6
Inflate : 14
Conceal : 5
Hide : 19 Just for starters .
If you think that 's bad , you might like this - from the file " ipcc-tar-master.rtf " :
47 out of 91 models listed in Chapter 9 assume that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing at the rate of 1 % a year when the measured rate of increase , for the past 33 years , has been 0.4 % a year .
The assumption of false figures in models in order to boost future projections is fraudulent .
What other figures are falsely exaggerated in the same way ?
And then there 's this ...

Mike ,
Can you delete any emails you may have had with Keith re AR4 ?
Keith will do likewise .
He 's not in at the moment - minor family crisis .
Can you also email Gene and get him to do the same ?
I do n't have his new email address .
We will be getting Caspar to do likewise .
I see that CA claim they discovered the 1945 problem in the Nature paper !!

Rules Of The Game
I downloaded the zip file , unpacked it , browsed a bit .
I opened a .pdf file entitled “ RulesOfTheGame.pdf ” .
Very interesting document .
Most compelling is that I broke open the metadata for this file .
The file date stamp is Oct. 3 , 2006 , the metadata says it was created Oct 14 , 2005 using QuarkExpress v.6.1 ( released in 2004 ) .
All properties and metadata for this file definitely appear genuine to me .
Interesting that this document describes methods of convincing the public of the “ crisis ” .
Excerpt :
a new way of thinking
Once we ’ve eliminated the myths , there is room for some new ideas .
These principles relate to some of the key ideas emerging from behaviour change modeling for sustainable development :
5. Climate change must be ‘ front of mind ’ before persuasion works
Currently , telling the public to take notice of climate change is as successful as selling tampons to men .
People do n’t realise ( or remember ) that climate change relates to them .
6 . Use both peripheral and central processing Attracting direct attention to an issue can change attitudes , but peripheral messages can be just as effective : a tabloid snapshot of Gwyneth Paltrow at a bus stop can help change attitudes to public transport .
7 . Link climate change mitigation to positive desires / aspirations Traditional marketing associates products with the aspirations of their target audience .
Linking climate change mitigation to home improvement , self - improvement , green spaces or national pride are all worth investigating .
8 . Use transmitters and social learning People learn through social interaction , and some people are better teachers and trendsetters than others .
Targeting these people will ensure that messages seem more trustworthy and are transmitted more effectively .
9 . Beware the impacts of cognitive dissonance Confronting someone with the difference between their attitude and their actions on climate change will make them more likely to change their attitude than their actions .
How To Avoid Taxes On Grants
Mike Abbott ( 17:06:59 ) :
Here ’s a quote from one of the emails :
“ Also , it is important for us if you can transfer the ADVANCE money on the personal accounts which we gave you earlier and the sum for one occasion transfer ( for example , during one day ) will not be more than 10,000 USD .
Only in this case we can avoid big taxes and use money for our work as much as possible . ”
Reducing " Blips "
Ric Werme ( 19:43:43 ) :
This sounds like a “ get rid of the MWP , ” I hope it ’s just a what if
speculation / exploration that might lead to research directions .

Phil ,
Here are some speculations on correcting SSTs to partly explain the 1940s warming blip .
If you look at the attached plot you will see that the land also shows the 1940s blip ( as I ’m sure you know ) .
So , if we could reduce the ocean blip by , say , 0.15 degC , then this would be significant for the global mean — but we ’d still have to explain the land blip .
I ’ve chosen 0.15 here deliberately .
This still leaves an ocean blip , and i think one needs to have some form of ocean blip to explain the land blip ( via either some common forcing , or ocean forcing land , or vice versa , or all of these ) .
When you look at other blips , the land blips are 1.5 to 2 times ( roughly ) the ocean blips — higher sensitivity plus thermal inertia effects .
My 0.15 adjustment leaves things
consistent with this , so you can see where I am coming from .
Wang Fabrications

Steve ,
I thought that I should summarize what has happened with the Wang case .
First , I concluded that the claims made about Chinese stations by Jones et al .
[ Nature , 1990 ] and Wang et al. [ GRL , 1990 ] were very probably fabricated .
( You very likely came to the same conclusion . )
Second , some investigation showed that Phil Jones was wholly blameless and that responsibility almost certainly lay with Wang .
Third , I contacted Wang , told him that I had caught him , and asked him to retract his fabricated claims .
My e-mails were addressed to him only , and I told no one about them .
In Wang 's reply , though , Jones , Karl , Zeng , etc. were Cc'd .
Fourth , I explained to Wang that I would publicly accuse him of fraud if he did not retract .
Wang seemed to not take me seriously .
So I drafted what would be the text of a formal accusation and sent it to him .
Wang replied that if I wanted to make the accusation , that was up to me .
Fifth , I put a draft on my web site --
http://www.informath.org/apprise/a5620.htm
-- and e-mailed a few people , asking if they had any recommendations for improvement .
I intend to send the final version to Wang 's university , and to demand a formal investigation into fraud .
I will also notify the media .
Separately , I have had a preliminary discussion with the FBI - - because Wang likely used government funds to commit his fraud ; it seems that it might be possible to prosecute Wang under the same statute as was used in the Eric Poehlman case .
The simplicity of the case makes this easier -- no scientific knowledge is required to understand things .
I saw that you have now e-mailed Phil ( Cc 'd above ) , asking Phil to publish a retraction of Wang 's claims : http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=1741#comment-115879
There could be a couple problems with that .
One problem is that it would be difficult for Phil to publish anything without the agreement of Wang and the other co-authors ( Nature would simply say " no " ) .
Another problem is that your e-mail says that you presume Phil was " unaware of the incorrectness " of Wang 's work .
I do not see how that could be true .
Although the evidence that Phil was innocent in 1990 seems entirely conclusive , there is also the paper of Yan et al .
[ Advances in Atmospheric Sciences , 18 : 309 ( 2001 ) ] , which is cited on my web page .
Phil is a co-author of that paper .
Phil , this proves that you knew there were serious problems with Wang 's claims back in 2001 ; yet some of your work since then has continued to rely on those claims , most notably in the latest report from the IPCC .
It would be nice to hear the explanation for this .
Phil ?
Kind wishes , Doug
Only by playing with data can scientists come up with the infamous ‘ hockey stick ’ graph of global warming
Beginning in 2003 , I worked with Stephen McIntyre to replicate a famous result in paleoclimatology known as the Hockey Stick graph .
Developed by a U.S. climatologist named Michael Mann , it was a statistical compilation of tree ring data supposedly proving that air temperatures had been stable for 900 years , then soared off the charts in the 20th century .
Prior to the publication of the Hockey Stick , scientists had held that the medieval - era was warmer than the present , making the scale of 20th century global warming seem relatively unimportant .
The dramatic revision to this view occasioned by the Hockey Stick ’s publication made it the poster child of the global warming movement .
It was featured prominently in a 2001 report of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , as well as government websites and countless review reports .
Steve and I showed that the mathematics behind the Mann Hockey Stick were badly flawed , such that its shape was determined by suspect bristlecone tree ring data .
Controversies quickly piled up : Two expert panels involving the U.S. National Academy of Sciences were asked to investigate , the U.S. Congress held a hearing , and the media followed the story around the world .
The expert reports upheld all of our criticisms of the Mann Hockey Stick , both of the mathematics and of its reliance on flawed bristlecone pine data .
...
Thus the key ingredient in most of the studies that have been invoked to support the Hockey Stick , namely the Briffa Yamal series , depends on the influence of a woefully thin subsample of trees and the exclusion of readily - available data for the same area .
Whatever is going on here , it is not science .
I have been probing the arguments for global warming for well over a decade .
In collaboration with a lot of excellent coauthors I have consistently found that when the layers get peeled back , what lies at the core is either flawed , misleading or simply non-existent .
Ross McKitrick is a professor of environmental economics at the University of Guelph , and coauthor of Taken By Storm : The Troubled Science , Policy and Politics of Global Warming .
Animated Engines
Single Cylinder Stirling Engine
This type of Stirling engine , known as the beta configuration , 3 features just one cylinder with a hot end and a cool end .
The working gas is transferred from one end of the cylinder to the other by a device called a displacer ( illustrated in blue ) .
The displacer resembles a large piston , except that it has a smaller diameter than the cylinder , thus its motion does not change the volume of gas in the cylinder — it merely transfers the gas around within the cylinder .
The same four phases of the Stirling cycle are at work in this engine :
Expansion
Most of the gas in the system has just been driven to the hot end of the cylinder .
The gas heats and expands , driving the piston outward .
Transfer
The gas has expanded .
Most of the gas is still located in the hot end of the cylinder .
Flywheel momentum carries the crankshaft the next quarter turn .
The bulk of the gas is transferred around the displacer to the cool end of the cylinder .
Contraction
The majority of the expanded gas has shifted to the cool end .
The gas cools and contracts , drawing the piston inward .
Transfer
The contracted gas is still located near the cool end of the cylinder .
Flywheel momentum carries the crank another quarter turn , moving the displacer and transferring the bulk of the gas back to the hot end of the cylinder .

Bio Barbara Liskov is an Institute Professor and head of the Programming Methodology Group .
Liskov 's research interests lie in programming methodology , programming languages and systems , and distributed computing .
Liskov is a member of the National Academy of Engineering , and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , and the Association for Computer Machinery ( ACM ) .
About the conference Starting in 1986 , OOPSLA Conference has proven to be the cradle of many techniques and methodologies that have become mainstream over the years : OOP , Patterns , AOP , XP , Unit Testing , UML , Wiki , and Refactoring .
Gaining its prestige with 3 academic tracks , OOPSLA Conference has managed to attract researchers , educators and developers every year .
The event is sponsored by ACM .
Current events have been begging for direct , pragmatic commentary .
This serial essay is therefore cutting into the " Empire of Yin " series , which is more philosophical .
Apology to my long - suffering readers .
" Empire " will resume in a few weeks .
European Commissioners opine that “ Immigration Is Moral Necessity ” and “ Islam Is Welcome . ”
A French President predicts that “ Arabic Is the Language of the Future . ” A Moroccan becomes Mayor of Rotterdam .
Europeans who wish to assert their ethnic identity and interests versus those of aliens are roughed up .
In the United States -- a country that has ruined itself through its own naïveté about human nature , about the world and about itself , the presidential election is being contested between a right - liberal candidate of the Stupid Party and a left - liberal candidate of the Evil Party .
The latter ’s position ’s is that America ’s wealth should be redistributed to the Afro- American “ community ” so that the country can have its salvation .
He may have rephrased this idea in more unctuous words as his political shrewdness was increasing over the years , but essentially this is still the intention .
Yet , Mr. Obama is likely to win , partly due to electoral fraud of his supporters and fawning adulation by mainstream media that disseminate news and opinions filtered to put him in the White House .
With Barack Obama in the White House and his party on the way to a supermajority in Congress , soon enough the United States will be turning from a stupid form of capitalism to a stupid form of socialism , and from a stupid form of multiculturalism to an evil one – of the Eurabian kind .
It will be Sweden West , without the virtues that ethnic Swedes still possess .
Indeed , Mr. Obama would fit seamlessly as Norway ’s Prime Minister or France ’s Minister of Housing , give or take a language or two .
He has vowed not only to transform America but also to “ change the world . ”
Many millions in the United States and around the world are waiting for this changin ’ and rearrangin’ , ignorant that Lenin also promised to change his country and the world – which he did .
Keeping Lenin in mind , what are people like us to do ?
Here are one man ’s answers , based on years of acquaintanceship with “ people like us ” in a dozen countries over many years .
To begin with , who are “ we ” ?
One Identity
We are the ethno - conservatives -- perhaps 60 million people in Western Europe , North America and Oceania .
There are probably four times that number who are like us , but they are latent , unable at this time to cut through the fog of suppressive propaganda and inertia .
In every Western country , we are a minority encircled by brainwashed zealots discharged at a steady rate from the left - only assembly line of public education .
The conveyor belt ’s propulsive power is multiplied many times over by the giant dynamos of Mainstream Media ( MSM ) and manufactured pop culture .
Our own propulsive power comes from inner conviction , books by Dead White Males , and – to steal a phrase from Abraham Lincoln – the mystic chords of memory .
We are vastly outnumbered , and have few friends among the leading elites of the Western world .
But it helps to remember that 185 million ex-Russia , non-Muslim Eastern Europeans are behind us .
Living under Soviet tyranny has immunized them against the terrible mental virus that has ravaged the West .
They have their own problems , related to economic development , but their combined weight is on our side .
We ought not to forget who came to the rescue of Vienna and Western civilization in their hopeless encirclement in 1683 .
Over 1.5 billion East Asians are of the same mind as we are with regard to their own answers as to who they are .
But they are busy beating us at our own game : technology , industry , innovation , commerce .
And the reason they are beating us is that the same elites and their remote - controlled supporters who have brought us Eurabia and Multimerica have also brought us a stifling socialism in Europe and a dumb and self - defeating capitalism in America .
Our common denominator is not white , for our most numerous and powerful opponents are also white .
Rather , it is our opposition to our disfranchisement , marginalization and impoverishment by our own ruling elites in government , media , education , culture and business .
In America , we steam for having been abandoned by our government to mayhem and rape by illegal aliens .
The two parties and their presidential candidates leave us a choice only between the details of how they will legalize the 12 – 18 million illegals , with all the terrorists and vicious criminals embedded among them .
We have nothing left but festering rage and memorials to the victims on YouTube .
But that ’s exactly the same experience relayed through innumerable news items posted by Brussels Journal about Europeans victimized and terrorized by Muslim or just plain - African immigrants who are under European governments ’ sponsorship and protection while the choices left to the rightful owners of Europe are to stew in terminal frustration , read The Camp of the Saints under cover with a flashlight , or emigrate .
We are unwilling to shut up about the de facto culling of whites by black and brown ( 1 ) crime and Muslim terrorists .
We are angry at the authorities ’ cowardice in confronting these problems .
We are not Islamophobes , not really .
Anyone who has spent time in , say , Qatar , Kazakhstan or Brunei , has experienced values and features of a society that challenge one ’s notions of the superiority of Western democracy and the wisdom of the Western über-value of hedonistic freedom .
It ’s just that these people do not belong in the schoolrooms and supermarket aisles of Rome , London or Charlottesville , just as we do n’t belong in Islamabad , Mecca , or Batna .
This is so obvious , that our ruling elites ’ willful subversion of this precept is the greatest act of mass treason and insanity in the history of the world .
In America ’s case , it even has a farcical dimension , for here is a country that ’s invading the Muslim world in the name of spreading freedom , while inviting Muslims from all over the world to live within its borders , thereby curtailing its own citizens ’ freedom .
Nearly all the 9/11 Muslim terrorists had US - issued drivers licenses that enabled them to carry out all the preparations and the boarding of the planes that they would crash into the country that had welcomed them .
It ’s relevant too that Mr. Obama ’s main accomplishment in his all - too - brief legal career was his lawsuit on behalf of ACORN to implement the Motor Voter law in Illinois in the mid-1990s .
For all we know , Mohammad Atta @ Co. voted in American elections , as can millions of illegal aliens with American drivers licenses .
And they vote Obama .
It ’s our own ruling elites that have put us on a collision course with Muslims , by importing them to our countries and subjecting us to a gross devaluation of our social capital through constant friction with people too different for us to absorb and digest , with alien ways and mores that we cannot condone .
Moreover , it ’s our own ruling elites and the suprastructures they support such as EU and UN that have put us on a collision course with Islam .
Jihad is an opportunistic infection that lay dormant as long as the West was strong and self - confident .
The West 's own impairment of its cultural immune functions and the related importation of millions of Muslims has allowed the dormant jihadi virus to thaw and flourish .
We are not racist .
Nature ’s strength is in diversity , and so is Humanity ’s .
But we are not Nature or Humanity .
We are particular people trying to live our particular lives .
And for that , we need our particular ethnicity and our singular culture , as other peoples need theirs .
Our ethnicity has a universal component : we are all Europeans , or descendants of Europeans .
This is implanted in our cultural , spiritual and moral makeup .
The molded life - forms encircling us charge that this amounts to a fixation on whiteness , blondness , disdain for other skin colors , cultures etc .
But that ’s absurd .
There are undoubtedly some people sitting right now in a bierstube in Leipzig or Baton Rouge who are classical racists .
But that ’s a small minority .
Of all the people on earth , none are as fixated on skin color , and as racist as Africans and people of African descent are .
People whose main political expression is an organization called La Raza certainly are not far behind , with the rest of non-whites in the world exhibiting ethnocentric and racist attitudes far beyond those of whites .
One wanders what would be the public reaction if the university graduation thesis of the white wife of the candidate for the U.S. presidency contained the sentence , “ As a member of the white community , I am obligated to this community and will utilize all of my present and future resources to benefit the white community first and foremost . ”
Yet these are the words of Michelle Obama , with “ white ” substituting for her original “ black . ”
European ethnicity is bound predominantly with white racial characteristics , but no one sound of mind and soul would exclude from it the part - black Pushkin and Dumas families , with all their distinguished members .
Nor are there many among us who split hairs as to Aryan–Caucasian - Semite differences , what with sizeable Jewish presence in Europe going back to 400 BCE , and the Jewish imprint on Euro - Western culture ranging from Moses , Jesus , Peter and Paul to Mendelssohn , Kant , Disraeli , Einstein , von Mises and Salk .
I say to liberals who accuse me of “ racist ” objections to Barack Obama that if Thomas Sowell ran against John McCain , I would be voting for the black man .
But ultimately , one cannot convince a life - form spewed from a conveyor belt .
I think we ought to accept the charge of “ racism ” calmly and not run for cover .
For Nature itself is “ racist . ”
Racial differences are real , and not only in obvious physical features but in cognitive and psychological ones as well .
This is increasingly moving from the realm of behavioral and cognitive statistics to hard genomic science .
Many of the differences do not favor whites , e.g. mean IQs versus East Asians or bodily - kinesthetic and musical intelligence scores versus those of blacks .
But whites score far better than blacks and browns do in areas of intelligence like Logical - Mathematical and Verbal - Linguistic that are prerequisite for well - paying jobs in the modern economy .
And since liberalism starts from the premise that all people would be equal in education , status and income but for malign social structures that hold back “ minorities , ” liberals spare no effort to stop contrary science .
We are not xenophobes .
Most of the people I know on our side of the political divide – including in Japan – like to have foreigners among them .
Life in Tokyo without pastry shops operated by the best of German and French patissiers would be as dull as French or Dutch football might be without black midfielders .
It ’s a question of balance .
4 % - 5 % of foreign - origin residents seems to be the level at which the marginal utility of diversity becomes zero , with negative values beyond that .
And that in a unicultural but cosmopolitan society , which seems to be the optimal model .
Even then , additional restrictions ought to apply on foreigners who are certain that they alone have a direct , exclusive telephone line to God , and those who do not are enemies to be subdued .
In contrast , the ruling American elite – including Republicans – has gone mad to such an extent that “ minorities ” are now over 1/3 of America ’s population , soon to be half .
And the EU ruling elite is welcoming , nay , soliciting , an Islamic wave that will accomplish what it failed previously at Tours , Lepanto and Vienna .
Together , they have brainwashed two generations of Westerners so effectively that the majority of whites in the world , notably among the young , celebrates “ diversity ” -- i.e. their peoples ’ and Western Civilization ’s inevitable dissolution – as their core value .
It is against this part of the population , and the politicians and subversive intellectuals who hold their puppet strings , that I believe we ought to define ourselves .
The Pods
Most contemporary whites are docilely or actively complicit in their own displacement , disappropriation , and disproportional share of rape , battery and murder by more savage peoples who have fewer scruples .
The epitome is the Amy Biehl Syndrome .
Amy Biehl was a young poster - girl “ progressive ” : blonde and upper–middle class , young and pretty , Stanford graduate and Fulbright scholar on a mission to help South Africa .
One day in 1993 , Amy drove to the shantytown of Gugutelu , on a do - good mission .
A mob of 80 black men started throwing rocks on her car .
She got out of the car and was stabbed and killed on the spot .
Four men were convicted of the murder .
They spent five years in prison before applying for pardon .
Amy Biehl ’s parents came to the pardon hearings , in her father ’s words , “ as Amy came , in a spirit of committed friendship . "
The Biehls not only forgave their daughter ’s killers .
They established a charitable foundation for the benefit of Gugutelu ’s youngsters , and employed two of Amy ’s killers in it .
Mrs. Biehl has said about her daughter ’s murderers , " It was like an adoption .
These were just children who did n't have a chance to have a childhood . "
The Biehls are not monsters , but loving parents who decided to upend the laws of gravity in the social and moral realms .
Except for small and esoteric sects like the Indian Jains , this particular inclination appears only among whites .
And , except for one , no analogy conveys this bizarre refusal to perceive reality , as though the act of suspending an idea could suspend the object of the idea .
Indeed , no true leftist – whether Marxist , cultural Marxist , Christian social penitent , New York liberal or Amsterdam libertine -- will ever let reality interfere with a good theory .
That ’s why I think of them as “ Pods ” and of us as “ Nonpods . ”
I use these words in the context of one of the great masterpieces of American cinema , “ Invasion of the Body Snatchers ” , released in 1956 and directed by Don Siegel , based on a novel by Jack Finney .
In it , a doctor returns to a small California town to find out that one by one , its people , most of whom he has known all his life , have been replaced by dopplegängers .
These emotionless beings animated by a single instinct – proliferation -- develop from large , foaming seedpods ; in effect a biological production line for lifelike automatons , set up by evil space aliens .
One by one , real people disappear – acquaintances , friends and ultimately the protagonist ’s girlfriend , until he remains the sole nonpod , encircled by human - like , giant legumes : the Body Snatchers .
Pods whose previous identities have been snatched and extinguished seem to be multiplying in our world too , and they are passionate in their hatred -- of us .
Middle - aged men and women who demonstrate publicly their desire for Europe to remain European are beaten up by Antifa gangs half their age and twenty times their number .
The few Americans who have the courage to demonstrate their support for the alternative to a crypto-Marxist disciple of Black Theology are heckled , beaten up , or firebombed in the Country of the Free .
Pods are deeply committed to the idea that freedom and equality are not mutually exclusive .
They are the emotional children of the French Revolution and worship its motto so much that they are willing to install PC tyranny in the name of Liberté , enforce racist and gender discrimination and robbery of private property in the name of Egalité , and stop at no fraud , libel and persecution of their opponents in the name of Fraternité .
Pods view biological race and gender differences as social constructs , and therefore social group differences as an unjust inequality that must be rectified by reconstructing society .
They view nation , ethnoculture , and private property as obsolete obstacles in the way of freedom , equality and fraternity of all people .
Therefore , the right of anyone to immigrate anywhere precedes the right of the one suffering the destruction of his social capital by this immigration .
The right of a slacker to home , sustenance , and self - esteem counseling precedes the right of the 80 - hours - a - week worker not to have his earnings confiscated to float the slacker in splendid idleness .
They view the refusal to tolerate the intolerable as unacceptable intolerance , and the desire to protect and preserve one ’s family , community , country and culture as racism and xenophobia .
And lastly , they have stood Jesus ’ metaphor on its end , so that they fail to see the beam in the nonwhites ’ , non-Christians ’ eye , but they see and greatly magnify the speck in their own peoples ’ eye .
This is deep , delusionary dementia .
A recent headline conveys the essence of this syndrome : Cyclists ' braved freezing cold temps ' to promote global warming awareness ...
This mental disorder is now the dominant orientation of the Western peoples , with its triumphant apotheosis , The One We Have Been Waiting For , coasting on the final approach to the most powerful job in the world , so that he can change the world into Pod kingdom .
The dementia ’s hold on the brains of the majority of the white population is such that the vile Afro-American racism that America ’s probable 44th president imbibed during most of his adulthood goes unmentioned and uncriticized by the MSM .
Even Mr. Obama ’s opponent in the presidential election remains paralyzed by the possibility that anything he might say would be deemed " racist . "
Barack Obama is expected to receive 75 - 80 % of the white vote in many urban areas of the United States .
If this is not having one ’s body and soul snatched , nothing is .
Podism in history
Mass dementia across wide swaths of the population occurs only once in several hundred years .
In the early 13th century , tens of thousands of Europeans , including many children , set out for the Holy Land , to convert Muslims to Christianity through love .
They were convinced that the Mediterranean Sea would part to let them through .
Most of them would be killed by disease and shipwreck , and the rest were sold into slavery in Tunisia .
In mid-17th century , European Jews were gripped by messianic fever .
The One They Had Been Waiting For was Shabbetai Tzvi , a Syrian Jewish kabbalist with delusions of grandeur and a taste for the good life .
In 1648 , Shabbetai declared himself as the true Messianic redeemer , designated by God to change the world .
His fame swept throughout Jewish , Christian , and Muslim communities .
He acquired wealth , a beautiful wife , and a veritable court .
He was issuing edicts that were circulating throughout the synagogues of Europe , and wherever he went , crowds of Jews greeted him with , " Long live our King , our Messiah ! "
In 1666 , “ the Messiah ” traveled to Istanbul , expecting the fulfillment of the prophecy of his campaign manager , one Nathan of Gaza , that he would be crowned as the sultan .
Instead , the actual sultan had him put in chains and imprisoned , but on lenient terms .
The lenient incarceration allowed The One to live in the prison castle in splendor -- financed by a huge stream of contributions from his many ardent followers .
Nathan of Gaza , a brilliant propagandist , kept disseminating fanciful reports about the miraculous deeds " the Messiah " was performing while incarcerated .
Therefore , the incarceration , instead of proving to the adherents that Shabbetai was an impostor , strengthened their Messianic delusions instead .
But the charade had to end .
Under the sultan ’s pressure , Shabbetai , still a prisoner , converted to Islam .
He received his freedom and various favors in exchange .
Some of his followers also went over to Islam , but largely the conversion of the Jewish Messiah to Islam was so devastating to most of his myriad followers that echoes of the damage persist among traditional Jews to this day .
It is significant that despite Shabbetai 's apostasy , Nathan ’s astute propaganda campaign turned what should have been the spike of death for Shabbetianism into just a bump on the road to self - perpetuation .
Many adherents –by then certified Pods — continued to cling to The One , asserting that his conversion was a part of the Messianic scheme .
Paul Johnson writes in his ( philosemitic ) A History of the Jews that Nathan of Gaza was an outstanding example of a “ highly imaginative and dangerous Jewish archetype . ”
Like Marx and Freud , Johnson adds , Nathan could construct a system of explanations of events that was both highly plausible and sufficiently imprecise to accommodate new , contrary events .
And he could do it with tremendous conviction and aplomb . ( 2 )
We will look into the eerily similar role of Barack Obama ’s campaign manager , David Axelrod , in a later chapter .
But the talent for Body Snatching is found not only among Jews , for it is fundamental to phenomena such as mass advertising and pop culture , Islam and other forms of extreme religious fundamentalism , Fascism , Maoism , Peronism , and more .
Not to forget the Third Reich .
What can be said about Hitler ’s Germany that has not been said before ?
How could the country of Gutenberg , Goethe , Schiller , Mann , Bach , Beethoven , Kepler , Heisenberg , Bonhoeffer– and thousands more -- follow in ecstatic obedience to its doom and infamy an obvious , raving mad housepainter from Braunau ?
Only Podism can account for that .
One by one , your friends , your children , your wife , come home changed by an overwhelming force of propaganda they are unable to resist .
And then you are left alone , doubting your sanity or preparing to emigrate .
Just as we do now .
The Road from Meccania
Muslim fanatics and La Raza are easy .
But the difficulty facing us versus the Pods is enormous .
Because these are not space aliens but neighbors , wives and children .
And they are not only on the identifiable left but also on the misidentified right , including such leaders of the right as George Bush and John McCain .
Readers of this website know about the attacks perpetrated on it by a section of the “ anti- jihadist ” blogosphere .
There is much credence as well given by ostensibly reasonable Americans to leftist propaganda about the “ extreme right ” European parties , while the latter are in fact a thin red line standing alone in the way of a nascent Eurabian Caliphate .
One can see Pod dementia even among libertarians , e.g. in this attack on two respected and scrupulous ethno - conservatives , slinging trope like “ white nationalist , ” “ racist , ” “ crackpot ” and “ nonsense . ”
Seeing that Eurabia and Multimerica may be merging into one ideological superstate , if not yet a formal one , naming it would be usefu so that it remains an easily identifiable concept .
A good name already exists in literature ’s archives .
It is the fictional Meccania – an oppressive police tyranny regimented and controlled by the government as much as errant garbage recyclers are monitored by CCTV cameras in the UK , cartoonists are kept in check by the PC compliance pashas of Eurabia , and unruly bananas are proscribed by EC Commission Regulation No 2257 / 94 .
The neat thing is that Gregory Owen ’s Meccania , the Super - State was published in 1918 .
And the other neat thing is that Meccania , probably attempting to conjure a mechanized society of the future , has the name Mecca in it .
Maybe it ’s time to start thinking about the common denominator of the besieged ones in Meccania , and develop a joint course of action .
Maybe Benjamin Franklin was right when he said that we must all hang together , or we shall all hang separately .
A European who cares about Europe ought to care about America or Australia .
Because when America goes , so does his freedom , whatever remains of it .
And if Australia goes , he has no place to go in case life in Eurabia has become untenable and Multiamerica slides into a 1984 scenario .
Conversely , a Flemamericanadian who writes a bestseller gloating over Europe ’s coasting toward the abyss , is not only blind to the provenance of all his mental furniture , but deaf to the gasping of his own , deeply wounded country .
Just as there is a Green Party everywhere – and that ’s a poster case for an association of Pods – why not a Nonpod Party everywhere ?
Nonpod may not be the right name , but we can come up with the right name .
The Peoples Party ( no apostrophe ) , perhaps .
The principle is to stand the Pods ’ agenda on its head : think locally , act globally -- with local manifestation .
And ultimately , perhaps , shrug Atlas ’ burden globally too , and leave the dhimmi-pods to their fate with the Ummah , the rappers and the rapists .

Advertisement Climate change is forcing humans and tigers in the Sunderbans delta of eastern India into closer contact - and attacks on people are on the rise .
The BBC's Chris Morris reports .
They are magnificent , but deadly .
Rarely seen , hidden in the jungles .
But now the Royal Bengal tigers which roam through the vast mangrove forests at the mouth of the river Ganges are coming into closer contact , and conflict , with humans .
" It all happened so quickly , " says Anar Ali Mullah , a fisherman who saw his neighbour Ahmad killed by a tiger just a few weeks ago .
" The tiger attacked with such force , " he said , gesturing to his neck , " Ahmad did n't stand a chance . "
Dozens of people are killed every year by tigers in the Sundarbans .
And local villagers say the number of attacks is increasing .
Fishermen , honey - gatherers and poachers who venture deep into the forest are particularly vulnerable .
' Afraid '
In the village of Jamespur , Seba Mridha is trying to get her life back together .
In May her house was destroyed by cyclone Aila .
And two months later her husband , Ramesh , was killed by a tiger .
" We 're all afraid of the tigers - in the forest they can kill us at any time , " Seba says , as she sits on a small tree trunk with her two young sons .
We 're all afraid of the tigers - in the forest they can kill us at any time
Seba Mridha
" Without my husband how will I live ?
How will I support these two children ?
I have nothing right now . "
In village after village across this vast waterscape you can hear the same story - tales of mourning , young widows , and real fear of the tiger .
The last official census in the Sundarbans , carried out in 2004 , suggested that there were 279 tigers in the forests .
Some experts dispute the figure and believe the true number is significantly lower .
Nevertheless , the Sundarbans remains one of the most important tiger habitats in the world .
And that 's why conservationists are working with local villagers who 've lived through tiger attacks , trying to persuade them that they need to preserve their whole eco-system if their way of life is to survive .
" Our basic message is if you save the tiger , the mangrove will be saved , and the mangrove will save you , " says Col Shakti Banerjee of the Wildlife Preservation Society of India .
" The mangrove always survives the worst storms .
It 's the best protection for the tigers and for the local people . "
Divine help Col Banerjee also points out that nearly all the attacks occur when humans enter the forests , not when tigers intrude into the villages .
But there 's little doubt that the two species have to co-exist in a shrinking space .
" Climate change is causing accelerated sea level rise and an increase in the salinity of the southern Sundarbans , " says Professor Pranabes Sanyal of Jadavpur University in Calcutta .
The villagers are seeking divine help " That in turn is causing the migration of the tigers from the southern islands towards the north , close to the human habitation .
That 's why we have this man-animal confrontation - and the confrontation is increasing . "
So the villagers of the Sundarbans turn to their local goddess Bonbibi ( Lady of the Forest ) .
In tiny thatched roof shrines , Hindus and Muslims alike pray to the goddess for protection , before they venture back into the forest .
They know their environment is changing - and the effects are felt every day .
" It 's very scary , " admits Madhu Mondal as he prepares for another perilous journey on a small unprotected boat .
" Sometimes the tiger will drag the corpse away as well .
You 'll never find it .
That 's what happened to my father .
We went back later , but we never found his body . "
More than four million people live in the Sundarbans - it 's a precarious existence in an eco-system under threat .
But many people need to fish or gather honey to survive .
And they still depend on the wild , where the tiger lies in wait , hidden in the mangrove .

Chuck Norris is worried about climate change .
Not the environmental effects caused by rising temperatures — that phenomenon , he thinks , is a “ con game . ”
No , he ’s worried that Obama and other world leaders are using global warming as an excuse to create “ a one world order ” when they meet in Copenhagen next week .
That ’s what Norris argued on a recent appearance on Fox News ’ Your World with Neil Cavuto , warning that if the US signs on to a successor to the Kyoto Protocol , “ Our country as we know it now will no longer exist . ”
“ My big worry , is that we as a nation , if we start having to be obligated to other countries …
Like , in this conference they ’re going to try to take our money and send it to third world countries , because of since we spend so much oil , and these other countries have suffered , then we ’re going to give our money to these third world countries . ”
In his Townhall.com column , Norris has also called attention to the phrases in draft versions of the negotiating text indicating that climate negotiations are a stealth attempt to create a unified world government :
Phrases such as “ creation of new levels of cooperation , ” “ a shift in global investment patterns , ” “ adjust global economic growth patterns , ” “ integrated system of financial and technology transfer mechanisms , ” “ new agreed post - 2012 institutional arrangement and legal framework , ” “ new institutional arrangement will provide technical and financial support for developing countries , ” “ global fund , ” etc. , are messages that make one wonder how far this political body ’s arm would reach into our country and force our hands into others .
All this leads Norris to the inevitable conclusion : “ Now , if that is n’t one powerful intergovernmental or global - governmental group overseeing and manipulating America ’s and others ’ economic and political conditions , I do n’t know what is . ”
Video below the jump :
There are 0 , but due to inflation and I think you mean US dollars , each bill is getting more and more worthless as the years pass .
However , here are COUNTRIES that amount to $ 1,000,000,000 and over ( in order of wealth ) :
USA , Japan , China , Germany , UK , France , Russia , Italy , Brazil , Canada , India , Mexico , Australia , and South Korea .
Those 14 countries are the ELITE of world economy .
However , a better answer would have JAPAN as # 1 because the US has a 13 trillion dollar debt ( it is still growing ) .
Even though it has a 14 trillion dollar economy , 14 - 13=1 , so the USA technically has only a 1 trillion dollar economy , placing it next to S. Korea .
Listen man , that 's not how it works .
The external debt is not something that is substracted from the economy of a country , its like if you have 10 dollars and you owe someone 5 .
You still have 10 dollars , until you pay .
The United States is in a pretty bad economic situation , how ever , it is by far , and will be for the next 30 years , the biggest economy in the world , there 's no looking two ways at it .
In Vietnam there are at least 13 people worth more than trillion dong
In Korea there are 15 people worth more than trillion won http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/83/Korea-rich-10_South-Koreas-40-Richest_Rank.HTML
Jajajaja , sorry to inform you the richest man in the world is Carlos Slim , lives in Mexico City and is worth 53 billion .
Also , that Forbes page does not exist .
What you should look at is the forbes list of Billionaires .
The richest billionaire is worth 53 billion , a trillion is 1,000 billion .
BRUSSELS --
In the weeks leading up to the Copenhagen climate conference , countries from China to Singapore have pledged cuts to their greenhouse - gas emissions .
One question still lurks unanswered :
Who is going to pay for it ?
Cutting carbon costs money .
Factories must be retrofit and industries must be prodded to buy more - expensive green technology ....
Critics have called alien epic Avatar a version of Dances With Wolves because it 's about a white guy going native and becoming a great leader .
But Avatar is just the latest scifi rehash of an old white guilt fantasy .
Spoilers ...
Advertisement
Whether Avatar is racist is a matter for debate .
Regardless of where you come down on that question , it 's undeniable that the film - like alien apartheid flick District 9 , released earlier this year - is emphatically a fantasy about race .
Specifically , it 's a fantasy about race told from the point of view of white people .
Avatar and scifi films like it give us the opportunity to answer the question :
What do white people fantasize about when they fantasize about racial identity ?
Avatar imaginatively revisits the crime scene of white America 's foundational act of genocide , in which entire native tribes and civilizations were wiped out by European immigrants to the American continent .
In the film , a group of soldiers and scientists have set up shop on the verdant moon Pandora , whose landscapes look like a cross between Northern California 's redwood cathedrals and Brazil 's tropical rainforest .
The moon 's inhabitants , the Na'vi , are blue , catlike versions of native people :
They wear feathers in their hair , worship nature gods , paint their faces for war , use bows and arrows , and live in tribes .
Watching the movie , there is really no mistake that these are alien versions of stereotypical native peoples that we 've seen in Hollywood movies for decades .
Advertisement
And Pandora is clearly supposed to be the rich , beautiful land America could still be if white people had n't paved it over with concrete and strip malls .
In Avatar , our white hero Jake Sully ( sully - get it ? ) explains that Earth is basically a war - torn wasteland with no greenery or natural resources left .
The humans started to colonize Pandora in order to mine a mineral called unobtainium that can serve as a mega - energy source .
But a few of these humans do n't want to crush the natives with tanks and bombs , so they wire their brains into the bodies of Na'vi avatars and try to win the natives ' trust .
Jake is one of the team of avatar pilots , and he discovers to his surprise that he loves his life as a Na'vi warrior far more than he ever did his life as a human marine .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Jake is so enchanted that he gives up on carrying out his mission , which is to persuade the Na'vi to relocate from their " home tree , " where the humans want to mine the unobtanium .
Instead , he focuses on becoming a great warrior who rides giant birds and falls in love with the chief 's daughter .
When the inevitable happens and the marines arrive to burn down the Na'vi 's home tree , Jake switches sides .
With the help of a few human renegades , he maintains a link with his avatar body in order to lead the Na'vi against the human invaders .
Not only has he been assimilated into the native people 's culture , but he has become their leader .
Advertisement
This is a classic scenario you 've seen in non-scifi epics from Dances With Wolves to The Last Samurai , where a white guy manages to get himself accepted into a closed society of people of color and eventually becomes its most awesome member .
But it 's also , as I indicated earlier , very similar in some ways to District 9 .
In that film , our ( anti ) hero Wikus is trying to relocate a shantytown of aliens to a region far outside Johannesburg .
When he 's accidentally squirted with fluid from an alien technology , he begins turning into one of the aliens against his will .
Deformed and cast out of human society , Wikus reluctantly helps one of the aliens to launch their stalled ship and seek help from their home planet .
If we think of Avatar and its ilk as white fantasies about race , what kinds of patterns do we see emerging in these fantasies ?
Advertisement
In both Avatar and District 9 , humans are the cause of alien oppression and distress .
Then , a white man who was one of the oppressors switches sides at the last minute , assimilating into the alien culture and becoming its savior .
This is also the basic story of Dune , where a member of the white royalty flees his posh palace on the planet Dune to become leader of the worm - riding native Fremen ( the worm - riding rite of passage has an analog in Avatar , where Jake proves his manhood by riding a giant bird ) .
An interesting tweak on this story can be seen in 1980s flick Enemy Mine , where a white man ( Dennis Quaid ) and the alien he 's been battling ( Louis Gossett Jr. ) are stranded on a hostile planet together for years .
Eventually they become best friends , and when the alien dies , the human raises the alien 's child as his own .
When humans arrive on the planet and try to enslave the alien child , he lays down his life to rescue it .
His loyalties to an alien have become stronger than to his own species .
These are movies about white guilt .
Our main white characters realize that they are complicit in a system which is destroying aliens , AKA people of color - their cultures , their habitats , and their populations .
The whites realize this when they begin to assimilate into the " alien " cultures and see things from a new perspective .
To purge their overwhelming sense of guilt , they switch sides , become " race traitors , " and fight against their old comrades .
But then they go beyond assimilation and become leaders of the people they once oppressed .
This is the essence of the white guilt fantasy , laid bare .
It 's not just a wish to be absolved of the crimes whites have committed against people of color ; it 's not just a wish to join the side of moral justice in battle .
It 's a wish to lead people of color from the inside rather than from the ( oppressive , white ) outside .
Advertisement
Think of it this way .
Avatar is a fantasy about ceasing to be white , giving up the old human meatsack to join the blue people , but never losing white privilege .
Jake never really knows what it 's like to be a Na'vi because he always has the option to switch back into human mode .
Interestingly , Wikus in District 9 learns a very different lesson .
He 's becoming alien and he can't go back .
He has no other choice but to live in the slums and eat catfood .
And guess what ?
He really hates it .
He helps his alien buddy to escape Earth solely because he 's hoping the guy will come back in a few years with a " cure " for his alienness .
When whites fantasize about becoming other races , it 's only fun if they can blithely ignore the fundamental experience of being an oppressed racial group .
Which is that you are oppressed , and nobody will let you be a leader of anything .
Advertisement
This is not a message anybody wants to hear , least of all the white people who are creating and consuming these fantasies .
Afro-Canadian scifi writer Nalo Hopkinson recently told the Boston Globe :
In the US , to talk about race is to be seen as racist .
You become the problem because you bring up the problem .
So you find people who are hesitant to talk about it .
Advertisement
She adds that the main mythic story you find in science fiction , generally written by whites , " is going to a foreign culture and colonizing it . "
Sure , Avatar goes a little bit beyond the basic colonizing story .
We are told in no uncertain terms that it 's wrong to colonize the lands of native people .
Our hero chooses to join the Na'vi rather than abide the racist culture of his own people .
But it is nevertheless a story that revisits the same old tropes of colonization .
Whites still get to be leaders of the natives - just in a kinder , gentler way than they would have in an old Flash Gordon flick or in Edgar Rice Burroughs '
Mars novels .
Advertisement
When will whites stop making these movies and start thinking about race in a new way ?
First , we 'll need to stop thinking that white people are the most " relatable " characters in stories .
As one blogger put it :
By the end of the film you 're left wondering why the film needed the Jake Sully character at all .
The film could have done just as well by focusing on an actual Na'vi native who comes into contact with crazy humans who have no respect for the environment .
I can just see the explanation : " Well , we need someone ( an avatar ) for the audience to connect with .
A normal guy will work better than these tall blue people . "
However , this is the type of thinking that molds all leads as white male characters ( blank slates for the audience to project themselves upon ) unless your name is Will Smith .
Advertisement
But more than that , whites need to rethink their fantasies about race .
Whites need to stop remaking the white guilt story , which is a sneaky way of turning every story about people of color into a story about being white .
Speaking as a white person , I do n't need to hear more about my own racial experience .
I 'd like to watch some movies about people of color ( ahem , aliens ) , from the perspective of that group , without injecting a random white ( erm , human ) character to explain everything to me .
Science fiction is exciting because it promises to show the world and the universe from perspectives radically unlike what we 've seen before .
But until white people stop making movies like Avatar , I fear that I 'm doomed to see the same old story again and again .

The official Web site for the band Kiss has re-printed my review of the band 's show Tuesday night at Jobing.com Arena in Glendale .
That 's not a big deal ; bands do it all the time .
What is a little shady , however , is the way they edited it .
Turns out they removed anything remotely negative about Tuesday 's concert on their " Kiss Alive 35 " U.S. tour .
Then , to add insult to injury , they posted my review with others under the hilariously labeled link " Even the Critics Love Today 's Kiss . "
For the record , I did not love that show .
New Times , but they did it without asking ( and we signed nothing agreeing that the review would be used on their site ) and they lamely did n't link back to our music blog , where someone might have discovered my true feelings on the show .
So , again , I generally liked the concert .
But it was my third time seeing Kiss since their reformation in makeup in 1996 , so I discovered few surprises and I was underwhelmed by the two new songs inserted into the tried - and - true setlist of mostly ' 70s - era classics .
I probably would n't have paid money to see Kiss this time around , but given the opportunity to review them for work , I jumped at the chance .
How did this happen ?
I 'm not sure , exactly .
They credited me , photographer Luke Holwerda , and , but they did it without asking ( and we signed nothing agreeing that the review would be used on their site ) and they lamely did n't link back to our music blog , where someone might have discovered my true feelings on the show .
Much of the review was positive :
The band ( especially with Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer replacing Peter Criss and Ace Frehley on drums and lead guitar , respectively ) was tight and energetic , Gene Simmons ' voice was as strong as its ever sounded , the stage show was no less an unabashed spectacle than it was in the band 's late - '70s heyday , and the setlist gave the people what they wanted : " Strutter , " " Detroit Rock City , " " Shout It Out Loud , " " Deuce , " " Cold Gin , " " Rock and Roll All Nite , " and on and on .
Major improvements in KGet and continued work on Shaman2
Filed under : December 22 , 2009 , 2:02 pmFiled under : KDE
Hey !
Again it ’s been a long time since my last blog post .
The main reason for this was me being busy with a lot of stuff …
First of all , let ’s talk about KGet …
There has been a whole bunch of work on it in the last months , including the merge of Matthias ’ great work during SoC , a kget - krunner ( thanks to
Tomas Van Verrewegen ) , a lot of feature development and even more bugfixing …
Get it , test it and , most importantly : report bugs !
The other project I ’m currently busy with is Shaman2 .
Dario wrote a long blog post about it already , so I wo n’t say too much .
Just one thing :
It ’s awesome …
Expect it to be rockin out quite soon … 🙂
I hope I ’ll have some more time to keep you updated in the future …
So far ,

The issue of who should pay towards care is disputed by the councils Orkney Islands Council has been criticised for stopping payments to the foster parents of a seriously ill six - year - old boy .
At the High Court in London , a judge said the decision was a triumph for budgets but a catastrophe for carers .
The boy , whose identity is protected by law , is from Orkney but now lives with his carers in Cambridgeshire .
The judge said the boy , who has serious heart problems , had been disowned by the state in its local authority form .
The boy , Child I , was born with a heart condition on Orkney in August 2003 but his parents were unable to look after him and he is now cared for by a couple in Cambridgeshire .
They could be forgiven for feeling abandoned to care for a child disowned by the state in its local authority form
Mr Justice Hedley
At first Orkney Islands Council offered the foster parents financial assistance but now say that will be withdrawn and Cambridgeshire County Council should take over , but the judge said they had " adamantly refused to become involved " .
In a statement lodged on their behalf , Orkney Isles Council ( OIC ) stated : " It is the view of OIC that ' I ' has been habitually resident in England since 2005 .
The responsibility and rights of his parents are likely to be governed by English law . "
In his judgment Mr Justice Hedley said : " If this position is justifiable legally ( as to which I am not convinced ) it is of course a huge triumph for OIC 's budget manager but a complete catastrophe for any foster parent unwise enough to rely on the word of this local authority . "
The judge also noted a long - running dispute between the foster couple , Mr and Mrs O , and Cambridgeshire County Council over child I 's education .
He added : " They could be forgiven for feeling abandoned to care for a child disowned by the state in its local authority form and they could be forgiven too if the thought ever entered their minds as to why they had taken on this child in the first place . "
' Poison fruit '
At one stage the judge said he was so shocked by the case that he had adjourned proceedings to ensure no " wholly improper judicial observations " escaped his lips .
He added that the couple had been " stuck with the poison fruit of these two local authorities ' dispute " .
He said : " This judgment has been reserved not because the issues are difficult ( they are not ) but because I did not trust myself to express my views in a temperate manner . "
We are well aware of this family 's predicament and we will support them in every way we can
Cambridgeshire County Council
The couple needed an official report to apply in the High Court for a Special Guardianship Order ( SGO ) and both Orkney and Cambridgeshire had refused to fund this .
Mr Justice Hedley said when the application was made to him for an SGO there was no report , the child was ill again and the couple were dividing their time between hospital , their other three children and their business .
The judge ordered Cambridgeshire to provide the report .
He said that might provide " some slight relief " to the couple but did not help with their main concerns over continuing financial support .
In an unusual move , the judge has made his comments public and ordered that copies were sent to government ministers in London and Edinburgh .
A spokesman for Cambridgeshire County Council said : " We are well aware of this family 's predicament and we will support them in every way we can .
" But as the judge 's ruling makes clear , there was a legal issue here which needed to be resolved and he has referred this issue to the English and Scottish governments for their consideration . "
He added the council shared the judge 's " disappointment " that Orkney Island Council " reneged on its commitment to fund this family " , which was made in 2008 .
Orkney Islands Council said : " The Hon Justice Hedley ruled that the responsibility for carrying out the assessment rests with Cambridgeshire County Council .
" This was and remains the position taken by Orkney Islands Council from the outset . "

Hi Everyone !
For my first blog post , I talked about what it ’s like to get “ the call ” that your work is going to be published .
What a lot of people do n’t realize is that once the euphoria of selling your novel wears off , the real work starts .
See , a publisher does n’t take the book and just print it .
You ’ll go through many , many steps .
I thought it would be fun to walk you through the process .
Step 1 : Revisions .
Your editor — the person who works for the publisher who read your book , loved it , and convinced a lot of other people that they should purchase it — will write you a revision letter .
It may be two pages , it may be twelve pages .
I ’ve had both .
And actually , the longer ones are sometimes easier !
Some editors will talk about the issues and the possible solutions , while other editors will just say “ fix this . ”
So what ’s in a revision letter ?
Well , they might talk about how Character A feels sort of flat , or they might say Chapter 4 serves no purpose and should be cut , or they might say the pace at the end goes way too fast .
They might say they want you to change it from third person to first , or they might ask you to drop a subplot .
In other words , they can ask for just about anything !
Generally , you ’ll have 1 - 2 months to revise your novel and send it back to your editor .
Then you wait , bite all your nails into little stubs , and cross all your fingers .
If you ’re lucky , you nailed your revisions and you move to the next step .
Some people are n’t so lucky .
Some people may do two or three rounds of revisions .
Step 2 : Line edits .
Next , you ’ll receive your manuscript either via email or snail mail , and it ’ll be marked up like crazy .
You ’ll cut paragraphs , clarify others with a few extra words tossed in here and there , fix punctuation , etc .
If your editor uses track changes in Microsoft Word , this is an easy round .
If it ’s hard copy , then it ’s kind of annoying and time consuming .
You generally have 2 - 4 weeks to do Line edits , but sometimes you have far less .
For my August 2010 book , YOU WISH , I had 24 hours .
Luckily they were electronic and I did them in about an hour .
Step 3 : Copy Edits .
Up until now , you ’ve worked exclusively with your editor .
But for copy edits , you ’ll have a new person going through your manuscript — the copy editor .
A copy editor is someone who specializes in knowing exactly how sentences should be structured , words should be used , etc .
They ’ll point out if you misuse a semi-colon where there should be a colon , if you ’re supposed to capitalize a proper noun , or if your sentence is missing a verb .
This stage is the scariest sometimes , because they have all kinds of symbols and short - hand and you might not understand everything .
The difference with your copy edits and your regular edits is that these changes are made for you , and then you have to approve them .
You are allowed to write “ stet ” next to things you want to keep as it was before copyedits , and they ’ll undo what the copyeditor changed .
Step 4 : First Pass Pages , or FPP :
This is the final proof read .
You ’ve made it through revisions , line edits and copy edits , so now you ’re just proof reading !
The fun part is that usually your FPP ’s are “ typeset ” — that means they have formatted it to appear exactly as it will in your book .
As an author , you often get cool little surprises — For PRADA & PREJUDICE , the chapter headings had these fun , whimsical swirls .
For Cyn Balog ’s SLEEPLESS , she discovered her chapter headings either had a crescent moon or a flower , to emulate the cover .
Step 5 : ARCs .
Advance Review Copies are sent to the printer somewhere after Step 2 … but you often do n’t have them in hand until the end of the process .
ARCs are a scary time — it means that the book is being sent out to reviewers .
It also probably means no one has read it yet and you ’re terrified it ’s going to be torn apart soon .
But it ’s also a THRILLING part of the process because it ’s the first time you hold your book .
I admit , I read mine cover to cover .
It ’s the first time in the process that you realize your little manuscript is truly becoming a BOOK .
Step 6 : Finished Books .
Anywhere from a month to a day before your book goes on sale , you ’ll get a box of them on your doorstep .
And they will be beautiful . 🙂
Hope it all makes sense !
If you have questions , post them in the comments and I ’ll try to answer them .

What I ’m reading now : BEAUTIFUL by Amy Reed .
Blood Diamonds Are Back
It ’s a safe bet that most of those surprised with diamond jewelry over the holidays did not pause long , if at all , to consider where their new gemstones came from .
" Santa ’s elves " is a good enough answer for most people , and even those who are aware that some diamonds have been known to come from African war zones may not have given the matter much thought this year .
" Conflict diamonds , " also known as " blood diamonds , " are rough stones mined at gunpoint by slaves and prisoners for the enrichment of those holding the weapons .
They were a cause célèbre at the beginning of the decade , when human rights groups exposed the role of diamonds in conflicts in Sierra Leone and Angola , but in recent years the issue has largely fallen off the radar of socially conscious western consumers .
That ’s not because the situation has improved .
The sordid business of blood diamonds was believed to have ended with the adoption in 2003 of the Kimberley Process , a UN - sanctioned agreement between 75 countries that import and export diamonds , diamond industry leaders and nongovernmental organizations .
Its mission is to certify that diamonds on sale at the corner jeweler did not arrive there at the expense of murdered and mutilated Africans .
When controversy was stoked anew in 2006 with the Leonardo DiCaprio movie Blood Diamond , the industry simply pointed to the existence of the Kimberley Process to convince moviegoers that conflict diamonds were an old problem that had already been solved .
Unfortunately , that ’s not the case .
In theory , all countries that are signatory to the Kimberley Process agree not to import or export conflict diamonds ; the origins of the diamonds are " verified " through a set of simple - sounding procedures .
Producing countries export their diamonds in tamper - proof packages accompanied by a certificate guaranteeing that the stones did not come from conflict zones ( this assumes that robust internal controls exist in producing countries ) .
The Kimberley Process monitors compliance through peer reviews , statistical analysis and site visits ; countries found to be in violation of the agreement can be expelled or suspended , meaning they can no longer export their diamonds to any of the agreement ’s member countries .
The reality is different .
According to recent reports by NGOs , including Global Witness , Partnership Africa Canada and Human Rights Watch , blood diamonds are still circulating freely and smuggling remains rampant .
Some of the worst countries in the diamond business , such as Sierra Leone , Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo , ca n’t account for where as many as 50 percent of the diamonds they export originate , making their status as clean gems highly questionable .
Meanwhile , Cote d’Ivoire , the only country considered to be the source of " official " conflict diamonds due to rebel control of its northern diamond mines , has expanded its production since it was placed under UN sanction in 2004 , meaning the rebels are finding willing markets for them somewhere .
Not only does the Kimberley Process in its present form seem powerless to stop conflict diamonds , but its policies may even be encouraging the illegal trade to flourish .
" A lot of governments have been happy to use the Kimberley Process as a fig leaf of respectability , so they can say , ‘ OK , look we ’re doing something , ’ " says Elly Harrowell of Global Witness , one of the NGOs that first raised the issue of conflict diamonds a decade ago .
" A lot of people , especially in the public , seem to think it ’s case closed . "
Zimbabwe provides the perfect illustration of the problem the Kimberley Process was created to address , as well as the difficulties in fulfilling that mandate .
Since 2006 , when diamonds were discovered in Zimbabwe ’s eastern Marange fields , the country ’s police and military have engaged in systematic human rights abuses for their personal enrichment .
According to an investigation earlier this year by Human Rights Watch , rotating garrisons of soldiers order civilians to dig diamonds at gunpoint .
Miners are beaten , women are raped , and children are forced into labor .
To secure the diamond fields and clear them of unlicensed independent diggers ( who , according to the report , were initially encouraged by President Robert Mugabe ’s government to help themselves to the stones ) , the military conducted a scorched earth operation that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians .
The diamonds are smuggled into neighboring Mozambique and onward to other countries where they can be exported under the cover of a Kimberley Process certificate , meaning they are then perfectly clean in the eyes of the world .
Both Human Rights Watch and a Kimberley Process investigative team that visited Zimbabwe in July considered the situation a clear violation of the agreement .
Both recommended the country be suspended .
Instead , it was given a grace period to clean up its act .
Rather than addressing a serious problem , this response from Kimberley Process administrators laid bare the system ’s weaknesses .
Primary among them is a lack of political will to punish a country that condones violence and smuggling within its diamond industry .
Such a failure is not only a massive blow to its credibility , but puts the entire process in jeopardy .
If there are no consequences to violating the Kimberley Process , what incentives do other nations have to comply ?
Nicky Oppenheimer , the chairman of De Beers , the world ’s largest diamond company , wrote diplomatically in a Bloomberg op - ed last week that he would have preferred more " decisive action " on Zimbabwe from the Kimberley Process : " Providing confidence about where these special symbols that mark moments in our lives come from , is integral to their enduring value . "
Even former supporters of the Kimberley Process have become critics .
" The whole point of the Kimberley Process was to make sure that diamonds were clean , that they ’re not hurting people , " says Ian Smillie , the former director of the NGO Partnership Africa Canada , which is credited as one of the driving forces behind the establishment of the Kimberley Process .
" When you see serious human rights abuses taking place in diamond fields then surely it ’s a no - brainer [ that something is wrong ] . "
Despite the criticism , there is widespread agreement that Kimberley can – and must – be fixed .
NGOs are calling for the inclusion of a human rights provision to address problems like those in Zimbabwe .
They want to do away with the consensus decision - making process in which it ’s possible for a single vote to veto important changes .
And they ’ve suggested the creation of a secretariat to provide independent oversight of reports and statistical analysis .
All eyes are on the incoming Kimberley Process chairman from Israel to tackle these challenges .
Meanwhile , other groups , including Human Rights Watch , are focusing on the one group that has so far been capable of spurring change : consumers .
Last month the organization called for a boycott of Zimbabwean diamonds .
It was the threat of a boycott that inspired Kimberley ’s creation in the first place , and such threats still strike fear into the heart of the diamond industry .
As Jon Elliott , Human Rights Watch ’s Africa advocacy director , explains : " We ’re not naïve enough to think we ’re going to solve the problem overnight but we do think that unless there is pressure from consumers through the industry supply channels , we ’re not going to make significant progress .
For his part , Smillie seem less hopeful .
He resigned from the Kimberley Process in May in frustration over what he called the system ’s " collective impotence . "
In his letter of resignation , he wrote : " There is a basic truth : when regulators fail to regulate , the systems they were designed to protect collapse …
In this case , the diamond industry , which means so much to so many , is being ill served by what has become a complacent and almost completely ineffectual Kimberley Process . "
Until changes are made , holiday buyers beware .
Ready to chuck his electric bills , Camarillo resident Marc Weinberg last year asked his homeowners association for permission to put solar panels on his roof .
When the Spanish Hills Homeowners Assn. said no , Weinberg sued the group .
Under the state ’s Solar Rights
Act , he argued , a homeowners association can’t unreasonably block solar installations .
Weinberg won , and the Spanish Hills Homeowners Assn. was ordered to not only permit the solar panels but to cover the tens of thousands of dollars that Weinberg had spent on legal fees .
Since last fall , when he installed a double row of matte black panels , three other homes in the hilltop neighborhood of luxury estates have added panels .
“ We did n’t set out to be green activists , ” said Weinberg , 39 , a real estate attorney .
“ That ’s not where we ’re coming from .
We honestly looked at it from a financial standpoint . ”

Whether motivated by pocketbook or environmentalism , similar battles between homeowners groups and property owners are cropping up across the state as the installation of solar systems becomes more affordable and utility costs rise .
Homeowners boards insist that they are protecting property values by enforcing rules that govern everything from paint color to how early trash bins can be set out for collection .
But residents say their right to invest in alternative energy trumps the sensibilities of neighbors who do n’t like how the panels look .
Results of the battles have been mixed even as the nation is being urged by the Obama administration to embrace alternative energy .
Santa Clarita homeowner Marty Griffin put solar panels up anyway after his homeowners association rejected his application .
The Tesoro Del Valle Homeowners Assn. sued him , and in early November a jury told Griffin the panels should be moved to a more discreet spot on his property .

Solar installer Bradley Bartz earlier this year threatened a Palos Verdes commun - ity group with legal action after it denied three clients permits to install solar panels .
He filed a claim against the city of Torrance after it rejected another client ’s application .
In all four cases , Bartz said , he prevailed .
Homeowners ’ main defense is the Solar Rights Act , adopted by California in 1978 to protect consumers ’ right to install solar energy technology .
The law makes it difficult for homeowners groups to reject solar energy equipment unless it creates a safety hazard or a modification can be made without great cost .
Now , solar advocates are pushing for a federal version of the California law .
Energy legislation that moved through the House earlier this year included a provision that would make it illegal for HOA rules , leases or private contracts to prohibit the installation of solar systems .
It ’s uncertain whether the Senate will keep the language in its version of the bill , said Raymond Walker , a government affairs spokesman for Standard Renewable Energy , a Houston - based solar installer .
As debate continues , solar industry advocates are forming a lobbying group to make sure their voices are heard , Walker said .

Industry officials say fewer regulatory hassles would speed the growth of jobs and move the nation closer to energy independence , he said .
“ We want to make this into a real industry , and we ’re trying to make sure the regulatory landscape is clear so this can take off , ” he said .
Homeowner and commun- ity groups have n’t taken a position on the bill yet .
Commun - ity Associations Institute , an education and advocacy group based in Alexandria , Va. , said such “ green issues ” arise regularly in the estimated 300,000 community groups nationwide .
The institute advises striking a balance between conservation and aesthetics , said spokesman Frank Rathbun .

Advocates say those who invest in alternative energy should be applauded instead of punished .
They ultimately benefit ratepayers by reducing demand on the state ’s grid , said Adam Browning of Vote Solar , a San Francisco - based nonprofit that promotes the use of solar energy .
“ It ’s somebody doing their part to reduce peak load , ” Browning said .
“ That ’s the most expensive electricity utilities have to buy . ”
California two years ago launched a $ 3.3 - billion effort to increase the use of solar statewide , offering rebates and tax credits to consumers who install energy systems .
Since then , the number of homes and businesses with installed solar has more than doubled , growing from 23,000 in 2006 to 52,700 , according to the California Public Utilities Commission .
The cost of small solar systems declined 9 % in the last year and larger installations have fallen 13 % , the PUC said in an October report .
Still , the state is far from being on track to its goal of adding 3,000 megawatts in solar panels by 2016 , sufficient to power 600,000 homes .

Property owners who install panels can sell excess energy back to the power companies for credit on their monthly bills .
Weinberg , the Camarillo resident , said he no longer pays electric bills that rose as high as $ 500 a month for his 3,000 - square - foot home during hot summer months .
He ’s already earned a $ 60 credit for sending excess energy to the state ’s grid , he said .
“ There is now a greater financial incentive for people to adopt this stuff , ” Weinberg said .
“ So I ’ve got to think there ’s more incentive to fight . ”
The heightened activity has produced more battles , not just in California but across the nation .
A Woodbury , Minn. , man was reportedly denied permission to install solar panels on his roof because his homeowners association found them too obtrusive .
Advertisement
In Somerset County , N.J. , a homeowner was reportedly ordered to remove 28 installed panels .
In Avondale , Ariz. , retiree Hank Speak has been fighting for more than six years to keep his solar equipment .
Arguing that the panels were ugly , his homeowners group imposed huge fines .
But last year , an Arizona judge ruled that the association ’s restrictions were contrary to the state ’s support of solar power .
Walker , the Houston solar installer spokesman , estimates that his firm has lost $ 2 million in jobs this year because homeowners groups have blocked installations in several of the states where the company operates .
Several states , including California , Arizona , Colorado and Florida , have laws that prevent homeowner groups from imposing too many restrictions .
But as the California cases demonstrate , homeowners sometimes have to fight for their rights .
Advertisement
Weinberg took on his homeowners group , he said , because the law appeared to be clearly on his side , he said .
The Spanish Hills Homeowners Assn. wanted him to move the panels from the front of his house to the back .
But that orientation would have caused him to lose about 40 % efficiency , a violation of the act , he said .
Griffin , the Santa Clarita homeowner , said he installed his panels without his homeowners group ’s permission because it was taking too long to respond .
His attorney , Michael Ribons , said delay is often a tactic .
“ Homeowners associations stall , they say they want more information , ” Ribons said .
“ But everyone knows it ’s all about looks . ”
The jury ’s finding that Griffin should relocate some of the panels to a newly built platform would cost him about $ 8,000 , Ribons said .

Bartz , who ’s run ABC Solar in Rancho Palos Verdes since 2000 , said he regularly runs up against homeowner association boards -- and even city planning departments -- that throw up roadblocks .
They usually back down once they learn about the Solar Rights Act , Bartz said .
“ Some homeowners groups are just unaware , ” he said .
“ But they also like their control . ”
The community board for the Palos Verdes homes rejected the permits because the proposed solar panels were blue , Bartz said .
“ They wanted it black .
It just was arbitrary , ” he said .
“ I do n’t care how they feel .
I know every time the meter spins backwards , I feel good . ”

Dec. 28 , 2009  --
A singed pair of underwear with a packet of powder sewn into the crotch , seen in government photos obtained exclusively by ABC News , is all that remains of al Qaeda 's attempt to down an American passenger plane over Detroit .
As seen in these photos , the alleged bomb consisted of a packet of powder sewn into the briefs of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a 23 - year - old Nigerian .
Al Qaeda took credit Monday for the attempted bombing , boasted of its ability to overcome U.S. intelligence and airport security , and promised new attacks .
The first photo , to the left , shows the slightly charred underpants with the bomb packet still in place .
All photos include a ruler to provide scale .
The bomb packet is a six - inch long container of the high - explosive chemical PETN , less than a half cup in volume , weighing about 80 grams .
In the second photo ( right ) , the packet of explosive powder has been removed from the underpants and displayed separately .
A government test with 50 grams of PETN blew a hole in the side of an airliner .
That was the amount in the bomb carried by the so - called shoe bomber Richard Reid over Christmas 2001 .
The underpants bomb would have been one and a half times as powerful .
Acid in Syringe Was Detonator
The packet of PETN explosive powder is shown separately here .
Tragedy was averted only because the detonator , acid in a syringe , did not work .
" It 's very clear it came very , very close , " said Rep. Pete Hoekstra , R. - Mich. , ranking minority member of the House Intelligence Committee .
" The explosive device went off , but it became an incendiary device instead of an explosive device , which is probably what saved that airplane . "
The acid in the melted plastic syringe , pictured below , caused a fire but did not make proper contact with the PETN .
Abdulmutallab told FBI agents he received the bomb from and was trained by al Qaeda in Yemen over the last few months .
In a web posting today , the al Qaeda group displayed a picture of Abdulmutallab , calling him a hero who " overcame legendary American intelligence which showed its fragility , putting its nose in the ground , using all of what they spent in new security techniques against them . "
The al Qaeda group in Yemen has been calling for attacks against the U.S. for months .
Two of its four top leaders were U.S. prisoners at Guantanamo until November , 2007 when they were turned over to Saudi Arabia and then set free after supposedly being rehabilitated .
Now U.S. officials say these men have shown they pose a much greater operational threat than al Qaeda in Pakistan or Afghanistan .
Richard Clarke : Yemen is the new Afghanistan .
It is the new sanctuary , the new al Qaeda base where people from around the world , who want to be trained are sent .
No longer to Afghanistan , but to Yemen . a
In its statement today , the al Qaeda group said the attempt to bring down the jet was retaliation for U.S. air strikes in Yemen .
But those air strikes took place on December 17 , and Abdulmutallab 's mission was already underway then as he bought his ticket to Detroit on Dec. 16 .

Geek obsession :
The novels and short stories of Philip K. Dick
Why it ’s daunting : Science fiction and fantasy get a lot of mileage out of taking their readers to new worlds , but most classic genre fiction is really about making new worlds seem like home .
The Lord Of The Rings would lose a lot of its appeal if the hobbits had no Shire to return to , and Isaac Asimov ’s Foundation series would n’t be nearly as effective if the heroes were n’t bent on protecting a sane , prosperous status quo .
Philip K . Dick does n’t play by the same rules .
While his work has clear genre roots , using such familiar tropes as androids , time travel , precognition , and space travel , he operates by a surreal common sense that ’s simultaneously lucid and fever - dream absurd .
In 36 novels and more than 120 stories , he used fiction to work out his own particular philosophy , and the results are n’t always immediately accessible .
Or , to put it better :
Anyone can read anything by PKD , but approaching him with the wrong expectations — as in , expecting a traditional narrative when he offers something far more bizarre and mind - warping — could lead to disgruntlement .
Advertisement
And then there are the adaptations .
Dick ’s novels and short fiction have inspired a handful of cult films , including Paul Verhoeven ’s Total Recall and , most famously , Ridley Scott ’s Blade Runner .
As usual in the process of adaptation , however , the filmmaker ’s vision ends up as the final word , so “ We Can Remember It For You Wholesale ” ’s trippy comedy turns into a series of excuses for Verhoeven ’s hyper - stylized action setpieces , and the philosophical questing in Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep ?
is dumbed down in favor of Scott ’s poetic imagery .
The disconnect between source and screen is sharp enough to cause whiplash .
Possible gateway : “ The Minority Report , ” a short story first published in 1956
Why :
Of course , disconnection is n’t always a bad thing .
Steven Spielberg ’s 2002 film version of Dick ’s story is n’t bad ; the special effects hold up nicely , and the dark subtext and performances ( particularly Samantha Morton ’s ) are a trip .
But it ’s far from perfect , and the movie ’s compromised mixture of sharp topical criticism and popular sentiment do n’t always work .
Thankfully , the plot is compelling enough to make the original version worth seeking out .
Dick ’s short fiction is by and large more pulpy and accessible than his novels , and “ The Minority Report ” is no exception .
It ’s a fast , exciting read where the weirder undercurrents do n’t really become obvious till the end .
Advertisement
Movie and story share the same basic hook :
In the future , police are able to use a trio of psychic mutants to predict the future and arrest potential murderers before any crime is committed .
Things seem to be running smoothly until the head of the Pre -Crime unit , Anderton , gets a slip from the precogs stating that he ’s going to murder someone he ’s never met .
Anderton goes on the run , believing himself innocent of even the potential of wrongdoing , and desperate to prove the system wrong , even though he ’s spent a large part of his career championing it .
It ’s impossible to get into the differences between the two versions without spoiling the plot of either , but suffice to say , they go in different directions , and PKD ’s story is n’t driven by Spielberg ’s essentially humanist , free - choice perspective .
Which is n’t to say that Dick is entirely down on humans ; more that his concept of what makes a person is n’t as easy to pin down in blockbuster terms .
“ Minority Report ” takes the concept of precognitive insight to its natural conclusions , and the end result is satisfying intellectually and emotionally , and unsettling in a way that ca n’t be exactly described .
Advertisement
Next steps : While “ The Minority Report ” was published on its own in a nifty - looking special edition , it ’s also collected in Selected Stories Of Philip K. Dick , which has a terrific cross-section of Dick ’s shorter fiction , and is essential for new fans .
But great as the stories are , Dick ’s novels really mark his place in literary history .
Generally only a couple hundred pages each , they bring the oddities hiding in the background of something like “ Paycheck ” right up to the surface .
The Man In The High Castle is easier to describe than most :
It ’s a parallel - history novel that has the successful assassination of President Roosevelt bringing about a Nazi victory .
Narratives follow a handful of characters trying to survive in the former United States , now split between Japan and Germany .
Even with its generally straightforward concept , High Castle still features Dick ’s obsessions with divine intervention ( characters try and interpret their fate using the I Ching , a classical Chinese text ) and displaced realities .
Dick ’s protagonists ( and his characters in general ) can sometimes be difficult to relate to , given the way their motivations and actions are obscured to the point of apparent randomness ; there ’s a logic to the choices people make in his work , but it ’s the kind of logic that resists easy identification .
That said , A Scanner Darkly ( adapted into a not - terrible movie by Richard Linklater in 2006 ) is easily his most personal , most emotionally accessible novel .
Dick takes a series of anecdotes about his and his friends ’ experiences in drug culture and cloaks them in a mild science - fiction spin , charting the gradual dissolution of Bob Arctor , Substance D addict and federal narcotics agent .
Scanner is n’t as driving as Dick ’s other work , but it has a cumulative , mournful power , and it serves as a brief glimpse into the sadness that haunts the rest of his writing .
Advertisement
Past those two , everything ’s fair game .
It only gets weirder , though .
Books like Ubik , The Three Stigmata Of Palmer Eldritch , Valis , and Flow My Tears , The Policeman Said are down - the - rabbit - hole madness , jam - packed with religious imagery , sudden left turns , and protagonists who are n’t so much heroes as the only lunatics in the asylum with the right meds .
They ’re also a blast , because no matter how dense the symbolism gets , Dick never loses his sense of humor or pacing , and even when the surprises become expected , they never lose their power .
Where not to start : Valis and The Three Stigmata Of Palmer Eldritch are essential — and extremely bizarre .
It helps to have a good grounding in PKD ’s major themes before wading into either .

A recent Bill Moyers program on PBS played audio tapes of Johnson on which he could be heard telling Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , “ Not a damn human thinks that 50,000 or 100,000 or 150,000 [ American troops ] are going to end that war . ”
McNamara replies , “ That ’s right . ”
Nothing like those sentiments were conveyed to the public as Johnson and McNamara jacked up the draft and started feeding young American boys and men into the Vietnam meat grinder .
Afghanistan is not Vietnam .
There was every reason for American forces to invade Afghanistan in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
But that war was botched and lost by the Bush crowd , and Barack Obama does not have a magic wand now to make it all better .
The word is that Mr. Obama will tell the public Tuesday that he is sending another 30,000 or so troops to Afghanistan .
And while it is reported that he has some strategy in mind for eventually turning the fight over to the ragtag and less - than - energetic Afghan military , it ’s clear that U.S. forces will be engaged for years to come , perhaps many years .
The tougher choice for the president would have been to tell the public that the U.S. is a nation faced with terrible troubles here at home and that it is time to begin winding down a war that veered wildly off track years ago .
But that would have taken great political courage .
It would have left Mr. Obama vulnerable to the charge of being weak , of cutting and running , of betraying the troops who have already served .
The Republicans would have a field day with that scenario .
Lyndon Johnson is heard on the tapes telling Senator Richard Russell , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , about a comment made by a Texas rancher in the days leading up to the buildup in Vietnam .
The rancher had told Johnson that the public would forgive the president “ for everything except being weak . ”
Russell said : “ Well , there ’s a lot in that .
There ’s a whole lot in that . ”
We still have n’t learned to recognize real strength , which is why it so often seems that the easier choice for a president is to keep the troops marching off to war .
Only one man seems to have ever been cured of AIDS , a patient who also had leukemia .
To treat the leukemia , he received a bone marrow transplant in Berlin from a donor who , as luck would have it , was naturally immune to the AIDS virus .
If that natural mutation could be mimicked in human blood cells , patients could be endowed with immunity to the deadly virus .
But there is no effective way of making precise alterations in human DNA .
That may be about to change , if a powerful new technique for editing the genetic text proves to be safe and effective .
At the University of Pennsylvania , Dr. Carl June and colleagues have used the technique to disrupt a gene in patients ’
T cells , the type attacked by the AIDS virus .
They have then infused those cells back into the body .
A clinical trial is now under way to see if the treated cells will reconstitute a patient ’s immune system and defeat the virus .
The technique , which depends on natural agents called zinc fingers , may revive the lagging fortunes of gene therapy because it overcomes the inability to insert new genes at a chosen site .
Other researchers plan to use the zinc finger technique to provide genetic treatments for diseases like bubble - boy disease , hemophilia and sickle - cell anemia .
Anthony Sowell appeared in court under tight security
A convicted sex offender living in an Ohio house where several bodies have been found has been denied bail .
Anthony Sowell was charged with five counts of aggravated murder on Tuesday .
Judge Ronald Adrine refused bail because of the " macabre nature " of Mr Sowell 's crimes , who is also facing rape , assault and kidnapping charges .
Prosecutor Brian Murphy told the judge Mr Sowell , 50 , was " an incredibly dangerous threat to the public " .
Anthony Sowell appeared in court briefly , represented by a court - appointed defense lawyer , Kathleen DeMetz .
She argued her client should be granted bail because of a heart condition which forced him to wear a pacemaker .
The court appearance came a day after police said they had possibly found another four bodies and a skull on the property .

The bodies of six African - American women where found there last week .
Coroners have ruled five of them were strangled .
Police Chief Michael McGrath said the latest bodies were found buried in the back garden of the house , in the city of Cleveland , and the skull was in a bucket in the basement .
Addressing a news conference , he said detectives were searching the home and backyard for further evidence .
" It appears that this man has an insatiable appetite that he had to fill , " Mr McGrath said .
The BBC's North America correspondent Matthew Price says the nondescript wooden house on a residential street is slowly giving up its secrets .
Our correspondent says people living nearby held a vigil outside the house this week , in memory of those found so far .
Some clutched photographs of women who have gone missing from the area in recent years .
Mr Sowell - who spent 15 years in prison after being convicted of attempted rape - was arrested on Saturday not far from his home .
5 Nov , 2009 : An earlier version of this story stated that Anthony Sowell had been convicted of a 1989 rape .
He was in fact convicted of attempted rape , and served 15 years in prison .
Iran Is No Existential Threat
After months of halfhearted , fruitless attempts at engagement , the United States and its European partners are effectively re-enacting George W. Bush ’s Iran policy .
In 2006 , after Iran had ended a nearly two - year voluntary suspension of uranium enrichment , then - U.S. president pushed the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to send Iran ’s nuclear file to the U.N. Security Council , which duly imposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic .
But the sanctions did not prove " crippling , " as Bush had hoped : Iran continued to expand its nuclear infrastructure , and the risks of a military confrontation between the United States and Iran climbed .
Unfortunately , Barack Obama ’s administration has decided to repeat this sorry history .
Last Friday , the IAEA passed a resolution urging Iran to send most of its current stockpile of low - enriched uranium abroad .
It also reported Iran once again to the Security Council .
Iran has wasted no time in upping the ante rather than backing down , saying it would restrict cooperation with the IAEA only to those measures " statutorily " required .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad also announced that the Islamic Republic would build 10 new enrichment facilities in coming years .
He later added , " Iran will produce fuel enriched to a level of 20 percent , " the level required for Iran ’s research reactor in Tehran .
This would be well above the 3 to 4 percent level that Iran has already achieved in producing low - enriched uranium and would take Iran closer to the 90 percent - plus level required for weapons - grade fissile material .
These developments again demonstrate the counterproductive futility of enshrining uranium enrichment and sanctions as the keys to resolving the nuclear issue .
By prompting Tehran to reduce cooperation with the IAEA , the United States and its European partners have done real damage to the international community ’s ability to monitor the state of Iran ’s nuclear program .
More broadly , U.S. , British , and French insistence on " zero enrichment " in Iran makes successful nuclear diplomacy with Tehran impossible .
At this point , there is no chance that Tehran will accept " zero enrichment " as a negotiated outcome , for at least two reasons :
It is a country - specific formulation applied to Iran but not to anybody else , and it requires Iran to forswear its sovereign right to the full range of civil nuclear technology .
If the United States and its partners continue on their present course , the Islamic Republic will continue to expand its nuclear infrastructure , and the risks of an eventual military confrontation between the United States ( or Israel , with U.S. support ) and Iran will , once again , rise inexorably .
There is no set of sanctions the Security Council might plausibly authorize that would change this reality , and various unilateral and secondary sanctions initiatives moving through the U.S. Congress will not work either .
A more constructive approach would seek to maximize international monitoring of Iran ’s nuclear activities by emphasizing country - neutral formulations for curbing nuclear proliferation in the Middle East .
This would require international acceptance of enrichment on Iranian soil .
Getting Iran to ratify and implement the Additional Protocol to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty would be an important step in this direction , but the most effective country - neutral initiative would be the establishment of a nuclear weapons - free zone ( NWFZ ) in the region .
Although talk of an NWFZ — or , more broadly , a weapons of mass destruction - free zone ( WMDFZ ) — in the Middle East is not new , serious consideration of these ideas in U.S. foreign policy circles always stops as soon as Israel ’s nuclear status comes up .
For years , the Israeli position has been that , once Arab - Israeli peace is achieved , it might become possible for Israel to join in creating an NWFZ / WMDFZ in the region .
Although American foreign - policy elites typically take this position at face value , it deserves a higher degree of critical scrutiny .
It is simply not analytically credible to describe the unresolved Palestinian , Syrian , and Lebanese tracks of the Middle East peace process as " existential threats " to Israel .
The 1978 Egypt - Israel Camp David accords effectively dispelled the prospect of Arab armies uniting to " push the Jews into the sea . "
Similarly , there is no amount of additional armed capabilities that would allow Palestinian and Lebanese militants to destroy Israel without also destroying the populations they are ostensibly seeking to liberate .
More recently , the dominant Israeli discourse about Iran has routinely characterized an Islamic Republic with a nuclear " breakout " capability — not to mention actual nuclear weapons — as an " existential threat " to Israel .
( Both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak have reiterated Israel ’s position that Iran ’s full suspension of uranium enrichment is the only acceptable outcome from nuclear talks with Tehran . )
But this position , too , does not stand up to rigorous scrutiny .
It is not analytically serious to describe an Iran with mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle as an existential threat to Israel or any other state .
Even if Iran were to fabricate a nuclear weapon , it is not credible to describe that as an existential threat to Israel — unless one has such a distorted view of Shiite Islam that one believes the Islamic Republic is so focused on damaging " the Zionist entity " that it is collectively willing to become history ’s first " suicide nation . "
Rhetoric from senior officials and politicians characterizing Iran as an existential threat resonates with the Israeli public , for understandable historical reasons , and Ahmadinejad ’s statements questioning the Holocaust only reinforce Israeli fears .
As a result , there is , effectively , no political debate in Israel about Iran policy .
But , when Israeli politicians and policymakers use politically effective rhetoric about Iran ’s nuclear development being an existential threat to Israel , what is really motivating them ?
Fundamentally , Israel ’s political and policy elites are focused on eliminating Iran ’s fuel - cycle capabilities in order to preserve a regional balance of power that is strongly tilted in Israel ’s favor .
Regional perceptions that the Islamic Republic had achieved a " breakout " capability would begin to chip away at Israel ’s long - standing nuclear - weapons monopoly .
That , in turn , might begin to constrain Israel ’s currently unconstrained freedom of unilateral military action .
One can readily appreciate why Israel values its status as the Middle East ’s military hegemon and wants to maintain the maximum possible room for unilateral military initiative .
But that strategic preference is not legitimated by the U.N. Charter , the laws of war , or any international convention .
Moreover , Israel ’s strategic preference for preserving and enhancing its military hegemony does not , at this point , serve the cause of regional stability or containing the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities in the Middle East .
The United States has an abiding commitment to Israel ’s survival and security .
But that commitment should not be confused with maintaining Israel ’s military hegemony over the region in perpetuity , by continuing to allow U.S. assurances of an Israeli " qualitative edge " for defensive purposes to be twisted into assurances of maximum freedom for Israel to conduct offensive military operations at will against any regional target .
It is time for the United States and its international partners to get serious about creating a regionwide framework for controlling WMD capabilities in the Middle East , including the full range of Israel ’s WMD capabilities , to create a more secure environment for all Middle Eastern states .
Obama ’s observation , in his June 4 Cairo speech , that no single country should determine which other countries are permitted to have particular types of weapons , could be a positive first step in this direction .
But , if he does not follow up purposefully , this will become one more good Obama idea that ends up disappointing the expectations it initially raised .
A 20 - year - old tourism student has been expelled from a Sao Paulo university after chaos broke out on campus when she turned up in a short dress .
The photos above show Geisy Arruda sitting in class at Bandeirante University ( Uniban ) on October 22 .
So outraged by her outfit , her classmates took photos of her to post online .
When she left the class , a group of boys started following and taunting her .
One student is heard shouting " Shout at her people ! "
The situation escalated to such a point that the police were called to escort her from the premises in a professor 's white coat .
As she 's being led out , the crowd chants " Puta ! " ( whore ) repeatedly .
The incident was filmed by several students on mobile phones ; who then posted the footage on YouTube .
Amateur images compiled by TV IG .
On November 8 Arruda 's university placed a public notice ( below ) in Sunday newspapers .
Entitled " Educational Responsibility " , the ad explained that Geisy Arruda had been expelled for disrespecting " ethical principles , academic dignity and morality " .
It also said that the university would be temporarily suspending some of the students seen heckling the 20 - year - old in the videos .
The decision has caused outrage across the country .
Both the national student union and Brazil 's top official for women 's policy , Nilcea Freire , have publicly condemned it .
UPDATE ( 11.11.09 - 9.30 am ) : Arruda was officially readmitted to the university in a statement made on Nov. 10 by vice chancellor Ellis Brown .
The location of her class will have to be changed however to make her return " more relaxed " , he said .
С наступлением эры широкой автомобилизации населения , всё больше людей начинают озабочиваться о своём здоровье .
Ведь пользование машинами отучает людей от двигательной активности , мышцы ног и рук не получают должного развития .
Такое положение дел можно с выгодой использовать для организации собственного бизнеса – продажи велосипедов и сопутствующих аксессуаров , которые можно найти , зайдя сюда .
В отличие от других специализированных магазинов , где нужны специальные стеллажи и стенды , а также достаточно просторные помещения , велосипедный магазин можно открыть при минимуме затрат .
Для этого нужен всего лишь небольшой склад и открытая площадка .
Позже можно расширить помещение и обзавестись необходимыми стендами и прилавками .
Всё это делает велосипедный магазин достаточно выгодным для вложений с коротким сроком окупаемости инвестиций .
С чего начать бизнес по продаже велосипедо в
Любое дело начинается с составления бизнес - проекта .
В нём бизнесмен старается досконально расписать свои предстоящие действия и подсчитать расходы .
Финансовая составляющая является основной частью любого проекта .
Затем начинается практическая часть выполнения задуманного плана .
Во-первых , следует подобрать подходящее помещение .
Если есть возможность , то его нужно искать всегда ближе к центру населённого пункта , или возле постоянного нахождения большого скопления людей .
Для начала можно ограничиться помещением в пятьдесят или сто квадратных метров , с небольшой смотровой площадкой перед зданием и складом для хранения товара .
Во-вторых , нужно будет определиться с закупкой и ассортиментом товара .
Лучшим вариантом в этом случае считается работа с производителем или крупным оптовиком , дающим товар под реализацию .
В таком случае высвобождаются средства на другие неотложные нужды .
Далее , нужно будет набрать штат сотрудников .
Кроме продавца потребуется работник , занимающийся сборкой велосипедов , так как товар приходит в магазин в разобранном виде .
Ещё может потребоваться уборщица и администратор .
Хотя , на первых порах , все должности могут совмещаться одним или двумя сотрудниками .
Ни одно стоящее дело не может обойтись без рекламы .
Для этого стоит задействовать все информационные ресурсы , начиная от броской оригинальной вывески и заканчивая размещением на листовках в видных местах .
Нельзя обойтись также без рекламы на радио , телевидение и интернете .
Для успешного продвижения бизнеса нужно использовать различные маркетинговые хода , так любимые нашими гражданами .
Это могут быть различные акции , розыгрыши , подарки .
Чтобы не простаивал рабочий , нанятый на сборку велосипедов , можно при магазине организовать небольшую мастерскую по обслуживанию и ремонту велотехники .
Очень хорошо продаются сопутствующие аксессуары – налокотники , наколенники , шлемы и другие подобные вещи .
В дальнейшем можно расширить ассортимент за счёт самокатов , роликовых досок , снегокатов и сноубордов , тем самым перейти на круглогодичные продажи товаров .

Rating : 5 stars Dealing with egg whites as icing :
One reviewer said they do n't use merengue for the frosting because of a distaste for raw eggs .
I think a merengue frosting is necessary for this cake to be authentic -- the merengue lightens the texture and is less sweet and rich than whipped cream ( which is v. good also ) .
So -- the answer is to " cook " the merengue as in " Italian merengues . "
To do this , you just heat to liquify a sugar syrup , sugar & water .
Then you slowly pour this boiling syrup into the eggs whites while you are whipping them .
This cooks the whites , but they still look like white , fluffy clouds .

This recipe is great .
I make it in a 9x13 dish .
When I take it out of the oven .
I take a knife and skim off the skin( light brown part ) while it is hot .
While it is still warm pour your milk mixture over no need to poke holes put in fridge overnight .
This cake gets better the longer it sits .
I do n't use merginue .
Sometimes I use 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and I cup of milk .
I love it this way .

This recipe makes a very nice tres leche cake .
As a variation try coconut milk as one of the three milks and then garnish the cake with seasonal fresh fruit and toasted coconut .
However what is really special about this recipe is the cake part .
It is easy to make avoids butter fat grams and can be used in a number of different desserts like trifle or all by itself .
The ingredients are staples in most kitchens so it can be made spur of the moment .
Thank you .

So delicious !
I used a 9x13 pan and when I poured in the first batch of batter it seemed too little .
I doubled the recipe for the cake itself and kept the " syrup " recipe the same .
I would do this again because the cake ended up just as tall as a regular boxed cake mix and there was not an excess of syrup .
I will difinitely make this one again !

I put together a Cinco de Mayo dinner and it was a wonderful ending to a fabulous evening .
This is what I did after reading some of the reviews : I added a few wholes in the cooled cake before pouring the ' 3 milk ' filling onto it and I also browned my meringue .
Thanks for the recipe . :)

Rating : 4 stars I tried it straight out of the oven after I poured the milks on it and really did not like it at all - but the next day after it sat in the fridge all night it tasted fantastic and my fiancee just loved it !
It was kind of spongy and I was n't sure if it was I beat the eggs too much or if it was suppose to be like that .
I frosted it with whipping cream .
I also noticed on another recipie that they added 1/3 cup milk and I wonder what that difference makes ?
If anyone know please post on the site or email me .
Thanks !

One of the women at the center of the David Letterman alleged extortion case is Stephanie Birkitt , his former assistant -- according to the search warrant obtained by FOX 5 New York .
And , the warrant says , Birkitt was the suspect 's girlfriend and we 've learned she was living with him until recently .
According to the warrant , the suspect , " 48 Hours " producer Robert " Joe " Halderman , sent Letterman a package which allegedly included treatments for a screenplay with supporting materials .
The warrant goes on to say the " supporting materials " included copies of parts of a diary and correspondence belonging to Birkitt .
Halderman allegedly sent more documents , including letters , emails and photos .
On September 23 , Halderman allegedly told undercover cops he would n't make the diary public if Letterman anted up $ 2 million .
Letterman acknowledged on his show last night he had sexual relations with female members of his staff .
Birkett has been a regular on Letterman 's show ( see video ) .
By Sean Trende - December 22 , 2009
Both sides of the blogosphere are lately consumed with trying to figure out how the Senate health care bill might still be derailed .
Mainstream news outlets are joining in , trying to keep the drama from the health care debate ( and accompanying pageview spike ) going by publishing stories with ominous titles like " Health Plans On A Collision Course . "
In particular , there 's been speculation that the House might kill Obamacare .
On paper , this is true ; indeed on paper the House probably should kill the Senate bill .
But in reality , this seems exceedingly unlikely .
I will admit that predicting the future has proven difficult on this bill .
In particular , if you had told most pundits , including yours truly , that Senator Nelson of Nebraska would accept the compromise that pushed the bill past 60 votes , those pundits , including yours truly , probably would have laughed at you .
The vote is completely at odds with Nelson 's history as a politician - he was elected Governor of Nebraska in 1990 by running to the right of incumbent Republican Governor Kay Orr , and spent his time in office by doing very un-Democratic things , even for a conservative Democrat , like cutting taxes and trimming worker 's compensation .
Take this personal background , add in the fact that Nelson probably holds the reddest Senate seat in the country for a Democrat by an order of magnitude ( when looking at a state top - to - bottom ) , toss in the fact that the bill probably has a 20 - 30 % favorability rating in Nebraska , and the vote is all - but inexplicable on paper .
It is almost a declaration of retirement for the Senator .
In the end , though , I think this seeming irrationality holds the key to understanding why the bill is exceedingly unlikely to fail .
Let 's start by examining the arguments for why the Senate bill might fail in the House .
In early November , the House barely passed its version of ObamaCare , 220 - 215 .
This , at least in theory , provides the baseline for the bill going forward .
One Republican , Jospeh Cao ( whose district leans Democratic by about 25 points ) reportedly said that he would not be the deciding vote for the bill , so realistically we 're dealing with a 219 - 216 split .
On January 3 , Representative Robert Wexler will resign , and his seat wo n't be filled for another four months .
That puts the bill at 218 - 216 .
Rep. Neil Abercrombie will be resigning sometime in January to pursue his run for Governor , but has committed to staying until this bill passes .
If there 's a tie vote on a bill , it dies .
So if Democrats lose one vote , the bill dies .
On paper , this should almost certainly happen .
Remember , the House is a fundamentally different institution than the Senate .
People focus on the relative conservatism of the Senate ( though this is n't , as some have argued , intrinsic to the Senate ; in the 1960s it was the more liberal institution ) and its arcane procedural maneuvers like the filibuster and holds .
But it is also less ideologically diverse .
This is because House seats are relatively small when compared to Senate seats and are reconfigured once every decade ( twice if you live in Texas and Georgia ) , so it 's easier to end up with a district that is almost all black , or heavily liberal , or really , really conservative .
In addition to your standard - issue Republicans and Democrats , the House has true libertarians , New Deal Democrats , former black panthers , and Zell Miller conservatives .
The Senate has none of these .
That means that you actually have more interests to satisfy in the House than you do in the Senate .
With that background , let 's start with John McCormack 's vote count from The Weekly Standard .
He notes that last November House Majority Whip James Clyburn stated that Democrats were 6 - to - 8 votes shy of passage without Stupak language prohibiting federal funding of abortions .
That language no longer exists in the Senate version .
Certainly Stupak wo n't be voting for a Stupak - less health care bill .
While I do n't really think everyone on McCormack 's list of members who signed the letter to Pelosi pledging to oppose a Stupak - less bill is a deep enough prolifer to kill the bill , Stupak , Daniel Lipinski , Paul Kanjorski , Dale Kildee , and probably Solomon Ortiz and James Oberstar ( and maybe Murtha ) all have histories that make them unlikely converts .
These Democrats are the vestiges of the white ethnic arm of the New Deal coalition in Congress ; there are n't enough left of these voters left to send anyone fitting that description to the Senate ( except supposedly Casey ) but you can still find them in the House .
The bill should therefore already be dead before we even start talking about the left .
There we have 60 House Democrats who previously signed a letter to Nancy Pelosi pledging to vote against a bill without a public option , again missing from the bill .
Remember , in the Senate there were three Democrats who were wavering on a bill that did n't include a public option : Sanders , Feingold and Burris .
We can look at Keith Poole 's ideological rankings of Congress ( for those who want me to be precise , I 'm using DW - NOMINATE common - space scores ) , and see that in the 110th Congress ( they have n't done the 111th yet ) , Feingold and Sanders are the two most liberal Democrats .
This is where things get interesting .
There are two House Democrats to Feingold 's left ( Barbara Lee and John Conyers ) and there are forty - one House Democrats to Bernie Sanders ' left .
This includes most of the members who pledged to vote against a public option - less bill .
The balance are mostly just to Sanders ' right .
Again , the difference between the bodies is crucial here ; Berkeley does n't get a Senate seat , but it gets a House seat ; the same is true of Compton , Amherst , Austin , and Greenwich Village .
Given Sanders ' and Feingold 's obvious discomfort with the bill and the bill 's unpopularity on the left , this means that these members are probably at least contemplating a " no " vote .
This is probably doubly true of a member like Marcy Kaptur , who pledged to vote against a public option - less , Stupak - less bill .
These are the big - ticket items , and between them we should expect at least one Democrat to break ranks .
Indeed , one big reason that the House actually might kill the bill is that the liberals and pro-lifers in the House can find strength in numbers , while those in the Senate can't .
There are only two or three theoretically pro-life Democratic Senators : Nelson , Casey and Reid .
There are several dozen in the House .
And there are only a couple of Senators on the left fringe ; there are 41 Representatives to the left of a declared Socialist .
No one wanted to be known as the member who killed health care ; Reid was able to pick Senators off one - by - one until Nelson was the last man standing ; it is harder to do that in the House .
And of course , there are myriad other potential problems .
The left wing of the House caucus does n't like the Nelson language on abortion either , the progressives are n't excited about taxing union health benefits rather than the rich , the Hispanic caucus does n't like language restricting illegal immigrants ' ability to purchase health insurance on the exchanges .
Oh , and the bill is about 7 - to - 8 points less popular than it was in early November .
So why do I think this bill will survive ?
To begin , very few of the progressives are likely to kill the bill , just as , at the end of the day , Feingold , Sanders and Burris all voted for the bill .
The impending retirements of Congressmen Tanner , Gordon , and Baird have probably given Pelosi a few extra votes to play with .
Moreover , a public option - less bill gives some of the less conservative " noes " some cover to vote yes ; Democrats like Adler ( NJ - 3 ) , Boccieri ( OH - 16 ) , Davis ( AL - 07 ) , and Teague ( AZ - 05 ) come to mind .
This could offset losses among the progressive caucus .
I 'm also guessing that there were ten - to - fifteen Democrats who voted " no " who were available for the Speaker if she really needed them , or wanted them badly enough .
Given the buy - offs of Senators Nelson , Sanders and Landrieu , it is pretty clear that no price is too high for the leadership and the White House .
If Congressman X's life desire is to be King of Zamunda , we can expect to see a pro-US coup there the next day , with Congressman X installed shortly as King .
What we saw in the Senate confirms what we already suspect to be true :
Most votes in the House and Senate are for sale if the price is high enough ( please note that this is not restricted to the Democrats ; see House Republicans ' handling of the Prescription Drug Benefit ) .
But at the end of the day , Ben Nelson 's vote is the real reason I can't imagine the bill failing in the House .
As I noted above , his Senate vote makes little political sense .
On paper there is no reason that he should be at " yes . "
It is a potentially career - ending vote that is n't supported by his constituents , and that , judging by his statements on Stupak and overall voting record , he does n't either .
And unlike Blanche Lincoln , he 's not facing a potential primary challenge from the left .
But Democrats seem to have made the collective decision that , for better or for worse , their fate lies with Barack Obama succeeding with his legislative agenda .
I think this is a gross miscalculation , but it is n't entirely irrational either .
Look at it this way :
If nothing gets done in the next year , the Democrats are almost certainly in deep trouble in 2010 .
If the bill passes and Obama 's popularity continues to sag , the Democrats are potentially ( probably , in my estimation ) in even deeper trouble .
Their only hope for a good outcome is that the bill passes , and Obama somehow convinces the nation over the course of the next year that it was a good thing , that unemployment declines substantially , and that his popularity rises .
This is n't particularly likely , but it is the only path that offers some hope of survival for Democrats in marginal seats .
To paraphrase Obama , if Obama is unpopular , the Republicans are coming after Democrats either way .
Their only hope for Obama to become popular is probably to keep passing things and hope the economy turns around .
And Nelson can afford to wait until 2012 for this to happen .
At the end of the day , I think the only way the bill dies is this : Seeing Nelson as weak , Progressives dig in during the conference , win a concession on funding , immigration , or abortion , and convince the leadership to dare Nelson again to be the one who killed health care ( I do n't think they will do this on the public option , because then they will have to gamble that Nelson , Lieberman , Landrieu and Lincoln all vote for the bill ) .
Nelson might do just that , but given the events of the weekend , I think it 's far more like that we 'll soon see his face on the coinage of Zamunda .
NAIROBI , Kenya  Somali pirates have struck again , seizing an oil tanker loaded with $ 150 million in crude that was headed from Saudi Arabia to the United States , naval authorities said Monday .
According to European naval reports , nine pirates hijacked the tanker and its crew of about 30 about 800 miles offshore and headed back toward pirate havens along the coast of central Somalia .
The Somali pirate business appears to be back in full swing after a brief lull this summer that some attributed to increased naval patrols but that may have had more to do with the monsoon season .
Now that the seas are calm , the pirates have resumed operations , acting with even greater sophistication .
“ They have definitely increased their capacity and their ability to stay out at sea for longer , ” said Cyrus Mody , manager of the International Maritime Bureau in London .
The pirates  many of them penniless former fishermen from Somalia ’s war zones  appear to be positioning themselves in the middle of the ocean on mother ships and then , for attacks , deploying on motorized dinghies , mere ants compared to the mammoth ships they capture .
The iPhone ’s familiar touch screen display uses capacitive sensing , where the proximity of a finger disrupts the electrical connection between sensors in the screen .
A competing approach , which uses embedded optical sensors to track the movement of the user ’s fingers , is just now coming to market .
But researchers at MIT ’s Media Lab have already figured out how to use such sensors to turn displays into giant lensless cameras .
On Dec. 19 at Siggraph Asia — a recent spinoff of Siggraph , the premier graphics research conference — the MIT team is presenting the first application of its work , a display that lets users manipulate on - screen images using hand gestures .
Many other researchers have been working on such gestural interfaces , which would , for example , allow computer users to drag windows around a screen simply by pointing at them and moving their fingers , or to rotate a virtual object through three dimensions with a flick of the wrist .
Some large - scale gestural interfaces have already been commercialized , such as those developed by the Media Lab ’s Hiroshi Ishii , whose work was the basis for the system that Tom Cruise ’s character uses in the movie Minority Report .
But “ those usually involve having a roomful of expensive cameras or wearing tracking tags on your fingers , ” says Matthew Hirsch , a PhD candidate at the Media Lab who , along with Media Lab professor Ramesh Raskar , research scientist Henry Holtzman and visiting researcher Douglas Lanman , developed the new display .
Some experimental systems — such as Microsoft ’s Natal — instead use small cameras embedded in a display to capture gestural information .
But because the cameras are offset from the center of the screen , they do n’t work well at short distances , and they ca n’t provide a seamless transition from gestural to touch screen interactions .
Cameras set far enough behind the screen can provide that transition , as they do in Microsoft ’s SecondLight , but they add to the display ’s thickness and require costly hardware to render the screen alternately transparent and opaque .
“ The goal with this is to be able to incorporate the gestural display into a thin LCD device ” — like a cell phone — “ and to be able to do it without wearing gloves or anything like that , ” Hirsch says .
The Media Lab system requires an array of liquid crystals , as in an ordinary LCD display , with an array of optical sensors right behind it .
The liquid crystals serve , in a sense , as a lens , displaying a black - and - white pattern that lets light through to the sensors .
But that pattern alternates so rapidly with whatever the LCD is otherwise displaying — the list of apps on a smart phone , for instance , or the virtual world of a video game — that the viewer never notices it .
The simplest way to explain how the system works , Lanman says , is to imagine that , instead of an LCD , an array of pinholes is placed in front of the sensors .
Light passing through each pinhole will strike a small block of sensors , producing a low - resolution image .
Since each pinhole image is taken from a slightly different position , all the images together provide a good deal of depth information about whatever lies before the screen .
An array of liquid crystals could simulate a sheet of pinholes simply by displaying a pattern in which , say , the central pixel in each 19 - by - 19 block of pixels is white ( transparent ) while all the others are black .
The problem with pinholes , Lanman explains , is that they allow very little light to reach the sensors , so they require exposure times that are too long to be practical .
So the LCD instead displays a pattern in which each 19 - by - 19 block is subdivided into a regular pattern of black - and - white rectangles of different sizes .
Since there are as many white squares as black , the blocks pass much more light .
The 19 - by - 19 blocks are all adjacent to each other , however , so the images they pass to the sensors overlap in a confusing jumble .
But the pattern of black - and - white squares allows the system to computationally disentangle the images , capturing the same depth information that a pinhole array would , but capturing it much more quickly .
LCDs with built - in optical sensors are so new that the Media Lab researchers have n’t been able to procure any yet , but they mocked up a display in the lab to test their approach .
Like some existing touch screen systems , the mockup uses a camera some distance from the screen to record the images that pass through the blocks of black - and - white squares .
But it provides a way to determine whether the algorithms that control the system would work in a real - world setting .
In experiments in the lab , the researchers showed that they could manipulate on - screen objects using hand gestures and move seamlessly between gestural control and ordinary touch screen interactions .
Of the current crop of experimental gestural interfaces , “ I like this one because it ’s really integrated into the display , ” says Paul Debevec , director of the Graphics Laboratory at the University of Southern California 's Institute for Creative Technologies , whose doctoral thesis led to the innovative visual effects in the movie The Matrix .
“ Everyone needs to have a display anyway .
And it is much better than just figuring out just where the fingertips are or a kind of motion - capture situation .
It ’s really a full three - dimensional image of the person ’s hand that ’s in front of the display . ”
Indeed , the researchers are already exploring the possibility of using the new system to turn the display into a high - resolution camera .
Instead of capturing low - resolution three - dimensional images , a different pattern of black - and - white squares could capture a two - dimensional image at a specific focal depth .
Since the resolution of that image would be proportional to the number of sensors embedded in the screen , it could be much higher than that of the images captured by a conventional webcam .
Raskar , who directs the Media Lab ’s Camera Culture Group , stresses that the work has even broader implications than simply converting displays into cameras .
In the history of computation , he says , “ intelligence moved from the mainframe to the desktop to the mobile device , and now it ’s moving into the screen . ”
The idea that “ every pixel has a computer behind it , ” he says , offers opportunities to reimagine how humans and computers interact .
“ It ’s kind of the hallmark of a lot of Ramesh ’s work , ” says Debevec .
“ He comes up with crazy cameras with the guts hanging out of them and strange arrangements of different mechanics in something that at first you ’re wondering , ‘ Well , why would you do that ? ’
No one quite does things the way that he does because no one else thinks the way he does .
Then you start to understand it and you realize that there ’s actually a very interesting new thing happening . ”
Our Pick : The # 1 PayPal Alternative & 3 Runners Up
Remember , these are just our TOP PICKS .
You can find a larger list of PayPal Alternatives HERE !
You many not agree as to what our top pick is -- you do n't have to agree .
Remember , what might not work for you , might work for somebody else and vice versa .
Picking what we think is the # 1 PayPal alternative out there today was a very tough choice to make .
The decision goes beyond what we liked and did n't like -- the decision is based on what we think users need in a service .
That being said , we could only pick from a limited amount of products and services .
While there are a lot of " PayPal alternatives " out there -- there are very few that are actually any good .
We had to take a close look at the ones that were good and put them to the test .
Screw - PayPal.com has already gone on record saying there is no service out there today that can match PayPal .
Why ?
The biggest reason is PayPal is allowed on eBay and many other good services are not .
Since the majority of people who use PayPal in some way use it for eBay , they need a way to be able to accept online payments and send online payments .
People also need a way to send and receive money to each other as well .
Therefore , we had to pick a service that was backed by a strong company , a service that could be used by as many persons as possible , have a strong brand name and brand recognition , a service that was flexible enough for users to customize it for their own purposes , a service that would allow sellers and buyers to receive and send online payments , and a service that would be able to expand its offerings and be a real viable competitor to PayPal .
Current potential was taken into account as much as FUTURE POTENTIAL .

Russia supplies about two billion cubic metres of gas to Armenia each year
Russia has temporarily halted gas supplies to Armenia after an explosive device was found near a pipeline , Russian news reports say .
A security official said exports via North Ossetia and Ingushetia were stopped and would not resume until the device was defused , Interfax reported .
Supplies to Georgia were not affected , a spokeswoman for Georgia 's Oil and Gas Corporation said .
The Ingushetia region has been the focus of attacks by Islamist rebels .
Militants have been battling pro-Kremlin authorities and Russian security forces in a low - level insurgency in Ingushetia and the Caucasus region for years .
Armenia receives about two billion cubic metres of gas a year from Russia via Georgia .
It is not known who was behind the planting of the device on the pipeline .
Disgraced former NBA referee Tim Donaghy , who was convicted of two charges related to betting on NBA games ( some of which he worked as an official ) , is out of prison , pimping a new book and telling his story to 60 Minutes and ESPN .
What he ’s saying , and who ’s backing him up , has to be giving NBA Commish David Stern a king - hell case of the nightsweats .
We ’ll stipulate up front that the witness has a credibility issue .
He is , after all , a convicted felon , and one guilty of betraying the trust of the players and pro hoop fans around the world .
Let ’s go a step further – he betrayed the trust of every athlete in America by fixing what ought to have been fair competitions .
Thanks to Donaghy , it ’s harder than ever to make the case for the integrity of sport ( at any level – and if you ’ve played any sport that involved an official , you know what I ’m talking about ) .
So before we get started , let ’s be clear : this post is n’t looking to canonize St. Tim of Donaghy .
This said , just because you ’re a crook does n’t mean that some ( or even most ) of what you say is n’t accurate .
And for many of us , the story Donaghy is telling has about it the uneasy ring of truth .
We might not buy the full - on conspiracy charges in their entirety ( and we probably should n’t ) , but the disconcerting thing about Donaghy ’s story is that we do n’t have to in order to conclude that the NBA is putting a compromised competition on the floor .
In the opening moments of his interview with ESPN ’s Mark Schwarz , Donaghy says that of all the pro sports in the US basketball is the easiest to manipulate because of the “ subjectivity of the calls . ”
He says that games are changed “ on a nightly basis , ” and he goes into significant detail about how certain officials let their like or dislike of particular players , coaches or even owners affect the calls they make on the floor .
The NBA , obviously , disputes every word of it .
Donaghy points to several specific players who do n’t get a fair shake and to at least one very specific instance – the treatment that Allen Iverson received after the league refused to suspend him for threatening an official – as examples .
Some of it makes sense , of course .
Refs are human , and when punks like Rasheed Wallace ( who has never committed a foul in his life ) are called out , you ’ll hear no complaints from me .
I ’ve officiated a variety of sports , including well over 1,000 games in soccer , and not only is it understandable that refs treat problem children differently , it ’s actually a good thing .
Some players work very hard to get over on the refs and their opponents unfairly , engaging in behavior that runs the gamut from the disruption caused by unnecessary bitching to faking injury to overtly dirty play that threatens the physical health of other competitors , so NBA analyst Kenny Smith is right on the money when he compares officiating to parenting : treating everybody fairly is n’t equal to treating everybody the same .
The problem arises when these tendencies ( and more extreme cases of bias , where an official calls things differently for some players simply because he or she does n’t like them ) lead to a predictable pattern of behavior that changes outcomes .
This is the part of what Donaghy has to say that ’s the most concerning .
In these interviews , Donaghy claims that inside knowledge allowed him to bet effectively .
Specifically , he says his track record of success in betting games in which he was not involved was between 70 and 80 % .
This is against the spread , remember , so we ’re not talking about betting good teams against bad ones .
This is 70 - 80 % on a level playing field .
If he knew who the teams were and who the refs were , his intimate knowledge of who hated who made it possible to predict outcomes with a ridiculous level of success .
The killing blow here ?
His claims are backed up by the lead FBI agent who investigated his case , which addresses the credibility issue we talked about above .
We do n’t have to take the word of a convicted felon – we have the word of Phillip Scala , a highly placed , experienced law enforcement professional who knows his away around corruption .
Let ’s be very clear here , then .
We are not talking about a simple “ refs are human ” problem .
That we can understand and accept .
What we ’re talking about instead is systematic , predictable , actionable bias .
We ’re talking about behavior that routinely changes the results of games in a knowable direction .
So ultimately Donaghy ’s crime was less about game fixing and more about … insider trading ?
And you ca n’t effectively trade on unreliable or nonexistent inside information , can you ?
What Donaghy says he did , and what the FBI confirms that he did , is real .
Earlier this year I wrote about the five sets of rules you find in NBA games :
1 : The official rules .
Somewhere the official laws of the game are written down .
No one knows why .
2 : The interpreted rules .
The official rules may say that X is a foul , but X can happen 45 times in a game and you never hear a whistle .
The refs all have interpretations of what the rules mean , so do n’t get hung up on what they say .
3 : The home team rules .
You get calls at home that you do n’t get on the road .
4 : Established star rules .
If you ’ve been in the league awhile – and especially if you ’re a marquee player – you get calls that rookies and journeymen and lesser beings do n’t get .
5 : Late in the game rules .
It may have been a class A felony in the first quarter , but all ’s fair in love , war and the last two minutes of the game .
After all , you have to let the players decide the game , not the refs .
It looks like I left one out :
The rules for players the refs do n’t like .
David Stern , the league establishment and the collected sports punditry that surrounds the game ( an assemblage of networks , writers , former player analysts and so on , all of who have some skin in the game and a powerful incentive to make sure that the public does n’t begin confusing the NBA with the WWE ) can preen and declaim and damn the messenger all they like .
But millions of people who watch the games are duly suspicious .
They know what they see , night and night out , and not all of them – not all of us – are mindless paranoid homers .
One of these days a squeaky clean NBA ref or league official , somebody who ’s disgusted by the arrogance behind the scenes , is going to step forward and confirm a lot of what Tim Donaghy is saying today .
On that day , the old argumentum ad hominem approach that comprises the entirety of the league ’s reaction at present is n’t going to work anymore .
And then the league is going to be facing a crisis 100 times worse than the Donaghy debacle .

" This issue is n't rocket science .
The American people are charged the highest prices in the world .
They want Congress to stand up for their interests and do something about it , " Mr. Dorgan said .
Pharmaceutical makers opposed the measure , saying the U.S. could n't ensure the safety of drugs from Canada , Europe , Japan and Australia .
Opponents cited a letter from the FDA 's commissioner that called the Dorgan amendment " logistically challenging " and risky to consumers .
Democrats and Republicans were divided on the issue , and at one point it threatened to hold up the larger health - overhaul package making its way through the Senate .
After the vote , Mr. Dorgan said , " The drug industry has a lot of clout in this town , and they demonstrated that tonight . "
He added , " This is not over . "
The politically charged amendment held up the Senate for a week as drug companies , the White House and lawmakers from states that are home to drug makers fought to derail the proposal .
Critics , including the Food and Drug Administration , said it would be difficult to implement and hard to guarantee that imported drugs would be safe .
Further adding to the momentum for final Senate approval of the massive healthcare bill , Obama and many liberal Democrats rallied behind the decision to put aside a goal liberals had long held as an article of faith -- a new government health insurance plan to compete with the private sector .
Obama summoned Senate Democrats to the White House today to urge them not to let disagreements over details of the legislation derail or delay the landmark effort .
" This reform has to pass on our watch , " the president said .
" We are on the precipice of an achievement that has eluded Congresses and presidents for decades . "
While some liberals mourned the capitulation that has long seemed inevitable , leaders of several progressive groups signaled that they would support the strategy for now rather than risk stalling their drive .
" The final bill wo n't include everything that everybody wants , " Obama said .
The president weighed in at a critical moment , as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) was working to unite their party in advance of key votes on the compromise that did not include the so - called " public option " -- a new government - run health insurance plan -- or an alternative plan to expand Medicare , which was popular with liberals .
The Senate voted late yesterday , taking up amendments to the health care bill sputtering through Congress as it sheds one ameliorative feature after another .
Before they got down to rejecting two amendments providing for the importation of foreign drugs , they passed a feel - good , symbolic resolution to protect middle class families from tax increases .
The only " no " vote was obsessive contrarian , feel - bad Senator Ben Nelson , who is elected by the people of Nebraska to represent the Insurance Industry .
That was quickly followed by the ritual Republican call for recommitting the bill ( killing it , something that is looking more and more attractive to grassroots Democrats these days , if not to the ruling class part of the party ) .
It was defeated 45 - 54 , every Republican plus Evan Bayh , Blanche Lincolln , Maria Cantwell , Ben Nelson and Amy Klobuchar voting to kill the bill .
By 6:45 pm , the first of the two drug importation bills , the one proposed by Byron Dorgan , came up for a vote .
It failed 51 - 48 with no apparent partisan lines drawn , neither by party nor faction .
Progressives like Sherrod Brown ( D - OH ) , Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) and Al Franken ( D - mn ) voted " yes , " along with knee - jerk obstructionist reactionaries like Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) , David Vitter ( R- LA ) , John McCain ( R - AZ ) , Jim DeMint ( R- SC ) , Blanche Lincoln ( D - AR ) and Miss McConnell ( R - KY ) .
At the same time , progressives like Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) , Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) and Roland Burris ( D - IL ) joined obstructionists and reactionaries like Evan Bayh ( D - IN ) , Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) , Jim Inhofe ( R - OK ) , Jim Bunning ( R - KY ) and Lieberman in opposition .
It 's odd to interpret a vote that splits Inhofe and Coburn , McConell and Bunning , Kyl and McCain .
Dorgan said Big PhRMA lobbyists were calling the shots for the two sides .
He 's right ; it was n't.
20 minutes later a drug re-importation amendment by New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberger came up for a vote , but that one also fell 4 votes short of passing , 56 - 43 .
The White House had made a deal with PhRMA for their backing of the overall plan , and defeating the amendments was something Obama was far more strenuously behind than , say , the Medicare buy - in or the public option , which he was nonchalant about tossing overboard at the first ripple of dischord .
Totally consistent with the Barack Obama who had served in the Senate voting with conservatives like Nelson , Lieberman and Lincoln far more than with progressives .

Critics say people could accidentally share too much information Digital rights groups and bloggers have heaped criticism on Facebook 's changed privacy policy .
Critics said the changes were unwelcome and " nudged " people towards sharing updates with the wider web and made them findable via search engines .
The changes were introduced on 9 December via a pop-up that asked users to update privacy settings .
Facebook said the changes help members manage updates they wanted to share , not trick them into revealing too much .
" Facebook is nudging the settings toward the ' disclose everything ' position , " said Marc Rotenberg , executive director of the US Electronic Privacy Information Center ( Epic ) .
" That 's not fair from the privacy perspective . "
Epic said it was analysing the changes to see if they amounted to trickery .
Control reduction
In a statement , the Electronic Frontier Foundation said : " These new ' privacy ' changes are clearly intended to push Facebook users to publicly share even more information than before . "
It added : " Even worse , the changes will actually reduce the amount of control that users have over some of their personal data . "
Facebook began testing the privacy changes during mid-2009 before introducing them site - wide .
The changes let people decide who should see updates , whether all 350 million Facebook members should see them , and if they should be viewable across the web .
Barry Schnitt , a Facebook spokesman , said users could avoid revealing some information to non-friends by leaving gender and location fields blank .
He said the changes to privacy made it easier to tune the audience for an update or status change so default settings of openness should have less impact .
Users of social networks are now splitting into two camps - what I would call the broadcasters and the whisperers

" Any suggestion that we 're trying to trick them into something would work against any goal that we have , " said Mr Schnitt .
Facebook would encourage people to be more open with their updates because , he said , that was in line with " the way the world is moving " .
Assessing the changes , privacy campaigners criticised a decision to make Facebook users ' gender and location viewable by everyone .
Jason Kincaid , writing on the Tech Crunch news blog , said some of the changes were made to make Facebook more palatable to search sites such as Bing and Google .
Blogger Marshall Kirkpatrick was worried that the default setting for privacy was to make everything visible to everyone .
" This is not what Facebook users signed up for , " he wrote .
" It 's not about privacy at all , it 's about increasing traffic and the visibility of activity on the site . "
He also criticised the fact that the pop -up message that greets members asking them to change their privacy settings was different depending on how engaged that person was with Facebook .
He said Facebook was " maddeningly unclear " about the effect of the changes .
Many users left comments on the official Facebook blog criticising the changes .
Some said they had edited their profiles and reduced their use of the social site to hide information they do not want widely spread either by accident or design .

I went to Vietnam a few months ago , and a friend asked on Twitter if that made me think of the classic “ Towers of Hanoi ” problem .
Well , it has !
Rice noodle factory in Vietnam
Here it is in Haskell , using the Writer monad .
This code is a very basic example of how to use tell to report data .
The Writer monad provides a kind of logger , that will record data as values are computed .
This algorithm is O ( 2n ) , as the structure of the move function clearly shows .
awo , woops , looks like i had musical opinions that are lame .
does n't matter .
you should look up that sting video , tho .
Andrew :
Hey all , I am Andrew Warner , I ’m the founder of Mixergy.com , home of the ambitious Upstar and by the way , what I mean by that is that I do these interviews for select few , I mean people who know that they can watch professional TV shows .
Not just my little operation over here , but instead , are picking and choosing to listen to this time after time because they ’re so hungry to build a successful business that they ’re going to spend an hour with an entrepreneur , an hour with an investor to find out what they know about building a company .
And today , by the way , I ’ve got a guy who ’s both .
So , on the phone with me today , not video , but on the phone with me today , I ’ve got a man who according to his website , sold his company for millions of dollars , and I ’m going to ask him to clarify that , he invests in startups , and according to my research , it ’s 11 startups that he ’s invested in up until now .
He ’s also the founder of HubSpot and HubSpot offers inbound marketing software .
His name is Dharmesh Shah , and Dharmesh that ’s kind of a small version of the full bio but how did I do there ?
Interviewee :
That was exceptional actually to carry around with me when I need intro that means .
Andrew : I did n’t even get into the blog that you write , that ’s really popular , on Startups.com and the question and answer site that you have for entrepreneurs called Answers.onstartups.com and how you ’re just tearing it up with that site already , even though the question and answer site is so new .
Interviewee : Yeah it ’s doing exceptionally well .
I ’m very pleased , the community has really stepped up .
Andrew : Alright , well let ’s go back in time before we talk about , we ’re going to be talking about how you decide what companies to invest in and what entrepreneurs can learn about from the way that you invest in , what they can learn about how they can get funding from the way that you invest .
We ’re going to find out what you ’ve learned about building successful companies but first I want to go back in time and find out about that company that you built in 1994 and sold in 2005 which is called Pyramid Digital Solutions .
What did Pyramid do ?
Interviewee : Pyramid provided CRM software for the financial services industry so it was a very boring business in terms of we sold to essentially high end software that helped people connect with their retirement accounts over the web and over the phone , touch tone response and those kind of things .
Andrew :
And you were n’t selling to individuals right , you were selling to enterprise ?
Interviewee : Correct , yeah .
Andrew : Alright , can you tell us a little bit about how you built that up , what was it like , what was the original vision for the business ?
Let ’s spend a little bit of time going over that company because it seems like that ’s where you really established yourself and that ’s given you lot of credibility in this base .
So , what was the original idea for Pyramid ?
Interviewee :
That was interesting , there was no really big grand master vision .
So , I was 24 at the time , I was working for a large technology and software company called SunGuard Data Systems .
Large publicly held company and I was n’t there for very long but one thing that occurred to me is that despite the fact that they were a successful software company , it was n’t a particularly productive place for programmers and as I was working there I felt that this does n’t seem like a particularly efficient way to solve customer problems that we had lots of big customers at SunGuard obviously as they ’d been around for a while and I had a small idea which was around doing this kind of data conversion application that would help customers essentially move from one financial system to another .
In this particular case , SunGuard .
So I actually approached management there and said I got this idea for a small data conversion application which I think will help to get more customers onto the SunGuard platform and so they asked me , ” Well , what do you think Dharmesh , you could sell this application ? ” for I was an employee at that time and I said , ” Well , I am not really sure , I ’ve not sold software before but let ’s say 5000 dollars . ”
And they came back and said , ” Well , you know we ’re really not in the 5000 dollar software business , we ’re in the million dollar software business , it ’s just not our focus , we do n’t think it really makes sense for us to pursue that particular product ” , which I think was the right thing for them to respond with .
It really did n’t make sense for them .
So the idea was n’t that big but I just wanted to do something independent and build it and so I left SunGuard and started that company and that was the first ???
that I built and we did end it up selling it for 5000 dollars but the price grew every time .
So no big grand vision , I just thought that it might be more productive and I hired all my buddies from college and every great programmer that I needed for the co
mpany and grew it .
???
I did n’t even know what adventure capital was at the time .
Andrew : Really ?
And how ’re you going to pay the people who you brought onboard with you from the start ?
Interviewee :
The way I had thought about businesses which I have never done before , I was a programmer least likely to start a company amongst the people that knew me .
So , my simplistic thinking was while we relate to actually run a company is you go get revenue from customers and then use those revenues to buy what you need including recruiting people .
The transcript for minute 5 till minute 0 is BELOW this line .
Interviewee : then use those revenues to buy what you need , including recruiting people !
So in the early days we had no employees , right , it was just the two co-founders , and we kind of cranked out code , and we had some early sales kick in and the good news about software businesses is that , if done correctly they should be capital efficient , so they do n’t take a lot of money , and once some small revenue started to trickle in we actually started bringing people on to the team , and the way we ran that company , essentially , for the entire duration of the company , was , you know , we kind of had a limit at how much we would take on in terms of monthly expenses based on how much cash was in the bank .
So essentially took all the profits of the business , all the revenues and threw it back in , and just grew as revenues grew , and it turned out we had , eight straight years of triple digits growth and the revenues … we did well , so it was good , was a fun ride .
Andrew : Alright , i got to dig deeper into the eight straight years of revenue growth .
My experience doing interviews here on mixergy with engineers is that they do n’t like selling , they ’re not good sales - people , and here you build a business , yes dependent a lot on software , but it seems equally dependent on sales .
Who sold and where did this skills come from ?
Interviewee : Yeah , that ’s a great question actually .
So , the way i fell into it that camp was , i was not particularly good at selling things , i do n’t enjoy it , and the two , i think , are correlated , but .. is .. so when i kicked off the company , and approached Sunguard , as i said earlier , and said “ hey i want to build this product ” , and then i went back to them “ i ca n’t get this out of my head , I ’m going to start this company ” , well i still believe that , this product can actually help you make more sales of your million dollar product .
And so ..
In the early days of the business , i said “ OK , well , let me go off and build this thing .
I like working here , but since i ca n’t get this idea out of my head , and why do n’t you sell the product ?
And what we ’ll do is we ’ll split the revenue fifty - fifty ” .
And obviously the money made no sense to them , they did n’t care about the 50 % of the five thousand dollars they were going to get .
What they did care about was in the event that i pulled it off , if it just added one more sale to their roster that they would n’t have gotten otherwise because we made the migration process to their platform easier , it was a win for them !
So they , agreed .
They were like “ OK ” , it was a flier and what was interesting .
So that kind of started a , essentially , a distribution partnership , which i did n’t know what those were either , but i was like “ OK , I ’ll build the product , you guys sell it because you are good at selling software ” , and they did that !
So that drove a lot of the early revenue , and obviously we renegotiated that partnership deal over time , but , that , it endured !
And we added more products on and it was a , probably around maybe year two or three , where we started , essentially , building out our own kind of distribution capability and did n’t sell it completely for the Sunguard anymore .
Andrew : OK , I , that ’s a really clever way to get sales early on .
You have a big company with established customers going out and selling for you .
Where did that idea come from ?
Interviewee : That idea came out of ignorance .
I thought ..
I just did n’t .. I mean ..
It seemed kind of relatively obvious that I was n’t going to be able to sell things .
I was , we were a two - person start up trying to sell to these kind of fortune 100 financial institutions , and I kind of had a sense that we had no chance in hell of actually convincing people .. to do it , to do that .
We did n’t know anything about sales .
So i think , part of it was just , we did n’t know any better , we asked , we were n’t really hung up on the terms of the deal , we just kept it simple , in terms of ..
“ Here ’s what it would take ” ..
So , to Sunguard ’s credit they had n’t done anything like that before either .
Particularly with a small rickety start - up ..
But they knew me , it was not that big of a risk .
It was one of those things where just luck played in .
I was at the right place , at the right time , and , i guess , caught them in the right mindset .
Andrew :
And if I ’m understanding you right , the deal for them , the benefit that they had in doing this was that , this would be just another product that they sold to their current customers and if there was a customer who just wanted this , but was n’t ready for any other products this would be a gateway solution .
One that would get them into the Sunguard fold .
Interviewee :
That is correct , yeah .
Andrew : OK , all right , yeah .
So , I said earlier that on your website , and used the word millions , i used that because that draws attention , and i’m hoping that it gets more people to listen in to the rest of the interview , but I ’m going to ask you for a little bit of clarity on that , how much really did you sell for ?
Interviewee : So , I ca n’t reveal the terms of the deal , what I can tell you is that the revenue at the time that we sold was 15 million dollars , first offer company , and it sold , you know , in the range of what an enterprise software company multiple would be .
Andrew : Can you give me a..
What was the range for an enterprise software company in 2005 , the year that you sold .
Interviewee :
At the time , the average range , the mean would probably be around 2 x revenue .
Andrew : Two times revenue .
And how ,
What percentage of the company did you own ?
Interviewee : That is interesting .
My co-founder was my brother .
Which is another …
Actually a different story .
But i owned 70 % at the time of the sale ?
Andrew : Wow , and how did the responsibility break down ?
Interviewee :
It was interesting , he was , in the early days he was a programmer as well .
The transcript for minute 10 till minute 15 is BELOW this line .
Interviewee :
In the early days , he was a programmer as well .
Because that ’s how we used to need to print out code .
And eventually , we kind of split roles where I was doing all the engineering and product development stuff , and he was doing kind of opps and sales and basically everything else .
Andrew : I see .
OK .
And you said that there was an interesting story behind that dynamic .
I worked with my brother , and I loved it .
Interviewee : Yup .
Andrew : I know a lot of people have trouble working with family .
What was the dynamic like for you ?
Interviewee : It was interesting .
So we had a very long run .
One of the things that was interesting is that there ’s a relatively large age difference between us .
He was 17 at the time , at the time that the company started , so just out of high school .
And , well , I ’ll have to you the story because it ’s , I think , interesting .
So at the time , I was working at Sunguard .
He was 17 .
He had just graduated from high school .
And I was working as a developer , and had only been there , at Sunguard , for about three months , I think at the time .
So I was n’t there at Sunguard for very long .
But , so we had this consultant that we had hired to do these kind of GUI screens .
We were , you know , Sunguard was building this kind of client server front end to their big mainframe system .
And then I remember the numbers vividly , is that we were paying the consultant $ 75 an hour .
He essentially would take like these paper kind of mock - ups and things like that and translate them into this kind of [ 4GL ] language , and just drag and drop and build these screens .
And I went through my manager at the time .
I ’m like , well , this stuff is actually relatively trivial , and you know we should n’t be paying $ 75 an hour to this person to do this stuff .
And then I went on to say well , it ’s so simple my brother , who just graduated high school who I do n’t think is all that bright , you know just …
Andrew : [ Laughs ]
Interviewee : kind of sibling jest there , could probably do it .
And so , my manager said , well OK , bring him in .
Right ?
So he was working for a grocery store at the time , just out of high school .
And so I brought him in , and we were n’t really sure , now in retrospect were n’t sure it was even legal to hire him , but and we hired him $ 5 an hour .
Right ?
So essentially within two weeks he displaced that $ 75 an hour consultant and had a really good run within Sunguard as well .
He was a natural at that particular , at the programming stuff , having never taken a computer science class in his life .
So it was just one of those things .
So when I left the company , you know I kind of left first , and then brought my brother [ Ricko ] with me .
And so it was interesting .
I think the challenge there , in terms of , you know , should you do it again , is that it ’s really hard to have , you know , in the long , long term , hard to have objectivity .
And that ’s , I think , the big issue .
That , as you know , the company grew .
And we ’re like , OK , well , how do we decide roles and responsibilities ?
And yes , so it ’s , I can argue both sides , but I think it ’s a challenge , so .
Andrew : Did you guys get into actual arguments , or are we talking about friction ?
What was it like ?
Interviewee : Actual arguments .
I think those are …
Andrew : Uh-hmm .
Interviewee :
So that particular set of arguments , I think , are similar to what co-founders would often have , in terms of just , you know , debate and discussion .
But so then we had , sometimes smart people have differing opinions , and those are the kind of rich topic areas for discussion anyway .
But where it becomes interesting , though , is that , you know , one of the things that you have with a , I ’ll call it anonimously , a co-founder , is that , you know , the discussions essentially would come down to , hopefully some degree of objectivity that says , OK , here ’s my opinion .
Here ’s your opinion .
And you ’re behaving this way because you think this .
And what happens in a family , whether it ’s family or friends , now , or very close friends , same thing .
But then you have the issue of well , you know , how much are you doing this because you ’re my older brother ?
And are you kind of , do you swing more power around than you normally do if , you know , if I were a different co-founder .
Right ?
That would be one argument from his perspective , let ’s say .
And from my perspective , I ’m like , OK , well , you ’re 17 .
If I had hired another 17 year old co-founder that was n’t my brother , you know , what would I , you know , how would I behave ?
So it ’s that kind of dynamic , I think , that ’s , uh , it gets tricky sometimes .
So , and we were both so young .
It was our first start - up , first anything , actually so .
Andrew :
And we should say that the company that you sold it to was Sungard , this very company that you worked for , that you made that initial deal with , they were the ones who came in and who bought the business .
Interviewee : Yeah , there ’s very some , some good poetic symmetry there , in terms of , we left we had acquistion offers , you know , starting probably like in the year four or fivish .
And then it continued every couple years , and we turned them down several times .
Then just finally the numbers made sense , and yeah .
Andrew : OK .
Do you think that if you were n’t working for Sungard , and you came up with this idea , that you could have brought that deal to them and said , guys can you please sell my software for me ?
And then let them handle it while you were working on software development ?
Interviewee : No way .
Yeah .
So , one of the things , you know , when I talk to entrepreneurs that are just getting started , there ’s this kind of temptation to strike this kind of a big partnership .
The distribution , or I ’m going to , form to do something , and that ’s going to help me try to market or position the product .
In , I would say , in most cases , that ’s a bad idea for entrepreneurs for a couple of reasons .
One is the likelihood of striking that kind of deal , unless you have some inside track , is really , really low .
Like one of the things that ’s exceptionally hard in the early stages of a start - up is , you know , enterprise software is really hard to sell .
The transcript for minute 15 till minute 20 is BELOW this line .
Interviewee : The start up .
You know , enterprise software is really hard to sell .
The only thing that ’s harder to do is some sort of large enterprise partnership .
So , my advice to entrepreneur is do n’t get overly caught up on trying to strike those big deals .
They sound awfully tempting , but they just rarely come to ??? in the way the entrepreneur is thinking .
If I go , well , I ’m going to strike this partnership and they are going to sale on my behalf and then I can go to the back in the back room and just rack coat , and not have to worry about all that ugly sales business .
That normally does n’t work out that way .
It usually ended up exercising frustration and a lot of time wasted .
I ’m not hung out for those parts .
Andrew : I see .
Interviewee :
In fact , I ’m lucky ,
It just so happened ???
Andrew :
All right .
It ’s , it ’s luck , but it ’s also intelligence .
To think about the idea , to not give it up when the company did n’t want to , to pick it up , to not say that maybe it ’s worthless because they ’re not jumping in on it , t o go out and take a risk and build the business yourself .
And then to have the ??? to go to them and ask them to sell for you and work out after you .
Interviewee : Sure .
I ’ll take some credit .
Yeah .
Absolutely .
Andrew :
You know what , I feel like sometimes part of my responsibility in these interviews is to make sure that the entrepreneur takes credit for their work .
A lot of time we ca n’t take credit for our own work because , or we do n’t want to publicly take credit because there ’s a lot of other people who really contributed a lot to this .
Because we do n’t want to seem arrogant Because we do n’t want to become arrogant .
Interviewee : Right .
Andrew :
But , really the people who are listening to this need to understand that this is not a way of Forrest Gumping your way to success .
There ’s some intelligence , there ’s planning , there ’s a lot of hard work that goes into it .
And , I want to make sure they can acknowledge that .
Interviewee : ???
Andrew :
All right .
By the way can I , for the record , can I say over 25 million is what you sold for ?
Interviewee : No .
We can ’t .
I ’m sorry .
Andrew : Oh .
Is there some number I can say over publicly ?
Interviewee : No. I ’m sorry .
This is one of the things that , yeah , I ’ve been really good about this .
It ’s been tempting to publish .
But , I ’m a roughly transparent guy .
That ’s one thing I ’m not out of favor with what the terms of the actual deal were .
Andrew : Okay .
Excuse me , I was just sneezing there .
Interviewee : That ’s okay .
Andrew : Fair enough .
Let ’s see , got a few people here who are watching or listening to us live guide .
This is , I usually would have a video of the person who I ’m interviewing .
I want to know from you how is this sounding .
To me it ’s sounding great and I ’m getting just as much value as if we had video .
But , I ’ll like to hear from you guys .
I see Johnny Gary is out there , tell me what you think .
Copre Singh , tell me what you think .
Will Lamb , you ’ve been watching a lot of these interviews what ’s it like to just listen .
And Ing Thomas , UK , tell me what you think to .
It sounds like you ’re in the UK and I ’ll love to hear how ’s it ’s coming across to you over there .
All right , so , you mentioned giving advice to entrepreneurs
And that ’s something that I knew you for before I knew any of your business background .
And something that I keep seeing about you .
You ’re blogging for entrepreneurs
You must be blogging non-stop .
I did research for this interview and I realized that you ’re blogging for venture hex , venture B , your own site which is on stardom.com .
I think you might have even blogged on my website neither one of us ever knew it because you ’re out there just tearing it up .
Why do you do it ?
Why you ’re giving advise in writing so much ?
Interviewee : Well , it ’s interesting .
The story behind the blog is actually a rather decent one .
So , when I sold pyramid .
My promise to my wife was okay , well I had been . . . she knows me before I actually start my first start up .
Before she knew I was going to be an entrepreneur .
Once I kind of had that transaction in the works .
I said , “ well , I ’ve been going at it hard and long with pyramid .
It ’s been a fun but , long and somewhat tiresome ride .
I ’m going to go back to grad school ” .
So , which had been on my list of things I wanted to do .
And so I went back to MIT to get my masters .
And , I ’ll go find myself and figure out what I want to do next .
And on my list of things was possibly like I could ____l and become a professor or something some day .
So that was insight .
And then within a month ish or so of starting grad school , I ’m like , well I kind of miss the whole start up thing .
And what I ’ll do , I ’ll start like living ____through other entrepreneurs
And , part of my list of requirements at MIT is I had to write a graduate thesis .
And so what I thought to do , is okay well , I ’ll write a thesis and I ’ll call it On Start Ups .
Because I want to kind of study how the software industry had essentially changed for start ups .
And talk to entrepreneurs and figure out what they had learned and how my experience may or may not have been different from what people are going through now .
So , now was the title of my thesis was on Start Ups .
The patterns and practices of contemporary software entrepreneurs
So , the blogg actually was a by product of that .
So , my thesis adviser , Ed Roberts , who is the ____ at my entrepreneur center , said : “ well you know the thesis is going well reasonably well .
This is reasonable good stuff .
But , the reality is you have no real kind of research .
You need to actually talk to people and get back from folks ” .
And so I started the blogg essential as a way , as a lazy person ’s way to collect that feedback .
Because I ’m an anti-social kind of guy .
I ’m like , oh , may be I can just put stuff out there , put opinions and let people kind of give me feedback and agree or disagree .
The transcript for minute 20 till minute 25 is BELOW this line .
Interviewee : And so that was the kind of motivation .
I had no plans to write a blog , it was essentially for thesis feedback .
And so being the creative guy that I was , I called it the same thing the thesis was called , I called it onstartups.com .
The domain happened to be available .
Anyway , so that was the original kind of motivation .
So what I found was that it was actually kind of fun to be able to just write about experiences .
Pyramid was basically the only experience I had at the time .
And then to share the kind of story that you experience was ten times more than I do in terms of the gratification of being able to connect stories together , to say “ Oh , well I talked to
Michael McDerment , hes the CEO of FreshBooks .
He was one of the early people that I interviewed for my thesis .
And Jason Fried from 37 Signals .
I had lots of you know , these great people learning from online for a little while and agreed to do an interview and it was just kinda wonderful to just kinda connect , connect entrepreneurs and connect tell my story and both other peoples stories
and just bring people together .
And the traffic did well so it was gratifying to see the numbers to grow over time .
And its been a lot of fun , so I ’ve been keeping it up ever since .
Andrew :
And you ’re right , I experience this as i do my interviews here
and I urge people all the time to go and do this themselves , to find a reason to interview other entrepreneurs , if they want to be entrepreneurs .
To interview other designers if they want to be designers .
To find a way and excuse to interview other people who are in the space they want to be in because you ’re going to make connections , you ’re going to learn from them and you ’re going to get an understanding that you could just not get as an outsider , that you could n’t even get if you were working for a single company here .
Its going to give you , if you interview lots of people you ’re going to get a breath that you could n’t match anywhere else .
Even books could n’t give it to you .
And im always happy to if anyones listening to us right now who wants to do interviews like the ones I ’m doing here , I do n’t fell threatened by it , i do n’t want to fight against you as i do this .
I want to support you and I want to help you , and I ’ll even show you everything that I do here .
So reach out to me and ill help you guys out .
OK , so it was fun , but you ’re also spending a lot of time on this .
Is there – are there business benefits to teaching publicly on your blog ,
or on other peoples blogs ?
Interviewee : Yeah , its interesting , so this was actually a decent segway into my current startup which I think has some kind of lessons in it as well .
So when i was at grad school , I said OK , well I ’m going to live vicariously through other entrepreneurs and i’ll start making age old investments and do that kind of thing .
But evidently the pain of living vicariously through other entrepreneurs was n’t high enough , so the notion of huffspot actually started when I was at MIT .
And i have to stray a little bit .
So one of my classmates at MIT Ryan Hallagan , he actually graduated a year ahead of me and he went to work for a venture firm .
he sent me a DIR to find out when his next gig was going to begin and we began noodling on the huffstop idea and one thing that was interesting , his job was to go around to the portfolio companies of the CC firms that he was working with and help them with sales and distribution , because hes a sales and distribution guy .
Hes been doing that for software companies his entire professional career .
And for one thing he learned ,
he sat down with these folks and said OK , well what are you doing to kind of reach customers ?
how are you going to get those early customers from the start up and go from a rinky dinky little to a big publicly successful company ?
and they all came back with kind of similar tactics .
They said OK , well we ’re doing these trade shows , we ’re buying advertising in these local trade journals ,
we ’re doing email blasts , we ’re doing all these classic kind of marketing things .
Ryan was like OK that ’s great .
I ’ve done this for my entire professional career , That playbook works .
Well as it turned out , it was n’t working .
At the same time he was providing this advice to all these start ups
in terms of how they can kind of you know , stretch the top of their tunnel and get more customers , onstartups blog had kicked off , and Ryan and I would meet every week , we would talk about doing business together anyway .
And one of the things that kinda hit us was , so he kinda looked at the traffic from startup and he looked at the traffic for these venture backed software companies trying to grow traffic to their websites , trying to get customers .
and there was a big , like onstartup was getting five times the traffic of these companies that were spending literally hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars
trying to market their product and so that ’s when the epiphany hit .
We were like , well there ’s something that ’s changed here .
why is it that these companies are having such a hard time getting traffic on their websites , a lot of times even consumer websites , whereas onstartups is succeeding .
So our thesis was that how the old - school marketing of “ OK I ’ve got this message I ’m going to take my marketing budget , and im going to spread the message as far and wide as possible ” just does n’t work anymore .
We kind of walk around with these little bubbles around us now .
We do n’t answer our phones anymore , we do n’t open junk mail , we only open spam .
We just do n’t do that , and so our thesis was what onstartups was essentially doing right was just pulling users in by saying something that was interesting .
So we took that kind if insight and
said OK what can we do to actually replicate the success that onstartups had for small businesses .
Why cant small businesses do essentially the exact same thing ?
The transcript for minute 25 till minute 30 is BELOW this line .
Interviewee : … small businesses do essentially the exact same thing .
OK , they all have a story .
They hopefully have some differentiation to put interesting youthful content out there and use it to draw customers in organically , versus pushing the message out .
So we call this “ inbound marketing ” .
That was the original , kind of premise and hub - spot , what ’s helping the small businesses essentially draw customers into their sales file .
So , the answer is , yes , we took all the early lessons from young start - ups , and then did a bunch of experimentation around social media .
Part of my motivation , obviously , is the personal gratification of growing the blog .
But then I had a very , very kind of precise business value , which is , I wanted to kind of test the experiments and say , “ look , here ’s what works to build traffic to a web site ” , and treat young start - ups as essentially a small business .
Although it was n’t revenue generating , the issues were the same .
Andrew : OK , um , they ’re a couple of ideas in there I want to dig into .
The first one keeps coming up when I ask entrepreneurs about how they started their business .
The word “ thesis ” .
That they say , I had a thesis , and then I built a business around it .
Am I picking up on something that ’s valuable , or is it a happenstance that you ’re all using the same word ?
Interviewee : Um , I think part of my use of the word “ thesis ” is probably because I ’ve been to grad school recently , and I had the word “ thesis ” on my brain for so long , and it was painful .
Ah , but , in this particular case , I think , [ Anec Doli ] , an entrepreneur that I talked to , the original idea was n’t necessarily the one that accompanying on both rounds .
And the same case exists with HubSpot .
The original idea , when I was sitting in grad school , was doing essentially ERP software for small businesses .
I wanted to do like a [ light , weak ] Oracle .
And the idea was to go one vertical at a time .
And what was happening , kind of simultaneously , is that the young start - ups left and then that intersected with , “ oh , wait a second , this kind of marketing problem seemed like a more interesting problem to solve that more people have ” , and then so there was , essentially , we kind of switched , or I switched the idea , and so , let ’s do this marketing software thing instead .
But it does help to have some theory about what you think about the market and how you think things are going to progress .
Because , that way you know whether you ’re right or not , and kind of iterate on that .
So , it ’s kind of the agile approach to start up development .
Andrew : OK , so , if you were going to , in one sentence say what the original thesis behind HubSpot was , what would you say it was ?
Interviewee : The original HubSpot thesis was , enterprise software start - ups are very painful .
Do n’t do that again .
Um , and it ’s very hard to build an enterprise software start - up .
So my original thesis was that a lot more money was going to get made in the small - business sector .
So that was the thesis , essentially , like I want to serve small businesses , and my thesis then was , OK , and this was in the MIT thesis , was .
Well , enterprise software is really hard for software start - ups because it ’s so hard to break in , they ’re very sophisticated buyers now , the hey day in was the late ’ 80s and ’90s , which I got to enjoy a little bit .
And now an enterprise software start - up is really hard .
On the flip side of the spectrum , consumer internet , consumer software start - ups are hard in their own way , because there would be
binary business models .
There , you know , approaching lottery tickets .
Like OK , you do this consumer web start - up , and if it ’s successful , you make , you know , tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars , or you make nothing at all .
Right ?
It ’s a very binary outcome .
The thing I like about small business and just doing the research , is like , OK .
I have the elements of enterprise software , in which you can actually charge people money , which is kind of old - fashioned , but coming back into style .
And you then have , but you still have the same scale essentially .
You have a consumer web spot .
There ’s millions of small businesses out there , and so you can build big interesting businesses , as folks like Salesforce.com and Constantcontact .
And a bunch of successful , kind of fast - paced companies have done recently .
So that would be , the original thesis is , money will get made in small business , and we should know how .
So the original thing was , oh , we ’ll go after small law firms and do ERP software .
And eventually we kind of pivoted and said well , marketing software is a more interesting problem .
And seems more people have it .
And it was more fun .
Andrew :
All right .
I do n’t want to get side - tracked , but I ’ve got to ask you about that , because it ’s an interesting observation that the consumer side of the business really is competitive .
And people are throwing lots of money at it .
And there are lots of voices screaming for attention , and not that much money coming in from consumers .
On the high end , the businesses are tough to create products for .
They ’re tough to satisfy .
They ’re tough to get in the door to sell to .
Somewhere in between is the smaller business that 37 Signals targets , that Pubspot targets .
That ’s more accessible .
That ’s plentiful .
That ’s willing to pay if you could get them results .
But how do you reach them ?
Because I know with Facebook and with consumer facing businesses , with consumers , you can reach them because consumers will spread the word to each other because consumers all day long will send links to each other , and invite each other out .
And borrow marketing is very effective .
And they ’ll pimp out their Myspace pages with your widget if you ’ve got a widget .
But how do you reach those smaller businesses that are n’t so willing to engage in viral marketing , or to engage you on social networks ?
And are too busy .
The transcript for minute 30 till minute 35 is BELOW this line .
Andrew : … on social networks , and are too busy ?
Interviewee : Yeah .
I think that ’s actually , that might be a myth in terms of that ….
You know , small businesses do n’t engage on the web or do n’t spread a marketing message .
What we ’ve found with our work at HubSpot , and with lots of small business customers , even boring businesses are actually succeeding at attracting customers through things like blogging and social media .
It ’s actually working for a bunch of our customers .
But for HubSpot specifically , we ’ve had phenomenal success in kind of organically reaching these small businesses .
That are spreading the word … and I think , in a way , 37 Signals is not really selling to consumers .
It ’s a solo launch firm , and people running the quote , original market was design firms .
Freelance designers and things like that .
So I think the small businesses are now increasingly online .
They ’re reading blogs , they ’re trying to learn .
They ’re trying to learn about marketing and sales .
And how to run a better management consulting firm .
And all those things .
And I think they ’re much easier to reach now .
In the trend line … we ’re swimming with the tide .
The trend line is positive .
And the other thing we have to remember here is that lots of these small business owners and practitioners , they grew up with the web , right ?
So , even if it ’s not what let ’s say only … .
Let ’s say , 30 percent happen to be online and are going to participate in Facebook and those kinds of things .
In the next two years , we ’re going to have a world where most of the people that are starting business and doing this kind of stuff do n’t know of a pre-Internet world .
That ’s not that foreign of a concept to them to pick both business and personal stuff sitting inside of Facebook .
Or , to write both a personal blog and to talk about their business .
It ’s relatively common .
Yeah .
Andrew : OK .
And I mentioned earlier that there were two things that you said that I ’ve been seeing over and over in my interviews .
The first is the idea of a thesis behind the formation of a business .
The second is the importance of having an audience before you launch a business .
I ’ve talked to multiple entrepreneurs and asked them , “ Where did you get your original customers ? ” and basically they said … .
Well , I keep going back to 37 Signals .
But [ PHONETIC ]
Jason
Freed said here that he had an audience because of his blog .
And his first customers came from that audience .
And I ’ve talked to others who said that they ’ve had audiences because of their blogs , because of email newsletters , because of a community that they built .
And so that ’s where their first customers came from .
Can you talk about the importance of having an audience ?
Or am I wrong ?
Am I picking up on , again , just a coincidence that they all have audiences ?
Interviewee : No , you ’re absolutely right on that one .
So , what ’s happening now is that — and this is one of the pieces of advice I give entrepreneurs as well — is that ….
If you ’re going to spend writing a business plan , stop and write a blog instead .
And the idea here is that if you can build that early community of people that just care , right ?
Like , if you ’ve been in business for a while , whatever your passion happens to be , if you can get hat online community built , that is the perfect early audience to reach into .
Because the odds are you ’re going to hopefully build a business around something you ’re passionate about anyway .
So why not have a community that you can sell into ?
But even once you start … .
I think before you write your first line of code , if you ’re a software entrepreneur , you should be writing a blog , right ?
That says , “ OK .
Can I get market feedback early ? ” and this is a tangent .
But a different topic we can talk about possibly later is around the lunacy of stealth mode .
In terms of trying to keep your idea a secret and not write about it .
Because you think someone ’s going to go steal that idea .
But I ’m an absolute believer in , “ build a community . ”
Because that is critical in terms of being able to get early market traction .
And it ’s worked for so many entrepreneurs , including me ; I ca n’t recommend it more highly .
That ’s a definite pattern I ’m seeing now .
Andrew : OK .
Can you give me an explicit …
I know we talked about it earlier in the conversation here .
But let ’s be even more explicit about the cause and effect of how you built an audience , and how that affected the launch of HubSpot .
And just , I know that we only have about 20 , 25 minutes left , and there ’s so much more to cover .
But if we could just do a quick cause and effect that would embed itself in people ’s minds , they ’ll understand why they need to built an audience .
Interviewee : Yeah .
So the cause and effect was , in the early days , we actually started a HubSpot blog as well .
Before the product was even launched or written .
And we said , “ OK .
Here ’s our , essentially , our thesis . ”
We put it out there , and said , “ Oh , well we think outbound marketing grinds of sucks .
Outbound marketing kills kittens .
And inbound marketing , pulling people in organically , is the path to truth and justice . ”
And I think one of the things that worked is basically kind of taking a stand .
Is having a vision .
And — even if it polarizes people .
So we had a bunch of marketers come back who said , “ Well , you ’re telling us tradeshows are dead !
You ’re telling us advertising is dead . ”
That ’s just simply not true .
And so what happened from , let ’s just say , cause and effect perspective is , once we start getting those … .
For every one person that completely , violently disagreed with us , we had a counterbalancing person that says , “ My God , you guys are right .
That is the path to truth and justice , ” is pulling customers in organically .
I want more of that . ”
And then essentially what we did is we translated that web visitor traffic into leads , right ?
And we said , “ OK .
Well , if you ’re interested in that , would you be interested in buying software that actually helped you do that ? ” and that ’s been immensely successful .
And so even to …
The transcript for minute 35 till minute 40 is BELOW this line .
Interviewee : … and that ’s been immensely successful .
So even to this day , the HubSpot blog drives in the top 5 legions forces a hotspot .
That ’s how we generate 18,000 lead last month and the blog is in the top 5 .
Andrew :
Ok , next we ’re going to talk about inbound marketing and then we ’re going to talk about how to work with Angel Industries and get them to see your business but before I move on to both those things , I ’ve got to tell you something that I love about this interview so far and this is something that I love about writers in general .
You ’re so clear about your ideas .
I just so admire that .
People who watch me do these interviews have heard me stumble though my words at times and have heard me rephrase questions three times before I get out there and of course when I interview entrepreneurs , their job all day long is to build out their business .
They ’re not thinking about how to articulate the way to build out their business .
What I admire about you is you ’re not just an entrepreneur who ’s building his business and has the knowledge in his head but because you ’re a writer , I can see the ideas come out clearly through you .
The ideas are expressed in a way that people can understand , can take them home and as a person who is doing an interview and I know as people who are listening our interview , that ’s something that we really appreciate .
So , I just got to point that out .
I love when I get interviewees like you who have the experience and also have the ability to articulate it .
See , if you were saying that , you would ’ve gotten that message out in one sentence .
To me it took a few sentences and a lot of ‘ uhms ’ and ‘ ahs ’ .
Interviewee : Well , thank you .
Andrew : Alright , thank you .
Let ’s go next to inbound marketing .
I ’ve heard and I think it was in one of your speeches or an online video you say that most companies know how to build the thing that they ’re building , they know how to build their software , they know how to build their product , they know how to build whatever is it they want to sell .
What they have trouble with is getting that audience , getting the customer base , marketing it .
So , let ’s spend about 10 minutes going through few questions about how to market it .
And I ’ll start up by asking you what ’s the most effective way ?
If there is an 80 - 20 rule where 20 % of my efforts are going to give me 80 % of the results , what ’s the 20 % here ?
Interviewee : Yes , what I would suggest would be , I ’ll put this kind of more broadly , is creating content that is useful for your potential customers that you hope to sell things some day .
And it can be in any number of forms .
One thing we had success with , and especially I think this would work very well for software companies , is free tools .
Hopefully programmers or developers , in software companies are good at writing software , and this goes towards the premiumish models , so we had a free tool that we launched early in our history called Website Grator .
And by the way Andrew I think you ’re off - screen or shifted away or the camera moved away or something .
Andrew : I can believe you ’re actually watching the interview , honestly I just had to blow my nose .
Interviewee : Ah , that ’s fine .
Do n’t worry , it ’s ok .
Andrew : [ Laughs ]
I love that you ’re watching too .
Interviewee : But anyway , so what ’s interesting is that if you can build either content or tools that will essentially be useful .
And one thing ’s ok .
Take a step back , when you ’re developing this content , let ’s say it is a blog or doing videos or whatever , it ’s extremely important to not sell in the blog in the early days .
The mistake people make is like , “ Oh well , I got this product and I am going to try and convince people to buy . ”
People are not going to be convinced to buy through that particular mechanism .
What you want to do is you want to convince them of the idea essentially , that ’s what you ’re selling .
You ’re not selling the product , you ’re not trying to get into their wallet and pull dollars out .
That ’s not going to be effective .
Let ’s say if I ’m in the marketing business , the marketing software business , I ‘m not going to talk about HubSpot , which we actually have a rule not to do on the blog , or make reference to the product itself .
What we say is , “ Here are 14 ways for a small business to get leads online . ”
We ’ll talk about blogging .
There are ‘ how - to ’ articles , there are things that are helpful and the way we ’re going to picture this is , imagine that someone inadvertedly stumbles across this piece of content that you developed , maximize the probability that they ’ll actually send it to a friend , that they ’ll bookmark it and come back to it later .
They ’re not going to take brochure - ware type stuff that says “ Here ’re the 14 reasons my product is so cool ” and so either write a blog , develop a video , write a software tool , do something that helps your future customers out essentially and that ’s valuable to them .
Anytime you can do that , even in this kind of short to mid term , it works .
We ’ve seen it work for , at this point , hundreds of companies now , it ’s magical .
Andrew : Absolutely I have .
I did n’t realize you had a rule not to talk about you ’re business on your blog .
I actually was supposed , at one point , to introduce Jason Calacanis on his show at a conference and I said , “ So Jason , I ’ll be saying this and this and this and the founder of Mahao.com ” , and he said , “ No no , do n’t even say Mahao .
They know Mahao . ”
So , it ’s not just that he did n’t want to promote Mahao himself , he did n’t even want me to promote it for him because he wanted to keep it pure .
Interviewee : Right .
Andrew : I see what you ’re saying .
What you want to do is just make sure that everyone understands , no confusion about it , you ’re just adding value and then later on the sale will come .
The transcript for minute 40 till minute 45 is BELOW this line .
Andrew : Confusion about it , you ’re just adding value and then , later on , the sale will come .
Interviewee : Yeah .
And , and expect that we ’ve , and its interesting so early .
Andrew :
But that ’s. that takes a long time though .
I mean , people who are building businesses , especially startups … Paul Graham has talked about this .
While , I , um , it takes a lot , it ’s all about survival .
He had a long blog post about that .
Now , in the early days it ’s , you feel like you only have days , months maybe , to , to survive .
Not years to build up a following and build up an audience .
Ands here you ’re telling us , “ Take your time .
Build up your audience .
Do n’t market to them . ”
But I ’m , I ’m saying that , that entrepreneurs , that people who are building businesses today are desperate .
They want to make the sale now .
Interviewee : I , I agree , so I ’ll , I ’ll , I ’ll kind of , I ’ll push back a little bit .
And I ’ll say , and your right , it ’s , it does take time and , and there is a limited amount of timespan , but I , my , I will posit to you that entrepreneurs are better off .
So , let ’s , let ’s say , I think you would agree that ’s it ’s actually harder to sell something than sell an idea .
So , let ’s say you ’re creating this value .
And let ’s say you ’re planning exceptionally hard .
You ’re four months into , you ’re writing this blog , you ’re creating great content , or whatever .
And you still can’t build any kind of traction .
It ’s just hard .
Well , that might be a problem with the underlying startup itself .
And I would rather learn that through , kind of , a marketing effort than go off and build a product or whatever and try and sell it .
Because that going to be even harder .
If I ca n’t convince people , that like in HubSpot ’s case , that inbound marketing is a good idea .
That it ’s gonna , you know , get some traction .
Well , my odds of selling software based on that idea are even slimmer .
Right , now I ’m asking , not just asking for their attention , I ’m asking for their money .
And , so , I would much rather , you know , see what these early , kind of , feedback is from the market or whatever and if it comes , and if it ’s way harder .
Like , you ’re getting almost nobody and nothing ’s spreading at all , that should be some early warning sign .
And I would rather have those signs .
I would rather try that path and learn that lesson early , so I can start and tweak the idea .
It ’s like , oh , maybe it ’s not this , maybe it ’s that .
And learn it through the , kind of , feedback mechanism of putting content out there and letting the market say , “ Oh , well , I find that interesting or useful or potentially something I would pay for . ”
Andrew : I see .
How many hours a , how many hours a week would you say that you spend writing ?
I see you online all the time .
Interviewee : Yeah , I do n’t really write that much anymore .
So , you know , the Young Startups Blog , you know I ’ll post maybe once every two or three weeks now .
So it ’s not that common .
This year I spent a bunch of time writing because I put the , wrote my first book .
But , I ’d say maybe two hours a week on average within a normal week .
Andrew : Wow , it seems like a lot more .
And maybe part of the reason it seems like a lot more is because you seem much more engaged with , with what ’s going on in other people ’s blogs , for example .
I think it was Nivi on Venture Hacks said that he , he wanted to have a list of Angel Investors and he allowed all you Angel Investors to go in and , and add yourself to this directory .
And you just popped right in there .
I think you one of , you were there the first day .
So , if it ’s not just writing , how much , how many hours a week do you spend being engaged in those ways .
Interviewee : Lots of hours .
So , so I spend most of my business hours , which is most of my hours sort of waking hours period , doing two things .
Writing code and engaging the online community .
So it used to be that I spent more time on the blog and , and putting content out there .
But now I find myself more in Twitter , more in , just kind of , engaging with blogs and commenting and reading and just consuming to see what ’s out there .
A ; because I enjoy it and B ; because I think it ’s useful .
Andrew : Okay .
Let ’s go through maybe another practical way the people can generate inbound marketing , in , inbound leads .
Can do inbound marketing .
Interviewee : Yeah , so one of the things I think what ’s interesting is , and it ’s one of the , kind of , push back I get from lots of entrepreneurs and , and small business folks as well , is , well I ’m not a good writer .
Or I can ’t , that ’s not one of my talents .
I ca n’t do that .
So my advice there is that , even if you ’re not a good writer , odds are you ’re probably a pretty good curator .
In terms of finding good content related to your industry , whatever happens to be .
And you can build a community around that , right .
So start a Facebook fan page , or a Linked In group , or something based on whatever market you happen to be in .
So , you know , the common misconception is that , “ Oh , all those little things have already been taken .
There ’s already someone sitting in those spots . ”
But , for most startups and , and , ’ cause we always talk about the , kind of , very popular , kind of mainstream kinds of things and , and markets .
But most startups , like , you know , Pyramid .
Let ’s say Pyramid were starting today .
There ’s a very confined little market that even if there were one or two bloggers or one or two discussion forums , or whatever .
I could play start .
One , it would probably be reasonably successful , because I think people want to talk about their industry regardless to what industry it happens to be .
So that would be my second piece of advice is to find , let ’s say , we ’ll start with Linked In , ’ cause I think it ’s a red - headed stepchild of social media .
Is , is figure out what kind of Linked In groups exist for your industry and either start participating in those , in terms of building credibility .
If there ’s one that ’s already so big that your not going to be able to overcome it or if there is n’t one that ’s that big , does n’t have at least , let ’s say , 500 members .
Start your own and , and build that up .
So , that ’s , yeah .
Andrew : I see .
So , I see that Kirstin Winkler is watching us live .
She ’s really into online education and new forms of education .
Let ’s suppose that she was n’t a good writer .
And I think she happens to be a good writer , now .
The transcript for minute 45 till minute 50 is BELOW this line .
Andrew Warner :
But let us suppose she was n’t a good writer she still wanted to build a community and eventually convert them into customers of a future product , what she would do is she would create an online forum on Linkedin where other writers can talk to each other .
She might create a question and answer site the way you did with Answersdot on Startups.com and let online teachers and other instructors go on there and ask each other questions and answer each others questions .
That ’s the kind of curation that you could do you are saying if you are not a writer .
Dharmesh Shah :
Yeah the idea here is that you have some expertise and passion about whatever your business happens to be and the idea is how do you channel that passion .
Right , so one way is to write it .
That ’s what you enjoy and you are good at , and you can do a video , you can do any number of things , you can build out a community , you can curate , you can do all those things , but the idea is to essentially share that expertise and build that community .
It does n’t have to be through writing .
It can be through any kind of mechanism that basically allows you channel what you know and share with others that you found useful .
Andrew Warner :
The first goal is to just be a magnet , it does n’t have to mean be a magnet as a writer , or be a magnet as a community organizer or host , just be magnet for your community .
Dharmesh Shah :
One thing I will tack onto that , lets say you do have a little bit of money , a little bit of budget , you are going to build a [ ] or whatever , one of those people I think should be a freelance writer , because I think the ROI on that , because there are a lot of journalists out on the market now , and the publishing industry is going through a massive transformation and these people are professionally trained to write , so if you can kind of intersect yourself for the same reason , design is extremely important for web based applications , well not all developers are entrepreneurs , what they do is they partner up with people that understand the importance .
This is along the same lines .
Essentially you are marketing your business or whatever , if you are not that good at writing , that ’s okay , you are good something , go find a writer .
They are not that expensive .
Experiment with that , and if you could someone that can help you craft that content , once again its magical .
Try and pick this up in your
brain and get into other people ’s brain in whatever form you kind of do that essentially .
Andrew Warner :
You are right .
It is really easy today to find good writers on the cheap , relatively cheap .
Lets see .
Before we go onto the next segment of this conversation , boy we have got a lot of different segments here , I feel like every segment here could become a whole interview in itself .
But before we move on to the next one , IC monocat , his real name is Moses but he goes by monocat on Twitter , that is all it gives you , he is saying that he has participated in many webinars hosted by Hubspot , your company , says you are very informative , and then he comes in with a request at the end and he says is there any chance to get a longer free trial for Mixergy fans , and they he made sure to include you in that message so you sign .
Dharmesh Shah : Nice , no right now .
But I say no for this reason , it is that not because I do n’t want to give a longer trial out , it is because the complexity [ ] to the product and convince my team is non trivial .
But I will say this , is that I am in the process of , this is one of the healthy areas of debate with an up spot , is around , should we have much longer trials , should we have indefinite trials , if it is actually a free version of the product , and that is something we are experimenting with .
Andrew Warner :
If you are looking for a guinea pig to experiment on that , I am sure Moses will
Dharmesh Shah : I will track him down .
Andrew Warner :
How do you do with that question Moses , let me know .
Finally angel investing .
Do I have the account right ?
Have you invested in eleven companies ?
Dharmesh Shah : Yeah , I have got eleven investments so far past the last three years .
Andrew Warner : I see here a company called 140 , which is like an app store for Twitter , I see shareaholic in my list here which makes sharing online easy , I think they a Firefox plug - in , we have got Visible Measures which does video metrics , and here this a company that I love , I have n’t used them yet , I discovered just through you in my research today , Backupify , what a great idea , lets you back up all the stuff that you put on different web sites , if they go out of business , if you forget about them , if you forget to pay your bill on one of these photo sites , Backupify apparently lets you have a back up of all the data that you left on those sites so you never lose it , do I have a good understanding what they do by the way ?
Dharmesh Shah : Yeah , that is exactly it .
Andrew Warner :
So those are just four out of eleven and I am sorry to the people who ’s companies I have left off of this list , but what are you looking for , what kind of companies are you investing in ?
Dharmesh Shah :
To me , we see say this all the time but I actually mean it , it is really more about the person and the individual and so there is , I have some broad kind of category , I like internet software , I like capitalization businesses that do n’t do non-tech business , and software companies , all of them are web - based software companies , and what I like are essentially kind of practical but passionate entrepreneurs , people that I like , from an angel investor perspective you invest as an angel for a different reason than a professional investor like a VC might do , yes the return would be nice , but I want to do things that I am actually interested and I can get excited about .
The transcript for minute 50 till minute 55 is BELOW this line .
Interviewee : [ 50:00 ] … get excited about to some degree , so the idea has to have some appeal .
But most importantly I . I ’d like to , like .
I ’d like to see entrepreneurs succeed .
And in my mind , you know , the ones that kind of have an objective , practical view on the world but are still passionate about what they ’re doing kind of fits that profile better .
And obviously I have n’t , you know , been added too , too soon , to actually have exits or anything .
But as I ’ve been having a great time with it .
In terms of , yeah .
So one thing to remember in terms of those looking for angel investments is to rem , remember that in most angel investors are probably more like me in terms of their living vicariously through other entrepreneurs .
It ’s not just about the money .
And , you know , find out what they ’re , what they ’re passionate about .
And , yeah .
Andrew : [ 50:40 ]
And from the conversations I ’ve said from other angel investors .
They , they do n’t end up doing that well .
I mean , it , it ’s , well .
What do you think of that ?
I ’ll .
I ’ll hold off my judgment .
I want to hear it from you .
Interviewee : [ 50:50 ]
Yeah .
I think that ’s true .
Because what ends up happening is that .
There ’s a couple of reasons that contribute to that .
One is , you know , there ’s like .
You drew the Venn Diagram in terms of , or the , the kind of decision tree , let ’s say .
So you make an angel investment in that company .
Let ’s say the idea is really good .
And then it goes off to , like , raise in appreciative rounds of capital , you know .
By the time all is said and done , you ’re gonna have a roughly small fraction of the , of the original .
So , although yes , you ’ll get , you know a , you know , decent returns from the rob a , the numbers are not big enough to move the dial .
And , and the other thing is that it ’s .
You do n’t have the time to spend .
Right ?
So like live due dilligence for probably like ten of the eleven deals was less than twenty - four hours .
Right ?
And due dilligence consisted of .
I either viewed the entrepreneur a little bit before and had dinner with them and said .
OK , well .
Yeah .
This sounds like an interesting thing .
Cause even though I spent more time with you , I ’m not gonna learn anything more than I do right now .
Anyway , and my decisions are n’t going to be any better .
So , I either .
I make a binary choice .
I ’m gonna do it or not do it .
But it ’s .
That ’s not necessarily the best way to invest .
It ’s the best way for me .
Because I ’m an angel investor .
And I have , you know , more money than time .
Essentially since I do n’t have the time to go through the due dilligence process .
And , but yeah .
It ’s a .
It ’s the angel investments .
So it ’s a hard business .
Right ?
It ’s like a wine industry .
They say that , you know , the best way to make millions of dollars is to start with tens of millions of dollars .
It ’s .
Yeah .
So .
Andrew : [ 52:06 ]
So , you do it for the love of the entrepreneur .
You do it for the love of the , of the business .
You do it cause you ’re passionate about this area .
Interviewee : [ 52:13 ]
Yeah .
I do it , because I have a genetic flaw that causes me to continue to like repeatedly inflict upon myself and live with the pain of others when it comes to entrepreneurship .
Andrew : [ 52:21 ]
Will Lam who ’s watching us live is asking .
Are there certain personality attributes that you ’re looking for ?
Interviewee : [ 52:28 ]
Yeah .
The biggest one I think is just objectivity .
So I like .
You know , I like optimists .
I think optimists tend to endure in terms of a , because it ’s gonna be , you know , a rollercoaster ride .
I know that ’s a cliché which I think is true .
But in it .
It ’s interesting , so that .
I like to interact with folks over email or , you know , see what they ’ve written , if they have a blog or something like that .
And objectivity kind of shows through .
It ’s like , OK .
Will this person be able to look reality in the face and say , OK ?
You know ,
The world , the world does n’t owe me anything .
Yes , this is going to be hard .
I ’ve got , you know , 95 percent probability of failing .
But I ’m going to do it anyway .
And , and those are the entrepreneurs I like and I think tend to succeed are the ones that are , are , you know , a mix of optimism and , and realism .
That says , yes .
I , am I gonna be an optimist but says I want to see this idea go through .
But I realize that things are not always gonna go as , as , as designed , as planned .
Andrew : [ 53:17 ]
Let me throw this out there as a theory .
Tell me if I ’m right or wrong about , about angel investors .
I see a lot of entrepreneurs who have great ideas do n’t get any funding .
They do n’t get even an angel investor to come in , not a meaningful one who ’s not , who ’s not related to them .
And then I see others whose ideas obviously evolve .
The first business I .
The first idea that you had very often evolved so much that it ’s completely unrecognizable about a year later .
In fact , I ’m gonna talk to Jason Cohen in a little bit .
Who I know you partnered up with on a site and who says exactly that .
Start somewhere .
And you know you ’re gonna evolve away .
So it ’s not the idea .
And it ’s not necessarily even the intelligence of the entrepreneur .
It seems like it ’s .
If you ’re in the club , you ’re in the club .
Like [ inaudible ] , for example .
I . What I ’ve read about you .
You ’re , you ’re not out there hunting for entrepreneurs .
You ’re not trying to figure out who ’s the , who ’s the most , who ’s the entrepreneur who needs the money the most or deserves the money the most .
You ’re out there saying .
Who do my friends like ?
Who ’s in my world ?
Who do I get to know ?
Who do I like myself ?
And who ’s ideas am I curious enough about to spend time with both the entrepreneur and the idea for the next , I do n’t know , three , five , ten years .
Is that ?
Is any of this true ?
Interviewee : [ 54:23 ]
Yeah .
That ’s a roughly accurate characterization .
So it ’s .
It ’s .
Yeah .
It ’s a little bit more nuance than who ’s in the club and who ’s not .
But it ’s a matter of , you know , that relationship esseor whatever .
That .
I ’m gonna .
I ’m much more likely to support them than I am someone that ’s just completely .
And I ’ve never like appro , proactively approached them …
The transcript for minute 55 till minute 60 is BELOW this line .
Interviewee : and I ’ve never like , proactively approached someone .
Oh , I think your business is really cool .
Will you let me invest ?
That ’s never happened , at least for me .
And I do n’t think most angels do that , either .
Andrew :
So basically , if you want to get an angel to invest in your business , you ’re much better off spending time getting to know them , getting into their world , becoming friends with their friends , hearing their opinions and their friends ’ opinions , than spending time in a room by yourself building out code .
Interviewee : Yeah , and especially for introverted angels like me , which I think we ’re in a relatively decent percentage of the angel population , as were .
You know , we actually like to read and consume stuff .
So if you really want to get our attention or whatever , like , even if I do come across you , like randomly , for whatever reason .
The first thing I ’m going to do is , I ’m going to do a Google search .
I ’m going to find everything you ’ve ever said , written or shared , essentially .
And it ’s , like , that I think the mark of a great entrepreneur today is that someone is , kind of , in the game .
It ’s not just a matter of , oh , I woke up this morning and said , “ this was a great idea .
I ’m going to go build a start - up ” .
You need to kind of put yourself out there a little bit .
And give me evidence that you actually care .
And that ’s relatively easy to figure out .
And if it ’s not easy to figure out , there ’s a problem anyway , in my mind .
That ’s a little opinionated , but .
Andrew :
All right .
You mentioned that you ’re an investor in Venture Hacks .
I thought I read that on Venture Hacks .
I did n’t understand that , that Venture Hacks is a blog though .
That ’s why I did n’t , that ’s why I assumed maybe I misread it .
What is there really to invest in Venture Hacks ?
What are , first of all , it ’s a great site .
I think everybody who ’s reading , listening , watching , anything on Mixergy , should go out and check out Venture Hacks .
And Nivi ’s a terrific friend .
And I think his partner is Naval , right ?
Interviewee : Yup , absolutely .
Andrew :
What ’s the business there that you ’re investing in beyond the blog ?
Interviewee : Yeah , it ’s interesting .
So I ’m in the , I ’m not sure how much I should share because I think Nivi’s , you should interview him , and ask him this question .
But what I will tell you is that , you know , once again , anyone that ’s ever come across Nivi , if you ’ve read Venture Hacks , and said OK , well here ’s a business site , you know , that is out to essentially help entrepreneurs .
And that ’s kind of the broad business angle .
It was very , you know there ’s specifics around it .
They ’re going to go through some iterations , as we all do , but that was initially it , which is OK .
This is a brilliant guy .
He cares .
He shares .
You know he satisfies all my criteria that essentially that I would want in an entrepreneur .
And it happens to be a business that is actually trying to help entrepreneurs .
So it made sense , essentially , and , I think , continues to make sense for me .
So .
Andrew :
All right .
Finally , I often ask a couple of things of everyone who I interview .
The first is , do you have feedback for me on my site , on Mixergy , on the interviews , as you ’ve seen it from here ?
I always like to get that from the people who I interview , especially someone like you who ’s really in the space .
Interviewee : Yeah , well I mean so , a couple of things .
I ’ve been watching the videos for a while .
I think it ’s , I like the long - form format .
I think , one of the things that ’s , it ’s really hard to have a 10 - minute interview , and dig into anything particularly interesting .
So I enjoy that .
So , I think what ’s helped is , I ’m not sure when you started it , but the transcriptions actually help a lot .
Because it helps you , like , there ’s so much content out there .
You ’re prolific , which is great .
There ’s lots of great entrepreneurs .
But it helps to kind of scan transcripts , and say , OK , well , here ’s something I think I ’m going to want to really jump into and save for later .
You do n’t know me that well , it ’s not like me to pander , and I would n’t say this if it were n’t true .
You ’re doing a fantastic job .
These are , um , yep , bring the average down in terms of quality of entrepreneur , but I ’m sure you ’ll bring it up with Jason in future interviews .
Andrew :
No , no , I ’ve been following you , and I ’m so glad that you ’re on here .
And the fact that you ’ve been watching or even are aware of my work , is , uh , makes me really proud of the work that I do here .
And , as you were saying that I said , well I better really make sure now that those transcripts are good .
I keep testing out different ideas on Mechanical Turk .
Now I got to make sure that , beyond testing price and efficiency , that I make sure to go back in and test quality assurance techniques .
The last question is , who else should I be interviewing ?
Who in your network , in your world , is so smart , is so successful that the rest of us entrepreneurs need to be learning from ?
Interviewee : Wow , I have a long list , so I ’ll give you three , actually .
Mike McDerment from FreshBooks , I think , is brilliant .
Um , and has lots of good insight to share , even in the start - up world .
I do n’t know if you know the company .
Drew Houston , from Dropbox .
I ’m not sure , I do n’t think you ’ve interviewed him yet .
Great guy , great entrepreneur .
Adam Smith , from Xobni , I think would be great .
Andrew : OK .
All right .
And it ’s not too early to interview Adam and Drew ?
Interviewee : No . I do n’t think so .
They ’ve lived through a fair amount at this point .
And sometimes it ’s interesting to catch entrepreneurs while they ’re going through that kind of maniacal growth , even though they ’re rough , young entrepreneurs , and they ’re first time entrepreneurs , they got lots of stuff to share , in my mind .
Andrew :
Well , I ’m going to hit you up for an introduction to Drew and Adam , and if they want to do an interview here , I ’d love to have them on here , anytime .
Mike McDerment , you just reminded me , I did an interview with him .
But he actually said a few things in the interview that he would rather not have out publicly , and I offered to edit it out , so I got to send that over to him .
Last thing I want to do here is to hurt the entrepreneur who ’s coming and doing an interview with me .
So , it there ’s something they need me to edit out , I usually can do that pretty quickly .
So , thank you very much for doing this interview .
By David Warren - September 13 , 2009
Those who have played hockey will appreciate the need to keep an eye on the puck .
And those who watch hockey through television are compelled by the cameras to fixate upon it .
Go to the arena , however , and one soon discovers dimensions of the game invisible to the TV viewer .
Much of what happens is in the background , away from this " front line . "
One begins to anticipate such things as passes , a potential breakaway , the risk of an offside .
One begins to grasp , for instance , that a player who is an offensive star may be useless defensively when the play turns ; that others have gifts never previously noticed .
As a kid in small - town Ontario , I had a coach who drummed into me this seemingly Christian principle of " play the puck , not the man " ( " the sin , not the sinner " ) .
It went with not fighting , and not questioning the referee , and I found it was fairly good advice -- for goalies .
In any other position it was better to ignore this coach , for one was confronted on ice with both / and propositions , more often than either / or .
Playing the puck means playing the man , too ; following the puck means following everything .
He was right about referees , however : it is pointless to argue with them .
And fighting makes no sense when you are small .
My heroes were Johnny Bower and Davey Keon .
My reader will now guess I am about to raise again the issue of " political correctness . "
I have written about it twice in the last eight days , in relation to so - called " human rights " commissions , and to the larger process of indoctrination and censorship by which the contemporary Left advances an essentially totalitarian agenda .
The purpose of political correction is to delegitimate opposition ; to make the most basic facts of life undiscussable , and thereby eliminate debate .
It is a device for seizing power .
In my view , the ideological Left advances ruthlessly , by turning the meanings of words upside down , by stating bald lies that we must not dare to challenge , by introducing " reforms " in the dark of the night , often through courts to subvert Parliament .
And when the play turns , they throw an octopus onto the ice .
Moreover , it strikes me that the very discussion of political correctness can serve the Left as such an octopus , or " red herring , " to distract from what is really at issue .
We get our eyes fixated on the puck , when the real play is happening off - camera .
But there is no natural monopoly on the use of illegitimate means to advance an agenda .
From the same small town in Ontario , I can recall the use of such tactics -- intense peer pressure to enforce social conformity ; the manipulation of institutions behind the scenes -- in the service of very different kinds of party interest .
Sin was reduced to a question of public respectability , and hypocrisy became the cover for very sinful acts , hidden behind ostentatious displays of public rectitude .
The Left are human -- it is perhaps the worst thing that can be said against them .
They want what they want for themselves , but they also want praise and " validation . "
The Al Gore phenomenon -- in which a man lives in a house that burns enough electricity to power an African town , but also wants to be the poster boy for green -- is hardly beyond fellow - human comprehension .
The phenomenon becomes more complex , however , and harder for us to follow , as more elaborate ideological poses become the cover for lives more elaborately selfish .
The human lust for power is Protean .
The poet Wallace Stevens expressed this superbly : " Throw away the lights , the definitions , / And say of what you see in the dark / That it is this or that it is that , / But do not use the rotted names . "
Several lines later : " Throw the lights away .
Nothing must stand /
Between you and the shapes you take /
When the crust of shape has been destroyed . "
In plainest English : until a man has confronted himself , he remains a stranger .
It was the wisdom of our ancestors to realize that sanctity excludes posing as a saint .
In the Christian West we once realized that the real battle was not between political forces , or ideological agendas , but between Christ and Satan .
Note well : both of them outside ourselves , both appealing for our allegiance .
The argument of Satan was presented in its simplest form , from the opening of our foundational document ( i.e. the Bible ) .
It was the message of the serpent with the apple : " eat thereof , and you shall be as gods . "
The argument of Christ was , conversely , " Give up all you have and follow me . "
To my mind , behind all questions of political correctness , is the same old background issue : the temptation to think that we can be as gods , that we can write the rules , and force the universe to obey us .
To my mind , it begins with the denial of God , and ends in the inversion of every moral law , and the replacement of reasonable politics with murderous tyranny .
Air France recently became the first airline in the world to offer in - flight cell phone service on international flights .
Using the Mobile On Air service , passengers can send and receive text messages and e-mails .
Air France plans to expand the service soon to voice calls .
Airline passengers who sneak in cell phone calls , play with gaming devices or listen to their mp3 players during takeoff or landing probably wo n't cause a plane crash , but they may risk a confrontation with flight attendants .
Federal agencies and airlines typically err on the side of caution — even though researchers and aircraft companies have found almost no direct evidence of cell phones or other electronic devices interfering with aircraft systems .
Frequent flyers know the familiar drill of only using certain electronic devices at cruising altitudes .
The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) asked the RTCA , an independent industry standards organization , to study the issue of electronic devices on airplanes in 1992 .
The RTCA found no interference and eventually recommended allowing the use of laptops , gaming devices and music players .
Still , it suggested the precaution of banning the use of any and all devices during the critical takeoff and landing phases .
Boeing also investigated several cases in the 1990s where aircraft crews reported that laptop computers or gaming devices caused autopilot disconnects , uncommanded airplane rolls or instrument display malfunctions .
The aircraft manufacturer was never able to replicate the reported anomalies in lab tests .
Cell phones and wireless devices such as laptops represent a different concern .
They emit active transmissions on the electromagnetic spectrum , which is used by devices that include phones , radios and Wi-Fi networks .
But the FCC divided the spectrum into different chunks for different uses , and so a cell phone call should not interfere with the bands reserved for aircraft communications or GPS navigation systems .
Wireless problems stay grounded
It turns out that the ban on wireless devices has a lot more to do with possible interference for ground networks , rather than any danger posed to aircraft systems .
The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) banned in - flight use of most cell phones and wireless devices in 1991 , citing the reason of ground network interference .
FAA regulations uphold the FCC decision .
But some airlines allow passengers to use cell phones in " airplane mode , " which shuts off phone transmissions .
The FCC briefly considered lifting the in - flight ban on wireless devices , but eventually decided in 2007 to keep the current rules in place because there was n't enough evidence to show whether in - flight wireless devices would cause harmful interference with ground networks .
There also was n't evidence demonstrating that the devices do cause interference , but the federal agency decided to play it safe .
An RTCA report commissioned by the FAA in 2006 also cited a lack of evidence , and recommended keeping the current rules on electronic devices .
All the regulations in the world still have n't prevented airline passengers from casually whipping out the cell phone every now and then .
About one to four cell phone calls were made during every commercial flight , according to a 2006 study from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh .
Funnily enough , the FAA even had to advise aircraft crewmembers to turn off their cell phones during takeoff and landing , after an incident in early 2009 .
In that case , a first officer 's ringtone proved potentially distracting during takeoff — but as the crew pointed out , their General Operations Manual did not prohibit them from keeping their cell phones on .
Getting your wireless fix
Travelers who can't part with their wireless Internet connections can now at least pay for in - flight access on a growing number of airlines , or take advantage of a free Wi-Fi holiday deal on Virgin American flights .
Such services use a dedicated chunk of the electromagnetic spectrum reserved for air - to - ground communication .
Cell phone use remains out of the question during flights , and ditto for Internet voice applications such as Skype .
But passengers can at least comfort themselves by knowing that their flight wo n't include anyone yammering loudly on a personal call .
As the FAA notes , a majority of travelers probably prefer the silence .
Mag+ from Bonnier on Vimeo .
As the future of printed magazine is being curved into its possible digital form , we ’ve seen several takes already .
How many of these future gadgets have came out Â anyway ?
Let ’s see , recently there was the CrunchPad which became the JooJoo .
Then there was the rumored Apple Tablet , Time Inc ’s Tablet Magazine , Wired Magazine and even Sports Illustrated showed us their own digital magazine reader .
Now here , we got another take on this Â – Mag+ .
This digital magazine was being Â conceptualized and developed in cooperation with Popular Science magazine ’s publisher Bonnier .
Mag + features scrollable articles which are placed side - to - side in kind of mountain range and are delivered electronically on the device per issue .
Very much like how printed magazines arrive on our hands .
Another feature of the Mag+ is its ability to flip through articles shifting focus and by tapping icons displayed on the screen .
So , Mag+ is definitely a touchscreen magazine tablet .
Â
It will treat magazine articles in appealing format , so as to elicit long - time interest from readers .
Very much like how printed magazines look like , glossy and colorful .
Of course this is still a concept .
But considering the increasing interest on digital ebook ereaders and magazine readers , it is most likely that the Mag+ will actually become a reality .
Actually it should .
Mag+ looks pretty sleek and cool .
It can even give the current crop of ebook readers a run for their money .
Â
The only possible contender that I can see is Apple ’s tablet , if in case it goes to production .

Mankind without religion is a pretty sorry lot .
It has never been able to survive without faith .
Yet , surprisingly agreement is never reached on a such vital subject .
Thus , they have their own zealots who attack the religions of others , the result of which is intolerance and contention .
by Sheikh Mansour LeghaeiInter - group relations , especially when religion is also involved , are full of conflict and suffering .
Martyrology feeds the myths , and prejudice adds bitterness to the legend .
Political expediency and biased scholarship invest the legend with the status of history .
To this end , men have been suffering throughout history from lack of toleration of others ’ beliefs .
With the cry Deus Vult !
( God wills it ) rivers of blood have flowed as a result of religious intolerance .
Crusades , Roman Inquisitions and Holy Offices established by the papacy in the Middle Ages , charged with seeking out , trying , and sentencing persons of heresy , brutal massacres and inhumane torture of Spanish people , and Albigensians of southern France , leave the man of our age with no doubt that intolerance is a very destructive activity .
Thus , in order for us all to survive on this planet it is important that we respect the religious beliefs of others and learn how to exercise a peaceful and harmonious religious coexistence under the principle of ‘ the right to believe as one chooses ’ .
The present leaflet is a brief study of the living in harmony from the Islamic point of view .
From the inadequate material at my disposal , it is not easy to fully construct the issue as it supposes to be .
Nevertheless , there is enough ground in Islam to call for religious peaceful coexistence .
Characteristically , Islam is usually classified as violent , intolerant , oppressive , obscurantist and opposed to enlightenment .
My objective in this paper is to clarify one of the dimensions of this biased opinion .
I will , with the help of God , demonstrate the way Islam treats living in harmony .
Does Islam respect and tolerate religions other than itself , and do their followers have the right to express and practice their own faiths in an Islamic state ?
In a multicultural society where different cultures and religions are practised , should Muslims , from the Islamic perspective , integrate with , or segregate from , other parts of the society ?
This study is also essentially based on the following material : 1. The Holy Quran , as the main source in Islam .
2 .
The Tradition of the Prophet of Islam and his Pure Progeny ( peace be on them ) , as the role models of Islam .
3 .
At the end , however , I have suggested some further resources for in - depth study .
Islam and Religious CoexistenceAlthough the idea of religious liberty and tolerance is a new issue in the West initiated with philosophers of the 18th century like John Locke and M Voltaire , it has always been a simple fact for Muslims , clearly declared in their religion .
A glance at Islamic literature fully supports the idea of religious coexistence .
Islam not only respects other divine religions and acknowledges their rights , but also prohibits any forms of contempt to them .
Any Islamic state is also obliged by Shariah to provide welfare and support to the followers of other divine religions equal to the Muslims .
Islamic Principles to Achieve Religious Coexistence
In order to establish a peaceful religious coexistence in society Islam has suggested four principles : 1 . No Compulsion in ReligionNo doubt , there are different factors involved in forming people ’s opinions and faiths .
The physical structure and the organic compounds , time , place , diet , education and so many other factors have inevitable effects on people ’s faiths .
Thus , the healthy way to change their opinion is to encounter them from their origins .
Utilising force and compulsion not only cannot change the hearts of people , but it may in many instances increase hatred and animosity .
To this end , the Holy Quran clearly denounces the use of the force in terms of religion .
It is ultimately the right of people to choose any religion they are happy with , and the duty of the Prophets is not more than educating people and reminding them of the right path .
They have never been authorised to force people to the Truth .
The following Ayat are the examples of many : 1/1 : “ Let there be no compulsion in religion ; Truth stands clear from error . ”
2:2561/2 : “ If it had been the Lord ’s Will , all who are on earth would have believed .
Will you then compel mankind against their will to believe ? ! ”
10:991/3 : “ Say , the Truth is from your Lord , let him who will believe , and let him who will reject . ”
18:291/4 : “ And you are not the one to overawe them .
Therefore , remind with this Quran those who reverence My warnings . ”
50:451/5 : “ You shall remind , for you are the reminder .
You are not one to manage ( men ’s ) affairs . ”
88:21-221/6 : “ Enlightenment has come to you from your Lord .
As for those who can see , they do so for their own good , and those who turn blind , do so to their own detriment .
I am not your guardian . ”
6:1041/7 : “ If they reject you , then say my work to me and yours to you .
You are free from the responsibility of what I do and I for what you do . ”
10:411/8 : “ The sole duty of the messenger is to deliver the message , and Allah knows everything you declare and everything you conceal . ”
5:991/9 : “ If they argue with you , then say I have simply submitted myself to God ; I and those who follow me .
And you shall proclaim to those who received the scripture as well as those who did not , ‘ would you submit ’ ?
If they submit then they have been guided , but if they turn away , your sole mission is to deliver this message .
God is Seer of all people . ”
3:201/10 : “ You shall obey God and you shall obey the messenger , and beware if you turn away , then know that the sole duty of our messenger is to deliver the message efficiently . ”
5:92 The above Ayat utterly denounce the practice of inquisition and pressuring the followers of other religions in order to change their beliefs .
Nevertheless , preaching and enlightening people is permitted and is the duty of the messengers in a logical manner .
2. Logical Debate and DiscussionIslam whilst respecting other religions and beliefs , may disagree with some of their teachings , finding them illogical , and hence invites their adherents to open discussion and debate in a peaceful and logical manner far from any type of fanaticism and prejudice .
The following Ayat are the examples of this approach : 2/1 : “ And dispute you not with the People of the Book except with means better ( than mere disputation ) unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong .
But say , we believe in the Revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you , our God and your God is One , and it is to Him we submit . ”

Divine Religions , Grades of one SchoolJudaism , Christianity and Islam have a great deal in common .
They are all based on monotheism and are committed to increase justice in the world , and the accountability before God .
Their historic roots go back to Prophet Abraham and , as such , they are often described as ‘ Abrahamic Faith ’ .
They are also the basis of great world civilisations .
Therefore , despite the followers of other religions who consider themselves the chosen nation and the only saved ones , Islam considers all of the divine religions as different grades of the one school .
From the Islamic point of view each new divine religion has been the upgraded version of the previous one , prescribed to complete its teachings .
All of the Prophets are the teachers of one school , teaching different grades according to the requirements of the people of their age .
Hence , if hypothetically all of them descend to earth they were to live together peacefully and each will acknowledge his successor and the one who has come after him .
An old debate has gone around between the followers of different religions as to who will go to hell and who to heaven .
The followers of each religion , with no hesitation claim the eternal life in heaven for themselves , and see hell as the place for all who oppose them .
Islam , despite this fanaticism , suggests a very liberal idea .
The following Ayat are vividly revealing this idea .
3/1 : “ They say : become Jews or Christians if you would be guided .
Say , nay !
( I would rather ) the religion of Abraham , the True , and he joined no gods with Allah .
Say we believe in God , and in what was sent down to us , and in what was sent down to Abraham , Ismail , Isaac , Jacob , and the Patriarchs ; and in what was given to Moses and Jesus , and all the prophets from their Lord .
We make no distinction among any of them .
To Him alone we are submitters . ”
2:135-1363/2 : “ The Religion before Allah is Submission to His Will .
Nor did the people of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other . ”
3:193/3 : “ And they say : none shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian .
Those are their ( vain ) desires .
Say produce your proof if you are truthful .
Yes , whoever submits his whole self to Allah and is a doer of good , he will get his reward with his Lord , on such shall be no fear , nor shall they grieve . ”
2:111-1123/4 : “ Those who believe ( in Islam ) and those who follow the Jewish ( Scriptures ) and the Christians and the Sabians , any who believe in Allah and the Last Day , and work righteousness , shall have their reward with their Lord ; on them shall be no fear , nor shall they grieve . ” 2:624 . The Principle of Righteousness and JusticeThe last suggestion prescribed by Islam , to achieve living in harmony among people of different cultures and religions , is that Islam has always advocated for the principle of justice and righteousness within humankind .
Muslims are encouraged to deal kindly and justly with all people , Muslims and non-Muslims alike with the exception of those who are fighting Muslims .
The Holy Quran revealing the above fact utters : “ Allah forbids you not , with regard to those who fight you not for your faith , nor drive you out of your homes , from dealing kindly and justly with them , for Allah loves those who are just . ”
60:8 Living in Harmony and the Prophetic Traditions Following the Words of God , the Prophet of Islam ( saww ) has emphasized on the issue of religious coexistence with the followers of different divine religions .
The following are some examples of the Prophetic treatment with them .1 . “ Whoever annoys a Dhimmii ( a Jew or Christian living in an Islamic state ) then I am his enemy and whoever I am his enemy I will be his enemy in hereafter .
” 2 . “ Whoever Muslim launches a charge against a chaste Dhimmi he will be punished in the Hereafter with a lash of fire .
” 3 . “ Whoever Muslim acts unjustly with a confederate or diminishes his right or over burden him or takes away something from him out of his desire , then I will be his enemy in the Hereafter .
” 4. Imam Ali ( p ) , the Caliph of Muslims after the Prophet , in his Document of Instruction written to his Governor in Egypt where around 15 million Christians were living , writes : “… Accustom your heart to mercy for the subjects , and to affection and kindness for them .
Do not stand over them like a greedy beast who feels it is enough to devour them , since they are of two kinds , either your brother in religion or one like you in creation . ” Historical Cases1 .
The Time of Prophet Muhammad ( saww ) 1/1 : The Treaty of Sinai :
In the year 2 A.H. the Prophet of Islam signed a treaty with the Christians of Sinai Land which was written by Imam Ali ( a ) .
A part of that treaty reads : “ I ( Prophet Mohammad ) promise that I will not change their priests and monks nor do I expel them from their worshipping places .
I do not prohibit their pilgrims from their travels , nor do I destroy their churches .
I do not convert any churches to mosques and whichever Muslim does so has violated God ’s covenant …
Muslims should not force them to anything .
They must be kind to them and respect them all …
Should their churches require any repair , Muslims should help them as much as they can and they should allow Christians practice their rituals …
” 1/2 : The Treaty of Najran : Najran was a village in the border of Yemen .
The following treaty was signed between the Prophet and the Christians of Najran in the year 9 A.H. in a situation that Muslims with no doubt had an upper hand over the Christians , and yet the Prophet did not take advantage of their miserable situation .
A part of the treaty reads : “ No priest or monk should be expelled from his church or its surroundings .
No Muslim has the right to humiliate them .
Our army shall not occupy their lands …
” It is interesting to note that according to the authority of Halabi when the delegate of the Christians of Najran came to Madina to negotiate the treaty it was the time of their prayer .
They asked the Prophet of Islam if they could pray beforehand .
The Prophet gave them the permission to pray in the Mosque , where they all prayed facing the east .
Despite the sabotage and the mischief that many of the People of the Book were engaged in against Muslims in the beginning of Islam , the Prophet of Islam never deprived them of his blessing and merciful attitude .
He attended their parties ; escorted their dead ; visited their sick , and borrowed from them and loaned to them .
The Following story is an example of many : 1/3 : Respecting a dead Jew :
It is quoted from the authority of Jabir Ibn Abdullah that : “ A Jewish funeral was passing where the Prophet and we were sitting .
The Prophet in respect of the dead body stood up .
We surprisingly asked : ‘O Messenger of Allah !
Is n’t he a Jew ?!’
The Prophet replied : ‘ Was he not a soul ?!’ ” 2. After Prophet Mohammad2/1 : People of the Book are included in Social Security : As it mentioned in Islamic Jurisprudence , it is the duty of the Islamic State to cover the basic expenditure of retired citizens irrespective of their culture and faith .
Muslim jurists from the first century of Islam have opened a particular chapter in which they have approved that non-Muslims should enjoy equal right for Social Security .
Also , it is the duty of the State to cover their basic expenditures from the Public Treasury if they are old or unable to work .
The following story is one of their proofs : Imam Ali ( p ) was passing by a road .
He saw an old beggar asking people for help .
He asked his companions who the man was ?
“ He is a Christian ” , replied the companions .
Imam
Ali while he looking upset said : ‘ You used him as much as he could work for you , and now that he is old and unable , you have left him behind !
Make sure you provide him a reasonable life from the treasury .
’2/2 : Justice for All :
As mentioned earlier in this paper , Islam is the religion of justice .
According to the Holy Quran , the provision of social justice is one of the major purposes of the dispatching of Prophets to humanity .
The following story reveals the spirit of social justice in an Islamic society .
“ Imam Ali , the Caliph of Muslims , was sitting at the Mosque of Kofa .
Abdullah Ibn Qofl a Jewish man from the tribe of Tamim passed by holding armour at hand .
Imam
Ali recognising the armour enquired as to where he had taken the armour from , for it had already been stolen from the treasury ?
The Jewish man , trusting Islamic justice agreed to follow the Imam to court .
Shorayh , the Judge of the court was the delegate of Imam Ali .
The Imam asked the Judge to ignore the background of both of parties and issue a just verdict .
Utilising the Islamic judicial methodology the Jewish man won the case against the Caliph of the Muslims and the man was not found guilty .
Nevertheless , as soon as he left the court , his conscious smote him , and he was impressed by the Islamic justice .
He then turned back to the court and confessed that he had found the armour somewhere on the way and was happy now to return it to the treasury .
Upon his confession Imam Ali gave him a gift and the man converted to Islam .
” 2/3 : Do n’t Forget Your Neighbour : One of the servants of Ibn Abbas , the companion of the Prophet , narrates : “ One day we slaughtered a sheep at home .
Ibn Abbas told me to leave a share for our neighbor who happened to be a Jew .
He repeated his statement several times until I asked him why he was so much concerned about that Jewish neighbour .
He replied : The Prophet of Islam advised us so much about our neighbours that I ’m afraid he may have a share in my inheritance .
” 2/4 : A Grand Muslim Clergy ’s Poetry Eulogises a non-Muslim ClergySayyed Radhi , the collector of Nahjul - Balagha ( The Peak of Eloquence ) and one of the greatest Muslim clergies of the fourth century of Islam wrote an eulogy in memory of Abu Ishaq Assabi , one of his contemporary clergymen who was a Sabian .
After being criticized by some narrow - minded Muslims , his answer was I eulogized his knowledge .
Georgi Zaydan after quoting several stories as above concludes : “ Muslims of early Islam , after conquering a new land , would not interfere in the internal affairs of the inhabitants of that place .
Christians were all free to practice their own culture and rituals .
They even did not interfere with papal edicts of Constantine regarding Christians of Damascus ...
Muslim Caliphs would never force any non-Muslim to convert to Islam .
They were even participating in some of their religious celebrations such as Christmas and Palm Sunday .
If a school or hospital was built by the Islamic State Muslims , non-Muslims would enjoy those facilities equally . ”

I am returning to Europe from a few days away .
At the weekend I was travelling on the New York subway and in the underground world where all eyes avoid each other a man with a very loud booming voice began talking about the hungry .
He was collecting money and pointed out that in this holiday season thousands would be dependent on charity .
Like with most metros , subways and undergrounds he got few takers .
On Fifth Avenue volunteers from the Salvation Army stand outside most of the big stores .
I spoke briefly to one woman who said the food banks had never been in such demand and in danger of running out .
A few more conversations filled in the picture .
One in eight Americans and one in four US children are fed with the help of food stamps .

There are nearly 700,000 homeless people .
It can remain true that if you lose your job you lose your home .
Now I mention this because you will not find such dramatic figures anywhere in Europe .
The safety nets are part of the social contract and most Europeans would not want the harsher world of the United States .
So , when you travel around Europe , you can escape noticing we are in recession .
The pain is less than in the United States .
Many Europeans take satisfaction in this .
But as the world emerges from the recession another argument will start .
Is it the European or American model that will create new jobs quicker , that will produce the greater number of start - up companies , that will more enthusiastically embrace the new technologies , that will be better prepared to compete in the global market ?
The answers cannot be known yet , but in the months ahead I will be looking at how Europe , with its safety nets , bounces back .
Facebook has released some startling figures today , which underlines just how big the site has become .
Speaking to journalists at the UK headquarters , with TechRadar in attendance , Facebook revealed just how many people log on each day and the stats are pretty mind - blowing .
The company also noted that one of its apps , ' Farmville ' , is more popular than its major rival in the social - networking world – Twitter .
Here come the numbers : worldwide Facebook is clocking up 200 billion page views a month , with 350 million users globally logging into the site .
When it comes to the site 's online chat function , 1.6 billion messages are sent every single day and 2.5 billion photos uploaded a month ( around a thousand a second ) .
Facebook is also now hitting 23 million unique users a month in the UK , with each of those people logging on spending around 25 minutes on the website a day .
With so many users , Facebook is keen to push itself beyond that of a place that you come to see what your friends are up to .
Part of the movement
In a video , founder Mark Zuckerberg called Facebook " a movement not a website " and noted that now is " a magical time for the company , as we are way closer to the beginning than the end . "
This was re-iterated by Facebook 's Head of Strategy and Planning , Trevor Johnson , who told TechRadar : " The Facebook experience for every individual is different .
We have changed the site a lot , and we hope users keep up with these things .
" The site 's now made up of many elements – apps , homepage , games , groups . "
To prove the popularity of these extra-curricular sections of Facebook , Johnson explained : " Applications make up a huge part of Facebook .
There are over 90,000 applications on Facebook .
" 69 million active users are using FarmVille alone , that 's more users than Twitter . "
Interestingly , Facebook noted that its demographic is getting older , with the 35 + category growing the fastest and 53 per cent of all those who log on in a month come back on a daily basis .
" Facebook is not just about adding photos and gaining friends , it 's integrated in lives , " notes Johnson .
Twitter may well be the website of the moment , but one glance at these figures show that it 's still got a long way to go if it wants to truly dominate in this social - networked world .
In 2007 , the Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) refused to stake a firm position on how fast and how high sea levels would rise .
The IPCC claimed that , while there was widespread agreement on sea level rise due to thermal expansion of seawater , scientists did not yet know enough about how the ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica would respond to climate disruption .
The science has advanced considerably since 2007 and the majority of the new results ( for example , this paper , this paper , and this consensus statement from earlier this year ) have confirmed that the IPCC estimates were too low .
Two recent studies measuring different changes on the Greenland and Antarctic ice shelves have added more evidence that sea levels are going to rise higher and faster than the IPCC estimates .
One used highly accurate measurements of the changes in ice sheet thickness to estimate how much ice was exiting the ice caps on Greenland and Antarctica via glaciers dumping ice into the ocean .
The other used the GRACE gravity measurement satellites to estimate the total amount of mass being lost from Antarctica .
Both found significant losses in ice , but GRACE found something more significant – a loss of ice mass from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet , a mass of ice that was previously believed to be stable or even adding ice mass .
Laser altimetry bounces a laser off the surface of the earth to measure how far the surface is from the satellite , and as the satellite passes over the surface , changes in surface ’s height can be tracked over months and years .
The first study , published in the journal Nature , use laser altimetry to determine whether the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica were getting thicker or thinner , and the results revealed significant thinning of the ice sheets along their edges .
The Greenland data revealed that the majority of the ice cap ’s edges showing significant thinning , with those areas feeding fast - flowing glaciers thinning the most .
Only a few areas showed thickening , and most of those were in the interior and / or above 2000 m altitude .
As the ice thins , the total mass of ice going into the ocean increases and sea level rises .
However , the authors could n’t estimate how much ice was being lost due to thinning because most of Greenland is thinning at a slow enough rate that it did n’t exceed the detection limit and so was n’t considered significant .
Even so , the fast moving glaciers thinned dramatically , and in three areas the thinning has penetrated deep into the ice sheet – at the outlet glaciers Jakobshavn Isbrae , Helheim , and Kangerdlugssuaq , where thinning is detectable 120 , 95 , and 100 km inland .
Jakobshavn Isbrae glacier is one of the largest outlet glaciers , draining 6.5 % of the Greenland ice cap .
Helheim and Kangerdlugssuaq are known for having accellerated unexpectedly and retreated from the coast rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s .
The Nature study ’s conclusions on Antarctica provide another independent confirmation of what scientists have known for a long time – the West Antarctic Ice Sheet ( WAIS ) is thinning dramatically .
In addition , there are areas of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet ( EAIS ) that are thinning as well , although the bulk of the EAIS appeared to be relatively stable between 2003 and 2007 .
And the authors found that some parts of the WAIS were actually thickening , even as the outlet glaciers were thinning .
These results led the authors to conclude that air temperatures are less a factor in the loss of ice mass than changes in ocean temperature and currents .
The areas that thinned the fastest were those where the outlet glaciers ground out into the ocean in areas where warm water can melt the bottoms of the glacier , speeding it up by reducing friction on the sea bottom .
The authors say
This is an apparently widespread phenomenon that does not require climate warming sufficient to initiate ice - shelf surface melt .
( emphasis mine )
Furthermore , the authors conclude that the thinning of the ice sheets at their edges is “ more sensitive , pervasive , enduring , and important than previously realized . ”
While the laser altimetry study had difficulties determining the mass lost to thinning and melt , the GRACE satellite measures mass directly , albeit over a much larger spatial area than a reflected laser beam .
And according to the study , published in the journal Nature Geoscience , not only has there been significant mass loss from the WAIS , the previously stable EAIS is apparently losing mass as well .
If the EAIS were to melt significantly , it would add a massive amount of water to the oceans and dramatically increase sea level rise , especially since melting of the EAIS has not been included in the climate models .
Something to notice is that the two studies agree with each other qualitatively – the areas that are the reddest in the image above are the areas with the most thinning .
They match the bluest areas in the figure at right , which have the greatest mass loss .
According to the GRACE study , the WAIS lost 132 ± 26
Gt of ice per year while the EAIS lost 57 ± 52 Gt per year over the period from 2002 to 2009 .
According to the paper , the large error in both regions is largely a result of limitations in the model of post - glacial rebound in Antarctica , but the larger EAIS error is a result of barometric pressure problems that occur over the EAIS but not over the WAIS .
Regardless , the error is still smaller than the estimated loss of ice mass , and the combined total ( 190 ± 77 Gt per year ) shows that the Antarctic ice sheets are losing mass .
Furthermore , the EAIS data from two areas where there ’s been the most change show a potential breakpoint at around 2006 , as seen below
If a breakpoint really did occur , then the ice loss from 2006 - 2009 would be greater than the average over the period of 2002 - 2009 .
Instead of 190 ± 77
Gt per year , the actual loss could be as high as 220 ± 89 Gt per year .
Taken in combination , these two papers support the conclusion that sea level rise is very likely to be greater than the IPCC estimated in 2007 , and may in fact exceed recent estimates .
Combined with another paper that suggests ice sheets and sea level are more tightly coupled to climate changes and carbon dioxide than previously believed , these papers should probably be read as a serious warning about the future of the world ’s coastal areas .
Thanks to Dr. Pritchard and Dr. Chen , primary authors on the two papers discussed above , for providing review copies of their work .

VIEWPOINT
Andy Atkins
The UN climate summit in Copenhagen must not become another talking shop , bogged down by divisions and confusion , says Andy Atkins .
In this week 's Green Room , he calls on leaders of industrialised nations to deliver on their " legal and moral " duty to cut global emissions .
People are rising up to demand real action on climate change
A wave of blue swept through the centre of London on Saturday .
Fifty thousand people donned blue coats , scarves and gloves , and took to the streets to call for a strong and fair climate agreement at the key UN summit in Copenhagen .
As the blue throngs passed close by Downing Street , Gordon Brown woke up to people power and invited a handful of marchers - including myself - into Number 10 to talk to him .
The UK prime minister looked like he was listening intently to the marchers , but he has already said that he has given up on reaching a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen , saying that for now we will have to settle for a political agreement instead .
This is misleading .
Most rich countries are already signed up to legally binding targets as part of the Kyoto Protocol , and cuts that should be made beyond 2012 are supposed to be set in Copenhagen .
But the detail of international climate negotiations is so complex it is barely accessible to those outside the bubble of the negotiations .
This murkiness can be used to the advantage of political leaders ; when things get shaky , they can hide behind the confusion .
' Loud and clear ' Gordon Brown has to go to Copenhagen shouting loud and clear about rich countries ' legal and moral duty to take the lead in cutting their emissions and to provide funds to combat climate change internationally .
The West 's addiction to oil is not sustainable , says Andy Atkins Rich countries are responsible for three - quarters of the emissions in the atmosphere today .
The poorest 10 % of the world 's population have contributed less than 1 % of the carbon emissions currently in the atmosphere .
Yet these people are the first to feel the devastating effects of climate change on their lives and livelihoods .
It is only fair that rich countries compensate the developing world financially for this damage .
At Friends of the Earth , we believe that rich countries should put new public money on the table to enable the developing world to grow in a clean , green way and enable them to adapt to the storms , droughts , famine and floods caused by climate change .
We must transform our economy through tried and tested measures that are proven to have worked in the past , such as carbon taxes , tougher emissions standards and a big increase in public investment to tackle the climate crisis .
Unfortunately , the solutions currently being pushed by rich countries at the talks are much more risky .
British negotiators are still pushing hard for the expansion of the global carbon market .
The basic idea is that a factory with a cap of a thousand tonnes of carbon dioxide a year , and only emitting nine hundred can sell the right to emit the remainder on the open market .
The system 's backers claim it will reduce emissions and provide cash to invest further in cutting greenhouse gases .
' Double whammy '
Friends of the Earth recently released a report called Dangerous Obsession that revealed that the banks , investment funds were packaging carbon credits into increasingly complex financial products , similar to sub - prime mortgages , which triggered the recent economic crash .
Carbon trading has yet to prove its value in cutting emissions , say critics
This risks a double whammy of financial and environmental disaster .
The evidence tells us that carbon trading does n't even work .
The EU trading scheme failed to deliver emissions cuts in its first few years and is unlikely to do much better its next phase , because once again too many permits have been handed out to polluters .
The scheme also allows European businesses to duck out of making their emissions reductions at home by offsetting - which means paying for cuts to be made overseas instead .
Trading also means politicians and industry are not taking the bold steps needed to cut emissions through investment in a massive rollout of renewable energy and energy efficiency .
The time it will take to extend carbon markets global will mean precious years wasted when governments could be taken action which is already proven to work .
It is time for rich countries like the UK to show leadership .
Gordon Brown must listen to those 50,000 pairs of feet that marched through London on Saturday .
People are rising up to demand real action on climate change .
Mr Brown must commit to ambitious , legally binding targets under the Kyoto Protocol to slash our emissions , abandon the UK 's promotion of dangerous gambles like carbon trading and provide public money for developing countries .
To shirk this responsibility would be nothing short of devastating - for our economy , the planet and millions of its poorest people .
Andy Atkins is executive director of Friends of the Earth UK The Green Room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with Andy Atkins ?
Do rich nations have a legal and moral obligation to lead the battle against climate change ?
Should rich nations use their wealth to pay for developing nations to build clean energy infrastructures ?
Or is carbon trading the best option in a global context to reduce emissions ?
The " Global Warming Consesus " has evidence to be faulty .
The " rush " for global warming policy seems to be lead by chicken littles rather than sound judgement .
The " poor " of the world are subject to unwise dwelling settlements and political strife rather than just victims of their climate catastrophies .
I disagree we must act now .
As for " rich countries " [ the USA mainly ] , nuclear and natural gas energy sources are , ironically , blocked by politicians and leaders of global warming alarmists .
Even wind power is blocked by " clean energy " politicians and activists .
Two growing industrial nations , China and India , have NO PLANS to curb emmisions .
Nor do these two countries even accept a " peak " emissions output .
Until technology allows efficient production of zero emmision energy sources , nuclear and natural gas NEED to be the transition energy sources to reduce emissions .
I have yet to see ANY US politician lead this idea .
Thank you .
Patrick , Oregon , USA Cap and Trade is a lethal farce .
Once again all other values ( beauty , health , survival ) are subordinated to bankster greed - schemes .
Enough !
A cap needs to be put on banks as well as industry .
The only way to stop polluting is to stop polluting .
Mark Conlan , USA
Do rich nations have a legal and moral obligation to lead the battle against climte change ?
No .
Not in the slightest .
Considering that just two decades ago the top scientists were crying out over global COOLING and the fact that the validity of datasets created by both UK's CRU and the USA NASA data are being called into question should give all parties concerned significant pause .
Instead of rushing headlong down a road which we know not where it leads would it not be in the most rational and logical of manners to actually have the facts straight before we make decisions which will cripple economies ?
Should rich nations use their wealth to pay for developing nations to build clean energy infrastructures .
Again , no .
Share technolgy ?
Absolutely .
Outright pay for it ?
Not a chance .
Mr Atkins shrill cries are typical of those seeking rigid and wide flung limitations on business .
What makes him all the more dangerours is that his foundation is that of one on shifting sand .
Keith , Queens , NY ; USA " The World " or North America and Europe , which often mistake themselves for the world .
Are super polluters China , India and Russia clamoring for the changes as much as Sweden with a GNP less than Switzerland ?
And , Carbon trading is a sham solution where you buy the credit for charitable works from those doing them already to make the world a better place .
Rudy C. , Brookfield Ohio
No I do n't , the science is n't settled .
After Climategate the global warming alarmists and the media have started name calling against the sceptics who have every right to ask the questions .
Why should the average person suffer tremendously financially through a decision based on science with an undecided or uncertain conclusion .
With the aspects of the media , politicians and some leading scientists using misleading stats and data .
Obviously the BBC would n't agree with such a statement , considering recent statements by your ' journalists ' saying the science is settled and everyone who does n't agree is a heretic ( in no uncertain terms ) .
Why should people be unable to answer important questions about something that results in dire consequences both for liberty and finance .
1. UN Taxation ( being taxed to breath included ) 2 .
Loss of liberty which will result in keeping track of carbon emitted .
3 . Move towards a UN centred Political structure , losing more of our national sovereignty .
I loved Gordon Browns flat earther statement concerning sceptics , fact is global warming debate does n't allow scepticism just as flat earthers did n't .
Both were mainstream viewpoints at the time , with both calling those who opposed it heretics .
Mark , Gloucester Rich nations do not have any obligation .
The whole idea of carbon emmissions is based on corrupt data and emotions about the envirment based on that bad data .
Global warming is and has been a hoax since the phrase was first uttered !
David Jonesq , Batesville Arkansas Atkins and his chicken littles are clueless as usual , USA did not sign up for Kyoto and most American are very concerned about the environment , but for an entire package which includes all pollutants .
We are not ready to send the World 's economy back to the Stone Age for a ginned up Looney movement .
What Americans have always wanted is for humans to be good stewards of this planet we call Earth , but with a stead rational approach .
Bob Skinner , Santa Ana , CA , USA
Money got us into this mess .
Crude oil and the money made from its refinement and sale not to mention all the other big business derived from it , such as the automobile industry .
Should we have shared the first use of fire ?
People need to realise it is not about the money it is about the survival of us all .
We should see this as a war which we started and are loosing , a war with ourselves one which we can not win without a fundamental change in our appreciation of ourselves and our plant .
Please excuse the drama but if aliens came down and started to heat the planet to make it their home , or scoop out our ozone layer for themselves .
The Americans would be the first to launch an attack the world would unite to save itself .
Sadly we do not see the fact that we are the aliens doing the damage we just carry on seeing the changes in the abstract terms as if watching it all on a big screen .
It is not real just words .
John E Warren , Manchester
How did so many of the richer nations become that way ?
By exploiting the resources , assets and people through trade and empire for hundreds of years .
Whether through tax on currency speculation , or green taxes ( for all that can afford them ) I believe it 's the least we can do .
We have the opportunity to work in partnership with developing nations to help them develop low carbon and carbon reductive technologies and products , which will in turn ensure a cheap supply of these resources for ourselves .
Carbon trading has had its place , but now the credits being traded exceed the low emissions we need to avoid runaway climate change .
A better use of time , money and resources would be to concentrate on preserving the natural resources that stabilize weather patterns , reducing energy wastage , and investing in fast working local green offsets such as biochar and tillage .
Lucy Wills , London Irritating leftist drivel that is totally out of touch with reality .
If I am not mistaken , our consumption of energy has been in many instances been used in the production of food and generation of capital that has been used to continually prop up and feed these poorest populations .
Yet after tens of trillions of dollars in aid , these countries continue to be corrupt disasters .
But poor , sweet Andy feels it is our obligation to continue pouring money down these rat holes for another noble purpose .
Andy , if you would like to significantly reduce hot gases in the atmosphere ... quit breathing .
John Underhill , Greenville , USA
Yes , I strongly agree with Andy .
Rich nations do have a legal and moral obligation to lead the battle against climate change .
Andy is right , we did make the mess .

Before you go and declare victory , you had better get your science house in order .
Have you not heard about the CRU scandal ( climate - gate ) ?
How about holding a world scientific forum with both sides of the debate represented to work through these issues before plunging the world into some new form of taxation that it cannot afford .
Or do dissenting voices matter in this new world ?

Wealthy nations definitely have a moral obligation to lead the way against climate change , especially since they have created 3/4's of the problem and since the developing nations do not have the resources to afford the eco solutions .
Barbara Greer , Brooks , CA , USA I believe fighting climate change is a losing battle - mostly because I think the earth 's climate is in it's own cycle and our carbon output is probably not effecting it as much as politically correct scientists want us to think .
That said however , I do believe that our carbon usage relates directly to pollution and also to using up natural resources that are either becoming scarce , or at least more expensive to reap , and so I do agree that the rich nations , ESPEICALLY THE USA , should do more than their fair share of moving away from energy generated from coal & oil to cleaner , environmentally superior sources .
Additionally , by helping the 3rd world grow their energy industry via renewable sources will hopefully circumvent their dependence on dirty , imported coal & oil .
So , while I may not agree on the reasons why - I do believe that rich nations have a moral obligation to help the rest of the world build clean energy infrastructures .
George B , Kansas City , MO USA
Nice long comment from a climate activist .
Fair enough , interesting points .
I however sincerely hope that the BBC will also provide space for someone to make the argument that making sustantial CO2 reduction a high priority would be misguided and not an optimal way to spend scarce resources in the light of more pressing global problems .
If it does not , this will be clearly indicative of bias on this issue , in my view .
wang , Brussels , Belgium ' rich countries should put new public money on the table ' ... so has Andy Atkins and FoE given up on the lobbying of rich countries to honour their long - standing commitment to commit 0.7 % of GDP to overseas development assistance ?
It 's taken nearly 40 years of lamentable failure to honour this commitment ( which would release instantly $ 120 - 140 billion from North to South ) ; why do you think this new tack under a climate change pledge is any more likely to work ?

J Story , BC , Canada Carbon trading is an ineffective smoke - screen ( pardon the pun ) that allows big business to continue as usual .

Carolyn Riddle , Othello , WA , US If the ' UN climate summit ' had been the ' UN Climate and Population Summit ' then arguably the summit would have more relevance and more could be achieved .
By leaving ' population ' most significantly out of the equation , I think that the summit will not achieve any more than providing politicians with more ' hot air ' .
Except , of course , that a new wave of taxation will result for our UK government to send more taxpayer 's money into the ' black - hole ' called ' overseas ' .
The global climate is deteriorating first and foremost because of massive population growth and the resultant demands on carbon fuels .
This is a matter of ' cause and effect ' - a basic tenet of all science - but - How is it that 15,000 delegates in Copenhagen will be ' failing to put the cart before the horse ' ?
James , Manchester Controlling global warming is an opportunity to fix three major world problems ; climate change , third world poverty and population growth .
Market forces can produce beneficial effects if a global , simple and fair system is agreed .
Since most of the world 's population are emitters of carbon dioxide , emissions are the wrong thing to control .
We need to control fossil fuel production .
A global cap and trade agreement of a quota on fossil fuel production that tapers down to sustainable levels would work .
To be fair the quota should be assigned to countries in proportion to their population .
The quota would then be traded , distributing wealth to less developed countries .
If a country 's future quota was inversely related to its population growth , population reduction would be encouraged .
Three world problems fixed .
Martin Corney , Plymouth UK
" It 's time to end the double speak and take meaningful action for the sake of our children and grandchildren . "

If you genuinely think we have a " climate emergency " , the last thing you ought to be doing is reproducing .
All those years of extra resource demand , especially at Western levels , yet not a peep out of FoE on the subject .
I wonder why ?

Too many people want GW to be true :
Western Govs - M- East oil dependency & slowing developing nations .
The Media - doomsday stories sells copy !
Scientists - get money for research , just by mentioning GW in it .
Environmental groups - ' proves ' pollution scares .
Anti-Capital / Globalisation - supports ' rollback ' philosophy .
This rolling snowball of political and media driven scare stories creates a taboo that no one can challenge .
At the centre is the IPCC - a political body ( not scientific ) that publishes scientific reports that even its own scientists do n't agree with .
What a shame for science !
Rob , Cheltenham I have mixed feelings with the article of Andy Atkins .
Yes , rich nations have a legal and moral obligation to battle against climate change .
Because , due to industrial revolution they become rich in the world and this industrialization releases various gases like carbon - dioxide and methane which are known to contribute to Global Warming .
Definitely , rich nation should use their wealth to pay for developing nations to build clean energy infrastructure .
Engr Salam , Kushtia , Bangladesh
The answers are simple :
Yes we rich nations do have a legal and moral obligation to combat climate change , because we caused it .
Yes we should use our wealth to help developing nations produce clean renewable energy , because the vast majority of that wealth was created by us relying on dirty unsustainable energy .
And no , carbon trading is not the answer .
It is an excuse for not doing anything tangible about the problem .
We are quite capable of doing exactly what is required - replace our energy creation infrastructure with renewables , and at the same time reduce our consumption by massive efficiency improvements .
So why do we delay ?
In my opinion , the only reason can be that this is a fundamental question of greed and fear - those in privileged positions want to maintain their comfort , and would do anything to avoid change .
Even to the extent of ignoring the overwhelming consensus of scientific evidence , or worse , consistently working to discredit it by creating denial propaganda .
Even to the extent of letting poor nations be destroyed .
Even to the extent of letting the only life - supporting planet in the known universe die .

Meet Mr. Ibrahim ( a pseudonym to protect him from reprisals ) , a 23 - year old Palestinian refugee living in the West Bank .
Unlike those descendents of refugees born in United Nations camps , Mr. Ibrahim fled his birthplace just two years ago .
And he was n't running away from Israelis , but from his Palestinian brethren in Gaza .

Only a few pieces of the aircraft have been recovered " Black box " flight recorders should be modified to emit signals for longer , experts investigating June 's Air France disaster over the Atlantic have said .
Their inquiry into why the flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed has been hampered by the failure to find the jet 's recorders .
Investigators said underwater beacons on recorders should emit signals for 90 days rather than 30 , in a report .
All 228 on board died in the accident , the worst in the airline 's history .
The report , by France 's BEA air accident authority , said the cause of the crash was still not known .
The reliability of speed sensors on the Airbus A330 has been questioned and BEA experts have suggested that new safety standards might be needed .
" At this stage , despite the extensive analyses carried out by the BEA on the basis of the available information , it is still not possible to understand the causes and the circumstances of the accident , " the BEA report said .
Another recommendation was that passenger planes flying over the sea should be equipped with an extra beacon transmitting on a different frequency , which would increase the chances of finding the wreckage .
We can't really say we are satisfied , because there has been no answer
John Clemes , brother of victim
The report - the second since the crash - added that problems with speed probes on the doomed flight AF 447 were one factor in a series of events that led to the crash , but not the only cause .
A string of automated messages just before the crash showed there were inconsistencies in data from the sensors , known as pitot tubes .
BEA said safety tests on the equipment did not replicate high - altitude conditions and it called for more studies of cloud masses and icy conditions .
Families of victims have said they are disappointed by the failure to find a cause of the disaster .
" We can't really say we are satisfied , because there has been no answer .
We do n't know exactly what happened , " said John Clemes , vice - president of the association of victims ' families .
Mr Clemes , whose brother was on the flight , said they had been told by investigators that the plane fell into the sea in less than five minutes and that the pilots had battled to save it .
" Some things were reset in the last minute , so they were obviously trying to desperately get the plane back under control , " he said .
A new search to find the recorders - believed to be at a depth of nearly 19,000 ft feet ( 6,000 m ) - is planned for February .

Along with the former officials , they provided few details about the targets of the raids in Iraq and Afghanistan , although they said that many of the Iraq raids were directed against members of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
To corroborate the claims of the company ’s involvement , a former Blackwater security guard provided photographs to The Times that he said he took during the raids .
They showed detainees and armed men whom he and a former company official identified as Blackwater employees .
The former intelligence officials said that Blackwater ’s work with the C.I.A. in Iraq and Afghanistan had grown out of its early contracts with the spy agency to provide security for the C.I.A. stations in both countries .

In 2007 , an Iraqi traffic police officer inspected a destroyed car in a square in Baghdad , where Blackwater guards killed 17 people in an incident that stirred outrage among Iraqis .
Credit ... Khalid Mohammed / Associated Press
In the spring of 2002 , Erik Prince , the founder of Blackwater , offered to help the spy agency guard its makeshift Afghan station in the Ariana Hotel in Kabul .
Not long after Mr. Prince signed the security contract with Alvin B. Krongard , then the C.I.A. ’s third - ranking official , dozens of Blackwater personnel  many of them former members of units of the Navy Seals or Army Delta Force  were sent to provide perimeter security for the C.I.A. station .
But the company ’s role soon changed as Blackwater operatives began accompanying C.I.A. case officers on missions , according to former employees and intelligence officials .
A similar progression happened in Iraq , where Blackwater was first hired for “ static security ” of the Baghdad station .
In addition , Blackwater was charged with providing personal security for C.I.A. officers wherever they traveled in the two countries .
That meant that Blackwater personnel accompanied the officers even on offensive operations sometimes begun in conjunction with Delta Force or Navy Seals teams .
A former senior C.I.A. official said that Blackwater ’s role expanded in 2005 as the Iraqi insurgency intensified .
Fearful of the death or capture of one of its officers , the agency banned officers from leaving the Green Zone in Baghdad without security escorts , the official said .
That gave Blackwater greater influence over C.I.A. clandestine operations , since company personnel helped decide the safest way to conduct the missions .
The former American intelligence officials said that Blackwater guards were supposed to only provide perimeter security during raids , leaving it up to C.I.A. officers and Special Operations military personnel to capture or kill suspected insurgents or other targets .
1827 : The " No child left unvaccinated " act becomes the law for Boston schools .
Smallpox was a deadly , disgusting disease , with the nasty habit of killing one - third of those who contracted the disease , and maiming those who were fortunate enough to survive it .
Boston 's declaration came just three decades after Edward Jenner discovered in 1796 that blister pus from those infected with the less - deadly cowpox could be used to immunize humans from smallpox .
Following Massachusetts ' lead , cities and states across the United States passed laws throughout the 19th century requiring citizens and schoolchildren to be vaccinated ( . pdf ) against smallpox in hopes of eradicating the disease .
Such rules were n't universally loved , and in 1905 , the Supreme Court heard a challenge to Massachusetts ' mandatory vaccination law .
The court ruled , in Jacobson v. Massachusetts that the city of Cambridge had the right to require everyone over 21 to be vaccinated against smallpox or be fined $ 5 ( about $ 120 in today 's money ) .
The court disputed Jacobson 's argument that a compulsory vaccination violated his
Constitutional rights , ruling that " the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person , to be , at all times and in all circumstances wholly free from restraint . "
Despite smallpox 's simple treatment and the laws mandating it , smallpox is estimated to have killed between 300 and 500 million people in the 20th century .
In what is considered a triumph of modern medicine , the World Health organization eradicated smallpox in 1979 after a decade - long search - and - destroy mission .
To this day , all states require students to be inoculated , typically against diphtheria , measles , rubella and polio .
However , most states provide exemptions for parents who have religious , medical and sometimes philosophical reasons for not having their child immunized .
Scientifically unfounded fears that vaccines cause autism have recently led many parents , particularly those in wealthy areas like Marin County , California , to forgo vaccinations , despite the risks of disease .

This morning , Stephen Colbert , host of " The Colbert Report " & right - wing alter ego of Stephen Colbert , has been served with a legal document called a writ of replevin by schoolteacher Robt Seda - Schreiber .
It demands the return of Captain America 's shield to its rightful owner .
Two years ago Joe Quesada appeared on the Colbert Show to give Stephen the shield after Cap 's death in the comics .
But now Steve Rogers appears to be returning to life , there 's still a matter of the adamantium / vibranium alloy weapon .
Robt tells Bleeding Cool that " I am willing to negotiate with Mr. Colbert .
I would think he would like to keep Captain America 's shield in his so - called " Eagle 's Nest " & I am willing to discuss terms by which he could do so .
I truly hope that we will be able to reach an amicable & fair agreement & we can settle this before it becomes an ugly & embarrassing courtroom spectacle . "
So say we all .
Here is that writ in full .
I present here the best general interest true films I 've found .
I define true films as documentaries , educational films , instructional how - to's , and what the British call factuals - a non-fiction visual account .
As dogged as I have been in tracking down great true films , I have seen only a fraction of the estimated 40,000 that have been made .
So I am ready for more .
However I will only list true films and documentaries that are available as VHS tape or DVDs at consumer prices .
In other words , films that are easy for most people to see upon request .
I wo n't include films that are only shown in theaters , or available via high - priced rentals , or simply out of print .
If you know of an available amazing true film that I 've missed please recommend it to me .
This film is a useful and serious extended prank .
An Indian - American kid from New Jersey returned from a guru quest in India convinced gurus were only ordinary people with the job title of “ guru . ”
The documentary begins when he decides to become a fake guru to prove that people only project guru - ness onto ordinary people like himself .
He takes the name Kumare , adds a fantasy backstory , plus a made - up religion with made - up rituals and invented yoga moves .
Over the span of four months he gathers a room - full of true believers in Arizona ( filming the whole time ) , and teaches them that they “ have a guru inside them ” and that he is just an illusion .
Much to his surprise he finds himself deeply bonding with his students who claim he is really helping them .
He ’s a pretty good guru !
This makes his final “ unveiling ” or confession to them all the more painful , riveting , and uncomfortable even for viewers .
Unlike the prank movie Borat , this one has a point , and it is a complex , unexpected , and subtle point .
Are the people who follow him really fools , is Kumare ’s deceit really noble , and will the now enlightened disciples be furious or forgiving ?
The true parable is spellbinding , funny , moving , and profound .
A must - see . — KK Kumare

This is another one of those films that is far more interesting than the title would suggest .
It follows the unlikely trajectory of a black kid from the tough side of Baltimore who finds his genius as the invisible soul of a furry puppet with a high voice on public TV .
In a flash of inspiration after many decades of struggling as an unknown puppeteer , Kevin Clash re-invents Elmo as a being who radiates unconditional love , and thus elevates this overlooked character ( and himself ) into universal stardom .
( After this film was released Clash resigned over sexual accusations , but it does not detract from brilliance of his creations , or his impact on our culture . )
The insight offered in the film that even puppets have to be ABOUT something , was worth the ride for me .
It is also a pretty good view into the dynamics of what makes the foam Muppets believable as beings .

This film will move you back in time while he connects you with the neolithic painters who worked their art .
Despite the vast time shift , and the geographic relocation , and the inaccessibility of the cave , you will feel , as Herzog intends , that these were painted by your uncle just last week .
They will make sense and you ’ll feel you made a journey .

This is an amazing film .
What would happen if you raised a chimp as a human in an ordinary home and taught it sign language from infancy ?
Would it learn language ?
A professor and his hippie girlfriends tried this experiment during the 1970s with a chimp named Nim .
Everyone of the dozen of humans who raised and cared for the chimp , bonded and communicated with Nim as if he were human .
Nim was raised by a free - love mother who never disciplined him .
When he got too strong to handle he was sent off to an animal farm where a long - haired hippy befriended him , and hung out everyday with him for years ; he and Nim often smoked joints together .
The farm ran into financial difficulties so , despite the outrage of his human family , Nim the “ talking ” chimp was sold to a research center where he was the subject of “ medical experiments . ”
Finally he was rescued .
Amazingly , Nim was filmed for much of his life so the director was able to put together this fantastic visual biography .
Woven together with interviews from all the principle characters in Nim ’s life we get an intimate record of this grand but misguided adventure .
A hundred questions are raised by the experiment and many are answered by this superbly crafted film .
I recommend it highly .

This small portrait of over - educated parking lot attendants in a college town is surprisingly entertaining .
The guys profiled rank at the bottom of society ’s status , but become the “ Gods of the Corner Lot ” and enter into a constant battle with the owners of expensive cars and SUVs .
Their whole war with the “ parkers ” is all in their heads , and since they spend a lot of time sitting in their tiny shack doing nothing , they live in their heads .
The great joy of this film is that it gets you into their big heads .

Bill Cunningham is the long - time photographer for the New York Times who , at 80 years old , still rides his bike around the streets of New York shooting street fashion — or folk fashion — what people actually wear .
Today there are hundreds of blogs chronicling this vernacular fashion , but for decades Bill Cunningham was the only one .
He is an odd , but sweet genius .
He unfashionably has worn the same blue blazer for 30 years , works all the time , ignores money , lives by himself in a tiny closet of an apartment stuffed with his photo negatives , and is a man marching to the beat of his own drum .
There is a legitimate zen quality to his style and manner .
While his subjects may be swayed by wealth , celebrity , and the superficial , he seems immune to them .
This film is not about fashion ; it ’s about someone who has successfully invented their own occupation , and their life .
It is uplifting .
I smiled the whole time watching it .

This is a great film about very ordinary people trying to break out of their humdrum lives .
The subjects are the type of people who once seem utterly odd , but now … less so .
They are the folks who dress up in historical costumes and role play in fantasy worlds .
They are members of Darkon , a live - action role - playing game that ’s been continuing for 25 years .
Every two weekends hundreds of Darkon enthusiasts take over parks in the DC area and stage physical battles for imaginary cells on a paper map .
They use foam padded weapons with intricate rules of combat .
Everyone takes the game and their roles almost creepily seriously .
The elf clan speaks elfish to each other !
It ’s a combination of martial arts , Dungeons & Dragons , re-enactments , World of Warcraft , and a 25 - year strategy board game .
Sales clerks become white knights , house dads become heroes .
Maybe .
We follow the dreams of an upstart wannabe king as he challenges the reigning imperial army to several foam battles .
It is what he lives for .
The entire time this film magically transverses that very thin line between : grow up , “ it ’s only a game ” and “ all life is a game , ” this too counts .
The extreme dedication of these multitudes to this surrogate world is both pathetic and totally inspiring .
Their enthusiasm is no more misplaced than say someone who spends years trying to put a tiny white ball in a hole in the grass .
But it is a hundred times more creative .
This film captures the immense passion by which these misfits pursue their vocation .
It ’s a great view of the human spirit .
All hail Darkon ! — KK Darkon

Think of this as a documentary version of Inception .
There are layers of truth and fiction that lead down many levels .
The subjects being filmed are sometimes also making the film , and sometimes the subject of a real obsessive documentarian , but it is never clear what level you are watching .
On the first level this is a documentation of street art beginning in the 1990s — and at this level alone it is worth watching .
Street art means not just graffiti and stickers , but ironic stenciling , performance art , and even pranks in the manner of the guy who nailed his own painting on the walls of the Museum of Modern Art .
That guy was the street artist Banksy , famous for both brilliant pranks and for keeping his real name and face unknown .
For the first time Banksy is filmed in in action , pixelated .
But who is filming him in this documentary ?
Is Banksy directing or someone else ?
This film itself is a prank about street pranks .
It is a piece of street art , as much as a documentary can be , as indicated by its title reference to the moneyed art world of galleries ( please exit through the gift shop ) .
It is a fun ride and its intimate journey into late night urban art will really help you appreciate what street artists are trying to do ( way beyond vandalism ) , and why it probably is the art of our times .

Last week we added new data to the geocoding service that resolves addresses down to their exact location
This means that we are now able to return two latitude / longitude pairs per address - one that represents the middle of the address land parcel ( for Display ) , and one for where the address connects to the road network .
Fortunately , this is one of those features where a picture is worth a thousand words , so I will stop trying to explain it and just show some differences
Address Point Geocoding difference
The red star shows where a regular geocoding data set would place the address
The blue star shows where we now tell you the center of the address parcel
The green star shows where we know the address connects to the road network
The red star shows where a regular geocoding data set would place the address
The blue star shows where we now tell you the center of the address parcel
The green star shows where we know the address connects to the road network
In the screenshot above , the red star represents where a regular interpolated geocode would place the address on the road .
Regular geocoding data does not actually contain every single address on a road .
instead , it normally contains the length of the road , and the range of house numbers along the length or the road ( e.g : 1-99 Main Street ) .
So if you looked for 50 Main Street , math would be used to work out the approximate location of where # 50 probably is between # 1 and # 99
However , with the new Address Point data , we know the actual physical location of each particular house .
So , in the screenshot above , the blue star shows us the center of the physical land parcel - as you can see , its a LOT more accurate !.
Then the green star shows where the actual address connects to the road network , so we can really deliver you right to the doorstep of the location you are trying to get to .
Here is where we need your help , faithful reader .
Adding Address Point Data represents a massive increase in the size of the data we are using in our geocoding service , and we are load - testing before we roll out to full production .
Please take the time to hit our Beta geocoding service at http://platform.beta.mapquest.com/geocoding as much as possible .
when using the service the response will inform you if it has resolved to a Point in two different ways .
Firstly , the GeocodeQuality node contains a pure text description like this ( JSON ) : geocodeQuality : " Point "
Secondly , the GeocodeQualityCode will start with a " P1 " for the granularity value - like this : geocodeQualityCode : " L1AAA "
For a full understanding of the geocodequalitycode value and what the different response values mean , the GeocodeQuality Code page in the documentation breaks it all down
Lets finish this post with some more screenshots that show the accuracy difference of address point versus interpolated geocoding
While everything was happening it was all too quick to process , but now that it HAS happened , I feel like I need to chronicle the series of random events that led to this taking place .
So here 's the story :
It all started when my co-worker ( jkb83 ) and I decided to have a Montreal meet up for the secret santa gift exchange .
It was her idea , and I skeptically tagged along to see what would happen .
We always wanted to meet more Redditors , we absolutely love this community , but we feel so isolated sometimes , no one we knew frequents the site or understands us when we start talking about narwhals or 4 paperclips .
We tracked down close to 20 participants in the secret santa from the redditgifts.com website very close to where we live , and submitted a post to have us all meet up and open gifts together .
I have to say , I was skeptical , I kept saying no one will show up , and for a good 20 min no one did .
But then they started walking in .
We noticed them .
Carrying boxes with orangered envelopes , and aliens posted on their jackets .
It felt pretty awesome finally meeting other Redditors .
We had a blast too .
We opened gifts together , some were in awe at how much stalking their Secret Santa had to do to get them their gift , and some were a little freaked out , but we shared stories and enjoyed each other 's company .
We parted ways promising to meet up again soon .
Little did we know a few days later some of us would be seeing each other under very unexpected circumstances .
A picture of us at the meetup gets posted in the r/secretsanta , and someone from Radio Canada ( CBC ) in Montreal , picks up the story and messages all of us to come in for a radio interview ( thanks dfawlt ) .
Somewhere in between getting phone interviewed and coming to terms with the madness of this whole thing jkb83 gets a call from CBC Television that they want to cover this interesting story on the news .
She was with family , she could n't make it , so she passed the torch on to me .
I did n't feel like I should be doing this at all .
I was n't prepared , we had 3 hours notice , it was surreal , and even though in no way do I see myself as a spokesperson for reddit or secret santa , someone had to represent .
So despite my hesitation , and intense fear of doing a live show , I decided to do it .
I rushed to get ready , and prepared a whole set of notes about different stats to mention , and heartwarming stories to share , there 's so much , I was getting overwhelmed .
This was too much responsibility for a lowly grad student like myself .
I was carrying all the awesomeness of Reddit on my shoulders .
Let me tell you , it was quite heavy .
It was pretty surreal walking up to the CBC Studios ,
I really could n't believe I was actually going to be on television within a few minutes .
I met up with another member of the Montreal secret santa gathering and we were shown to the make - up room !
After that , Christy ( pic ) took us on a tour of the CBC studios .
She let us take pics , but suggested we avoid using flash .
Here are some cool pics from the trip :
This lady has a lot of work piled up for her !
How'd this guy get past security ?
After we had our fun , we were taken to the studio where we were going to do the interview ( pic ) .
I was starting to get nervous .
Kept looking at this little script I wrote out and printed right before coming , making sure I mention everything I need to , and do n't make a fool of myself on TV !
Before I knew it , we were sitting in the chairs , got our microphones on ( pic ) , and the interview began ( pic ) .
My nervousness began to cease as I tried so hard to keep the topic on track , and the awesomeness of the Reddit secret santa in perspective .
However , time ran out , and I could n't finish saying all I wanted to say .
They were all really nice at CBC ( pic ) , I would love to go back , but I 'd doubt they 'd let us in past security this time !
So here 's what I would have said if given the chance :
Thank you Kickme444 and 5days and all the organizing committee for such a wonderfully executed international Secret Santa gift exchange , I hated Christmas before this , it was a miserable time for me , but taking part in this was both fun and rewarding in more ways than one .
Something about sharing a part of the Christmas tradition with a complete stranger made me realize that there 's more to this season than the things I hate .
It made me realize how much I enjoy giving .
How happy it made me to see fellow Redditors post up their gifts in the gallery , sharing their stories , and gratitude for the flattering thoughtfulness of a stranger .
Also thanks to my fabulous coworker and friend jkb83 who was responsible for the Montreal Secret Santa meet up that led to all this crazy publicity !
And most importantly to you the Reddit community at large .
I love you .
That is all .
Was your ancestor a cannibal ?
And were their victims HAPPY to be eaten ?
It 's a spine - chilling discovery - hundreds of expertly - butchered human bones that suggest cannibalism was rife among early man .
What 's even more shocking is that the victims may have been HAPPY to be eaten ...
The birds are singing and the forest floor is dappled with sunlight .
You can hear the sound of a babbling stream , running into the great river not far off to the east .
Sharp ears might hear the drumming of a woodpecker or , high above , the cry of a sparrowhawk .
In a forest clearing , scattered with red campion and wood anemone , butterflies are
dancing in the sunbeams .
The air is warm and still .
It could be a quiet woodland anywhere in Britain today .
Spine - chilling :
The burial site finding seems to show that our ancestors were cannibals as recently as 7,000 years ago
Then there comes the sound of footfalls rustling the fallen leaves .
Something is approaching from the dark heart of the forest .
The figures step into the clearing - and you see that this is no modern woodland .
This is prehistoric Europe , 7,000 years ago .
First , comes a group of shuffling people , heads bowed .
There are men , women and children , some as young as six .
At least one of the women is pregnant .
They are wearing simple tunics of animal skin , mostly deerskin , cured and softened by beating with wooden paddles .
The men are heavily bearded and everyone has long hair .
But these people have their hands tied behind their backs with twists of grass and sedge and they are shuffling because their ankles have been tied .
Their hair has been bound up as well , leaving their pale necks bare - as if in readiness .
Behind them follows a very different group .
Warriors of magnificent physique , naked to the waist , broad - chested and strongly muscled .
Their bare flesh is heavily decorated with tattoos made by their women with the dye of madder and woad , using the pinpricks of bone needles .
They show spirals and whorls , symbols of magical power in the hunt , flaming suns , the eyes of wolves .
The warriors carry long , ash spears tipped with hand - shaped flints as sharp as shards of broken glass , and blunt - headed stone clubs hanging from loops on broad oxhide belts .
Behind them come their women , almost all of them either pregnant or with infants in their arms .
Wide - eyed , grubby children trot at their sides .
And further back , gliding among the trees at the edge of the clearing like wraiths , circle the witch doctors , or shamans .
There are only glimpses of these outlandishly decorated figures wearing wreaths of oak leaves and necklaces made of wolves ' and bears ' teeth .
They carry skin drums and bone drumsticks .
As they circle the clearing , they begin a murmurous chanting to their gods - who demand sacrifice .
The shuffling victims , knowing what they must do , kneel down obediently in a line in front of a shallow pit .
The warriors stand behind them .
First , they set down their spears and then they reach for the stone clubs in their belts .
Scene of death : Hundreds of bones are being excavated at the site in Herxheim , southwestern Germany
The sacrificial victims , with their heads bowed , are quite silent and still , as if they have already passed into the other world .
The warriors raise the clubs high above their heads , and the murmuring and drumming of the shamans in the shadows grows louder and louder .
The women of the tribe , expert butchers all , are watching intently , using their thumbs to test the edges of their lethally sharp flint knives for keenness .
For after the killing will come the feasting .
With a great cry , the stone clubs descend .
Frightened birds rise up from the trees crying out and vanish away to the west .
Fires are lit - it will soon be time for the cannibal feast to begin .
The spine - chilling discovery this week of mass cannibalism in Germany 7,000 years ago is as unexpected as it is gruesome .
Some of the details emerging sound as horrible as anything dreamed up in a ghoulish horror film .
The bodies found at Herxheim had been skinned , the bones expertly butchered in precisely the way you would joint a pig , and then smashed open so the sweet , juicy marrow could be sucked out .
Ribs were broken away from the spine or snapped back to reveal internal organs , tongues were cut out and the heads were neatly scalped to get at the brain - as you would lop the top off a boiled egg .
Some of the victims - who may have numbered many hundreds at this site alone - appear to have been spit- roasted .
Hannibal Lecter , eat your heart out .
Other details are not just gruesome , but downright shocking .
Not only children were eaten , but unborn babies , too .
Our immediate reaction is to recoil in disgust .
What sort of people could do things like that , even 7,000 years ago ?
Experts have already suggested this ancient atrocity may simply have been a desperate last act by a starving people .
After all , under terrible circumstances , similar things have happened far more recently .
During the terrible siege of Leningrad in World War II , for example , emaciated citizens , having eaten all the birds , dogs and rats in the city , finally resorted to feasting on their own kind .
Indeed , experts have speculated that 7,000 years ago , Europe may have been in the grip of dramatic climate change , with widespread famine and social collapse following in its wake .
Yet the marks of butchery at Herxheim have every appearance of being not desperate , but careful , methodical , even ritualistic .
Is it possible that cannibalism was not a desperate act , but something altogether more commonplace ?
It is hard to tell .
The definition of prehistory is that it predates written records - history begins with the written word .
The earliest clay tablets come from the Sumerian culture of around 3,000BC .
So how can we know anything about life in Stone Age Europe ?
The answer is archaeology - and the revelations are truly startling .
The theory that the people of Herxheim turned to cannibalism at a time of famine makes little sense .
The time from 9,000 to 5,000 BC is called the Holocene Climate Optimum , which makes it sound like a nice afternoon on a Mediterranean beach .
And , more or less , it was .
As well as being warmer than today - and that 's without the contribution of cars and power stations - the climate was extremely stable .
It was perfect for sustaining human life .
So , no famine .
We know other things about their lives as well .
The study of language is a more surprising way back into the remote past .
Place names , especially for rivers , can be amazingly old , predating the Anglo - Saxon we speak .
The names of the rivers Itchen , Wey , Colne and Humber are thought to be pre-Celtic - in use since at least 500 BC .
Think of that the next time you drive past Weybridge .
Studies :
The bones found point to the victims being scalped and skinned before being expertly butchered
It is probable the contemporaries of the Herxheim cannibals called the area they lived in something similar .
Language experts at Reading University recently revealed that some of the most common words we use today could be an astonishing 20,000 years old .
Words such as ' I ' , ' you ' and ' we ' , and numbers such as ' one ' , ' two ' and ' three ' , have changed little over 20,000 years .
Words that modern Germans would recognise could even have been used by the Herxheim cannibals .
We can reimagine the prehistoric wildlife and landscape of Herxheim well enough , too .
A warm and equable climate , vast tracts of forest , mostly mature oak , ash and beech , with just a few manmade clearings .
The animal life would have been largely familiar to us , with some absences - no pheasants , for instance .
They were introduced from Asia by the Romans .
But there would have been many more large and dangerous animals .
Grey wolves , brown bears and the massive European bison , which is bigger than the American bison , with tiny populations still surviving today in Eastern Europe .
They can be 7ft tall at the shoulder and weigh more than 140 stone .
Just as terrifying to those forestdwelling Stone Age tribes people , though also a good source of meat when they could kill one , would have been the auroch - now extinct wild cattle that were even bigger than bison and were famously ferocious .
And the cannibals ?
They would certainly have had much in common with the tribal people who still survive in remote areas today , their way of life relatively untouched by the modern world .
Nature and fertility would have been all - important ; they would have worshipped sun gods , water gods , moon gods and doubtless bison gods .
Their religion would have combined elements of shamanism and ancestor worship , and the heart of their beliefs would have been the eternal cycle of life , death and rebirth .
We are presuming the cannibalism at Herxheim was an act of desperation and that those eaten were victims , but this is not the only way to regard it .
It may be that in Stone Age Europe , to be eaten by the tribe was an honour .
In Sir James Frazer 's vast and magisterial survey of ancient tribal beliefs and practices , The Golden Bough , published in 12 mighty volumes between 1890 and 1915 , he recounts numerous examples of ancient tribal rituals that to us seem utterly alien .
And yet they tell us a great deal about what might have been going on at Herxheim 7,000 years ago .
When the work was written , many tribes around the world still ate the enemies they killed in battle - especially an enemy who had died with conspicuous courage .
Among the Basuto of Southern Africa , Frazer records , the liver of the vanquished would be eaten to impart bravery , the ears to pass on his intelligence and his testicles to give strength .
The rest of the body would be burned to ash , ground to powder and made into a paste in the horn of a bull to be administered to the warriors on special occasions .
This was nothing to do with the scrabbling desperation of a starving people , but a highly ordered , solemn and even reverent religious ritual .
Doubts :
The site at Herxheim , as shown on the map , was unlikely to be experiencing drought at the time of the killings
In the wars between the British Empire and African tribes in the 19th century , clashes between a modern industrialised nation and Stone Age tribes people , cannibalism reared its head .
In 1824 , the commander of the British expeditionary force , Sir Charles McCarthy , was killed in battle against the Ashanti .
His heart was then devoured by the tribal chiefs .
For the Regency gentleman back in Britain , this would have seemed like the most conclusive evidence imaginable that the Africans were nothing but savages .
But are we making the same mistaken judgment about the cannibals of Herxheim ?
For the true reason the Ashanti ate McCarthy 's heart was not in malicious triumph , a sign they despised him or the fact they were savages , but because they so admired his valour and the heroic way he had fought and died .
They wanted literally to ingest those qualities themselves .
His bones were long kept in the temple of the Ashanti at Kumasi as relics of great power , not in mockery , but in the same way that saints ' bones were kept in medieval cathedrals - with the greatest reverence .
His skull was rimmed in purest gold and used for years by the kings of the Ashanti as a ceremonial drinking vessel .
Or take the example of the Mayans in Central America .
Theirs was essentially a Stone Age civilisation , and yet one that developed the most advanced astronomy and mathematics .
Yet another thing about Mayan culture tells us something quite extraordinary about how they viewed this world .
They played a primitive kind of football in great stone stadia , which you can visit in Honduras and Guatemala .
The football match was n't a sporting occasion ; it was a religious ritual .
At the end of the match , the winning team was led to an altar and sacrificed .
Yes , the winning team .
It is almost beyond our comprehension .
Would n't you try pretty hard not to score a goal and perhaps even pop in a few home goals for good measure ?
But this is a 21st - century view .
For those ancient Mayan warriors , to win and be sacrificed was the highest honour .
Only the most perfect beings , the greatest heroes , were sacrificed .
After death , they would go to the great Hall of Heroes and live in perpetual bliss .
Can we be so sure that our German cannibals in their Rhineland forests were just a bunch of savage , grunting , Stone Age Hannibal Lecters ?
Only a little later than them , on the island Malta , another Stone Age people built a beautiful < cite >
Hypogeum </ cite > or underground tomb for their dead .
It is the most astonishing prehistoric site I have visited , more evocative and beautifully haunting even than Stonehenge .
There , many thousands of years ago , a nameless people reverently buried their loved ones .
Excavations - have found one small tomb holding the skeleton of a little girl .
Beside her lay the tiny skeleton of a puppy , which had been deliberately killed , cradled for ever in her arms .
Again , our first reaction might be disgust : ' Just because the poor child had died , that was no reason to kill her puppy , too . '
But this is to look down the wrong end of the telescope .
For those early people , death was most certainly not the end .
To them , the little Maltese girl was going off on her great journey into the next life , alone and a little frightened .
What greater kindness could there be than to send her beloved puppy after her , to keep her company ?
Thus understood , these bones become some of the most moving artefacts in archaeology .
We will never know for sure the truth about the Stone Age tribes people of Herxheim .
We will never know their names , or the names of their gods , nor exactly why they ate their dead .
But if we consider what we know of other cultures around the world , the mysterious truth might be that , rather than a frenzied orgy of cruelty , killing and cannibalism , what really happened there 7,000 years ago was a ritual of tender reverence .

Obama's " stimulus " is doing quite the bang up job creating jobs , is n't it ?
In my time , we knew that jobs were created by small businesses and that the best way to stimulate small business growth was with tax cuts and deregulation — the government needs to get out of the way of the American entrepreneur .
Instead , all we see is a radical increase in the tax burden ( which itself is being borne by a smaller percentage of tax paying citizens ) and the government is doing everything it can to strangle innovation and the American way with overregulation and a massive expansion of government control .
Everyone Loves Gold ... Time to Sell ?
Gold gained yet another powerful ally yesterday — hedge fund icon Paul Tudor Jones .
The man who famously called Black Monday in 1987 and the Nikkei crash a few years later now thinks “ gold appears to be cheap . ”
In a note to his investors , Tudor said , “ I have never been a gold bug .
It is just an asset that , like everything else in life , has its time and place .
And now is that time … gold ’s value should increase as its scarcity relative to printed currencies increases . ”
So gold is now publicly loved by armchair investors , famous hedge fund managers and central banks … even as we write , Erin Burnett is “ squawking ” about it on CNBC .
Are your contrarian senses tingling yet ?
“ So many hedge fund managers and pundits are singing the same tune : long gold and short U.S. Treasuries , ” our friend Dan Denning wrote in today ’s Daily Reckoning .
“ The bond bubble could go on much longer than anyone expects .
And when so many people agree on something , none of them are usually right .
As a contrarian , you ’d be worried about becoming a victim right about now .
“ But yes , in the long term , the end of the Super Cycle in fiat money results in the remonetization of gold .
That is what you ’re seeing now .
And it ’s probably what you ’ll see for a few more years .
It also ought to benefit other precious metals , and , of course , precious metals shares . ”
In the meantime , if you ’re the charting type , this might help :
From our overly simplistic trading point of view , gold has sustained a well - defined range during its latest record rise .
If it breaks outside this range , especially to the downside , traders might be quick to take profits .
What conceivable excuse have these " law enforcement agencies " , including the Police or HM Revenue and Customs , got for bribing anyone whatsoever ?
Conversely , they are giving any " law enforcement agency " , an unfathomable exemption from bribery offences , " for the prevention or detection " of Serious Crime .
This includes Local Authority Trading Standards or Environmental Health departments , who are notorious for their lack of expertise and training , when it comes to " simple " Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act use of Covert Human Intelligence Sources .
Note that there are no provisions to strengthen the legislation against corrupt lobbying by Members of the House of Commons or of the House of Lords or of senior Whitehall Sir Humphreys . .
Incredibly , it appears that this Labour Government still intends to make it illegal for , say the Secret Intelligence Service MI6 to bribe a Foreign Government official for information or influence , even where this serves the United Kingdom 's national security interests .
For some reason it has been introduced by Jack Straw 's Ministry of ( In ) Justice in the House of Lords .
Another bit of proposed legislation , which will hopefully be lost due to the forthcoming General Election , is the flawed Bribery Bill 2009
12 Defence for certain bribery offences : legitimate purposes
(1) It is a defence for a person charged with a relevant bribery offence to prove that the person 's conduct was necessary for --
( a ) the prevention , detection or investigation by , or on behalf of , a law enforcement agency of serious crime ,
No !!!
- this is far too broad !
Neither the Police , nor the HM Revenue and Customs , nor the UK Borders Agency nor Local Authority Trading Standards Departments , nor the Home Office 's " anti-fraud " designated private sector partners , nor the myriad of other quangos and non-departmental public bodies and agencies etc. should ever be allowed to even contemplate bribery of UK government officials or private companies or individuals !
( b ) the proper exercise of any function of the Security Service , the Secret Intelligence Service
We saw the obvious need for this exemption back in 2001 - why has it taken this incopetent Labour government so long to correct the legislative blunders they made back in 2001 ?
One of the worse than useless bits of unnecessary and counterproductive legislation pushed through by the notorious former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett , was the Anti Terrorism Crime and Security Act 200 Part 12 Bribery and Corruption sections 108 to 110 .
( ATCSA Part 12 )
This incompetently draughted legislation , which was guillotined through the Commons , without proper scrutiny , is intended to be repealed by this Bribery Bill .
ATCSA Part 12 has no exemption or statutory defence for the Secret Intelligence Service MI6 or the Security Service MI5 .
How have they managed to recruit spies and informers working for foreign governments without , in many cases , offering them money i.e. bribery , according to the laws of many foreign countries ?
or GCHQ , or
What obviously applies to SIS and MI5 certainly does not apply to GCHQ .
The Government ' s electronic intelligence , gathering , processing and analysis people in Cheltenham etc. should have no expertise or business in running or recruiting foreign Covert Human Intelligence Sources i.e. spies .
GCHQ has no conceivable excuse for bribing anyone !
( c ) the proper exercise of any function of the armed forces when engaged
on active service .
Since World War 2 , it has been a standard part of , say , an aircraft crew 's survival pack ( or that issued to Special Forces personnel operating behind enemy lines ) , to include money and / or gold bullion etc. to help them escape back to safety , if they parachute over enemy territory
Dealing with local tribal chiefs in say Afghanistan must involve payments which would otherwise fall under this Bribery Bill , so Armed Fores on Active Service should also be obviously exempt .
Just like MI6 and MI5 , they are not exempt from ATCSA Part 12 .
(2) In this section -- " active service " means service in -- ( a ) an action or operation against an enemy ,
( b ) an operation outside the British Islands for the protection of life or property , or
( c ) the military occupation of a foreign country or territory , " armed forces " means Her Majesty 's forces ( within the meaning of the Armed Forces Act 2006 ) , " detection " , in relation to serious crime , includes -- ( a ) establishing by whom , for what purpose , by what means and generally in what circumstances any such crime was committed , and ( b ) the apprehension of the person by whom any such crime was committed , " enemy " has the same meaning as in the Act of 2006 ,
Unclear draughting - which " Act of 2006 " ?
They probably mean the Armed Forces Act 2006 .
" GCHQ " has the meaning given by section 3 ( 3 ) of the Intelligence Services Act 1994 , " law enforcement agency " means a public authority acting in pursuance of a duty of a public nature under the law of any part of the United Kingdom to prevent , detect or investigate crime ,
No !!
This is exactly how the 8 or so full time law enforcement and intelligence agencies which were initially granted extraordinary legal powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 , later bloated out to hundreds of Local Authorities and quangos like the Egg Marketing Board etc. who all have " a duty of a public nature under the law ... to prevent , detect or investigate crime "
" public authority " has the same meaning as in section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 , " relevant bribery offence " means -- ( a ) an offence under section 1 which would not also be an offence under section 6 , ( b ) an offence under section 2 , ( c ) an offence of attempting or conspiring to commit , or of inciting the commission of , an offence falling within paragraph ( a ) or ( b ) , or
( d ) an offence under Part 2 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 ( encouraging or assisting crime ) in relation to an offence falling within paragraph ( a ) or ( b ) , " serious crime " has the same meaning as in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 ( see section 81 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) .
Astonishingly , the Bribery Bill 2009 Explanatory Notes clause 12
" Relevant bribery offence " does not include a clause 1 offence which would also amount to an offence of bribing a foreign public official under clause 6 .
This addresses concerns raised by the Joint Committee on the 2003 draft Corruption Bill in relation to , in particular , compliance with the UK 's obligations under the OECD Convention ( see HL 157 and HC 705 , 31st July 2003 ) .
So perhaps SIS and MI6 will still not be able to legally ( under UK law at least ) buy information or influence from foreign officials , even when UK national security is at stake , something which is insanely perverse .
It is inconceivable that the other OECD member countries do not have " national security " exemptions like this .
Surely someone in the House of Lords can amend this Bribery Bill to give only SIS and MI5 and Armed Forces on Active Service an exemption to this , and to get rid of any exemptions for the hundreds of generalised " law enforcement agencies " ?
The moment of truth for health care is at hand , and the distortion that perhaps gets the most traction is this :
We have the greatest health care system in the world .
Sure , it has flaws , but it saves lives in ways that other countries can only dream of .
Abroad , people sit on waiting lists for months , so why should we squander billions of dollars to mess with a system that is the envy of the world ?
As Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama puts it , President Obama ’s plans amount to “ the first step in destroying the best health care system the world has ever known . ”
That self - aggrandizing delusion may be the single greatest myth in the health care debate .
In fact , America ’s health care system is worse than Slover , oops , more on that later .
The United States ranks 31st in life expectancy ( tied with Kuwait and Chile ) , according to the latest World Health Organization figures .
We rank 37th in infant mortality ( partly because of many premature births ) and 34th in maternal mortality .
A child in the United States is two - and - a - half times as likely to die by age 5 as in Singapore or Sweden , and an American woman is 11 times as likely to die in childbirth as a woman in Ireland .
Canadians live longer than Americans do after kidney transplants and after dialysis , and that may be typical of cross - border differences .
One review examined 10 studies of how the American and Canadian systems dealt with various medical issues .
The United States did better in two , Canada did better in five and in three they were similar or it was difficult to determine .

New Laws Add to Employer ’s Challenges in the New Year
By Dunn , Carney , Allen , Higgins & Tongue
In January 2010 , Oregon employers will be taking on several new challenges thanks to a host of new or expanded laws enacted by the Oregon Legislature .
Dunn Carney ’s Employment & Labor Team is committed to helping its clients and friends understand the new obligations and ensure the transition to compliance with these new requirements is a smooth one …
“ The Big Six ” are all effective January 1 , 2010 , unless otherwise noted below .
Private - Employee Whistleblower Protection
In January , the scope of protection given to Oregon ’s whistleblowers who work for private sector employers will expand dramatically .
Under the new law , private employers cannot discriminate or retaliate against an employee who has “ in good faith reported information that the employee believes is evidence of a violation of a state or federal law , rule or regulation , ” regardless of the severity or importance of the alleged violation .
In contrast , the scope of protection previously provided was much narrower , and applied only to good faith reports of criminal activity , filing a complaint , cooperating with law enforcement conducting a criminal investigation , bringing a civil proceeding against the employer , or testifying in a civil or criminal proceeding or in a legislative setting .
The challenges for employers will be in identifying what could fall within the new , broad definition of whistleblowing , and remembering to evaluate whether this protection applies before taking adverse action against an employee .
Religious Accommodation
The Oregon Workplace Religious Freedom
Act will change the religious accommodations employers are required to make for their employees .
The Act redefines “ reasonable accommodation ” in a manner more consistent with regulations under the Americans With Disabilities Act ( ADA ) .
Previously , an employer need only prove a de minimis or minuscule burden in order to claim undue hardship and avoid the duty to accommodate .
Starting in January , in order to reject an accommodation , an employer must show it will result in significant cost and expense or be detrimental to the health and safety of others .
Moreover , the Act clarifies that employers must accommodate the scheduling of leave time for religious observance and / or the wearing of religious apparel in the workplace , unless such practices would pose an undue hardship .
The changes in this area are significant and will require revisiting discrimination policies and ensuring supervisors are aware of the new accommodation obligations related to employee ’s religious beliefs and practices .
Disability Discrimination Law
The new Oregon Disability Discrimination law seeks to bring Oregon law in line with the ADA ’s Amendments
Act of 2009 by broadening the definition of “ disability . ”
A person will still be required to show : ( 1 ) an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities ; ( 2 ) a record of such an impairment ; or ( 3 ) that the person is regarded as having such an impairment to be a qualified individual with a disability .
The difference is that these terms will have far broader meaning under the new law and many of the grounds for determining that an employee is not covered by the Act have been discarded .
For example , employees with a condition that is episodic or in remission will be considered covered by the Act , even if the condition is not active , so long as , when active , it limits a major life activity .
Also , the ameliorative effects of “ mitigating measures ” , such as medication , prosthetics , hearing aids and other devices , can no longer be taken into effect when evaluating the severity of an impairment as part of the coverage inquiry .
The only exception to the new rule on disregard of mitigating measures is for ordinary eyeglasses and contacts .
Employers will want to revisit their accommodation policies and ensure that supervisors understand that many more employees will be in a position to assert a request for reasonable accommodation so proper and timely handling of such requests is more important than ever .
Oregon Restricts Employer Speech on Religion , Politics , and Labor Unions
Whether you call it the “ Worker Freedom Act ” ( by supporters ) or the “ Employer Gag Bill ” ( by detractors ) , Oregon calls it SB 519 , and it becomes law on January 1 , 2010 .
SB 519 prohibits an employer from punishing employees who refuse to attend mandatory employee meetings if the primary purpose of the meeting is to communicate the employer ’s opinion about three subjects : religion , politics , and labor unions .
The AFL - CIO drafted the bill several years ago and has been looking for a state to pass it ever since .
New Jersey , Michigan , West Virginia , and Washington have all come close .
But Oregon is the first to actually pass it .
SB 519 is enforced by a private right of action ; employees may sue their employers for injunctive relief , such as reinstatement and back pay .
In addition , any time an employer violates the law , a trial court must award treble damages ( back pay ) and attorney fees .
Expect a court battle over SB 519 .
The new law may be preempted by the National Labor Relations
Act which specifically allows employers to hold mandatory meetings with employees to discuss unionization if there is an organizing campaign in progress .
However , unless and until a court makes that ruling , Oregon ’s employers — all of them , regardless of size — are expected to comply .
As a result , if you have concerns about union organizing efforts , it is critical that you involve legal counsel before you consider speaking to your employees about your position on unions .
Family Military Leave Comes to Oregon
Oregon employers with 25 or more employees now must , in certain circumstances , provide any employee married to a member of the armed forces with unpaid “ military leave . ”
Employees may split a total 14 days of military leave to : ( 1 ) prepare for the military spouse ’s imminent deployment ; and ( 2 ) visit with the military spouse during periods of leave from deployment .
This Act largely mirrors the 2008 amendments to the Family and Medical Leave Act ( FMLA ) , but applies to any employee who works , on average , more than 20 hours per week .
Curiously , this Act contains no private enforcement mechanism ; presumably , enforcement is handled exclusively by BOLI .
This Act became law on June 25 , 2009 .
If you have not already revised your handbook to incorporate this new law , now is the time to do it .
Military Discrimination Law
This 2009
Act prohibits an employer from discriminating against any person because of that person ’s past , present , or future military service .
Employers cannot refuse to hire , reemploy , or promote any employee because of the employee ’s military service .
Employers also cannot discharge , fire , or retaliate against any employee because of that employee ’s military service .
Violations of this Act are enforceable by a private right of action .
Remedies include injunctive relief , compensatory damages , punitive damages , and attorney fees .
This Act creates a state analogue to the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act ( USERRA ) .
It applies to all employers , regardless of size , and takes effect on January 1 , 2010 .
This is another issue to be included in your list of handbook policies to be reviewed and revised .
Hands - Free Cell Phone Use Required While Driving
Starting in 2010 , all drivers over age 18 will be required to use a hands - free device if they use a mobile communication device while driving .
Previously the law prohibited drivers under age 18 who had not yet obtained a regular driver ’s license from using a mobile communication device while driving , although police officers were only allowed to enforce the provision as a secondary action .
The new law contains various exceptions , including previously - included exceptions for emergencies , and new exceptions for those for whom driving while operating a mobile communication device is necessary for the person ’s job , those who are merely activating or deactivating the device or a function of the device , and those using one - way voice communication while engaged in certain activities related to employment or safety .
Violation of the law is a Class D traffic violation punishable with a fine of up to $ 90 .
Obviously 2010 brings many changes for employers .
We hope this summary has been helpful to raise your awareness of the issues you will be facing .
A more detailed review of these laws will be included in a white paper that will be released soon …

Pope and Anglican Head Discussed Rifts
His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI and the leader of the Anglican Communion Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams met at the Vatican Saturday , November 21 , 2009 to discuss recent issues between the churches .
The two met in private for twenty minutes .
It was last month when the Pope offered dissatisfied Anglicans to convert to Roman Catholicism while allowing them to retain some of their own traditions .
An example of which are married priests and women priests .
The Anglican Church calls it foul and accused the Vatican of poaching .
The Vatican replied that they were simply “ reaching out ” .
The Anglican Communion , so called instead of “ Church ” which is with universal juridical authority , has each national or regional church with full autonomy .
The communion just recognizes “ full communion ” with “ mother church ” , the Church of England and its main primate , the Archbishop of Canterbury .
From this concept , the communion is divided among issues due to its numerous “ country members ” .
The issues that divide the communion include women priests , divorce , abortion , contraception and homosexuality .
This has been the cause of “ dissatisfaction ” among some members .
The Anglican Communion started when it split ( as Church of England ) with the Catholic Church in 1534 after Pope Clement VII refused a request of divorce for King Henry VIII with wife Catherine of Aragon ( mother of Queen Mary I ) to marry Anne Boleyn ( mother of Queen Elizabeth I ) .
It was King Henry who first claimed that he is the head of his own church in his own country ( Anglican Communion foundation ) and could therefore grant himself divorce .
Update at bottom : Matalin ‘ lied ’ about Bush inheriting recession
No amount of spit and polish can clean the tarnish of the 9/11 attacks from the Bush legacy , but that did n’t stop GOP strategist Mary Matalin from trying .
During a Sunday appearance on CNN , Matalin attempted to prop up an analogy between the first year of George W. Bush ’s presidency and that of President Barack Obama’s .
Raising the specter of rising unemployment , anchor John King wondered whether Republicans have the right to attack Democrats over the economy .
ADVERTISEMENT
According to a CNN transcript , Matalin–seated across a table from her husband , Democratic strategist James Carville–gave a response which was a little more than blindly partisan .
“ I was there , ” she said .
“ We inherited a recession from President Clinton and we inherited the most tragic attack on our own soil in our nation ’s history .
And President Bush dealt with it .
And within a year of his presidency at this comparable time , unemployment was at 5 percent .
And we were creating jobs . ”
The attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 happened during the Bush presidency .
While administration officials said repeatedly that nobody could have predicted such a devastating attack , an August 6 , 2001 , briefing delivered to President Bush — titled “ Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S. ” — later surfaced .
“ The memo , sent to FBI headquarters by a Phoenix FBI agent , warned that bin Laden could have been using U.S. flight schools to train terrorists and suggested a nationwide canvass for Middle Eastern aviation students , ” The Washington Post reported .
Yet , even with clear warning , the Bush administration did not take steps to prevent the attack .
Indeed , the FBI even thwarted efforts of a key informant close to alleged 9/11 plotter Mohammed Atta .
The man , a Lebanon - native who pretended to be an Islamic extremist at the behest of American authorities , said that without the FBI ’s intervention he is “ one million percent positive ” the attacks could have been prevented .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ [ Matalin is ] even full of shit on unemployment , ” noted Atrois .
“ It was much better than it is now , of course , but 5.7 % , rising eventually to 6.3 % , is n’t 5 % . ”
This video was broadcast by CNN on Dec. 27 , 2009 , snipped by Think Progress .
Think Progress ’ Lee Fang noted , “ Last month , former Bush administration spokesperson Dana Perino claimed that “ we did not have a terrorist attack on our country during President Bush ’s term . ”
Former Bush administration officials seem intent on misrepresenting history to pretend that the country never suffered its worst terror attack in history under Bush ’s watch .
It ’s a peculiar talking point , even considering the other efforts to whitewash Bush ’s disastrous record . ”

Matalin ‘ lied ’ about Bush inheriting recession
But Matalin is n’t just facing criticism for her 9/11 revisionism .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Washington Independent ‘s David Weigel claims she “ lied ” about Bush inheriting Clinton ’s recession .
Not actually true !
Leaving aside the claim that George W. Bush “ inherited ” the 9/11 terrorist attacks from Clinton , the unemployment rate in January 2001 , when Bush took office , was 4.2 percent–a 0.2 point increase over December 2000 , but not a recession number .
The unemployment rate in December 2001 , at the point in Bush ’s presidency where Obama is now , was 5.8 percent , up 0.2 points from November .
The unemployment rate did not actually hit 5 percent until May 2005 .
Unemployment never actually fell back to the Clinton - era rate during Bush ’s presidency , coming closest in October 2006 , when it hit 4.4 percent .
Mocking how television rewards liars , Weigel concludes , “ Expect to see her on TV again soon . ”
Tiger Woods admits ' I have let my family down '
Tiger and Elin Woods were married in 2004 and have two children Golf star Tiger Woods has apologised to his family , amid continuing speculation about his private life following a car crash last week .
" I have let my family down and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart , " he said in a statement , without elaborating further .
" I have not been true to my values and the behaviour my family deserves . "
Woods was found bleeding and semi-conscious after his car hit a tree and fire hydrant outside his Florida home .
He was charged with careless driving , which carries a $ 164 ( £ 98 ) fine and four points on his driving record .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Senate on Tuesday rejected two proposals to allow Americans to buy cheaper prescription medicines from other nations , preserving a deal between the White House and the pharmaceutical industry .
The measures were offered as part of broad Democratic legislation to overhaul the $ 2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare system by expanding access to health insurance , tightening insurance industry regulations and controlling certain costs .
A bipartisan group of more than two dozen senators had sought to allow drug imports from Canada and other countries -- where drugs often sell at a much lower cost than in the United States .
But they saw their proposal , which needed 60 votes to pass in the 100 - member Senate , fall short by a vote of 51 - 48 .
“ We should n’t be paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs , ” Senator Byron Dorgan said before the Senate vote on his proposal .
Other senators backed a separate measure to allow imports only after they had been certified as safe by U.S. health officials .
Also needing 60 votes , the proposal lost 56 - 43 .
The roughly $ 315 billion pharmaceutical industry boasts one of the strongest lobby groups in Washington .
It also is the biggest healthcare industry to back President Barack Obama ’s drive for healthcare reform legislation .
In an $ 80 billion , 10 - year deal reached earlier this year with the White House and some Democratic senators , the industry agreed to help fund the reform effort through higher taxes and certain price agreements .
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America Senior Vice President Ken Johnson said the drug makers ’ lobby group continued to back the broad reform efforts .

A Brazilian toddler has been found with some 40 needles inside him , which police say his stepfather inserted during a possible " black magic " ritual .
Police said Roberto Carlos Magalhaes had confessed to sticking the sewing needles into the two - year - old boy , and had been arrested .
Mr Magalhaes said his mistress had told him ritually to kill the child to take revenge on his wife .
Doctors are set to begin operating on Thursday to remove some of the needles .
The toddler was taken to hospital in the north - eastern Bahia state by his mother , complaining of stomach pains and vomiting .
X - rays showed scores of sewing needles inside his neck , torso and legs .
At least one had punctured a lung , another his liver .
' Revenge attack '
Police said Mr Magalhaes had broken down and confessed after being arrested .
" He did that for revenge , to get back at his wife , " the police chief in the town of Ibotirama , Helder Fernandes Santana , was quoted as saying by AFP news agency .
" His mistress told him to kill the child through a macabre ritual , " Mr Santana said .
The boy 's mother told police she suspected the child had been the victim of a black magic ritual after she found suspicious objects in the home she shared with Mr Magalhaes - her husband of six months - and her six children .
Doctors said most of the needles would be removed , but not the ones inside organs as their removal could cause more damage .
They said there were no signs of wounds on the boy .
Reports say the boy is in a serious condition , but that he has shown some improvement since being admitted to hospital on Sunday .
All those who have spent late hours playing SimCity 3000 and never understood why the damn thing would never get any people to move into it , will derive a deranged pleasure from the following clip .
In China , where 8 % GDP is guaranteed and has to be " goal seeked " by any and every increasingly more deranged economic project , the authorities have taken the game of SimCity and applied it to real life .
Alas , they started out on " difficult " level .
Ordos is a hyper modern city , full of brand new glass walled residential and commercial buildings , yet devoid of inhabitants .
In its attempt to present a " growing " economy , and to " invest " its $ 585 billion stimulus into anything and everything , courtesy of comparable idiocy on the other side of the Pacific , China 's communist party is now ruling over ghost towns .
One wonders just how many such " efficient " projects sustain China 's magical 8 % growth .

The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ( BPAI ) , a key panel within the Patent Office , has tightened the rules for American software patents .
The recently - released decision builds on last year 's landmark ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the case of In Re Bilski .
In that case , the Federal Circuit focused on business method patents and had left key questions about the patentability of software - related inventions unanswered .
The new ruling will give thousands of American patent examiners guidance about how to apply the holdings of Bilski in software patent cases .
Narrowing the scope
The BPAI has first crack at reviewing the work of individual patent examiners and its decisions are subject to review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .
The new BPAI decision was actually released in August , but the panel only recently declared it " precedential . "
This relatively rare step means that the nation 's patent examiners are required to take it into consideration as they work through the backlog of pending software - related patent applications .
However , the decision may have a short shelf life : the Supreme Court is due to weigh in on Bilski in the Spring .
If the Supreme Court overrules key provisions of the Federal Circuit 's Bilski ruling , the BPAI will need to go back to the drawing board once again .
The BPAI considered a patent application submitted by two American engineers working for Philips Electronics .
The patent , titled " Method and Apparatus for Generating a Stereotypical Profile for Recommending Items of Interest Using Item - based Clustering , " focused on a system for recommending television content to users .
But the application did n't limit itself to this application .
It claimed ( among other things ) " a method for identifying one or more mean items for a plurality of items , each of said items having at least one symbolic attribute . "
If granted , the patent could have applied to a wide variety of recommendation algorithms .
The patent examiner assigned to the case rejected most of the claims in the patent , and the BPAI affirmed these rejections .
But while the examiner largely rejected the patents on long - established , pre-Bilski grounds , the BPAI instead used the decision as an opportunity to announce new standards for software patentability based on the standards the Federal Circuit articulated last year .
In Bilski , the Federal Circuit said that to be patentable , inventions must involve either a particular machine or a specific transformation of matter .
An important question left unanswered by the decision is whether a general - purpose computer qualifies as a " particular machine . "
The BPAI 's new decision suggests that its answer is " no . "
For example , the BPAI rejected one claim by noting that " other than providing examples of memory as RAM and / or ROM and the processor as a CPU for a personal computer , the specification provides no more details about these devices . "
The patent application attempted to claim its recommendation algorithm in two different ways : as a " method " for selecting items , and as a machine that performs that method .
The BPAI squarely rejected the gambit , writing that because the functionality described in its " machine " claims were identical to the " methods " described in earlier claims , the claims must stand or fall together .
An unpatentable algorithm doens't become patentable merely because it 's implemented using off - the - shelf computer hardware .
This is important because it appears to sharply limit so - called Beauregard claims : efforts to effectively claim an algorithm by patenting the manufacture of digital media containing that algorithm .
As recently as 2007 , the Supreme Court heard a case involving a patent of this type , but it ducked the question of patent validity , focusing instead on the esoteric issue of how to calculate damages .
Two prongs , one test
In its decision , the BPAI announced a new two - pronged test for determining whether an invention involving a mathematical algorithm would be eligible for patent protection .
First , the invention must be " limited to a tangible practical application " and result " in a real - world use . "
Second , it must be " limited so as to not encompass substantially all practical applications of the mathematical algorithm " in all fields or even in " only one field . "
If that seems vague and convoluted , it might be because the BPAI has to work within the framework established by the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit , neither of which have been especially clear about the precise boundaries of patentable subject matter .
The Supreme Court ruled out most software patents in the 1970s , but during the 1990s , the Federal Circuit handed down a series of decisions that were far more permissive .
Since Bilski , the pendulum has been swinging back toward stricter limits on software patents , but the law remains very much in flux , and the BPAI seemed to be struggling to reconcile seemingly contradictory precedents .
Indeed , the somewhat muddled nature of the BPAI ruling underscores the importance of the Supreme Court 's forthcoming Bilski decision .
The Supreme Court has been silent on the question of what may be patented since 1981 , leaving a vaccuum that was filled by a strongly pro-patent Federal Circuit .
Because Supreme Court decisions supercede Federal Circuit rulings , Bilski gives the high court an opportunity to sweep away much of the confusion of the last quarter - century and set the law of patent eligibility on a more solid foundation .
That may be a headache for the Patent Office , which may be forced to rewrite the software patent rules yet again .
But it could give the rest of us some of the clarity we so desperately need .
Rachel Christie after being crowned Miss England in London , July 20 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Miss England / Handout
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Beauty pageant winner Miss England gave up her title on Friday after reports she had been involved in a nightclub brawl with another beauty queen .
Rachel Christie , niece of former British Olympic gold medal sprinter Linford Christie , was arrested earlier this week after allegedly getting into a fight with Miss Manchester , Sara Jones , at a club in the northern English city , newspapers reported .
Christie , who had become the first black winner of the title in July , was accused of punching Jones in a row over her boyfriend who appears on the TV show “ Gladiators , ” the papers said .
“ Due to the media attention following the allegations against her , Rachel Christie has now decided to withdraw from the Miss World competition and relinquish her Miss England crown , ” the pageant organizers said in a statement on the Miss England website .
“ Rachel will concentrate on clearing her name and focus on training for the 2012 Olympics until this case is resolved . ”
Christie says she wants to emulate her uncle and win gold at the 2012 Olympics in London in the heptathlon .
There was no shortage of volunteers to marry the sex workers
More than 1,000 followers of a multi-religious sect in northern India have pledged to marry female sex workers who want to escape exploitation .
Young Hindu , Muslim and Sikh men have been queuing up at the Dera Sacha Sauda ( Abode of the Real Deal ) in the town of Sirsa as " wedding volunteers " .
They say they are doing so to stop the women from being exploited in brothels .
They also claim that their move is part of a campaign to stop the spread of the HIV / Aids virus .
The Dera Sacha Sauda ( DSS ) is one of many religious sects operating in northern India .
Most take root by offering community services , social welfare and spiritual leadership but over time , as their followings grow , they often seek political influence .
All women forced to live as prostitutes are my daughters
Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Correspondents say that in religious terms , the DSS is hard to classify .
Many experts argue that it is not , as some have said , an offshoot of Sikhism .
More than 1,200 DSS members have signed pledges to marry the sex workers following a call from DSS chief Ram Rahim Singh a little over a month ago .
Mr Singh commands a huge following of predominantly lower caste Hindus , Muslims and Sikhs across the states of Punjab , Haryana , Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan .
Two years ago his growing influence brought the DSS chief into confrontation with the mainstream Sikh clergy who claimed he had tried to imitate their beliefs .
The sectarian violence that ensued across Punjab - as well as subsequent rape and murder charges brought against Ram Rahim Singh - have cast a shadow on the affairs and functioning of the DSS ever since , observers say .
But the group 's supporters believe the new campaign is to halt the spread of HIV by offering respectable options to sex workers and is part of a long list of related initiatives against drug abuse and female foeticide .
" By helping drug users and sex workers we are trying to help remove people from the highest risk situations , " said Dr Aditya Insan , a senior DSS functionary .
' Delicately handled '
He estimates that 40 % - 50 % of women working in red light districts in cities like Mumbai ( Bombay ) and Delhi are HIV carriers .
Mr Singh ( known as Guru - ji to his supporters ) proclaimed at a congregation last month that " all women forced to live as prostitutes are my daughters " .
His remarks brought forth a virtual flood of eager young volunteers from his flock .
Business graduate Ashish Sachdeva , 22 , is in the garments trade in the town of Sirsa .
He believes that marrying a sex worker could be his chance to repay his debt to humanity and society .
" I am very well settled and it will be the greatest honour for me to respond to Guru - ji 's call . "
Nearly 100 young sex workers have contacted the DSS - from Calcutta 's Shonagachi red light district to brothels in Delhi and Mumbai .
" This will have to be a slow and delicately handled process , " Dr Insan said .
" Many women are HIV - positive .
Some have young children and are understandably concerned about their future .
We need to ensure these women are protected legally once they are married . "

( CNN ) --
Most sexually active unmarried young adults believe pregnancy should be planned , but about half do not use contraception regularly , according to a study published Tuesday .
The survey of 1,800 people age 18 to 29 was conducted by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy .
" What is surprising is just how wide the gap is between single young adults ' intentions and behavior on this very important issue , " said Bill Albert , chief program officer at the organization .
Also , 29 percent of women and 42 percent of men said it is at least slightly likely they will have unprotected sex in the next three months -- and it 's quite likely or extremely likely for 17 percent of women and 19 percent of men .
The discrepancy between both wanting to plan pregnancy and having unprotected sex may have something to do with a focus in recent years on abstinence - only education , said Laura Lindberg , senior research associate at the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute .
" Abstinence - only curriculums have gone explicitly out of their way to teach misconceptions about contraception , " she said .
" This generation of 20 - somethings have missed many opportunities to get medically accurate and correct information . "
But for abstinence education advocates , the problems stem from not enough focus on refraining from sex until marriage .
" I do n't think we 'll be able to overcome this problem unless we restore the social norm of not having sex and not getting pregnant before marriage , " said Peter Sprigg , senior fellow for policy studies at the Family Research Council .
" Even when people are informed , they just do n't choose to consistently practice contraception . "
Many of the people surveyed said they did not know much about contraception to begin with -- 63 percent said they knew little or nothing about birth control pills , and 30 percent said they had scant knowledge about condoms .
The numbers may reflect that while most people have heard of the pill and condoms , they have never been taught how to use the pill or where to get it , or how to put on a condom , said Dr. Yolanda Wimberly , assistant professor of clinical pediatrics at the Morehouse School of Medicine and an adolescent medicine specialist with Grady Health Systems in Atlanta , Georgia .
Myths about pregnancy and sexual activity continue to permeate circles of young people .
For instance , 28 percent of men incorrectly believe they will get extra protection from wearing two condoms at once , a practice that actually leads to condom breakage .
At the same time , 18 percent of men wrongly believe that having sex standing up reduces the chance that they will get a female partner pregnant .
These are the kinds of myths often heard in Wimberly 's office .
Wimberly , who sees young people from age 12 to 30 about sexual health issues , commonly hears rumors like these that have spread among friends .
Anecdotal evidence that a behavior is safe is sometimes more convincing for young adults than the recommendations of health professionals .
" If other people have been doing it , and nothing bad has happened , then they 'll do it , " she said .
" We have definitely got to do a better job of dispelling myths . "
Albert said it was shocking that about four in 10 respondents said it does n't matter whether people use birth control , believing that people get pregnant when it's their " time . "
But this was not surprising for Wimberly .
She pointed out that some people are not opposed to having children in their 20s and are at a point in their lives at which they would be relatively comfortable going through with an unplanned pregnancy .
There are also exaggerated doubts and fears about birth control pills , the study said .
Twenty - seven percent of women and 34 percent of men in the survey said serious health problems such as cancer are likely to result from using the pill or other hormonal contraceptives .
Experts say hormonal contraceptives are relatively safe , but there is some mixed scientific research on the topic .
According to the National Cancer Institute , oral contraceptives have been shown to increase the risk of cervical cancer , although human papillomavirus is the major risk factor for the disease .
Some studies have found an increased risk of breast cancer , but others found no connection .
There is also evidence that oral contraceptives decrease the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer , but that they increase the risk of liver cancer in women who are otherwise considered at low risk for the disease .
But the known evidence does not suggest it is " highly likely " that cancer will result from the pill , the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy said .
The survey cites a recent Mayo Clinic study that suggested an additional 2 to 3 percent increase of developing breast cancer as a result of being on the pill .
Wimberly always goes through all the pros and cons of using the pill with her patients , including the noncontraceptive benefits .
Each individual should discuss all the positives and negatives of the pill with a health care provider before deciding to use it , she said .
Nearly half the adults surveyed said they agreed that " drug companies do n't care if birth control is safe ; they just want people to use it so they can make money . "
Thirty - two percent said they agreed that " the government is trying to limit blacks and other minority populations by encouraging the use of birth control . "
Still , according to a 2002 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the leading contraceptive method among women ages 15 to 29 is the pill .
While the actual rate of infertility among people 18 to 29 years old is 8 percent , a great deal more think they may fall into that category -- 59 percent of women and 49 percent of men said it is at least slightly likely they are infertile , and 75 percent of people who had concerns about fertility did not worry about it because of information from a doctor .
About half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned , according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists .
The survey calls for more sex education for adults , given that about one in five participants said they had never had sex education in school .
Colleges -- both two - year and four - year -- should educate students about pregnancy and contraception , and such programs should also be available in workplaces , job training sites and the military , the survey said .
Health care providers also have a role to play in ensuring that young people know all their options for family planning , and in providing patients with these methods , the report said .
Wimberly added that other community - based venues such as churches , community centers , hospitals and after - school programs could all disseminate information about contraception and family planning .
Parents can also play a big role in helping educate their children about these issues , Albert said .
Groups such as the Family Research Council continue to advocate for abstinence - only education at the K - 12 level , but the organization does not have an official stance on what sex education should happen beyond that , Sprigg said .
" But as far as investing taxpayer dollars and making a strong public policy effort , we think the principle focus should be on encouraging abstinence , " he said .
The survey also touches on a distrust of the health care system more generally , Lindberg said .
The challenge is to " create more positive attitudes and make health care providers and the health care system feel like a safe and trusting place , " she said .

KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid ...
The idea is to read distance by simply looking thru your scope while aiming .
No complicated calculations ...
Just look and know the distance .
Explaining how it works makes it seem more complicated than it is , so please bear with me as we go thru the numbers .
Look at the " C " dimension in the chart and on the reticle above .
1 Mil at 100 yards is 3.6 inches or 1/10th of what it is at 1,000 yards ( 1/10th of 36 inches ) .
At 200 , 300 , 400 , etc ... it is 2/10 , 3/10 , 4/10 , etc .
So , if you know the size in inches of a target , you can tell how far it is by the number of mildot increments it spans in your scope .
Looking through the scope at a target 100 yards away , the distance between centers of two mil dots is 3.6 inches .
If you figure the chest of a deer or antelope to be 18 inches high , at 100 yards the number of Mil dots it spans is 18 ÷ 3.6 = 5 Mil Dots .
So , if you look at a deer through the scope and the chest spans 5 Mil Dots , that deer is 100 yards away .
If the chest spans 2.5 Mil Dots , then the deer is 200 yards away ... and so forth .
See the charts at left .
You should make your own chart for the dimensions of your target .
This is the easiest way to estimate distances with Mil dots .
According to the Elias Sports Bureau , it was the biggest rally since Utah overcame a 36 - point deficit to beat Denver on Nov. 27 , 1996 .
" I mean , what can you say ?
It 's unheard of to do what just happened , " Kings coach Paul Westphal said .
" I 'm not even sure I believe it , but it sure was fun . "
The Bulls were talking about a collapse , not a comeback .
" This one stings , " Chicago coach Vinny Del Negro said .
" We stopped being aggressive , got a little complacent there and they jumped on it .
We 're not good enough to take a minute off , never mind a half . "
The Bulls led 79 - 44 with 8:50 left in the third quarter , and were still up 83 - 50 two minutes later before the Kings stole momentum and , eventually , the game .
After Sacramento finished the third with a 19 - 5 run to make it 88 - 69 , Ime Udoka scored 15 of the Kings ' first 22 points in the fourth quarter to cut it to 95 - 91 with 2:28 remaining .
Evans , the outstanding rookie guard from Memphis , then personally outscored the Bulls 9 - 3 the rest of the way .
He converted a three - point play and , after Chicago 's Luol Deng made a free throw , scored on a drive and hit a foul shot to give the Kings their first lead since the opening minutes .
Evans then hit a 22 - footer at the shot - clock buzzer to put Sacramento up 99 - 96 .
Derrick
Rose made two free throws to cut it to 99 - 98 before Evans hit one of two foul shots .
After Rose missed a layup , Beno Udrih clinched the win with two more free throws .
" I think we relaxed , " said Deng , who scored 26 points .
" We were making mistakes defensively .
We were just not aggressive and that carries over to offense .
It 's frustrating . "
As the sellout crowd booed the Bulls off the court , Kings owner Gavin Maloof celebrated .
" If they did n't know who Tyreke Evans was , they know him now , " he said .
" It was magical . "
Evans followed Rose to Memphis , where each played only one year of college ball before turning pro .
Rose was last season 's Rookie of the Year and Evans -- one of just four NBA players averaging at least 20 points , five rebounds and five assists -- is a front - runner for the award this season .
" I just kept attacking and never gave up , " Evans said .
The Bulls were almost perfect in the first quarter , shooting 71 percent , committing no turnovers , holding the Kings to 39 percent shooting and forcing seven giveaways .
Chicago built a 67 - 43 lead by halftime and opened the second half with a 12 - 1 run that seemingly put the game away .
But as the Bulls gradually came unglued -- they were only 2 for 10 from the floor and committed nine turnovers in the fourth quarter -- Evans , Udoka and the Kings took control .
" This game was absolutely crazy , " ex-Bull Andres Nocioni said .
" I 've played in many games with national teams and many games in the NBA and I 've never seen anything like that .
I do n't know if we won the game or the Chicago Bulls lost the game . "
The despondent Del Negro knew .
" It was a matter of us not being smart at either end , " he said .
" It 's frustrating .
It 's difficult .
But what are you going to do , put your head down and feel sorry for yourself ?
You 've got to go play . "
Game notes
Rose finished with 24 points and seven assists .
... Nocioni received a nice ovation when introduced before the game .
Acquired from Chicago last February , he was one of the Bulls ' most popular players of the post - Michael Jordan years .
" I 'm fine with Sacramento , " he said , " but I miss Chicago a lot . " ... Bulls F Tyrus Thomas , who broke a bone in his left forearm on Nov. 6 , returned to practice Sunday .
Del Negro hopes Thomas will play Saturday against New Orleans .
...
Deng has averaged 23 points while playing the last four games with a small fracture in his left ( non-shooting ) thumb .
I have a tale of death , near death , and undeath to weave for you , but first , gaze upon the jewel - like beauty of the glittering denizens of M30 :
This image was taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope .
I had to cut it and compress it drastically to get it to fit on the blog , so you very much want to click on it to embiggen it massively and see it in its fully resolved glory .
The image is of the insanely beautiful globular cluster M30 , an ancient city of a few hundred thousand stars located 28,000 light years away in the constellation of Capricornus .
The cluster is ancient , about 13 billion years old , making it as old or even older than the Milky Way itself .
The core of the cluster is unusually dense as such things go , which is why it was studied .
Where better to find vampires and thrillseekers ?
Like people , stars are born , age , and die .
Stars born with more mass tend to die off more quickly , consuming their fuel at far higher rates than their lower - mass brethren .
These stars tend to be blue , so in an old cluster like M30 you 'd expect to see no blue stars at all ; they should all be long gone .
And yet , there are quite a few -- astronomers call them blue stragglers .
Where did they come from ?
One theory , which has been borne out by observations , is that blue stragglers are in tight binary systems , with a dead star in such close proximity to a normal star that it can siphon off the normal star 's gas , using it to rejuvenate itself .
This would make them vampires , of course , sucking the life force of other stars in an attempt to stay young .
But another idea was that dead stars might also physically collide with other stars and merge , forming a single star that would burn blue and bright .
In an environment like that near our own Sun this kind of collision can almost literally never happen ; even considering the entire Milky Way Galaxy over its entire lifetime a head on collision has probably never happened out here in the stellar suburbs .
But that cluster M30 is pretty densely populated with stars , and collisions are far more likely .
What observations like this one of the cluster ( and also of an ancient cluster called NGC 188 ) have shown is that the blue stragglers appear to have two different sub - groups ; one that appears to have come from the vampire stars , and another from stars that have collided : thrill - seekers , stars that have physically slammed into each other and merged , their combined mass separating them from the other blue straggler group .
Blue stragglers have been known since the 1950s , and the idea that they were pulling gas off nearby stars was proposed to explain them , too , but it 's only with our modern instrumentation that we can not only show that this is true , but that a second , far - fetched - sounding scenario of collisions also contributes .
I find it wonderful and extremely uplifting that an image as spectacular and gorgeous as the one above -- it became my desktop wallpaper as soon as I saw it ! -- not only satisfies our desire for beauty and art , but can also be tapped to deliver incredible science that boosts our awe of what Nature can do .
I love that we can understand such things , but you know what I love even more ?
The idea that we have only begun to understand the Universe .

On a larger scale , religious denominations affect economics by creating bonds of trust and shared commitment among small groups , both necessary qualities for lending and trade .
In the Middle Ages , studies show , monk - run estates outperformed those that used serfs , thanks to religiously inspired cooperation and frugality .
The Quakers of 18th - century Britain , renowned for their scrupulous honesty , came to dominate British finance .
Ultra-orthodox Jews similarly dominate New York ’s diamond trade because of levels of trust based on religion .
Modern religious kibbutzim on average outperform their secular rivals , in part because of trust built through engaging in communal religious rituals .
In a sense , religion and economics long have been intertwined .
There are more verses on money and finance in the Bible than there are verses on prayer .
The New Testament stakes out clear if seemingly contradictory positions : on the one hand is the admonition that a rich person has little chance of getting into heaven ; on the other is the parable of the talents , which praises the servant who got the biggest return on his money .
Islam , to this day , outlaws the charging of interest ; Buddhism instructs its followers to abjure desire for material goods .
The work is preliminary , but offers the hope of useful findings .
Knowing exactly how and when God influences mammon could lead to smarter forms of economic development in emerging nations , and could add to our understanding of how culture shapes wealth and poverty .
And it stands as part of a larger movement in economics , in which the field is looking beyond purely material explanations to a broader engagement with human culture , psychology , and even our angels and demons .
The notion that religion influences economies has a long history , but the specifics have been vexingly difficult to pin down .
Today , as researchers start to answer the question more definitively with the tools of modern economics , what ’s emerging is a clearer picture of how nations ’ prosperity can depend , in part , on seemingly abstract concerns like theology - and sometimes on quite nuanced points of belief or religious fervor .
That hell could matter to economic growth might seem surprising , since you ca n’t prove it exists , let alone quantify it .
It stands as one of the more intriguing findings in a growing body of recent research exploring how religion might influence the wealth and prosperity of societies .
In recent years , Italian economists have presented findings that religion can boost GDP by increasing trust within a society ; researchers in the United States showed that religion reduces corruption and increases respect for law in ways that boost overall economic growth .
A number of researchers have documented how merchants used religious backgrounds to establish one another ’s reliability .
A pair of Harvard researchers recently examined 40 years of data from dozens of countries , trying to sort out the economic impact of religious beliefs or practices .
They found that religion has a measurable effect on developing economies - and the most powerful influence relates to how strongly people believe in hell .
What makes economies grow ?
It ’s a question that has occupied thinkers for centuries .
Most of us would tick off things like education levels , openness to trade , natural resources , and political systems .
After Barro and McCleary ’s initial work was published in 2003 , other economists started looking more seriously at the impact of religious beliefs .
Researchers based at the New University of Lisbon and the University of Illinois used a model that showed European industrial development between 1645 and 1850 took place roughly 35 years earlier in Protestant countries than Catholic ones .
( The researchers posited that Protestant beliefs in economic success as a sign one might get to heaven inspired people to work harder and invest . )
The German economist Sascha O. Becker looked at Prussia ’s economic development and found that , at least for Germany , Weber was right about the Protestant work ethic : Protestants were more likely to be entrepreneurs than Catholics , and more likely to create bigger firms .
( Becker argues the cause is n’t religious belief itself , but an accidental offshoot of Protestants needing to be literate enough to read the Bible . )
McCleary says this makes sense from a strictly economic standpoint - as economies develop and people can earn more money , their time becomes more valuable .
For economic growth , she says , “ What you want is to have people have their children grow up in a faith , but then they should become productive members of society .
They should n’t be spending all their time in religious services . ”
The two collected data from 59 countries where a majority of the population followed one of the four major religions , Christianity , Islam , Hinduism , or Buddhism .
They ran this data - which covered slices of years from 1981 to 2000 , measuring things like levels of belief in God , afterlife beliefs , and worship attendance - through statistical models .
Their results show a strong correlation between economic growth and certain shifts in beliefs , though only in developing countries .
Most strikingly , if belief in hell jumps up sharply while actual church attendance stays flat , it correlates with economic growth .
Belief in heaven also has a similar effect , though less pronounced .
Mere belief in God has no effect one way or the other .
Meanwhile , if church attendance actually rises , it slows growth in developing economies .
Among the most provocative findings have come from Robert Barro , a renowned economist at Harvard , and his wife , Rachel McCleary , a researcher at Harvard ’s Taubman Center .
McCleary , the daughter of a Methodist missionary , felt that she had seen religion change people ’s economic behavior , and wondered why economists did n’t look at it as a potential factor in economic development .
Barro found the idea intriguing .
But over the last several decades , better sets of statistics on religion have become available , and improvements in computing power and mathematical techniques have made it easier for economists to run very large statistical analyses , with hundreds of variables .
But the ways that religions can influence entire economies - and the extent to which they do - are less clear .
In 1905 , Max Weber , a German sociologist who studied religions , identified what he called “ the Protestant work ethic ” as the driving force behind modern capitalism in the West .
But by the middle of the 20th century , most sociologists had dismissed Weber ’s thesis as based on bad theology and bad statistics .
Modern economists have n’t looked much at the question , in part because it ’s difficult to quantify something like religious belief , or to compare statistics on religious beliefs across countries .
Scientists also find it hard to prove that religion , or any aspect of culture , causes economic behaviors .
So what is it about religion that creates these economic effects ?
On one level , the connection seems intuitive :
All the major religions extol virtues like self - discipline , sacrifice , and thrift .
Some even preach that earthly success translates to good things in the afterlife , a kind of gold - plated stairway to heaven .
Religion can , quite directly , affect what you earn - fundamentalists and evangelicals in the United States tend to have lower savings rates and incomes than members of other religions , in part because they have larger families and give away more of their money .
Belief ’s influence on our economic behavior might even reflect biology .
The special motivational power of hell , for instance , may lie deep in the human psyche .
Ara Norenzayan , a psychologist at the University of British Columbia , and his graduate student Azim Shariff set up an experiment that would make it easy for people to cheat on a difficult math test .
They found that people who believed in an omniscient , vengeful God typically chose short - term suffering - that is , facing the test without the crutch of cheating - over possible eternal suffering .
“ Those who believed in a punishing God cheated less , ” Norenzayan said in an e-mail .
He considers his findings to be consistent with Barro and McCleary ’s research .
Of course , belief might just spark behavior that affects economic growth , rather than causing the growth itself .
Charles M. North , an economist at Baylor University , argues that private property protections developed by the Church to guard against grasping secular rulers gave Catholic - and eventually Protestant - nations stronger protections for individual rights than other nations , creating incentive for individual success .
Similarly , literacy seems clearly connected with economic development , and mass literacy is a Protestant invention , says Robert D. Woodberry , a sociologist at University of Texas at Austin .
He has mapped how missionaries spread literacy , technology , and civic institutions , and finds that those correlate strongly with economic growth .
He argues in part that this helps explain why the once - poor but largely Protestant United States surpassed rich , Catholic Mexico after 1800 .
If religious belief does have important effects on prosperity , it raises a difficult question for anyone concerned with economic development :
What should we do with that knowledge ?
Does it make sense to put up religious billboards in struggling countries , or to appoint a minister of belief ?
Probably not .
For one thing , religion is just one among many factors that affect economies .
And for another , it seems to take a long time for religious shifts to catalyze economies .
The Protestant work ethic may indeed have some economic importance , but the Industrial Revolution in Germany came 300 years after Martin Luther ’s 95 theses .
Many countries in the developing world shifted from ethnic religions to Christianity or Islam during the 20th century , and few miracles have so far occurred in those economies .
Many think we can just pluck out the secular lessons from the new findings , and no longer need religion as a spur for , say , property laws and literacy .
Norenzayan thinks that people originally developed the idea of “ supernatural monitors ” - a fear of being punished by an omniscient watcher - at a time when secular institutions either did n’t exist , or might as well not have .
Today , he thinks , developing nations can simply adapt proven , secular approaches to governing .
Then again , cloning institutions without certain intangible aspects of culture often proves futile .
When Italy imposed identical forms of government across its regions , the new institutions worked well in some parts of the country but performed poorly in others with different underlying traditions .
Governments worldwide have tried to foster their own versions of Silicon Valley , and , lacking the California Bay Area ’s particular culture and history , have mostly failed .
While education and rule of law might seem straightforward secular policies , the cultural forces that carry them into a society , including religion , have a lot to do with whether people respect them .
Barro and McCleary , for their part , think religion and policy are difficult to mix .
McCleary says the lesson of their results is n’t that governments should boost religion , but simply that they should recognize it has some value , and avoid regulating it too heavily .
The bigger application of research into religion , she thinks , is n’t to foster religious imperialism but to build a better - informed economics , and in the long run , better policy .
There wo n’t be manna from heaven .
But there might , over time , be less poverty here on earth .

C onservative John Tory has decided to run for mayor of Toronto .
He 's keeping the decision close to his vest but skittish supporters say all that 's left is the announcement date .
This sets up a classic heavyweight fight with Liberal George Smitherman , who surprised potential contestants Monday by jumping into the race before it officially begins on Jan .
4 .
Tory is n't confirming or denying he will run .
He gets around it by saying , " I have no announcement to make . "
But sources close to the ex-provincial Conservative party leader say he will jump into the race in January .
" Off the record , he 's in , " said one Tory backer as soon as word leaked out Sunday night that Smitherman had jumped the gun to declare his candidacy for the October 2010 vote .
" The announcement ( will come ) in January .
He has 12 to 15 councillors ( backing him ) ... across the city . "
" Not the first week ... but before end of January , " another insider confirmed .
Tory , a long - time party backroom organizer and successful businessman , ran for mayor in 2003 and finished second to David Miller .
He then became provincial party leader but lost several contests .
His backers think the stars may finally be aligning in his favour .
" Right place , right time , maybe for the first time in his political life , " another source said .
But before there is a coronation of either Smitherman or Tory , the NDP is still to be heard from and Councillor Adam Giambrone seems to be the leading candidate to carry the left - wing banner .
Giambrone , the TTC chair , is looking to secure the backing of federal NDP Leader Jack Layton and his influential MP wife , Olivia Chow .
" I understand he has n't made a decision yet , so I 'll have to wait for that to happen before commenting , " Layton told the Star on Monday .
" I have certainly been very impressed with his leadership in the important assignments he 's had before him . "
Translation ?
Giambrone can count on Layton when he 's ready to roll .
Tory spent Monday prepping for his interview with Smitherman on Tory 's drive - home talk show on CFRB radio .
And listeners got a taste of what 's to come when they clashed over Smitherman 's record and the eHealth scandal – each combatant straining to remain polite .
The thinking of the Smitherman and Tory camps has been that the politically smart thing is to let Mayor David Miller and city council battle over this year 's tough city budget , then swoop in on the bloody battlefield after the budget carnage and offer a rescue plan attached to their campaign .
But every new week has brought new challenges that force the hand of potential candidates .
First , Miller surprised everyone by announcing he would resign at the end of the term .
Suddenly , the political calculus was no longer : " Who best to take on David Miller ? " or " Let 's not split the anti-Miller vote . "
It became a free - for - all .
Miller 's departure put both Tory and Smitherman in play , even though they had an informal pact that only one or the other would challenge Miller .
And it forced the city 's budget chief , Shelley Carroll , fellow councillor Giorgio Mammoliti , Giambrone and others to declare their interest .
Now , the fortunes have changed again .
Smitherman , battling perceptions that he is smarting from the eHealth scandal at Queen 's Park and would not run , decided to force the issue and resigned as deputy premier Sunday to run for mayor .

The eye now has ' super - vision '
As the body ages so do the eyes and people start needing glasses for reading and driving .
But now a new technique has come on the market which promises not only to restore our sight but also to make it better than before and get us seeing in high definition .
Where the light adjustable lens ( LAL ) differs from others is that because of the flexibility of its material , unpolymerised silicone , it can be adjusted after it has been placed in the eye - allowing eye surgeons to optimise vision .
But at the moment the technique , which costs upwards of £ 3,000 an eye , is not available on the NHS .
Age deterioration Larry Benjamin , from the Royal College of Ophthalmology , said : " It is an exciting development but is unlikely to be available on the NHS initially because of cost . "
TV star Fred Batt , a demonologist for the TV show Most Haunted Live , had noticed his eyes deteriorate over the years .
He needed glasses for reading but did not like wearing them and so opted to become one of the first in the UK to try the new technique .
It is like having new eyes
Fred Batt
This week , with one eye completed , Fred says the change in vision is extraordinary and he now has better than 20 /20 vision - the standard measurement .
" Before this I had to use reading glasses , " said Fred , from Surrey .
" And when I was driving at night with the headlight glaring in my eyes it would cause difficulties with seeing properly .
" With my work on the TV show I sit and look at my laptop and so when the camera comes to me I need to get information quickly to see what the others have picked up ghost - and spirit - wise .
" I will get the other eye done in two weeks - that should mean super vision - so maybe I will pick up a few more ghosts . "
Mr Batt , who was awake during surgery , said the first thing he noticed was that everything seemed brighter .
" It is like having new eyes , " he said .
No glasses Bobby Qureshi , at the London Eye Hospital , who is the only person in the UK carrying out the technique , said it allowed the eye to see perfectly again .
" We all have a lens in our eyes and this focuses the light onto the retina , " he said .
" When we are young this is transparent and flexible .
" Because it is flexible the muscles round the lens can change its focus to make the lens fat to look close up and thin to look far away .
Fred Batt needed glasses for reading " By the late 30s early 40s it tends to have become one shape so even though the muscles round it are acting on and pulling round the lens it cannot change its shape to change its focus and at that stage we need reading glasses .
It is normal ageing and called presbyopia or ageing eyes . "
The lens can then be removed and replaced with a new lens made from flexible plastic , which unlike traditional lenses can be adjusted in the eye .
" The beauty about the lens is that from the start it was designed so the shape of the lens could be changed from the outside by using light from a particular wavelength , " he said .
" By changing the shape you can change the focus so you can change long - sightedness , short - sightedness and astigmatism ( blurring ) .
" Unlike a conventional lens you can almost guarantee 20 / 20 vision because you can change and make sure you have corrected any problems . "
Eight patients have so far had the surgery - all have at least excellent 20 / 20 vision , although two still have some minor imperfections .
Alex Ionides , a consultant ophthalmologist from Moorfields Eye Hospital , said imperfections should be ruled out with the new technique .
" When we do cataract surgery we aim to give people good unaided distance vision and then they need readers for near , " he said .
" But we do n't always succeed in this aim , and some people require glasses for distance as well as for reading .
" This is owing to a bit of long - or short - sightedness or perhaps a bit of astigmatism left behind . "

Adam Lambert experiments at the AMA November 27 , 2009
Posted by admin in entertainment Tags : ABC
In front of 14 million people during his performance for the American Music Awards , former American Idol star Adam Lambert kissed a fellow performer and shoved his crotch into the face of another .
Lambert was immediately criticized , and ABC canceled his next - day performance on Good Morning America .
Lambert complained about the reaction and stated :
“ If it had been a female pop performer doing the moves that were on the stage , I do n’t think there ’d be nearly as much of an outrage at all .
I think it ’s because I ’m a gay male . ”
Lambert ’s incident became slightly more controversial after he appeared on CBS ’s The Early Show a few days later , and the program showed an unedited video of Madonna and Britney Spears kissing during the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards , but edited the clip from the American Music Awards performance .
At the very least , Lambert ’s performance was controversial because it violated community standards of obscenity .
Was the general reaction to his conduct homophobic , though ?
Such a question was recently asked by Joy Behar during a recent segment of her television talk show :
Discussion Questions :
1. Was Lambert right that there is a double standard in the entertainment industry in regards to sexual behavior ?
2 . Was ABC ’s reaction to Lambert , and perhaps much of the public ’s reaction , homophobic ?
3 . More than anything , Lambert ’s performance speaks to the controversial nature of standards of obscenity .
How does one judge what is too obscene to be shown on television ?
What are the consequences of these judgments ?
If you judge the man 's career by the individual awards he received , Brendan Shanahan was the equal of Ethan Moreau .
One King Clancy Memorial
Trophy apiece , nothing else .
Leadership and humanitarian contribution are all well and good , but individual awards do not begin to cover the breadth , and the depth , of the hockey player that was Brendan Shanahan .
Power forwards are poorly served by those awards , and Shanahan was one of the finest power forwards of his or any era .
One could argue he was the player Cam Neely might have been had he stayed healthy .
18 minutes a night , game after game , season after season , Shanahan was as consistent as they come .
He put up huge numbers across a very broad spectrum over the years : 1524 GP ( 11th all - time ) ; 656 goals ( also 11th ) ; 1354 points ( 23rd ) ; 2489 PiM ( 22nd ) ; 5086 shots on goal ( 6th ) ; 237 powerplay goals ( 5th ) ; 109 game - winning goals ( 4th ) .
But his individual successes were dwarfed by those of his teams : the 3 - time Stanley Cup champion won gold medals representing Canada in the Canada Cup , the World Championships , and the Olympic Games , joining several exclusive clubs in the process .
More on this later .
Shanahan first came to prominence at the ' 87 World Juniors , when he was one of the top performers on a Canadian team whose run to a certain medal and possible gold was derailed by the infamous Punch - Up in Piestany .
It was to be the only international bauble to escape Shanny .
First though was the rise to prominence in the NHL .
Drafted second overall ( behind Pierre Turgeon ) out of London Knights that summer of ' 87 , Shanahan proceeded directly to the NHL , never playing another game of junior or any in the minors .
I picked him in my " keeper league " fantasy pool that same fall so followed his career as closely as possible as he worked his way up the charts .
As a rookie in New Jersey he scored just 7 goals and 26 points but took no prisoners , posting 131 PiM .
He would reach triple digits in that category for 13 consecutive seasons and 17 of his first 18 .
By his second season he added scoring to the mix , reaching 20 goals for the first of 19 consecutive seasons , as well as the 50 - point plateau which he would miss only in the lockout - shortened season ( 1995 - 95 ) .
By Year 3 those totals surged to 30 and 72 and Shanny was on his way as an elite power forward .
For a star the man moved around quite a bit in the first half of his career .
His value can be seen in the quality of players for whom he was exchanged : Scott Stevens was awarded to New Jersey as compensation when Shanahan signed as a restricted free agent in St. Louis in 1991 ; the Blues later dealt him to Hartford in '95 with Chris Pronger coming the other way ; a year later the Red Wings put together a package including Paul Coffey and Keith Primeau to bring Shanny to Detroit where he settled down for the next decade .
By any measure Stevens , Pronger and Coffey rank among the top handful of NHL defencemen over the past 30 years .
Shanahan reached his individual peak in St. Louis where he put up back to back seasons of 51 and 52 goals .
In 1993 - 94 he was All - World , posting 52 - 50 - 102 with 211 PiM , career highs all , while leading the NHL in shots on goal ( 397 ) and shorthanded goals ( 7 ) and making the season - ending First All - Star Team for the first time .
I remember attending this game where I essentially isolated on " my " guy from my seat in the high end zone for the entire game .
Shanny broke a 1 - 1 tie early in the third , but it 's the empty netter that I remember in detail .
Oilers down 2 - 1 but on the powerplay , goalie out for the 6 - on - 4 , faceoff in Blues ' end , 53 seconds left .
St. Louis sends out Shanahan to not only kill the penalty but take the faceoff , just another one of those value - added things you do n't expect from a winger .
Ca n't recall who the centre was for the Oilers , but when the puck dropped Shanahan lifted the guy 's stick clean as a whistle as he spun to his left , picked up the disc with his right skate , kicked the puck on to his stick as he completed his 360 and sifted a 180 - foot shot right into the empty net .
Total elapsed time : 3.6 seconds .
One of the best empty - netters I 've ever seen .
In the end it turned out to be the game winner when Louie DeBrusk of all people notched a late consolation goal .
Another memorable Shanny performance closed that ' 93 - 94 season .
The Blues met the Winnipeg Jets , featuring another top power forward of the day , Keith Tkachuk ( a player whom I have always detested for various reasons ) .
On this occasion Tkachuk caught Shanahan with a vicious high stick , really raked him and opened a wicked cut above his lip which resulted in a nasty scar .
Shanahan bled profusely , went off for repairs , came back for the third period still leaking , and proceeded to score two goals to put the game on ice .
Then he turned his attention back to Tkachuk , jumping the Jets star and whaling the tar out of him .
The message was loud and clear : Do Not Mess With Brendan Shanahan .
That spring of ' 94 Shanahan was a key player as Team Canada won its first world championship in 33 long years .
It was Brendan 's second gold medal on the international scene , adding to a trophy case that already included Canada Cup gold from 1991 .
Next on the agenda was the Stanley Cup .
Mired in their own decades - long drought , Detroit had been coming close , making the SCF but being swept by the Devils in ' 95 , then winning the President 's Trophy with a record 62 wins in ' 96 .
The Wings brain trust felt they were a little too soft up front so targeted Shanahan as their man , landing him early in the ' 96 - 97 season .
It was a perfect fit ; with the veteran Shanahan in a support role the Wings won back - to - back Cups in '97 and ' 98 .
Alas , around this time I parted ways with Shanny on my fantasy team , being suckered in a weak moment by a shiny bauble named Sergei Samsonov who had just won the Calder Trophy .
Short - term pain for long - term gain I figured , but I figured wrong as Shanny outpointed Sammy in each subsequent season .
Never mind the other 19 things he could do for a hockey club that Samsonov could n't ; even in a points - only hockey pool Shanny proved to be the better bet .
In real life Shanahan settled down in Detroit for a decade , where he was a constant force , missing just 20 games over that entire span .
His goal totals ranged from 25 to 41 and basically fluctuated with his shooting percentage , as his shots on goal were virtually constant year over year : 266 , 288 , 283 , 278 , 277 , 260 , 280 , 289 ... the man was a shooter through and through .
His career reached another pinnacle in 2002 when he helped Team Canada break another decades - long jinx , winning the Olympic gold medal for the first time in a half - century .
He then completed a remarkable double when the Red Wings reclaimed the Stanley Cup .
Shanahan and team - mate Steve Yzerman became just the second and third men to accomplish this feat , previously accomplished by the great ( and greatly underrated ) defenceman Ken Morrow in 1980 .
Shanahan joined a couple of other exclusive groups in the process , including the " Triple Gold Club " which consists of 22 players ( and entirely too many Swedes ) who have won Olympic and World Championship gold as well as the Stanley Cup .
Only five players have won those three plus a Canada / World Cup : Slava Fetisov , Igor Larionov , Joe Sakic , Scott Niedermayer and Brendan Shanahan .
That 's pretty elite company .
During the lockout that torpedoed the 2004 - 05 season Shanahan headed a two - day summit of players and coaches which made 10 recommendations to the NHL and the players association to improve the flow of play .
Many of these changes were adopted when play finally resumed .
After a final 40 - goal , 80 - point , 100 PiM season in which the Wings won the President 's Trophy but were upset by Edmonton in the playoffs , Shanahan made one last appearance for Team Canada at the Worlds .
Although his appearances were limited by playoff commitments , he had represented his country in 1987 , 1991 , 1994 , 1996 , 1998 , 2002 and 2006 : a World - class player for two decades .
Shanahan moved on for two solid seasons with the Rangers before signing with New Jersey midway through last season to end where he began .
He broke in with the Devils at 18 and played his last games with them at 40 .
Announcing the end of his wonderful career earlier this week , Shanny retired from the NHL with at least one unofficial record , having compiled no fewer than 9 " Gordie Howe hat tricks " .
Brendan Shanahan brought a lot of game , and he brought it every night .
While North America 's airports groan under the weight of another sea-change in security protocols , one word keeps popping out of the mouths of experts : Israelification .
That is , how can we make our airports more like Israel 's , which deal with far greater terror threat with far less inconvenience .
" It is mindboggling for us Israelis to look at what happens in North America , because we went through this 50 years ago , " said Rafi Sela , the president of AR Challenges , a global transportation security consultancy .
He 's worked with the RCMP , the U.S. Navy Seals and airports around the world .
" Israelis , unlike Canadians and Americans , do n't take s--- from anybody .
When the security agency in Israel ( the ISA ) started to tighten security and we had to wait in line for — not for hours — but 30 or 40 minutes , all hell broke loose here .
We said , ' We 're not going to do this .
You 're going to find a way that will take care of security without touching the efficiency of the airport . "
That , in a nutshell is " Israelification " - a system that protects life and limb without annoying you to death .
Fliers urged to opt out of airport security en masse
Despite facing dozens of potential threats each day , the security set - up at Israel 's largest hub , Tel Aviv 's Ben Gurion Airport , has not been breached since 2002 , when a passenger mistakenly carried a handgun onto a flight .
How do they manage that ?
" The first thing you do is to look at who is coming into your airport , " said Sela .
The first layer of actual security that greets travellers at Tel Aviv 's Ben Gurion International Airport is a roadside check .
All drivers are stopped and asked two questions :
How are you ?
Where are you coming from ?
" Two benign questions .
The questions are n't important .
The way people act when they answer them is , " Sela said .
Officers are looking for nervousness or other signs of " distress " — behavioural profiling .
Sela rejects the argument that profiling is discriminatory .
" The word ' profiling ' is a political invention by people who do n't want to do security , " he said .
" To us , it does n't matter if he 's black , white , young or old .
It 's just his behaviour .
So what kind of privacy am I really stepping on when I 'm doing this ? "
Once you 've parked your car or gotten off your bus , you pass through the second and third security perimeters .
Armed guards outside the terminal are trained to observe passengers as they move toward the doors , again looking for odd behaviour .
At Ben Gurion 's half - dozen entrances , another layer of security are watching .
At this point , some travellers will be randomly taken aside , and their person and their luggage run through a magnometer .
" This is to see that you do n't have heavy metals on you or something that looks suspicious , " said Sela .
You are now in the terminal .
As you approach your airline check - in desk , a trained interviewer takes your passport and ticket .
They ask a series of questions :
Who packed your luggage ?
Has it left your side ?
" The whole time , they are looking into your eyes — which is very embarrassing .
But this is one of the ways they figure out if you are suspicious or not .
It takes 20 , 25 seconds , " said Sela .
Lines are staggered .
People are not allowed to bunch up into inviting targets for a bomber who has gotten this far .
At the check - in desk , your luggage is scanned immediately in a purpose - built area .
Sela plays devil 's advocate — what if you have escaped the attention of the first four layers of security , and now try to pass a bag with a bomb in it ?
" I once put this question to Jacques Duchesneau ( the former head of the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority ) : say there is a bag with play - doh in it and two pens stuck in the play - doh .
That is ' Bombs 101 ' to a screener .
I asked Ducheneau , ' What would you do ? '
And he said , ' Evacuate the terminal . '
And I said , ' Oh. My. God . '
" Take Pearson .
Do you know how many people are in the terminal at all times ?
Many thousands .
Let 's say I'm ( doing an evacuation ) without panic — which will never happen .
But let 's say this is the case .
How long will it take ?
Nobody thought about it .
I said , ' Two days . ' "
A screener at Ben-Gurion has a pair of better options .
First , the screening area is surrounded by contoured , blast - proof glass that can contain the detonation of up to 100 kilos of plastic explosive .
Only the few dozen people within the screening area need be removed , and only to a point a few metres away .
Second , all the screening areas contain ' bomb boxes ' .
If a screener spots a suspect bag , he / she is trained to pick it up and place it in the box , which is blast proof .
A bomb squad arrives shortly and wheels the box away for further investigation .

" This is a very small simple example of how we can simply stop a problem that would cripple one of your airports , " Sela said .
Five security layers down : you now finally arrive at the only one which Ben-Gurion Airport shares with Pearson — the body and hand - luggage check .
" But here it is done completely , absolutely 180 degrees differently than it is done in North America , " Sela said .
" First , it 's fast — there 's almost no line .
That 's because they 're not looking for liquids , they 're not looking at your shoes .
They 're not looking for everything they look for in North America .
They just look at you , " said Sela .
" Even today with the heightened security in North America , they will check your items to death .
But they will never look at you , at how you behave .
They will never look into your eyes ... and that 's how you figure out the bad guys from the good guys . "
That 's the process — six layers , four hard , two soft .
The goal at Ben-Gurion is to move fliers from the parking lot to the airport lounge in a maximum of 25 minutes .
This does n't begin to cover the off - site security net that failed so spectacularly in targeting would - be Flight 253 bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab — intelligence .
In Israel , Sela said , a coordinated intelligence gathering operation produces a constantly evolving series of threat analyses and vulnerability studies .
" There is absolutely no intelligence and threat analysis done in Canada or the United States , " Sela said .
" Absolutely none . "
But even without the intelligence , Sela maintains , Abdulmutallab would not have gotten past Ben Gurion Airport 's behavioural profilers .
So .
Eight years after 9/11 , why are we still so reactive , so un-Israelified ?
Working hard to dampen his outrage , Sela first blames our leaders , and then ourselves .
" We have a saying in Hebrew that it 's much easier to look for a lost key under the light , than to look for the key where you actually lost it , because it 's dark over there .
That 's exactly how ( North American airport security officials ) act , " Sela said .
" You can easily do what we do .
You do n't have to replace anything .
You have to add just a little bit — technology , training .
But you have to completely change the way you go about doing airport security .
And that is something that the bureaucrats have a problem with .
They are very well enclosed in their own concept . "
And rather than fear , he suggests that outrage would be a far more powerful spur to provoking that change .
" Do you know why Israelis are so calm ?
We have brutal terror attacks on our civilians and still , life in Israel is pretty good .
The reason is that people trust their defence forces , their police , their response teams and the security agencies .
They know they 're doing a good job .
You can't say the same thing about Americans and Canadians .
They do n't trust anybody , " Sela said .
" But they say , ' So far , so good ' .
Then if something happens , all hell breaks loose and you 've spent eight hours in an airport .
Which is ridiculous .
Not justifiable
" But , what can you do ?
Americans and Canadians are nice people and they will do anything because they were told to do so and because they do n't know any different . "
Fliers urged to opt out of airport security en masse

Following are excerpts from a TV children ’s show , in which children learn about Palestinian suicide bomber Wafa Idris .
The show aired on Al - Quds TV on December 1 , 2009 .
TV Host :
There used to be a girl , who was a student at medical school .
She lived in a refugee camp called Al - Am’ari .
the Al - Am’ari camp , my dear children , is located near the city of Ramallah in occupied Palestine .
[...]
[ Wafa Idris ] went to the commander of the resistance , and asked to carry out a martyrdom operation .
What , a girl carrying out a martyrdom operation ?!
She said : I want to carry out a martyrdom operation , just like any young man in the resistance .
Obviously , the commander hesitated at first , because this was the first time such a thing happened .
Since the beginning of the Intifada , no Palestinian girl had carried out a martyrdom operation .
But Wafa insisted , until she managed to convince the commander that the Zionists would not pay attention to a girl .
Usually , they only inspect the young men .
So the commander agreed .
In light of her determination , courage , and persistence – he agreed .
[...]
So he set out .
The moment she set foot on the road , she remembered something .
What was it ?
Not a family member or a relative .
She remembered that she had not fed the doves on the roof .
Quickly , she climbed to the roof .
As soon as the doves saw her , they began flapping their wings .
From among the doves , Wafa took a white dove in her hands .
Its wing was broken two days earlier .
Wafa stroked it gently and said to it :
Do n’t worry , white dove , peace dove .
Tomorrow , you will be able to fly again .
You will return to your nest in the Old city of Jerusalem .
Tomorrow , the skies will open up before your wings , and you will fly over the Galilee , Nablus , Jenin , Bethlehem , and Hebron .
Wafa went to her work as usual , but obviously , she took a day off , and left .
Why ?
Because the time for the heroic operation had come .
Boy :
Where was the operation ?
TV Host : In Jerusalem .
On her way to West Jerusalem , everything she saw encouraged her to commit martyrdom .
[...]
Second boy : Was n’t Wafa afraid among the occupiers ?
Did n’t she hesitate ?
TV Host : Of course not .
She was n’t afraid , and she did not hesitate , because she placed Allah between her eyes and in her heart .
She would always remember Allah and would crush her fear .
If fear wanted to come near her calm and peaceful heart , she would get ready to enter Paradise , knowing that she would be among the living , who are sustained [ by God ] .
Who are they ?
The martyrs .
[...]
Today , Wafa will not treat the wounded in Ramallah .
Why ?
She will go to Jerusalem , and there will be many dead and wounded there , but not from among the Palestinians .
They will be from among the Zionist soldiers .
[...]
Wafa fulfilled her wish by successfully carrying out her martyrdom operation .
The result was that she killed an Israeli soldier and wounded about a hundred .
Why was Wafa martyred ?
So that the flower of the homeland would not wither .
[...]
Third boy :
When was she martyred ?
TV Host : Wafa Idris was martyred on Sunday , January 27 , 2002 .
She has become a role model for any Palestinian girl who harbors the spirit of self - sacrifice , national sentiment , and love of death for the sake of Allah and in defense of the homeland .
Young girl : I want to become a doctor like Wafa , so that I can help the wounded .
TV Host : Allah willing , we will all become like Wafa Idris .
We will treat the wounded , and Allah will grant us martyrdom .
Toronto police detectives will knock on 6,000 doors in a triangle of northern Toronto starting today in the latest attempt to uncover information about the disappearance of teenager Mariam Makhniashvili .
" There will be a large presence of police in your neighbourhood .
You will expect a knock at your door and police will keep knocking at your door , " Det. Sgt. Dan Nealon told a news conference Monday morning .
" We 're also asking to be invited into your home just for a quick peek into areas of your home to ensure that there is no evidence in relation to this case with respect to you and we can move on . "
Sixty plainclothes detectives are involved in the massive investigation , which will knock on doors of houses , condos and apartments in the area around Shallmar Blvd. , where Mariam and her family live , in the Bathurst St. and Eglinton Ave. area for the next two or three weeks , seven days a week , 12 hours a day , he said .
Even though police have already visited homes in this area , it 's an opportunity to " drill down into that area , " he said .
A new digitally enhanced photo of Mariam in the clothes she wore when she disappeared Sept. 14 has also been released and will be displayed for days on a large information screen outside the Yonge - Eglinton Centre , Nealon said .
The intersection , a block away from where her knapsack was found last month , is " one of the busiest areas in the city and hopefully it'll grab someone 's attention , " said Nealon .
This " unprecedented move " by Toronto police follows helicopter searches that turned up nothing , he said .
He insisted there was no firm evidence of foul play in the disappearance on that Monday morning in September of Mariam , who has since turned 18 .
People " have the right " not to talk to police or let them into their homes , Nealon said .
" We have gathered certain information , " he said , without elaborating .
In the nearly two months since Mariam disappeared , police have appealed to hundreds of teenagers at two Toronto schools during public assemblies , used helicopters to search for clues , seized 27 computers at two libraries to try to trace her emails and Web surfing , and papered the city with posters .
Mariam was last seen while walking to Forest Hill Collegiate with her brother .
They had moved to Toronto in late June from the Republic of Georgia to be reunited with her parents , who had been living in California for five years .
Her parents have said she did not speak English very well , had no friends and did not know her way around Toronto .
Last week , police began using Ontario Provincial Police helicopters in their search for clues , but a helicopter sweep of two Toronto parks failed to turn up new leads .
Toronto police used the chopper , equipped with heat - seeking equipment and capable of taking high - resolution photos , to scan Earl Bales Park and Sherwood Park .
Fallen leaves provided better sightlines but offered no leads .
It was the second aerial search of Earl Bales Park , near Bathurst St. and Sheppard Ave. W. , about six kilometres north of her school and home .
It was the first time such a search was done at Sherwood Park , near Mount Pleasant Rd. and Blythwood Rd. , about two kilometres north of the spot where Makhniashvili 's knapsack was found one month ago .

Earlier , Toronto police seized 27 computers on Tuesday from the Forest Hill and Barbara Frum library branches , close to Mariam 's home .
She had visited them before vanishing on Sept. 14 .
" We know that Mariam attended the library for the purpose of using the computer , " said Const .

An imbalance of regulatory cells may be the reason why some people are more susceptible to Crohn ’s disease , ulcerative colitis , and other autoimmune diseases .
The report comes from researchers at the University of Adelaide , who say the cell imbalance has been observed in people who have inflammatory bowel disease .
Inflammatory bowel disease , which includes Crohn ’s disease and ulcerative colitis , affects approximately one million Americans , according to the American College of Gastroenterology .
The causes of this autoimmune disease , which is characterized by inflammation in the digestive tract , abdominal cramps , bloody diarrhea , and fever , are unknown .
The disease most often develops between the ages of 10 and 30 , although a lesser peak develops in people between ages 50 and 60 .
Currently there is no cure , and the goal of treatment is to relieve inflammation .
The new study , which appears in the Journal of Clinical Immunology , reveals that people who have Crohn ’s disease and ulcerative colitis have a reduced number of regulatory cells and more “ attack ” cells that cause inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract .
According to a news release from the University , Dr. Nicola Eastaff - Leung , who conducted the research , noted that healthy individuals possess a mechanism to tolerate food in an appropriate manner .
“ But some people do not have enough of these regulatory cells and their body overreacts and goes into attack mode .
That is where the inflammation occurs . ”

Dr. Eastaff - Leung ’s work may lead to a diagnostic tool for gastrointestinal diseases , perhaps a blood test to identify an imbalance of regulatory cells , which would reduce the need for colonoscopies .
However , she also pointed out that “ the second , bigger challenge is to work out a treatment that can restore the balance of these cells , ” as well as determine why the imbalance occurs in the first place .
Thus far , evidence points to diet and lifestyle as being significant factors in the development of gastrointestinal disease .
Dr. Estaff - Leung noted that inflammatory bowel diseases and many other autoimmune disorders are common in developed Western nations but rarely seen in developing or Third World countries .
The very things we identify as progress may be harming our health .
Dr. Eastaff - Leung believes that the Western diet is a factor in the development of Crohn ’s disease and ulcerative colitis , and in other autoimmune disorders .
Another factor is the obsession with cleanliness and the use of antibacterial products , which she says “ has gone overboard .
Children need to be exposed to bacteria as they are developing in order to build their immune system naturally . ”
For the next year , Dr. Eastaff - Leung will be working with other scientists to develop a new biomarker for the regulatory immune cells , with the hope of eventually finding a way to correct the cell imbalance seen in inflammatory bowel disease .

The ‘ Motorola Droid ’ caught a lot of attention in the last months , therefore I thought to research the web a bit to make this YouTube video , comparison review list .
Most of the information in this post are about ‘ Motorola Droid ‘ comparison with the BlackBerry Storm 2 , the Nokia N97 / 900 and my other favorite Droid the HTC - Droid Eris .
Another way leads to the ‘ iPhone 3GS ’ which has been compared with the Droids and with the ‘ Palm Pre ’ , the ‘ Palm Pixi ’ , the HTC Touch Pro2 Windows Mobile and the Verizon Wireless Touch Pro2 smart - phones .
Motorola Droid Vs. RIM BlackBerry Storm 2
The launch of the Motorola Droid in November ’09 was n’t very useful for BlackBerry Storm 2 .
The ‘ BlackBerry Storm 2 ′ was RIM ’s second attempt to try to offer an alternative Smartphone , which should compete with Apple ’s famous iPhone .
Now Motorola ’s Droid smartphone receives plenty of attention , that the launch of the BlackBerry Storm 2 falls into oblivion .
In this video Jon Rettinger aka jon4lakers from technobuffalo.com compares the functionality of the Browser and Browser speed , the Text entry , customization , navigation and apps on these both smart - phones .
The Motorola ( An ) Droid has the better Browser rendering plus the right screen which wins against BlackBerry ’s baby screen .
The page load on 3G and Wifi is on The Droid much faster than on the BB .
The Storm ’s keyboard is much better to use then Motorola ’s soft and hard keyboard .
The Blackberry Storm 2 looks much more compact , but I would prefer the bigger screen of the Motorola Droid over the BlackBerry Storm .
I also would prefer that the OS of the Motorola Droid is open source , while the BlackBerry OS 5 is not .
Android ’s open source software allows adding widgets without restriction , which is a smart way of customizing your Droid ’s Desk very easy .
Load your Android 2.0 applications via the Android Market .
The Black Berry Storm limits the added Widgets to 8 and the applications on the Webstore seems also be a bit more expensive then the commercial apps for the Android phone .
The HTC -( An ) Droid Eris vs Motorola Droid
Motorola Android vs Verizon Wireless Touch Pro2
The Eris is a very cool smartphone with pretty much the same characteristics then the Motorola Droid has .
The Motorola Droid has a faster processor , but I ’m not quite sure if this makes such a big difference , because the speed difference seems to be very low .
Besides the bigger screen , the pictures on the Motorola have a much higher resolution and the fact that the Motorola Droid delivers a 16 GB SD card , that makes an advantage against HTC ’s Droid Eris by as much as 8gb .

Find out in our Nokia N900 review .
If the N900 has a better overall look - n- feel it depends on your taste , when you are a music lover , you will like the FM Radio / Transmitter and the 32 GB memory .
These are the main reasons why you should use the N900 over the Motorola Droid also people says that the N900 has a Better Keyboard and a better Camera .
Now I will stop writing people love short posts and when I feel that you are on an Android I ’m feeling sorry for this long post .
A big thank you to InfoSync.com for providing their great review list where you can compare four phones of your choice .

The New York State Police ’s supervision of a major crime laboratory was so poor that it overlooked evidence of pervasively shoddy forensics work , allowing an analyst to go undetected for 15 years as he falsified test results and compromised nearly one - third of his cases , an investigation by the state ’s inspector general has found .
The analyst ’s training was so substandard that at one point last year , investigators discovered he could not properly operate a microscope essential to performing his job , the report released on Thursday said .
And when the State Police became aware of the analyst ’s misconduct , an internal review by superiors in the Albany lab deliberately omitted information implicating other analysts and suggesting systemic problems with the way evidence was handled , the report said .
Instead , the review focused blame mostly on the analyst , Garry Veeder , who committed suicide in May 2008 during the internal inquiry .
“ Cutting corners in a crime lab is serious and intolerable , ” said the state ’s inspector general , Joseph Fisch .
“ Forensic laboratories must adhere to the highest standards of competence , independence and integrity .
Anything less undermines public confidence in our criminal justice system . ”
We 're not in it for the short haul
We ’ve had some good ( and some volatile ) discussions in comments recently , particularly over what constitutes drug policy reform and its end goals .
This is quite healthy ( as long as we avoid the name - calling ) .
We have a number of people who frequent this site with different views both of our destination and our route to get there ( and even how we should publicly describe our route to get there ) .
I ’m going to inject LEAP ’s Norm Stamper into that discussion , with a particularly appropriate piece over at Alternet : Let ’s Not Stop at Marijuana Legalization
Yet , I ’m alarmed that the above - mentioned poll showing majority support for marijuana legalization also found that fewer than one in 10 people agree that it ’s time to end the prohibition of other drugs .
This no doubt makes sense to some readers at first glance , since more people are familiar with marijuana than other drugs like cocaine , heroin or meth .
However , even a cursory study of our drug war policies will reveal that legalizing pot but not other drugs will leave huge social harms unresolved . [ … ]
Marijuana legalization is a great step in the direction of sane and sensible drug policy .
But we reformers must remember that we ’re working to legalize drugs not because we think they are safe , but because prohibition is far more dangerous to users and nonusers alike .
Read the whole thing — it ’s worth it .
Norm ’s OpEd very closely echoes my views .
I ’m fine with incrementalism .
I think medical marijuana , for example , serves us in two ways — on its own merits , and as a stepping stone toward acceptance of marijuana in general .
I realize there are others who believe we should instead build and wield the Weapon of Instant Legalization of all things , but I seem unable to make sense out of the blueprints .
I ’m not fine at stopping with marijuana .
Like Norm , I ’m perhaps less interested in the ability to freely shoot heroin than I am in stopping the evils of prohibition .
I ’m not opposed to regulation , and will accept that to the extent that it makes it possible to virtually eliminate black market harms .
I ’m not concerned that we do n’t yet have a finalized policy model for each legalized drug .
I believe that there ’s more than one that is acceptable and meets the requirements , and that these will come with trial and error ( probably in the laboratory of the states ) , but we do have some good blueprints , despite the unwillingness of the “ academics ” in the U.S. to do their job and actually craft policy options .
Next , while I know some do n’t like the word “ legalization , ” I will continue to use it .
Sure , the word can scare people , and our opponents know it and try to demonize us with it .
And I understand “ framing . ”
But by avoiding the word , we cede to it that dark power , when in fact , the meaning of the word has nothing inherently in it to elicit fear or shame .
Every time a former cop from Law Enforcement Against Prohibition steps up in front of a Kiwanis Club and says “ We need to legalize all drugs , and here ’s why … , ” the word “ legalization ” takes a giant step over to our side .
When our opponents no long have that word to scare people , what do they have left ?
Finally , I understand that we ’re in it for the long haul — not just in terms that have to do with continuing beyond marijuana legalization , but because it ’s the nature of our fight .
The only way we ’ll win is by changing people ’s minds , one at a time .
There ’s no wizard who can ride up and wave their magic wand to undo decades of corruption and propaganda .
No President is going to step in and tear up the Controlled Substances Act on national TV .
We had a victory this week in Congress on syringe exchange , and I really appreciate the sentiment in this OpEd by Julie Davids at Prevention Justice .
Bill Clinton said NOT lifting the federal funding ban on syringe exchange was one of the biggest regrets in his presidency .
But he did n’t fess up to that till he was safely out of the White House .
Barack Obama pledged to lift the ban .
Then pointedly did n’t publicly work to do so , even when his imprimatur could have given a much - needed margin of safety for congressional efforts .
But who really did work to lift the ban ?
People with HIV , drug users , harm reduction leaders and their allies .
Long - time and brand new AIDS activists who took to the streets and the halls of Congress and the plaza of HHS and the UN for decades at this point , including those who got arrested in the Capitol Rotunda in one of the first acts of civil disobedience against the Obama Adminstration .
Organizers and policy wonks who counted the votes and worked hand in hand with grassroots activists to persuade and convert legislators .
Religous people who spoke up about what faith and redemption and compassion really means .
AIDS service and prevention providers and drug treatment people and harm reduction counselors and people in recovery , and people in and out of recovery , who spoke up about their lives and their work .
And because of all this – not because of the political cowardice of those who knew they were doing the wrong thing by allowing the ban to persist but who time and again shrank in the face of ideological opposition – the ban will now be lifted .
We ’re in it for the long haul .
There was a time when the federal government ’s annual budget was submitted by the president and decided by the Congress in a relatively straightforward fashion .
A time when it was n’t so difficult to figure out what the government spent taxpayers ’ money on .
But this is , or soon will be , 2010 , and President Obama ’s promises of transparency aside , the new way of doing things in the perpetual wartime economy is to pass bulky spending bills filled with anything and everything Congressmen want on an accelerated schedule , every few months .
In today ’s example , a 1088 page $ 1.1 trillion “ compromise ” spending bill passed through the House of Representatives in a 221- 202 vote along partisan lines .
The bill covers everything from veteran ’s benefits to arbitration for car dealers and , of course , a hefty raise in the foreign aid budget .
The latest massive spending bill comes less than two months after the White House signed a $ 680 billion “ Defense Spending Bill , ” which included hate crimes legislation provisions and restarted military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay .
That bill itself came just a few months after a $ 106 billion “ emergency ” war spending bill , which included a number of “ pet projects , ” including the so - called Cash for Clunkers program that subsidized new car purchases in return for a promise to destroy what were in many cases servicable used cars .
Which of course came not long after the $ 787 billion “ stimulus bill ” aimed at hurling enough money at assorted government programs that the economy would improve .
When President Obama took office , he promised a more transparent budget , particularly with promises to stop requesting “ emergency ” war spending bills to pay for what are now several year old wars .
This promise , like so many others , will likely be ignored , as the defense budgets have projected a more rapid pullout from Iraq and did not include last week ’s massive escalation of the Afghan War , itself a $ 30 billion addition to the annual cost .
Instead , America seems poised to continue the new way of doing things , piecemeal spending bills which provide ample opportunity to include the trendy projects that Congress craves and the unclear picture of the overall cost of war that keeps the voter largely in the dark about how much the nation ’s assorted adventures really cost .
Balk scratches his head after reading Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen :
Now , I ’m no professional journalist or anything .
I did n’t go to J - school , I do n’t spell “ lead ” the right way , and I hate talking to people on the phone , but even with all those qualifications I ’ve got to think this would be the time where you , I dunno , asked a follow - up ?
“ Cheney was asked if he thinks the Bush administration bears any responsibility for the disintegration of Afghanistan because of the attention and resources that were diverted to Iraq .
 I basically do n’t , ’ he replied without elaborating . “
Increasingly , these journos see themselves as conduits for politicians , not as independent actors determined to get at the truth and hold the powerful accountable .
There are no follow - ups any more ; and when you see how Palin was insulated from real questioning in the campaign and book tour , you realize how corrupted the MSM has become .
Mike Allen has done this before - giving Cheney or Rove a platform as well as anonymity - with no pushback or skepticism .
What matters is the " get " and the pageviews , not the substance .
These people are not checks on power ; they are increasingly its willing accomplices .

Arsène Wenger has admitted that Robin van Persie 's long - term ankle injury will force him to search for a replacement striker during the January transfer window .
The Arsenal manager , who is generally wary of the mid-season window , associating it with desperate measures , said he would only do business if any deal were viable .
But for the first time since the full extent of Van Persie 's injury became clear , he conceded that it had affected his thinking .
" It has to , " he said .
" It has to because I did n't feel we were in the need to buy anybody , but we will be out on the market , that is for sure .
But we will only make a decision if it suits us . "
Wenger 's words will be welcomed by many of the club 's supporters who saw him sell Emmanuel Adebayor to Manchester City over the summer but choose not to replace him .
He instead put his faith in Van Persie , Nicklas Bendtner , Eduardo da Silva and Carlos Vela .
All four , though , have suffered injuries , with Van Persie 's the most demoralising .
Van Persie was hurt while playing for Holland against Italy last month following a challenge from Giorgio Chiellini , the motives of which Wenger has now questioned .
" I watched the tackle of Chiellini again ; it looked anonymous but it's not as anonymous as it looks at the start and in between [ the Holland forward ]
Dirk Kuyt has come out and said that they were kicked by the Italians , " Wenger said .
" In such an important season for us we lose players in friendlies on tackles like that and it is really difficult to accept . "
Chiellini has denied any malicious intent .
Van Persie was diagnosed by the Dutch FA 's doctors to have suffered a partial ligament tear but after further tests by Arsenal 's medics , the ligaments were revealed to have been severed .
He has been ruled out for five months , virtually the remainder of the domestic season .
Bendtner , who has not played since the beginning of last month because of groin surgery , is not expected to return until Christmas at the earliest .
Wenger 's interest in the Bordeaux striker Marouane Chamakh is well documented , although a January deal appears unlikely .
His other targets include André - Pierre Gignac of Toulouse , Milan 's Klaas - Jan Huntelaar and Mario Balotelli of Internazionale .
Sampdoria 's Giampaolo Pazzini is another Serie A striker on Wenger 's radar .
Arsenal face Manchester City at Eastlands in the Carling Cup quarter - final tonight and because of injuries , Wenger 's team will be even more experimental than that which beat Liverpool in the previous round .
The 17 - year - old midfielder Jack Wilshere , a loan target for Celtic , will start .
It was billed as the moment when a wildlife photographer 's remarkable patience was rewarded ; an image which won him £ 10,000 and the year 's most prestigious award .
But José Luis Rodriguez is now facing allegations that his startling close - up image of an apparently wild Iberian wolf vaulting a farmer 's fence is in fact faked .
The judges of the Veolia Environnement Wildlife photographer of the year competition confirmed tonight they were reconvening to determine whether the Spanish photographer had used a tame and captive " model " animal in breach of competition rules .
They have been sent evidence , apparently from rival photographers , that the pictured animal is a wolf called Ossian who lives at a zoological park near Madrid .
A wolf expert , quoted by Finnish nature magazine Suomen Luonto , which revealed the allegations , also said the wolf appears to have been trained to jump the gate , because a wild specimen is likely to squeeze between the bars .
Rodriguez could not be reached for comment , but a spokesman for the Natural History Museum , which runs the prize with BBC Wildlife Magazine , said he strongly denied any wrongdoing or breach of the competition rules .
" The museum is aware of an allegation as to the veracity of the photograph , Storybook Wolf , by José Luis Rodriguez , specifically that an animal model was used in breach of the competition rules , " she said .
" We are investigating this thoroughly with the judging panel and will report back in the new year once our investigations are completed .
Mr Rodriguez strongly denies any wrongdoing or breach of the competition rules . "
The rules of the competition , which attracted 43,000 entries , state that " images of captive animals must be declared .
The judges will take preference to images taken in free and wild conditions " .
Rodriguez had told the judges it took him a long time to find the ideal location , let alone a wolf that would jump a gate .
The text accompanying the winning photograph explained : " His chance came when he found a landowner who was happy to have both the wolves and José Luis on his property , and also had the ideal setting : a copse and an ancient , disused cattle corral .
" José Luis started by placing meat in the corral .
Once he knew a male wolf was visiting regularly , jumping the gate , he began to introduce the bits of equipment needed to set up a camera trap …
When the first transparencies arrived back from the lab , José Luis was overjoyed to find he finally had the picture he had dreamt of . "
One wolf expert , Ilpo Kojola of the Finnish game and fisheries research institute , told the magazine that judging by the pictures provided in evidence against the Spaniard , Rodriguez 's wolf appeared to be the tame Ossian .
" The dark , scar - like sign under the right eye seems to be a unique mark of this individual , " he said .
One judge , Rosamund Kidman Cox , told Luonto judges were looking at details such as differences between images presented of Ossian 's right ear and that of the wolf in the photo .
The picture of Ossian shows the ear apparently damaged and Kidman Cox speculated this may have been the result of a fight .
" But until one bit of evidence can be verified I do n't think it 's possible to accuse the photographer of cheating , " she said .
" It 's not 100 % . "
Lily was traveling to Tel Aviv .
For some reason , the Israeli security officers thought she was suspicious .
So they put three bullets through her MacBook .
Then they asked me to wait .
Since they had asked for friends and families phone numbers I assumed they might be calling to verify my answers to questions or confirm I really had extended family in Tel Aviv .
An announcement played over the sound system , interrupting my break in the sunshine .
First in Hebrew , then Arabic , then in English .
It was something along the lines of , " do not to be alarmed by gunshots because the Israeli security needs to blow up suspicious passanger luggage . "
I went inside to check on my bag .
I had left it unattended , where they instructed .
It was still there so I went back outside .
Moments later a man came outside and introduced himself as the manager on duty .
And then , " I 'm sorry but we had to blow up your laptop . "

Where Keynes Went Wrong And Why Governments Keep Creating Inflation , Bubbles , and Busts • By Hunter Lewis • Axios Press , 2009 • Vi + 384 pages .
Defenders of Keynes , such as the recent convert Bruce Bartlett , often claim that he supported capitalism .
( Bartlett 's The New American Economy has this as a primary theme . )
His interventionist measures had as their aim not the replacement of capitalism by socialism or fascism .
Rather , it is alleged , Keynes aimed to save the existing order .
The unhampered market cannot by itself recover from a severe depression or at best can do so after long years of privation and unemployment .
Keynes discovered a way by which the government , through an increase in spending , can restore the economy to prosperity .
Only diehard purists could spurn Keynes 's gift to capitalism .
Without it , would not revolutionary pressure mount in a severe depression to overturn capitalism and replace it with socialism or fascism ?
Hunter Lewis convincingly shows the error of this often - heard line of thought .
Keynes , far from being the savior of capitalism , aimed to replace free enterprise with a state - controlled economy run by " experts " like him .
His prescriptions for recovery from depression do not save capitalism : they derail the price system by which it functions .
As one would expect , Keynes lacks sound arguments to support his revolutionary proposals .
Quite the contrary , Keynes defied common sense and willfully resorted to paradox .
Indeed , as Lewis points out , the entire Keynesian edifice rests on a central paradox : impeding the central mechanism of the free market will restore prosperity .
The free market works by price adjustments .
If , e.g. , consumers demand more of a product than is currently available , suppliers will raise their prices so that no imbalance exists .
As consumers shift their demand from product to product , businesses must adjust their production schedules to meet changing preferences .
If firms fail to do so , they face extinction .
If an economy is stumbling , and unemployment is high , it means that some prices are far out of balance with others … .
Some companies , some industries may be doing well ; others may be in desperate straits .
What is needed is an adjustment of particular wages and particular prices within and between companies , within and between industries , within and between sectors .
These adjustments are not a one - time event .
They must be ongoing , as each such change leads to another in a vast feedback loop .
( p. 232 ) .
Keynes 's " remedies " for depression paralyze this process of price adjustment .
In a depression , obviously , many businesses fail .
When they go under , resources shift into uses that enable the demands of consumers to be satisfied better .
If increases in government spending prop these failures up , consumer preferences are thwarted .
This is just what Keynes proposed .
" Keynes defied common sense and willfully resorted to paradox . "
Further , Keynes ignored the significance of a fundamental fact .
The rate of interest is also a price .
It reflects the preferences of consumers for present over future goods : the greater the time preference , the higher the rate of interest .
Keynes 's principal aim in economic policy , not only to combat depressions but more generally , was to keep the rate of interest low : ideally , it should be done away with entirely .
To do so flies in the face of consumer preferences .
If the rate of interest is forced below what it would have been on the unhampered market , then people are being compelled to invest more than they wish .
The point holds altogether apart from the Austrian theory of the business cycle , which Lewis fully accepts .
That theory tells us that forcing the rate of interest below the natural rate may lead to an unsustainable boom .
But even if this theory were mistaken , interference with interest rates would still distort the economic system .
Businesses depend on prices to give them the information with which to run the economy .
If the price system for interest rates is broken , no part of the price system is unaffected .
( p. 90 )
To prevent the price system from functioning hardly seems the course of wisdom : why then did Keynes recommend it ?
He argued that , in a depression , government action is needed to stave off disaster .
If businesses are allowed to collapse , then a wave of pessimism will be set off .
Entrepreneurs will anticipate yet further declines , and the economy will spiral downward into total disaster .
Lewis has little difficulty in showing that this line of thought is mistaken .
Why would not resources shift from collapsing businesses to others better suited to use them , without setting off a general conflagration ?
Keynes assumed without adequate basis that investors are driven by irrational " animal spirits . "
Keynes condemned what he called " casino capitalism . "
Investors , in his view , made irrational decisions based on what they guessed others would do .
To the contrary , the free market weeds out businessmen who are unable accurately to forecast the wishes of consumers , in favor of those more skilled at this task .
During a depression , there is what Rothbard calls a " cluster of entrepreneurial errors " : precisely the task of an adequate business - cycle theory is to explain this phenomenon .
Keynes did not do so .
He appeals to a failure of his " animal spirits " : investors lose confidence in massive proportions .
But he does not account for the wave of pessimism .
But even if Keynes does not have an account to offer of why there are swings of optimism and pessimism , does this invalidate his remedy for depression ?
Keynes does , after all , give a reason for not allowing prices to fall in a depression : to do so would set off a wave of further reductions , leading to a worse situation .
Once more , Lewis challenges Keynes : why should lowered prices induce businessmen to expect even further reductions , in a way that sends the economy spiraling to disaster ?
If the argument is that lower prices , along with lower wages , will lead to expectations of decreased spending , this rests on confusion .
What about the … claim that wage cuts will backfire by reducing workers ' buying power , which in turn will reduce business revenue ?
As Henry Hazlitt noted , Keynes is confusing wage rates with wages earned … so long as prices fall faster than wages , real ( price - adjusted ) worker income may actually rise .
( p. 228 )
Lewis brings out fully that Keynes had much more in mind than a cure for depressions .
He thought that boom conditions could be permanently maintained by lowering the rate of interest nearly to zero .
In that way , the scarcity of capital could be ended .
In The General Theory , Keynes said ,
The remedy for the boom is not a higher rate of interest but a lower rate of interest !
For that may enable the boom to last .
The right remedy for the trade cycle is not to be found in abolishing booms and thus leaving us in a semi-slump ; but in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi-boom . ( pp. 20 –21 )
Is this not an incredible doctrine ?
The interest rate is to be lowered by an expansion of credit .
But production can increase only through an increase in capital goods .
Putting pieces of paper designated " money " into circulation will not by itself increase prosperity , even if all the new money is , as Keynes wished , spent and not hoarded .
To think otherwise is to indulge in magical thinking .
" The entire Keynesian edifice rests on a central paradox : impeding the central mechanism of the free market will restore prosperity . "
Keynes was not satisfied , furthermore , with recommending inflation as the key to promote prosperity .
He extended his view into a full - fledged inflationist theory of history .
" That the world after several millennia of steady individual saving , is so poor , " Keynes claimed , " is to be explained … [ by ] high rates of interest " ( p. 17 ) .
( Incidentally , the French literary figure Georges Bataille developed a similar theory of history .
See his The Accursed Share , Volume 1 : Consumption . )
Keynes 's program went far beyond monetary expansion .
He wanted the government to take control of investment .
Wise planners would do much better in guiding the economy than the speculators of " casino capitalism . "
He remarks in The General Theory that he favors " a somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment " ( p. 56 ) .
Does not this program pose a severe threat to liberty , in a way classically explained by Friedrich Hayek in The Road to Serfdom ?
How can one preserve civil liberties in a state - controlled economy ?
Of this danger Keynes was well aware , and he praised Hayek for having written " a grand book , " with which he was " morally and philosophically " in agreement .
But this did not lead him to abandon his penchant for planning .
He thought that the dangers of planning could be averted if matters were left to wise experts — experts including him as a prime example .
Keynes 's egotism knew no bounds .
Lewis has presented Keynes as an inflationist , but is not he vulnerable to an objection ?
Keynes recommended increased spending in bad conditions , but did he not also call for restraint once full employment was reached ?
In that case , spending would drive up prices , to no good effect .
In responding to this objection , Lewis makes one of his most valuable points .
True enough , one can find in Keynes 's writings warnings against inflation .
But Keynes set such stringent conditions for inflation that it would almost never exist .
Specifically , so long as there is some unemployment present , as there invariably is , there is no inflation .
Lewis has exposed with unmatched clarity the lineaments of Keynes 's system and enabled us to see exactly its disabling defects .
Keynes defied common sense , unable to sustain the brilliant paradoxes that his fertile intellect constantly devised .
Lewis 's book is an ideal guide to Keynes 's dangerous and destructive economics .
The evil & mad scientists at Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories built upon the idea of a certain David Friedman for a digital sundial .
A normal sundial relies on the sun and only displays the hour .
The Bulbdial clock is lit up by three layers or rings of LEDs that cause the gnomon ( the object in the center of the clock that casts the shadow ) to have three shadows .
So aside from the hour hand , there ’s a minute and a second hand as well .
The Bulbdial comes in one of four available case designs .
The cases are laser - cut acrylic , and come in Tortoiseshell , Abalone Pearl , Black Granite , or Granite back / Clear front .
Fancy names , but if you ask me I like the clock better when it ’s naked :
The Bulbdial is Arduino - based , and both it ’s hardware and software are open - source , which means that the clock is hacker - friendly .
Makes you wonder why these nerds insist on calling themselves Evil Mad Scientists , what with their harmless products and open source philosophy .
You can get the Bulbdial Clock Kit at Evil Mad Science for $ 65 ( USD ) .
Yes , I said “ kit ” ; basic soldering skills are required to assemble the whole thing together .
Still does n’t make you evil mad scientists , Evil Mad Scientists .

Was there ever a time when Goldman Sachs was more , um , ethical and client - centric than greedy and profit - driven , as its reputation now suggests ?
That ’s debatable , but whatever its previous corporate ethos might have been , all signs point to Goldman ’s current chairman and CEO , Lloyd Blankfein , as the major driving force behind the firm ’s push for building bigger profits quicker these days .
–KA
The New York Times :
Mr. Blankfein has surrounded himself with a tight circle of executives drawn from Goldman ’s trading operation .
Many of these executives , like Mr. Blankfein , cut their teeth in the commodities division , J. Aron & Company .
Gary D. Cohn , Goldman ’s president , as well as the heads of the bank ’s asset management division , are J. Aron alumni .
So is the head of human resources .
With the traders ascendant , Goldman ’s bankers are being urged to generate bigger profits .
In what former partners called a significant shift , Goldman now uses “ profiles ” to track how much money its bankers are bringing in .
Granted , money is what makes Wall Street run , and Goldman Sachs is no exception .
“ I do n’t buy the argument that the old Goldman was more principled and less greedy , ” said Arthur Levitt , a Goldman adviser and former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
But even Goldman concedes it is changing with the times .
“ This business is all about serving clients , and if you do n’t evolve , you die , ” said Lucas van Praag , a Goldman spokesman .

Stephen Colbert explained why it ’s so difficult to mock Fox News ’ newest celebrity at the Second City 50th anniversary event in Chicago last weekend .
Colbert told a panel that Glenn Beck “ raised the stupid bar and now it ’s nearly inapproachable . ”
The Atlantic ‘s Jim Warren was there .
As for Glenn Beck , the panel discussed the challenge of maintaining a separation between reality and satire when so many TV pundits are simply , premeditatedly over - the - top .
“ I said , ‘ Let ’s start doing some Glenn Beck stuff but in praise of Glenn Beck , ' ” said Colbert .
“ But every time we do one , he will have done something dumber .
He raised the stupid bar and now it ’s nearly inapproachable . ”
“ I worry that if we use that as a model … if somebody does n’t believe what they ’re saying , it ’s very hard to out - stupid them , ” said a decidedly analytical Colbert .
“ Because then there ’s no place to sink our hook into , there ’s no mountain to climb there .
I ca n’t climb Glenn Beck since there ’s nothing there . ”

You heard right As of noon PST today , the Demoman / Soldier WAR ! is over .
The score is , as of this writing :
Demoman Killed : 6,323,921
Dead Soldiers : 6,298,465
It all comes down to this .
I 'd give you a motivational speech right now , but the time you wasted reading it would be less time you spent making a difference on the battlefield .
Go ahead and break the bad news to your grandfather : YOU are officially now the greatest generation .
A provocative report by the New Economics Foundation has made an effort to put a price tag on the broader costs and benefits of various types of work .
As quoted in the Financial Times ( hat tip Swedish Lex ) , the leader of this effort put it :
Pay levels often do n’t reflect the true value that is being created .
As a society , we need a pay structure which rewards those jobs that create most societal benefit , rather than those that generate profits at the expense of society and the environment .
But where this study gets interesting is that it attempts to measure the costs of the looting that the banksters just pulled off :
The authors assume the financial crisis and recession would not have happened without City bankers engaging in risky , opaque and complex transactions .
Applying a guess about the cost of the recession on the rest of society , they estimate top City bankers des - troy £ 7 of value for every £ 1 they are paid privately .
This of course , not only said that top financiers took advantage of the rest of us , but they did so very inefficiently .
But they still appear to be more efficient than AIG Financial Products was ( in terms of money extracted relative to value destroyed ) .
If we assume that $ 30 billion of the AIG rescue was for its securities lending operation , and $ 100 billion plus went for AIGFP .
If they were to have destroyed $ 10 for every $ 1 they earned , that would still imply average pay of over &8 million each for every person at AIG FP for three years .
Now of course , that $ 100 billion includes loans , and one can charitably assume that there could be some recoveries , but I would not hold my breath .
But then we have also omitted the collateral damage ( no pun intended ) from the AIG meltdown .
This line of reasoning says the 50 % surtax on banker bonuses is warranted ; indeed , perhaps a 95 % surtax would be even better to discourage people from joining this line of endeavor .
I would be pretty certain that the NEF effort is at best a rough cut .
However , it raises important questions that I hope others pursue .
I sincerely hope that this NEF exercise leads others to sharpen their pencils and come up with more refined efforts of what the meltdown cost us collectively versus the bankers ’ take .
Believe it or not , there is some consolation to bankers .
Advertising execs are deemed to be even more destructive ( although not meeting the likely AIG level ) .
Next , they look at pay versus collective benefits for hospital cleaners :
The report says good hospital cleaners prevent the spread of infection , saving lives and protecting the wider health of the public .
The authors calculate they provide £ 10 of benefits for which they are directly paid only £ 1 .
Since we accept that manufacturing can result in externalities ( pollution ) , I do n’t see why it should be at all a stretch to think that the same could not apply to service industries .
And the “ right ” solution , from an economist ’s perspective , to externalities are taxes to impose the full social cost of the goods on the manufacturer , or regulations to make them make low or no-externality products .
The BBC gives a longer - form summary :

Just more ammunition for the movement to tax churches that engage in political activities : Bishop Richard J. Malone of Maine contributed $ 553,608.27 to overturn a gay marriage law in his state , money he got from some 50 dioceses and archdioceses , not to mention individual bishops , throughout the country .
That law went down on November 3 , 53 to 47 % .
According to a report in the National Catholic Reporter , Malone ’s diocese donated $ 286,000 to Stand For Marriage Maine , the right - wing group that led the campaign to repeal gay marriage .
He also raised an additional $ 86,000 from special collections at Masses during a weekend in September .
Just how legal is passing the donation plate for a political cause at a religious service ?
The rest of the half million dollars came from outside the state , every penny of which Malone personally solicited .
The highest diocesan and archdiocesan donors include the following : Philadelphia and Phoenix to the tune of $ 50,000 each ; Newark , New Jersey , St. Louis , Missouri and Youngstown , Ohio , $ 10,000 apiece ; and Arlington , Virginia , Rockford , Illinois , Crookston , Minnesota and Pittsburgh , Pennslvania $ 5,000 each .
Individual bishops also contributed to the effort :
In the $ 1,000 category were Richard Lennon of Cleveland and William Lori of Bridgeport , Connecticut .
At the $ 500 level : Herbert Brevard of St. Thomas , Virgin Islands and John D’Arcy of Fort Wayne , Indiana .
Jose Gomez of San Antonio , Texas and John LeVoir of New Ulm , Minnesota each gave $ 250 .
The Knights of Columbus threw in $ 50,000 .
The full list of donations from the “ Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland ” can be seen at http://www.mainecampaignfinance.com/public/entity_financial_transactions.asp?TYPE=BQC&ID=4528.
Donna Farrell , communications director for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia , told the Catholic newspaper that her outfit “ responds to various requests for donations which come from outside the diocese , in order to advance the mission of the church by promoting and defending the teaching of Christ . ”
Explained Farrell , “ Examples of contributions which have been made by the archdiocese for other purposes include those to feed the hungry and provide for the needy in mission countries , to assist victims of natural disasters ; to support Catholic military chaplains and pastoral care for our men and women in uniform and to defend the dignity and sanctity of life from conception to natural death . ”
The latter is accomplished by opposing abortion , not war or capital punishment .
The ironic thing is that even as Malone was raising all that dough , his diocese was hurting financially because of all of the money it ’s had to shell out in priest sex scandal cases .
You ’d think that a diocese that is closing churches would be the last to raise half a million for anything other than keeping its own doors open .
Not to mention the fact that , considering its behavior in covering up those scandals , it should simply keep its trap shut when it comes to judging other people ’s morality .

The following text is an excerpt from the book Big Brain by Gary Lynch and Richard Granger , and it represents their own theory about the Boskops .
The theory is a controversial one ; see , for instance , paleoanthropologist John Hawks ' much different take .
In the autumn of 1913 , two farmers were arguing about hominid skull fragments they had uncovered while digging a drainage ditch .
The location was Boskop , a small town about 200 miles inland from the east coast of South Africa .
These Afrikaner farmers , to their lasting credit , had the presence of mind to notice that there was something distinctly odd about the bones .
They brought the find to Frederick W. Fitz­Simons , director of the Port Elizabeth Museum , in a small town at the tip of South Africa .
The scientific community of South Africa was small , and before long the skull came to the attention of S. H. Haughton , one of the country ’s few formally trained paleontologists .
He reported his findings at a 1915 meeting of the Royal Society of South Africa .
“ The cranial capacity must have been very large , ” he said , and “ calculation by the method of Broca gives a minimum figure of 1,832 cc [ cubic centimeters ] . ”
The Boskop skull , it would seem , housed a brain perhaps 25 percent or more larger than our own .

The idea that giant - brained people were not so long ago walking the dusty plains of South Africa was sufficiently shocking to draw in the luminaries back in England .
Two of the most prominent anatomists of the day , both experts in the reconstruction of skulls , weighed in with opinions generally supportive of Haughton ’s conclusions .
The Scottish scientist Robert Broom reported that “ we get for the corrected cranial capacity of the Boskop skull the very remarkable figure of 1,980 cc. ”
Remarkable indeed :
These measures say that the distance from Boskop to humans is greater than the distance between humans and their Homo erectus predecessors .
Might the very large Boskop skull be an aberration ?
Might it have been caused by hydrocephalus or some other disease ?
These questions were quickly preempted by new discoveries of more of these skulls .
As if the Boskop story were not already strange enough , the accumulation of additional remains revealed another bizarre feature :
These people had small , childlike faces .
Physical anthropologists use the term pedomorphosis to describe the retention of juvenile features into adulthood .
This phenomenon is sometimes used to explain rapid evolutionary changes .
For example , certain amphibians retain fishlike gills even when fully mature and past their water - inhabiting period .
Humans are said by some to be pedomorphic compared with other primates .
Our facial structure bears some resemblance to that of an immature ape .
Boskop ’s appearance may be described in terms of this trait .
A typical current European adult , for instance , has a face that takes up roughly one - third of his overall cranium size .
Boskop has a face that takes up only about one - fifth of his cranium size , closer to the proportions of a child .
Examination of individual bones confirmed that the nose , cheeks , and jaw were all childlike .
The combination of a large cranium and immature face would look decidedly unusual to modern eyes , but not entirely unfamiliar .
Such faces peer out from the covers of countless science fiction books and are often attached to “ alien abductors ” in movies .
The naturalist Loren Eiseley made exactly this point in a lyrical and chilling passage from his popular book , The Immense Journey , describing a Boskop fossil :
“ There ’s just one thing we have n’t quite dared to mention .
It ’s this , and you wo n’t believe it .
It ’s all happened already .
Back there in the past , ten thousand years ago .
The man of the future , with the big brain , the small teeth .
He lived in Africa .
His brain was bigger than your brain .
His face was straight and small , almost a child ’s face . ”
Boskops , then , were much talked and written about , by many of the most prominent figures in the fields of paleontology and anthropology .
Yet today , although Neanderthals and Homo erectus are widely known , Boskops are almost entirely forgotten .
Some of our ancestors are clearly inferior to us , with smaller brains and apelike countenances .
They ’re easy to make fun of and easy to accept as our precursors .
In contrast , the very fact of an ancient ancestor like Boskop , who appears un - apelike and in fact in most ways seems to have had characteristics superior to ours , was destined never to be popular .
The history of evolutionary studies has been dogged by the intuitively attractive , almost irresistible idea that the whole great process leads to greater complexity , to animals that are more advanced than their predecessors .
The pre-Darwin theories of evolution were built around this idea ; in fact , Darwin ’s ( and Wallace ’s ) great and radical contribution was to throw out the notion of “ progress ” and replace it with selection from among a set of random variations .
But people do not easily escape from the idea of progress .
We ’re drawn to the idea that we are the end point , the pinnacle not only of the hominids but of all animal life .
Boskops argue otherwise .
They say that humans with big brains , and perhaps great intelligence , occupied a substantial piece of southern Africa in the not very distant past , and that they eventually gave way to smaller - brained , possibly less advanced Homo sapiens — that is , ourselves .
We have seen reports of Boskop brain size ranging from 1,650 to 1,900 cc.
Let ’s assume that an average Boskop brain was around 1,750 cc .
What does this mean in terms of function ?
How would a person with such a brain differ from us ?
Our brains are roughly 25 percent larger than those of the late Homo erectus .
We might say that the functional difference between us and them is about the same as between ourselves and Boskops .
Expanding the brain changes its internal proportions in highly predictable ways .
From ape to human , the brain grows about fourfold , but most of that increase occurs in the cortex , not in more ancient structures .
Moreover , even within the cortex , the areas that grow by far the most are the association areas , while cortical structures such as those controlling sensory and motor mechanisms stay unchanged .
Going from human to Boskop , these association zones are even more disproportionately expanded .
Boskop ’s brain size is about 30 percent larger than our own — that is , a 1,750 - cc brain to our average of 1,350 cc .
And that leads to an increase in the prefrontal cortex of a staggering 53 percent .
If these principled relations among brain parts hold true , then Boskops would have had not only an impressively large brain but an inconceivably large prefrontal cortex .
The prefrontal cortex is closely linked to our highest cognitive functions .
It makes sense out of the complex stream of events flowing into the brain ; it places mental contents into appropriate sequences and hierarchies ; and it plays a critical role in planning our future actions .
Put simply , the prefrontal cortex is at the heart of our most flexible and forward - looking thoughts .
While your own prefrontal area might link a sequence of visual material to form an episodic memory , the Boskop may have added additional material from sounds , smells , and so on .
Where your memory of a walk down a Parisian street may include the mental visual image of the street vendor , the bistro , and the charming little church , the Boskop may also have had the music coming from the bistro , the conversations from other strollers , and the peculiar window over the door of the church .
Alas , if only the Boskop had had the chance to stroll a Parisian boulevard !
Expansion of the association regions is accompanied by corresponding increases in the thickness of those great bundles of axons , the cable pathways , linking the front and back of the cortex .
These not only process inputs but , in our larger brains , organize inputs into episodes .
The Boskops may have gone further still .
Just as a quantitative increase from apes to humans may have generated our qualitatively different language abilities , possibly the jump from ourselves to Boskops generated new , qualitatively different mental capacities .
We internally activate many thoughts at once , but we can retrieve only one at a time .
Could the Boskop brain have achieved the ability to retrieve one memory while effortlessly processing others in the background , a split - screen effect enabling far more power of attention ?
Each of us balances the world that is actually out there against our mind ’s own internally constructed version of it .
Maintaining this balance is one of life ’s daily challenges .
We occasionally act on our imagined view of the world , sometimes thoroughly startling those around us .
( “ Why are you yelling at me ?
I was n’t angry with you — you only thought I was . ” )
Our big brains give us such powers of extrapolation that we may extrapolate straight out of reality , into worlds that are possible but that never actually happened .
Boskop ’s greater brains and extended internal representations may have made it easier for them to accurately predict and interpret the world , to match their internal representations with real external events .
Perhaps , though , it also made the Boskops excessively internal and self - reflective .
With their perhaps astonishing insights , they may have become a species of dreamers with an internal mental life literally beyond anything we can imagine .
Even if brain size accounts for just 10 to 20 percent of an IQ test score , it is possible to conjecture what kind of average scores would be made by a group of people with 30 percent larger brains .
We can readily calculate that a population with a mean brain size of 1,750 cc would be expected to have an average IQ of 149 .
This is a score that would be labeled at the genius level .
And if there was normal variability among Boskops , as among the rest of us , then perhaps 15 to 20 percent of them would be expected to score over 180 .
In a classroom with 35 big - headed , baby - faced Boskop kids , you would likely encounter five or six with IQ scores at the upper range of what has ever been recorded in human history .
The Boskops coexisted with our Homo sapiens forebears .
Just as we see the ancient Homo erectus as a savage primitive , Boskop may have viewed us in somewhat the same way .
They died and we lived , and we ca n’t answer the question why .
Why did n’t they outthink the smaller - brained hominids like ourselves and spread across the planet ?
Perhaps they did n’t want to .
Longer brain pathways lead to larger and deeper memory hierarchies .
These confer a greater ability to examine and discard more blind alleys , to see more consequences of a plan before enacting it .
In general this enables us to think things through .
If Boskops had longer chains of cortical networks — longer mental assembly lines — they would have created longer and more complex classification chains .
When they looked down a road as far as they could , before choosing a path , they would have seen farther than we can : more potential outcomes , more possible downstream costs and benefits .
As more possible outcomes of a plan become visible , the variance among judgments between individuals will likely lessen .
There are far fewer correct paths — intelligent paths — than there are paths .
It is sometimes argued that the illusion of free will arises from the fact that we can’t adequately judge all p ossible moves , with the result that our choices are based on imperfect , sometimes impoverished , information .
Perhaps the Boskops were trapped by their ability to see clearly where things would head .
Perhaps they were prisoners of those majestic brains .
There is another , again poignant , possible explanation for the disappearance of the big - brained people .
Maybe all that thoughtfulness was of no particular survival value in 10,000 B.C.
The great genius of civilization is that it allows individuals to store memory and operating rules outside of their brains , in the world that surrounds them .
The human brain is a sort of central processing unit operating on multiple memory disks , some stored in the head , some in the culture .
Lacking the external hard drive of a literate society , the Boskops were unable to exploit the vast potential locked up in their expanded cortex .
They were born just a few millennia too soon .
In any event , Boskops are gone , and the more we learn about them , the more we miss them .
Their demise is likely to have been gradual .
A big skull was not conducive to easy births , and thus a within - group pressure toward smaller heads was probably always present , as it still is in present - day humans , who have an unusually high infant mortality rate due to big - headed babies .
This pressure , together with possible interbreeding with migrating groups of smaller - brained peoples , may have led to a gradual decrease in the frequency of the Boskop genes in the growing population of what is now South Africa .
Then again , as is all too evident , human history has often been a history of savagery .
Genocide and oppression seem primitive , whereas modern institutions from schools to hospices seem enlightened .
Surely , we like to think , our future portends more of the latter than the former .
If learning and gentility are signs of civilization , perhaps our almost - big brains are straining against their residual atavism , struggling to expand .
Perhaps the preternaturally civilized Boskops had no chance against our barbarous ancestors , but could be leaders of society if they were among us today .
Maybe traces of Boskops , and their unusual nature , linger on in isolated corners of the world .
Physical anthropologists report that Boskop features still occasionally pop up in living populations of Bushmen , raising the possibility that the last of the race may have walked the dusty Transvaal in the not - too - distant past .
Some genes stay around in a population , or mix themselves into surrounding populations via interbreeding .
The genes may remain on the periphery , neither becoming widely fixed in the population at large nor being entirely eliminated from the gene pool .
Just about 100 miles from the original Boskop discovery site , further excavations were once carried out by Frederick FitzSimons .
He knew what he had discovered and was eagerly seeking more of these skulls .
At his new dig site , FitzSimons came across a remarkable piece of construction .
The site had been at one time a communal living center , perhaps tens of thousands of years ago .
There were many collected rocks , leftover bones , and some casually interred skeletons of normal - looking humans .
But to one side of the site , in a clearing , was a single , carefully constructed tomb , built for a single occupant — perhaps the tomb of a leader or of a revered wise man .
His remains had been positioned to face the rising sun .
In repose , he appeared unremarkable in every regard ... except for a giant skull .

LONGMONT — Even for a roomful of people in the nascent medical marijuana industry , what Larry Hill was proposing was a little unusual .
Standing before a meeting of cannabis dispensary owners here last week , Hill said the time has come to form a trade association .
“ People , let ’s help ourselves , ” said Hill , who operates The Apothecary dispensary in Longmont .
“ It ’s time we become the shining light in the community , so that people are n’t afraid of us anymore . ”
Across the state — as the number of medical marijuana dispensaries surges and local officials rush to enact laws governing them — cannabis business people have banded together so as to have a louder voice in the debate .
More than 100 people attended the meeting in Longmont last week at the VFW hall , which Hill hosted .
A day before , medical marijuana attorney Rob Corry hosted a similar meeting in Denver .
Corry said he is talking with around 50 dispensary owners about forming a statewide association .
The idea , the medical marijuana supporters say , is to find a way for the burgeoning industry to fill the current regulatory vacuum and perhaps stave off further governmental rules by regulating itself .
“ If you wait for something to happen to you , it ’s going to happen to you , ” medical marijuana attorney Jeff Gard told the crowd in Longmont .
“ If you take control over something yourself , you have some ability to direct it . ”
But getting consensus on a public , self - governing structure among dispensary owners — some of whom are accustomed to operating quietly and have a well - honed wariness of authority — is no sure thing .
During the meeting in Longmont , Gard read a list of rules recently negotiated in Frisco that he said could serve as a start for the cannabis community ’s proposals for self - regulation .
Those laws include things such as standard operating hours , uniform security measures and prescribed buffer zones between dispensaries and schools or day - care facilities .
A number of the regulations elicited grumbles in the crowd .
“ When you start talking about regulations , ” said Kathleen Chippi , who operates Cannabis Healing Arts in Nederland , “ you ’re continuing to buy into reefer madness lies .
We do n’t need to be afraid of a dispensary . ”
Other advocates , while conceding the need for some self - government , took issue with particular proposals .
George Thomas , who operates a small caregiver business for about a dozen patients out of his Longmont home , said the buffer - zone regulations could force providers to constantly move .
“ I do n’t want some day - care center operated by some mom down the street to kick me out of my house , ” he said .
No one knows exactly how many dispensaries operate in Colorado because they are neither licensed nor tracked by the state .
Estimates put the number of dispensaries at as many as 100 .
Hill said he thinks the threat of regulation facing dispensary owners will encourage them to get on the same page — but he also concedes it will be difficult to keep them there .
It ’s unclear how interested state lawmakers are in taking up the issue .
Democratic and Republican aides at the Capitol said they have n’t heard of any proposed bills to clarify medical marijuana regulations .
“ In the giant scheme of things , with all the budget - cutting that ’s been taking place , it ’s really moved to a back - seat position , ” said state Sen.
Betty Boyd , D - Lakewood .
Gov. Bill Ritter , meanwhile , has put state lawyers and health department officials to work examining how to handle the proliferation of dispensaries , Ritter ’s spokesman wrote in an e-mail .
While Ritter intends to uphold the state ’s constitutional protection of medical marijuana , he also “ has an obligation to ensure the program is not being abused , not operating outside the law and not going unregulated , ” Evan Dreyer wrote .
All of that ’s fine by Hill , as long as those who run the dispensaries get a say .
“ We want to remove the gray area from the medical marijuana industry , ” Hill told the dispensary owners last week .
“ It ’s up to us . ”

Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura , doing press for his new TV show on “ conspiracy theories , ” made got some attention from ( among others ) Eric Roper at the Minneapolis Star - Tribune .
Roper alludes toa “ curious comment Ventura made in the Los Angeles Times this weekend ” – that MSNBC canceled his short - lived show when they found out that he opposed the Iraq War :
I was basically silenced .
When I came out of office , I was the hottest commodity out there .
There was a bidding war between CNN , Fox and MSNBC to get my services .
MSNBC ultimately won .
I was being groomed for a five - day - a - week TV show by them .
Then , all of asudden , weird phone calls started happening : “ Is it true Jesse does n’t support the war in Iraq ? ”
Roper writes that MSNBC ‘s decision would be an “ odd one since they are considered liberal . ”
Except for the fact that the same cable channel canceledits highest - rated program for the same reason , as FAIR noted in 2003 :
The complex Julia set is typically calculated in 2D with a constant complex seed value .
However , if you consider the set of all possible Julia sets ( all possible seed values ) , you get the complete 4D Julibrot set .
The Mandelbrot set is contained as a 2D slice of the 4D Julibrot set .
You can also take 3D slices of the 4D Julibrot set as shown here .
The left picture shows what the Mandelbrot set looks like if you vary the real part of the starting value along the third dimension and the right picture shows what it looks like when you vary the imaginary part .
Technically , this is not a hypercomplex fractal , but it 's still worth mentioning here .
Here is some Mathematica code :
(* runtime : 18 seconds , increase n for higher resolution *)
n = 100 ; Julibrot [ z0_ , zc_ ] := Module [{z = z0 , i = 0} , While [ i < 12 && Abs[z ] < 2 , z = z ^2 + zc ; i++ ] ; i ] ;
image = Table[z = 1.5 ; While[z >= 0 && Julibrot[z , x + I y ] < 12 , z -= 3/n ] ; z , {y , - 1.5 , 1.5 , 3/n} , {x , - 2 , 1 , 3/n} ] ;

A crazed intruder dangles from the jaws of a bear after leaping into its zoo enclosure for a “ picnic ” .
The demented visitor was badly mauled before being rescued by keepers .
But it was Finn , the four - year - old
European brown bear , who ended up fighting for life after being shot by police using a dum - dum bullet – the kind that shatters on impact .
They opened fire to save the madman , who is recovering in hospital from severe head and leg wounds .
Finn was not so lucky .
He was critically ill last night , but vets are unable to operate because of the number of splinters caused by the bullet .
The bear was simply defending his territory at Bern Park in Switzerland when he pounced on the man who had scaled a wall and leapt 20ft into the recently opened enclosure .
He picked up the 25 - year - old interloper as if he were a rag doll and carted him in his teeth to the far side of the pen he shares his 10 - year - old sister Bjoerk .
Cops had no option .
They shot Finn to save the man ’s life .
The sickening moments , captured by a horrified visitor on Sunday , echo a similar incident at Berlin Zoo in April .
On that occasion disturbed Mandy Knobloch , 32 , was savaged after jumping in to swim with the polar bears .
She was pulled clear before keepers had to use their weapons .
Last night police and zoo officials said they had been inundated with messages of sympathy – for Finn the bear .
I 've been saying for a while that Joe Lieberman posed the greatest threat to health care reform .
Unlike the rest of the party , he has no political interest in the passage of reform or a successful Obama presidency , and he seems to view the prospect of sticking it to the liberals who supported his Democratic opponent in 2006 as a goal potentially worth sacrificing the lives of tens of thousands of Americans to fulfill .
( Of course , the irony is that Lieberman is actually vindicating his 2006 critics and undermining his own defense from that time , which revolved around him being a progressive Democrat on domestic policy issues . )
Still , I feel that liberals are somewhat overreacting to Lieberman 's turn against health care reform .
It 's true that Lieberman refused to take part in negotiations with Reid over the compromise , suggested he could support the bill presuming a positive CBO score , and then decided to stick in the knife .
However , I do n't think that health care reform is in peril .
If Harry Reid decided to submit to Lieberman 's demands , the health care bill would basically revert to what the Senate Finance Committee produced .
That 's still a major piece of legislation .
Expectations among liberals have risen since then , so the come - down is understandable .
But this is n't the end of reform .
Now , the counter - argument is that Lieberman may well come up with a reason to back away from that bill as well .
Given his obvious bad - faith negotiation , that 's certainly a danger .
But Olympia
Snowe is not negotiating in bad faith , and she , unlike Lieberman , actually seems to care about health care reform .
So even if you revert to something like the Senate Finance bill and Lieberman tries to stab you in the back , you can still pick up Snowe .
( A fact that itself reduces the chance that Lieberman will attempt a second act of sabotage -- why try to knife health care reform if you can't kill it ? )
I also think liberals , myself included , might be driving ourselves a little nuts trying to divine Lieberman 's motives .
He keeps flip - flopping and explaining his shifts by making demonstrably false claims .
What 's his game ?
Why does he keep saying these wrong , uninformed things ?
I think one answer here is that Lieberman is n't actually all that smart .
He speaks , and seems to think , exclusively in terms of generalities and broad statements of principle .
But there 's little evidence that he 's a sharp or clear thinker , and certainly no evidence that he knows or cares about the details of health care reform .
At one point during the 2000 recount , the Gore campaign explained to Lieberman why lowering standards for military ballots would be totally unfair and illegal , and Lieberman proceeded to go on television and subvert the campaign 's position .
Gore loyalists interpreted this as a sellout , but perhaps the more plausible explanation was that Lieberman -- who , after all , badly wanted to be vice - President -- just did n't understand the details of the Gore position well enough to defend it .
The guy was taken apart by Dick Cheney in the 2000 veep debate .
In its current form , the bill proposes life imprisonment and even the death penalty for gays and lesbians in Uganda .
Museveni's top aide said on Thursday that the president was planning to intervene to address the concerns of Uganda 's Western partners who have expressed strong opposition to the bill .
" We should not have an extreme position .
The president will harmonize the two sides and address the concerns of the Europeans and our other development partners . " said Museveni's spokesman .
International condemnation
The bill , which is yet to be debated in Uganda 's parliament , would have gay men and lesbians sentenced to life in prison for having sex .
In cases of sex with minors or sexual acts leading to HIV infection , the penalty would be death .
The bill also proposes that anyone who fails to report a homosexual act committed by others would face up to three years in jail .
International reaction to the bill has been widespread condemnation , with some Western states threatening to withdraw aid to Uganda if the government passes the bill into law .
There has also been outcry from the country 's small gay and lesbian community .
Church groups worldwide have condemned the bill
The World Council of Churches ( WCC ) has also criticized the bill , saying it would run against basic Christian teaching by promoting hatred .
" From the experience of many nations , it is very clear that if such a bill is enacted into law , it will leave a lot of room for manipulation , abuse , blackmail and oppression of people " said WCC chief Samuel Kobia .
A top Anglican cleric of Ugandan decent in the UK , Archbishop of York John Sentamu , said he was " totally opposed to the death sentence " and found the language being used to describe homosexuals " upsetting " .
Uganda denies bowing to the West
Uganda 's ethics and integrity minister Nsaba Buturo said the revised law would most likely make life in prison the maximum penalty for offenders .
" There have been a lot of discussions in government regarding the proposed law , but we now think a life sentence could be better because it gives room for offenders to be rehabilitated , " he said .
" Killing them might not be helpful , " he added .
The East - African state has benefitted from Western aid and investment
However , Buturo denied the change in government attitude was forced by Western pressure .
" It 's really out of our consultation with various groups , including religious leaders .
It has nothing to do with external forces , " he said .
Buturo also added that Uganda had not changed its view that homosexuality is a " moral perversion that must not be allowed to spread " .
Uganda has long benefitted from Western aid and investment due to its stable economy and widespread economic reforms .

AUSTRALIA'S immigration intake should be reviewed and an independent board , similar to the Reserve Bank , should be established to set immigration policy , says a former Australian of the Year , Tim Flannery .
'' Immigration has always been a tool of economic policy , economic development , or else it has been set as a result of scare campaigns by people who do n't like foreigners , '' he said .
Tim Flannery ... justify intake .
Credit : Carl Court
There had been no estimation of the rate of immigration that allows for the protection of the environment , he said , but immigration was '' far too important to be left to government ' ' .
'' Government will always want more taxpayers , and business will always want more customers - so put them together and you 'll get a recipe for endless population growth . ''
The system would distribute electricity from solar , geothermal , wind and wave energy from Australia to China .
Natural gas and hydro would fill the gaps .
The vision is big .
So is climate change .
In Europe , the DESERTEC Industrial Initiative proposes that a series of concentrating solar power plants in North Africa could power the region and export surplus electricity to Europe .
A similar network built in Asia would generate energy market efficiencies , spur innovation and increase energy security .
Following this path , Asia could end up with networked electricity and natural gas backbone that would serve the region into the 22nd Century .
The plan involves connecting Asia through a 6,000 - 8,000 kilometer electricity and natural gas transmission system stretching from southern Australia to Japan and South Korea .
Australian surplus concentrating solar power , geothermal , wind and wave energy , along with natural gas , would flow northward to Indonesia .
There , it would be joined by Indonesia 's surplus natural gas , geothermal and hydro power .
The combined energy supplies , joined by Malaysian hydro , southeast Asian biomass and Mekong wind , would then be transmitted to China , Japan and South Korea through a ' non- discriminatory , common - carrier ' infrastructure operated like a toll road .
Further north , China 's Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang provinces could contribute solar and wind energy .
In the East Asian Sea , networked offshore wind farms and wave and tide machines would contribute more energy .
Regional natural gas and hydro energy supplies would ' load balance ' the entire system in a hemispheric network managed as an highly - efficient whole .
Competitively accessible , non-discriminatory , low - emission energy generated and delivered through a regionally - interconnected , Pan -Asian energy infrastructure represents a market - based solution to climate change .

VLC for Mac death is " greatly exaggerated " / What is Lunettes ?
VLC for Mac is being maintained .
However the old Cocoa graphical interface of VLC , is not being maintained at this time .
The reason is that we are in the process of rewriting a new interface for VLC .
Its codename is Lunettes .
Why a rewrite ?
This is something really easy to see .
VLC for Mac is just not " Mac " enough .
So far , we could name 3 reasons for that :
VLC for Mac must attract designers .
They can't easily give a refresh of the graphical interface .
Hence , we have decided to offer to designer the possibility to edit via a simple text file the look of VLC .
Even Windows and Fullscreen Head - Up - Display can be changed using CSS .
VLC for Mac 's interface code comes from the 2000s .
We need to refresh it .
We want to use VLCKit which is pure Cocoa , Objective - C 2.0 with bindings supports .
This will help us concentrating on features .
As a positive side effects , we 'll not use old non -64 bits compatible APIs .
VLC for Mac needs a good interface to be the best Video Player .
We want to make sure you 'll get the best experience ever when watching your favorites TV shows or Movies using VLC .
For instance , if I am watching a TV show , and then quit Lunettes .
At next launch Lunettes will offer you to go back to where you were .
.
Then , we added a better way to visualize the media discovery .
This is a seldom known feature of VLC .
Now , if you are on a local network that streams TV content ( Freebox ) , Lunettes will automatically show them .
.
Then the famous playlist fades out :
It is not visible by default , and you do n't have to use it anymore .
: It is not visible by default , and you do n't have to use it anymore .
Also in fullscreen you can now scroll through your playlists or TV channels .
or TV channels .
And finally Lunettes is 64 bits .
For now , Lunettes is being hosted at : https://wiki.github.com/pdherbemont/Glasses
That said , Lunettes is still under heavy development .
And we hope to be able to release a test version soon .
We still want new developers to help us !
Try to build VLC and Lunettes !

The suspect ’s name was inserted last month into the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment , or Tide .
About 550,000 individuals are registered in the database .
A subset of that is the Terrorist Screening Data Base , or T.S.D.B. , which has about 400,000 .
By contrast , fewer than 4,000 names from the T.S.D.B. are on the “ no - fly ” list , and an additional 14,000 on a “ selectee ” list that calls for mandatory secondary screening , an Obama administration official said .
At the time Mr. Abdulmutallab ’s name was recorded in the Tide database in November , the official said , “ there was insufficient derogatory information available ” to warrant putting him in the T.S.D.B. , no - fly or selectee lists , and so he was not on any watch list when he boarded the plane bound for Detroit .
President Obama ordered a full review of the law enforcement and intelligence databases related to the no-fly list to make sure the procedures and practices still make sense , a senior administration official said Saturday .
Mr. Abdulmutallab was issued a regular visitor ’s visa by the United States Embassy in London in June 2008 , the administration official said .
There was no “ derogatory information available ” on him at the time he applied , and he was granted a two - year visa , which is still valid , the official said .
He had traveled to the United States once before , to Houston in August 2008 .

Representative Bennie G. Thompson , a Mississippi Democrat who leads the House Homeland Security Committee , said in a telephone interview that he would hold hearings next month when Congress returns from its recess to determine whether airport screening processes were at fault , scanning equipment was inadequate , information was not shared among federal agencies , or human error was to blame .
Mr. Abdulmutallab told F.B.I. agents he was connected to the Qaeda affiliate , which operates largely in Yemen and Saudi Arabia , by a radical Yemeni cleric whom he contacted online .
The cleric is not believed to be Anwar al - Awlaki , an American - born imam who has spoken in favor of anti-American violence and who corresponded with Maj .

Will the losses that financial executives suffered as a result of the crisis provide the discipline necessary to prevent excessive risk taking in the future ?
Not according to this analysis :
Bankers had cashed in before the music stopped , by Lucian Bebchuk , Alma Cohen , and Holger Spamann , Commentary , Financial Times : According to the standard narrative , the meltdown of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers largely wiped out the wealth of their top executives .
Many – in the media , academia and the financial sector – have used this account to dismiss the view that pay structures caused excessive risk - taking and that reforming such structures is important .
That standard narrative , however , turns out to be incorrect .
It is true that the top executives at both banks suffered significant losses on shares they held when their companies collapsed .
But our analysis ... shows the banks ’ top five executives had cashed out such large amounts since the beginning of this decade that , even after the losses , their net pay - offs during this period were substantially positive .
...
Our analysis undermines the claims that executives ’ losses on shares during the collapses establish that they did not have incentives to take excessive risks .
... [ R]epeatedly cashing in large amounts of performance - based compensation based on short - term results did provide perverse incentives – incentives to improve short - term results even at the cost of an excessive rise in the risk of large losses at some ( uncertain ) point in the future .
To be sure , executives ’ risk - taking might have been driven by a failure to recognise risks or by excessive optimism , and thus would have taken place even in the absence of these incentives .
But given the structure of executive pay , the possibility that risk - taking was influenced by these incentives should be taken seriously .
The need to reform pay structures is not , as many have claimed , simply a politically convenient sideshow .
...
To understand what has happened , and what lessons should be drawn , it is important to get the facts right .
In contrast to what has been thus far largely assumed , the executives were richly rewarded for , not financially devastated by , their leadership of their banks during this decade .
It does n't really matter whether executive compensation structures caused or contributed to the crisis or not .
If the manner in which executives are paid creates perverse incentives and distorts decisions away from the best interests of shareholders , as it appears to do , then both the level and structure of the compensation should be fixed .
The Diet Delusion [ pp 601 ] ( published in the USA as Good Calories , Bad Calories ) Gary Taubes 2008
There is no topic more widely discussed than what one should eat in order to stay healthy .
And there are few topics where the evidence is so lacking in quality .
It is also a topic that is besieged by gurus , cranks and supplement hucksters .
You need to beware of misleading titles .
Dietitians are good .
Nutritionists are sometimes good .
But titles like ‘ nutritional therapist ’ and ‘ nutritional medicine ’ are usually warning signs of alternative therapists and / or pill salespeople .
Gary Taubes is a journalist , but he is quite an exceptional journalist .
His account of the importance of randomisation for the establishment of causality is one of the best ever and it was published not in an academic journal , but in the New York Times [ 1 ] .
His book , The Diet Delusion , is in the same mould .
It is more complete and more scholarly than most professional scientists could manage .
Not only does it cover the literature right back to Samuel Johnson , but it is also particularly good at unravelling what one might call the politics of science .
And by politics I do n’t mean the vast lobbying industry that has built up with the aim of selling you unnecessary supplements , but the politics of academia .
Obesity sounds simple .
If you are fat it is because you eat too much or exercise too little , right ?
Well no , it ’s not as simple as that .
For a start , it has been shown time and time again that low fat diets , and exercise , have small and temporary effects on weight .
The problem with diet and health revolves round causality .
The law of conservation of energy is an inevitable truth , but says nothing about causality .
It could imply that you get fat because you eat too much , or equally the causal arrow could point the other way and “ we eat more , move less and have less energy to expend because we are metabolically or hormonally driven to get fat ” .
The assumption that positive caloric balance is the cause of weight gain has predominated since the 1970s and “ this simple misconception has led to a century of misguided obesity research ” .
At the heart of the problem is the paucity of randomised trials , which are the only way to establish causality .
Those that there are have usually shown that diet does not matter as much as we are told .
Taubes concludes
“ It does little good to continue basing public health recommendations and dietary advice on association studies ( the Framingham Heart study and the Nurses Health Study are prominent examples ) that are incapable of reliably establishing cause and effect . ”
I think it can certainly be argued that the problem of causality has been greatly underestimated .
We are warned constantly of the dangers of processed meat , on the basis of very unconvincing evidence [ 2 ] .
This is one reason why we still know so little about the causes of obesity , diabetes and heart disease .
For Taubes , a major villain was the US nutritionist Ancel Keys ( 1904 – 2004 ) .
His
forceful advocacy of the low - fat hypothesis in the early 1970s , was , says Taubes , based on ignoring the many studies that did not agree with the idea .
It seems that the sort of citation
bias , recently described systematically by Greenberg [ 3 ] , resulted in great exaggeration of the strength of the evidence .
It is quite possible that there was rather more to be said for the Atkins diet than was apparent at the time .
The fact that Atkins was not a university scientist , that his views were extreme and that he was so obviously out to make a lot of money from it , gave him all the appearance of being yet another profiteering diet guru .
He was dismissed by the medical establishment as a quack .
Taubes points out that conflict of interest cuts both ways .
Atkins ’ sternest critics at Harvard were funded by General Foods , Coca - Cola and the sugar industry .
It adds up to a sorry story of a conflict of vested interests and scientific vanity .
Taubes ’ final judgement is harsh .
He quotes Robert Merton ’s description [ 4 ] of what science is , or should be .
“ The organization of science operates as a system of institutionalized vigilance , involving competitive cooperation ”
In such a system , scientists are at the ready to pick apart . and assess each new claim to knowledge .
This unending exchange of critical appraisal , of praise and punishment , is developed in science to a degree that makes the monitoring of children ’s behavior by their parents seem little more than child ’s play " .
He then comments “ The institutionalized vigilance , “ this unending exchange of critical judgment ” , is nowhere to be found in the study of nutrition , chronic disease , and obesity , and it has n’t been for decades . ”
It took Taubes five years to write this book , and he has nothing to sell apart from his ideas .
No wonder it is so much better than a scientist can produce .
Such is the corruption of science by the cult of managerialism that no university would allow you to spend five years on a book [ 5 ] .
I find all ten points in his summary convincing .
But his most important conclusion is that you cannot have any certainty without randomised trials .
The business of nutrition is greatly at fault for not having put more effort into organising randomised trials .
Until they are done , we ’ll never really know , and we should n’t pretend that we do .

Word on the street is that Men 's Health editor - in - chief Dave Zinczenko has checked out of editing the magazine .
So why bother writing new cover lines for the latest issue when the ones from October 2007 will do ?
Aside from the different celebs — the new cover features Taylor Lautner and the old one Jason Statham — the entire left side of cover lines has virtually identical copy and layout : the six pack abs , the poster , the results in nine days , the " gain muscle , lose weight , " the ultimate nutrition plan , and the eat better and think smart .
The 1,293 is the same even though apparently then it was what women want in bed and now it is tips to get money , fitness , sex , and nutrition .
Is there something about the number 1,293 that focus groups really well ?
Or maybe a numerological thing ?
A few details on the covers have been changed .
Now we get " tech toys " instead of " hard muscle " above the title , the sexy women have migrated to the right hand column , and the " best body ever " has gotten a little bit smaller .
The December '09 cover has no " get - rich secrets " because , well , in December '09 ain't no one getting rich .
Anyway , are n't all Men 's Health covers interchangeable anyway ?
Updated A researcher has identified a vulnerability in the most recent version of Microsoft 's Internet Information Services that allows attackers to execute malicious code on machines running the popular webserver .
The bug stems from the way IIS parses file names with colons or semicolons in them , according to researcher Soroush Dalili .
Many web applications are configured to reject uploads that contain executable files , such as active server pages , which often carry the extension " .asp . "
By appending " ;.jpg " or other benign file extensions to a malicious file , attackers can bypass such filters and potentially trick a server into running the malware .
There appears to be some disagreement over the severity of the bug , which Dalili said affects all versions of IIS .
While he rated it " highly critical , " vulnerability tracker Secunia classified it as " less critical , " which is only the second notch on its five - tier severity rating scale .
" Impact of this vulnerability is absolutely high as an attacker can bypass file extension protections by using a semicolon after an executable extension such as '.asp , ' '.cer , ' '.asa ' and so on , " Dalili wrote .
" Many web applications are vulnerable against file uploading attacks because of this weakness of IIS . "
In an email to El Reg , Dalili offered the following attack scenario :
" Assume a website which only accepts JPG files as the users ’ avatars .
And the users can upload their avatars on the server .
Now an attacker tries to upload " Avatar.asp ;.jpg " on the server .
Web application considers this file as a JPG file .
So , this file has the permission to be uploaded on the server .
But when the attacker opens the uploaded file , IIS considers this file as an ASP file and tries to execute it by ' asp.dll . '
" So , the attacker can upload a web - shell on the server by using this method .
Most of the uploaders only control the last part of the files as their extensions , and by using this method , their protection will be bypassed . "
Secunia did n't explain how it arrived at its assessment , but it did confirm the bug on a machine running a fully patched version of Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2 with Microsoft IIS version 6 .
A Microsoft spokeswoman said company researchers are investigating the report .
They are not aware of attacks targeting the reported vulnerability , she said .
In the absence of any official guidance , webmasters who want to workaround the potential problem should make sure that upload directories do n't have execute permissions .
And web developers should ensure their applications never accept the user 's input as a file name .

More than 100 people connected to Phoenix streets gangs face criminal charges following an investigation that revealed drug- running activities stretching from Arizona to the East Coast .
A task force led by Phoenix police and the FBI announced they arrested 63 of the suspects early Wednesday .
Two others turned themselves in , and nearly 40 people are outstanding , authorities said .
The far - reaching criminal conspiracy case compiled by the FBI 's Violent Street Gang Task Force received its nickname , Operation Trident , because investigators initially focused on three street gangs .
Since January , investigators unraveled drug operations that supplied the local market and as far away as New York and Delaware .
Investigators recently seized 500 pounds of marijuana , 1,000 ecstasy pills , and nearly $ 250,000 in cash from drug proceeds , according to authorities .
The gangs were also involved in dealing crack cocaine and PCP .
Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas joined Phoenix Public Safety Manager Jack Harris , Mayor Phil Gordon , and investigators from several law enforcement agencies in heralding the arrests as one additional step toward freeing neighborhoods of gang violence .
Thomas said a grand jury returned the lengthy series of indictments in the conspiracy case on Tuesday .
The street gang task force included efforts by the Arizona Department of Public Safety and several other federal , state and local agencies .
Phoenix police Lt. Charlie Consolian , who oversees gang investigations , said investigators served search warrants at 14 homes in the Valley - finding luxury vehicles and flat - screen TVs among the items funded by the drug trade .
" Sixty - three out of 104 is actually a pretty good batting average for a one - day takedown , " said Consolian , whose gang unit helped arrest 127 of more than 180 suspects indicted on hundreds of felony counts ranging from conspiracy to drug - related charges in a similar investigation earlier this year .
The earlier operation involved south Phoenix gang members forging government checks to fund the drug trade .
Unlike the dozens of gang associates involved in that case , those arrested Wednesday were far violent , Consolian said .
" The majority have been in south and west Phoenix , which is unfortunate , but those communities have been under the control of these groups for some time , " he said .
The birth of galaxies is quite a complicated affair , and little is known about whether the supermassive black holes at the center of most galaxies formed first , or if the matter in the galaxy accreted first , and formed the black hole later .
Observations of the quasar HE0450 - 2958 , which is situated outside of a galaxy , show the quasar aiding a nearby galaxy in the formation of stars .
This provides evidence for the idea that supermassive black holes can ‘ build ’ their own galaxies .
The quasar HE0450 - 2958 is an odd entity : normally , supermassive black holes – also known as quasars – form at the center of galaxies .
But HE0450 - 2958 does n’t appear to have any host galaxy out of which it formed .
This was a novel discovery in its own right when it was made back in 2005 .
Here ’s our original story on the quasar , Rogue Supermassive Black Hole Has No Galaxy .
The formation of the quasar still remains a mystery , but current theories suggest that it formed out of cold interstellar gas filaments that accreted over time , or was somehow ejected from its host galaxy by a strong gravitational interaction with another galaxy .
The other oddity about the object is its proximity to a companion galaxy , which it may be aiding to form stars .
The companion galaxy lies directly in the sights of one of the quasar ’s jets , and is forming stars at a frantic rate .
A team of astronomers from France , Germany and Belgium studied the quasar and companion galaxy using the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory .
The astronomers were initially looking to find an elusive host galaxy for the quasar .
The phenomenon of ‘ naked quasars ’ has been reported before , but each time further observations are made , a host galaxy is found for the object .
Energy streaming from the quasars can obscure a faint galaxy that is hidden behind dust , so the astronomers used the VLT spectrometer and imager for the mid-infrared ( VISIR ) .
Mid-infrared observations readily detect dust clouds .
They combined these observations with new images obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope in the near - infrared .
Observations of HE0450 - 2958 , which lies 5 billion light years from Earth , confirmed that the quasar is indeed without a host galaxy , and that the energy and matter streaming out of the jets is pointed right at the companion galaxy .
This scenario is ramping up star formation in that galaxy : 340 solar masses of stars a year are formed in the galaxy , one - hundred times more than for a typical galaxy in the Universe .
The quasar and the galaxy are close enough that they will eventually merge , finally giving the quasar a home .
David Elbaz of the Service d’Astrophysique , who is the lead author of the paper which appeared in Astronomy & Astrophysics , said “ The ‘ chicken and egg ’ question of whether a galaxy or its black hole comes first is one of the most debated subjects in astrophysics today .
Our study suggests that supermassive black holes can trigger the formation of stars , thus ‘ building ’ their own host galaxies .
This link could also explain why galaxies hosting larger black holes have more stars . ”
‘ Quasar feedback ’ could be a potential explanation for how some galaxies form , and naturally the study of other systems is needed to confirm whether this scenario is unique , or a common feature in the Universe .

CNN 's Nicole Lapin recently reported on the Humane Society 's efforts to get downer pigs banned from the food supply .
Downer pigs are classified as animals that are too injured or too sick to walk .
In Lapin 's report , Dr. Michael Greger , Humane Society 's Director of Public Health states , " You can't tell just by looking at a pig whether the pig is down because of fatigue , because of injury , or because of sickness .
Indeed the science is very clear that these pigs are at an increased risk of having disease .
They 're more likely to contaminate their hide and some of that contamination can get into the plant .
So there 's multiple reasons why animals too sick to even stand up , or for whatever reason , really should be excluded from the food supply . "
When asked by Lapin why regulations , other than farm safety checks , are not in place , Dr. Jennifer Greiner from the National Pork Producers Council replies , " We estimate that if all non ambulatory pigs were banned , all fatigued pigs were banned from the food supply , we would lose approximately 41 million pounds of safe pork going into the food supply . "

Conservatives Republicans have decided that the world must be remade to match their ideology .
First they proposed a “ purity test ” — a ten - point checklist of conservative positions .
In order for a candidate to receive funding from the national Republican Party , they must be able to prove that they support at least eight items on the checklist .
Unfortunately , it is n’t clear whether Reagan would have passed this test .
But if that is n’t bad enough , the Conservative Bible Project is attempting to rewrite the Bible to put it more in line with conservative principles .
Led by Andy Schlafly , the son of Phyllis Schlafly and founder of Conservapedia.com ( the conservative answer to wikipedia.org ) , they eschew current translations of the Bible because they were all translated by professors , and as we all know “ Professors are the most liberal group of people in the world . ”
Some of the changes they are making are relatively minor , such as removing gender neutral language .
So instead of Jesus calling his disciples “ fishers of people ” , they want to change it to “ fishers of men ” .
They also do n’t like words like “ comrade ” so it is being replaced by “ volunteer ” .
But some of the changes are bigger .
For example , virtually every translation of the Bible in existence has Jesus on the cross praying for his killers , saying “ Father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . ”
But apparently forgiveness must not be a conservative trait , because the project ’s authors claim that liberals put that in — and are removing it .
I ’m curious what other changes will be necessary in order to be in line with modern conservative positions ( you know , like supporting torture , permanent war , homophobia , racism , etc. ) .
UPDATE : Stephen Colbert will be interviewing Andrew Schlafly next Tuesday .
Also , he did a hilarious report on the conservative rewrite of the bible back in October :

The sale of a Montblanc pen to mark Gandhi 's birth has angered many Mention Mahatma Gandhi and many think of fasting , restraint and the struggle for Indian independence .
He renounced material comforts , promoted Indian goods and embraced a simple , ascetic life .
These images jar with German pen maker Montblanc 's launch of a $ 25,000 pen to mark the 140th anniversary of his birth .
Some see it as an insult to him .
One group has filed a lawsuit to try to stop its distribution .
Montblanc says it is intended to honour Gandhi .
' A simple lifestyle ' The $ 25,000 ( £ 16,000 ) gold and silver limited edition pen has an engraving of Mahatma Gandhi , the man seen as the father of Indian independence and revered as a global spiritual leader .
It is a mockery of the great man and an insult to the nation
Dijo Kappen Critics have questioned if the Montblanc pen is the best way to honour Gandhi .
The Center for Consumer Education in Kerala has filed a lawsuit to try to stop distribution of the pen .
" Mahatma Gandhi advocated a simple lifestyle , " Dijo Kappen of the centre said .
" He was , of course , a nationalist and , in the nature of the independence movement , the only thing he promoted was Indian - made goods .
It is a mockery of the great man and an insult to the nation ... to use him as a poster boy . "
A fitting tribute ?
The limited edition pen is intended to honour Gandhi , the German premium pen maker said .
" I certainly have to say , I would n't have thought that people would have reacted negatively , " Montblanc 's chief executive Lutz Bethge told the BBC .
" Yes , there were questions asked .
Does it make sense to combine Montblanc and Mahatma Gandhi ?
But from what I noticed people were delighted that we were paying tribute to him . "
Just 241 of the handmade pens will be sold , in reference to the number of miles Gandhi walked in his famous march against salt taxes in 1930 .
Each comes with an eight - metre golden thread that can be wound around the pen , representing the spindle and cotton Gandhi used to weave simple cloth .
" What we want to do is talk about the values of Mahatma Gandhi as well .
And this is certainly a person who believed in non-violence , peace , education and tolerance , and these are universal values , " added Mr Bethge .
Gandhi's great - grandson Tushar Gandhi has endorsed the idea .
His charitable foundation has already received a donation of $ 145,000 from Montblanc and will receive between $ 200 and $ 1,000 for each pen sold .
" Part of the proceeds are donated to the Gandhi foundation .
That is certainly something Gandhi would have approved of , " said Mr Bethge .
For those who find the pen a little out of their price range , there is a more affordable version - there are 3,000 roller ball and fountain pens on sale for about $ 3,000 dollars each .

Not every confrontation that a gay person experiences in their life is based on their orientation .
But sometimes it is very difficult to see any other possible explanation .
Take the experience that Joe Paolucci , Thomas Hitchcock , and their special need twins had recently with Wal - Mart .
Employees at the Niles , MI Wal - Mart store accused Paolucci of shoplifting some Bic lighters .
Although he produced the receipt , they refused to back down , insisting that the two men go to a “ detention room ” .
The employees , using vulgarities and hostility , frightened their special needs kids .
( South Bend Tribune )
Paolucci said that while he and Hitchcock were attempting to calm down the boys , the employees ordered them to enter a “ detention room ” for questioning .
Fearful of what might happen behind closed doors , he and Hitchcock refused to enter and asked to speak to a manager .
“ Some guy came up and said , ‘ I ’m the manager , ’ then turned around and left , ” Hitchcock said .
Paolucci said he and Hitchcock then asked store personnel to call police .
Within minutes , deputies from the Berrien County Sheriff ’s Department ’s Niles Township Patrol arrived , pleasing Paolucci who said he thought a few questions and a review of the store ’s videotapes and computer records would quickly resolve the matter .
He said he was shocked when he was immediately handcuffed , without a question being asked , and placed in the back seat of a squad car .
Hitchcock was n’t handcuffed but also was placed in the back seat of a second squad car .
The twins , despite the protests of Paolucci and Hitchcock , were turned over to the store ’s security personnel , who took them into the “ detention room ” or what police referred to as a security room .
A review of the security tapes proved that Paolucci and Hitchcock had done no wrong .
So the store management profusely apologized and expressed their remose , right ?
No .
They did not .
The two said they expected an apology and were surprised once again when personnel from the store walked up to the squad cars with the twins and read from a statement that Paolucci and Hitchcock had been banned by the store chain for life .
Rather than shoplifting , the reason they were given was “ being uncooperative . ”
By the time they were read the statement , Paolucci and Hitchcock said , the twins had told them that the security staff had allegedly threatened them in the security room and had made disparaging remarks about Paolucci and Hitchcock ’s lifestyle .
Paolucci and Hitchcock said they asked police to take statements from the boys but the officers refused , telling the couple they ’d have to contact Child Protective Services .
Wal - Mart even refused to replace frozen items that had now thawed due to their unprovoked misuse of their customers .
Nor did the situation end at the harassment of the couple at the store .
Paolucci said the boys have suffered a type of post - traumatic stress disorder since the experience .
Both wet their beds , although one has stopped , and both have had nightmares about one security employee in particular , he said .
“ They ’re terrified , horrified .
We ’ve had to change their medication twice , ” he said .
And what does Wal - Mart corporate have to say ?
Paolucci and Hitchcock e-mailed The Tribune a copy of a letter from a law firm representing Wal - Mart seeking 10 times the retail price of the items the store still claims were shoplifted by Paolucci .
The letter states the matter will be dropped if Paolucci submits the $ 158.40 payment .
Now this is not the first time that Wal - Mart has been perceived as hostile to gay Americans .
In 2007 , HRC advised against giving our business to Wal - Mart , and just in April of this year , the CEO signed his name to a petition to ban gay couples from adopting .
Wal - Mart does n’t care about my opinion .
And there ’s little I can do to impact their decision to treat gay customers with hostility .
But perhaps there are those , even in Niles , MI , who will decide that this situation is just one too many .
That they cannot give their custom to bad neighbors .
That it may be worth an extra nickle and a further drive to frequent the stores that do not abuse customers solely because they “ disapprove of their lifestyle ” and who admit it and apologize when they are wrong .
All I can do is spread the word .
A male age 41 - 50 , anonymous writes : I am a older guy .
My wife died at a really young age .
I have 2 daughters .
One is 12 and the other is 14 One year ago I caught them masturbating in the bathroom .
I told them it was ok and that they have the right to do that to themselves but do n't let other people touch you .
Now just of late I hear all kinds of sounds that have me worried that there doing more the just masturbating .
I do n't really want to catch them but it 's very wrong if I think there doing very bad things to each other and not stop them .
What should I do ????

Do n't be afraid to tell them that doing it together by actually touching each other is wrong because they 're siblings .

I find that very disturbing .
Common courtesy says to knock everytime , you never know what they could be doing .
Do n't worry about them masturbating either , its normal and as long as they are n't doing anyhting dangerous to pleasure themselves it is ok .

It is not uncommon for one sibling to force another into a sexual situation .
Maybe one of your daughters is being pushed to do something that she is ashamed of and is afraid to get help .
If this is the case ( coming from someone who has been molested ) this could haunt her for years and may the rest of her life .

Okay , loud noises , well , first off , they might simply not be aware of how thin the walls are .
But if they are really doing it on purpose then something really odd is going on .
Has the relationship broken down before ?
Because I can think of absolutly no reason why a teenager masturbating OR having sex of any sort would make loud noises on purpose .
It just seems odd .

Well , you should NEVER have caught them in the bathroom in the first place .
How would you have liked it if your parents had invaded your privacy like that ?
Do n't you think your mom knew ?
Fathers do NOT walk in on their daughters .
As for your suspicions they are doing things together , it is just that , suspicions .
Have a heart to heart with them , but be really careful not to be to judgemental .
Remember one thing , if they are really experimenting with each other , they are at least not doing it with boys .
Siblings often experiment on each other , sisters kissing is just a way to find out what it is like without the risk of doing it with a boy who may not stop .
Sometimes things are however best left in the dark , read the kinsey report on what people do in their youth , it is part of growing up but is far too private to be discussed with your parents .
Would you have wanted your parents to discuss your behaviour with you ?
Be there if they got questions , inform them about the birds of bees , make sure they always have someone to come too if they need too , but leave them free to make their own mistakes and grow up by themselves .
I know it is murder , but if you want your childeren to ride a bike you need to let go at one point .
Just stand back .
If there is a woman you can call on , she can try and talk with your daughters , but not you .
Sorry , fathers can't take the role of a mother .
Be very careful how you proceed and try to remember that once your parents ignored you jerking of as well .
Sometimes it is best for a parent to stand back and wait for things to resolve normally .
Consult an expert ( but not a person with an agenda like a priest ) first before you do anything .

Masturbation is normal , but doing it with each other as sisters is not .
However , my advice is to seek a medical type of person , like a nurse , or counselor , or kind old aunt type person or a woman in the family , an older woman , and have the woman have a woman - to - girl talk with them .
Perhaps there are some things they would feel more comfortably discussing with another woman that you as a man can't really feel comfortable talking about .
If it was my daugther 's , and my wife passed away , like in your case , I would have a woman have a talk with them .
Also , try to give them separate rooms if you can .. and also , try to get the into a physical exercise program , like running or heavy physical sports so the physical urges of the body can be transferred into sports and away from sexual thoughts .
Heavy physical exercise I recommend , get all of that tension and frustration out of their body will help also .

To be totally open - minded - they 're not hurting anyone and there 's no risk of pregnancy - where 's the harm ?
If your daughters were to spend their lives as lesbian lovers , why should it bother anyone else - as long as they 're happy , right ?
Having said that , most likely this is just a stage they 're going through - they 're probably straight and just fooling around .
Kids are becoming rapidly more open - minded these days .
I think the thought that concerns me is that a couple of girls who could be so " uninhibited " might end up messing around with threesomes just to impress boys or become more popular and ( whilst I have nothing whatever against threesomes )
I guess that at a younger age this could easily be self - destructive behaviour .
I guess you 're going to want to sit them down and have a talk with them .
Well , you 're not going to _want_ to , but y'know , I think you 're going to feel this needs to be done .
I would stress that you 're not judging , that their happiness is what 's important but myself I 'd probably want to know if they see themselves as life - and - sexual soulmates or whether they see each themselves with a guy someday .
They 're probably just filling in time , but the underlying thought I would wish to impart to them is that sex is something to be shared with someone they like and care about - as long as they 're aware it 's not just a party - trick then you have nothing to worry about .

They should not be touching each other sexualy or masturbating together .

You may want to question them as to where they came up with the idea of doing it together ?
I find it strange that they are sharing something that usually is done alone , when you 're that young .
It could be some outside source that has encouraged this behaviour ... or , just plain sisterly curiousity ?
Either way , I would talk calmly about the matter and not make demands that could damage your relationship / trust for future questions and conversations .

As PIMCO 's Bill Gross notes in this NYT article on zero- percent interest rates , the Fed 's ongoing Wall Street bailout is coming at a cost :
Anyone who has any cash savings is getting screwed .
This includes retirees who did exactly what they were supposed to do -- save .
Their incomes are now getting clobbered .
Meanwhile , for those who prefer to borrow money , the ongoing bailout has created the world 's easiest way to make $ 1 billion .
Borrow short - term from the taxpayers and lend the same money back to the taxpayers -- and get a guaranteed risk - free spread .
Here 's Bill Gross :
“ What the average citizen does n’t explicitly understand is that a significant part of the government ’s plan to repair the financial system and the economy is to pay savers nothing and allow damaged financial institutions to earn a nice , guaranteed spread , ” said William H. Gross , co-chief investment officer of the Pacific Investment Management Company , or Pimco .
“ It ’s capitalism , I guess , but it ’s not to be applauded . ”
Mr. Gross said he read his monthly portfolio statement twice because he could not believe that the line “ Yield on cash ” was 0.01 percent .
At that rate , he said , it would take him 6,932 years to double his money .

When videographers tried to document Kurt Hoffman being taken out of the Keene District Court on a stretcher , they were met with extreme resistance , forced into a side room , and issued threats of being penalized for violating HIPAA .
Not once has anyone been able to show us the text of HIPAA that restricts people from recording patients in public .
In fact , you may be surprised to see that in the video below , a videographer in Keene openly records the scene of an accident and the patient , without his consent , and the police do n’t even seem to acknowledge it as an issue .
Over a year ago I posted five things I liked about D&D 4e , and five things I did n’t like .
With fourth edition in its second year , how have these impressions held up ?
The good
Dungeon Master advice :
The advice in the Dungeon Master ’s Guide is still as useful as it was in 2008 .
Particularly important are the guidelines on player motivations and pacing , which I probably have n’t paid enough attention to .
Dungeon Master ’s Guide II mainly provides new game rules , but has some good DM advice articles including contributions from game mastering expert Robin D. Laws .
Monster archetypes : Several cracks have appeared in the creature archetypes system , particularly that Solo creatures make for long and boring fights .
Monster Manual 2 and Dungeon Master ’s Guide 2 reveal new guidelines which fix these issues .
Soldier type creatures are still very stodgy and Minions still feel a little weird when they go down in one hit .
Faster , more interesting combat : I ’m not certain that this held up .
Between increased hit point values , increased miniatures use , fewer spells known and more status effects to track , the game in my experience is slower , if anything .
This is in online play using a digital gametable setup without voice , so perhaps the real issue is that 4E only works if you have good communication between players .
Other players I ’ve spoken to report that the game is faster overall .
Rules balance :
We ’ve yet to see anything truly game - breaking that is n’t quickly errata’d .
There are allegations of power creep , though we may see the power balance level out as designers get a better grasp of the game ’s power level .
Easy monster creation :
This is definitely still the case .
First up , the D&D Insider Compendium and Monster Builder has over 3,000 monsters you can repurpose or mine for ideas - there are currently 154 monsters of level 7 alone , all official content .
You can scale them up or down by as many as five levels , or apply one of 28 templates ( 16 DMG , 12 DMG2 ) or 17 classes ( 8 DMG , 9 DMG2 ) .
There are solid monster creation guidelines for creatures of all types , and a Monster Builder tool to aid the process .
The bad
Ugly races : Tieflings still look stupid with horns coming out of their forehead .
Both tieflings and dragonborn still look like monsters in the book art , even when they ’re alongside humans and elves .
( Perhaps I ’m just racist ? )
There ’s a lot of 4E art in general that does n’t ignite my imagination .
Even if it looks good , it ’s still just some heroes posing or engaging a monster , without leaving the viewer with questions to imagine wonderful answers .
Cheesy in - character text : “ I see the secret patterns of magic , and through the items I carry , I can use that magic to protect you , heal you … or make you explode . ”
Why would anyone ever say this phrase ?
Is he at an adventurer job interview ?
It exists only to summarize the Artificer class in smug first - person .
It does n’t invoke a scene or fire the imagination .
There ’s hope , though , as the monk ’s introductory quote sounds like something he might genuinely say to a villain or an ally : “ You fight well , but without discipline and focus , you will fall . ”
Too abstract mechanics :
This is still the case , but as 4E blog At Will writes , nothing stops you inferring your own meaning into the game mechanics .
When the rogue ’s Cloud of Steel power lets him shoot a crossbow at ten opponents in a round , perhaps it ’s a spell he ’s picked up .
A healing surge might literally relate to some in - character attribute of personal stamina : for further discussion , see the June article Hit Points and You .
Skill challenges : I still do n’t get skill challenges .
It feels somewhat arbitrary that you succeed based on the number of times you make a successful attempt , rather than what it is your character succeeds at accomplishing .
Perhaps it ’s possible to create a good skill challenge that handles both .
Errata has improved the skill challenge rules and DMG2 offers further advice for creating good skill challenges .
Pushing other WotC products :
This still occurs , but it does n’t bother me as much .
It ’s not very prevalent even so .

( New York ) -
The Kenyan government should ensure that strong human rights protections are included in plans for expanded home - based HIV counseling and testing , Human Rights Watch said today in a letter to the public health minister .
Earlier in 2009 , Kenya started testing people for HIV in their own homes , and aims to test more than four million Kenyans - adults and children - in 2010 , according to the new Kenya National HIV / AIDS Strategic Plan .
Home - based counseling and testing can improve accessibility to HIV testing but should be conducted in a way that protects human rights and minimizes risks of stigma and abuse , Human Rights Watch said .
Research by Human Rights
Watch has shown that HIV - positive mothers and children frequently are stigmatized in Kenya , and suffer violence , abuse , and abandonment when their family members find out they are HIV - positive .
" Expanding HIV testing is critically important in efforts for universal access to treatment , " said Juliane Kippenberg , senior researcher in the Children 's Rights Division at Human Rights Watch .
" As Kenya 's government takes steps to ensure that everyone knows their HIV status , it should also ensure that everyone who tests positive is able to get the needed care and is protected from discrimination and abuse . "
Testing children at their homes poses special challenges , Human Rights Watch said .
Outreach workers conducting counseling and testing , for example , must get consent from older children if they are pregnant , married , already a parent , or engaged in risky sexual behavior .
These children have a right to refuse interference from parents or relatives .
In the past , some children have been kicked out of the home , exploited or physically ill - treated by their relatives when their status became known .
Human Rights
Watch recommended to the government that social workers be present during the testing to assist the family with any potential conflict , and where abuses occur , to refer family members to competent , free medical services .
Vulnerable groups , including women and children , often face difficulty getting and staying on treatment because they cannot afford transport , fees for medical tests , and adequate food to be able to tolerate the treatment .
This is of particular importance for children , who need adult support to access and adhere to treatment , and for whom treatment is less widely available than for adults .
Human Rights
Watch also called on the government to create an independent oversight mechanism to respond to complaints about problems with confidentiality , consent , linkages to other health services , and other abuse based on HIV status .
" Human rights protections are sometimes seen as a barrier to the expansion of HIV counseling and testing services , " Kippenberg said .
" In fact , attention to human rights improves access and ensures that testing translates to care .
Kenya has an opportunity to slow HIV transmission and treat AIDS , but this program will work only if people receive the protection and services they need . "

News : Hulk Hogan announces when he 'll make his TNA debut during UFC Ultimate Fighter finale , says TNA is going go head - to - head with WWE Raw
Dec 5 , 2009 - 09:05 PM
Hulk Hogan will make his TNA debut on a live special that will air on Monday , January 4 on Spike TV .
Hogan made the announcement on Saturday night during an interview with Joe Rogan during the UFC Ultimate Fighter finale live on Spike TV .
Hogan stated on the air that they would be going head - to - head with WWE on January 4 .
" We 're going wide open , head - on - head , we 're going to battle with the WWE , " Hogan said .
Hogan was noncommittal when Rogan asked him whether he'd be wrestling .
Powell 's POV : I 'm a longtime advocate of the idea of running a live Monday night special against Raw , as it will give TNA officials an idea of what type of rating they could draw on Monday nights .
It will be a blast to have a Monday Night War if only for one night .
The TNA show will reportedly be a three - hour event .
It will be interesting to see whether WWE counters by extending Raw to three hours that night .

Klimaschutz nervt Wolfgang Pomrehn
In Nordrhein - Westfalen wollen CDU und FDP eilfertig Energiesparvorschriften aus einem Gesetz streichen , damit E.on Steinkohlekraftwerke bauen kann
In Düsseldorf demonstriert die dort regierende schwarz - gelbe Koalition dieser Tage ihre besondere Auffassung vom Umgang mit Rechtsprechung und Klimaschutz .
Da das Oberverwaltungsgericht in Münster im September unter Berufung auf das Gesetz zur Landesentwicklung der Klage gegen den Bau eines Kohlekraftwerks in Datteln [ http://www.duh.de/pressemitteilung.html?&no_cache=1&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=1951&cHash=91c07bc9d7 statt gegeben ] hatte , wollen die Christlich - Liberalen nun den störenden Klimaschutz einfach aus dem Gesetz streichen .
Am Mittwoch stimmte der Wirtschaftsausschuss des nordrheinwestfälischen Landtages einem entsprechendem Antrag zu .
Der Paragraphen 26 des fraglichen Gesetzes soll gestrichen werden .
Schon am 17 .
Dezember soll der Landtag im abschließend beraten .
§ 26
Energiewirtschaft
In allen Teilen des Landes sind die Voraussetzungen für eine ausreichende , sichere , umweltverträgliche und möglichst preisgünstige Energieversorgung zu erhalten oder zu schaffen ; dabei sind alle Möglichkeiten der Energieeinsparung zu berücksichtigen .
Es ist anzustreben , daß insbesondere einheimische und regenerierbare Energieträger eingesetzt werden .
Zur Verbesserung des Energienutzungsgrades und aus Umweltgesichtspunkten sind die Möglichkeiten der Kraft - Wärme - Kopplung sowie der Nutzung industrieller Abwärme auszuschöpfen sowie der Nutzung industrieller Abwärme auszuschöpfen .
Regionale und örtliche Energieversorgungskonzepte sollen entwickelt werden .
So steht es – bis auf den kleinen Zusatz im Abschnitt ( 3 ) zur Nutzung industrieller Abwärme – seit mindestens 20 Jahren in dem Gesetz , doch nun hatte sich endlich ein Gericht gefunden , das diesen Paragrafen ernst nimmt .
Also weg damit , haben sich die Koalitionäre gedacht , und zwar subido .
FDP und CDU springen damit dem Energiekonzern E.on bei , der bereits seit 2007 in dem westfälischen Städtchen an einem neuen 1050 - Megawatt - Steinkohlekraftwerk baut .
1,2 Milliarden Euro sollen investiert werden .
Die Dimensionen sind viel zu groß , um die reichliche Abwärme – der effektive elektrische Wirkungsgrad dürfte kaum über 44 Prozent liegen – nutzen zu können .
Hinzukommt , dass das Kraftwerk jährlich zwischen fünf und sechs Millionen Tonnen des Treibhausgases CO 2 in die Luft blasen wird .
Schließlich sind auch die anderen Emissionen nicht ohne : Mit mehreren Tonnen Blei , Cadmium , Quecksilber und Arsen , jeweils mehrere tausend Tonnen Stickoxide und Schwefeldioxid sowie einige hundert Tonnen der krebserzeugenden Feinstäube wäre pro Jahr zu rechnen .
Zurzeit hat Bezirksregierung einen Baustopp verhängt , aber E.on hat in der Erwartung der Gesetzesänderung bereits einen neuen Bauantrag eingereicht .
Umweltverbände [ http://www.duh.de/pressemitteilung.html?&no_cache=1&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=2033&cHash=e56a321a0b sprechen ] von einem " Lex E.on " .
Auch vom Bundesverband Windenergie kommt Widerspruch .
Dessen Präsident Hermann Albers meint : " CDU und FDP torpedieren mit diesem Gesetzesänderungsantrag die Klimaschutzziele der Bundesregierung .
Die Meseberger Beschlüsse zur Klima - und Energiepolitik vom August 2007 müssen von Bund und Ländern gemeinsam umgesetzt werden . "
Bis zu elf neue Steinkohlekraftwerke in Nordrhein - Westfalen wolle die CDU - FDP - Regierung unter Norbert Rüttgers retten .
Gleichzeitig würde aber seit dem Amtsantritt der Koalition im Jahre 2005 der Ausbau der Windenergie mit allerlei Höhenbegrenzungen , Abstandsregelungen und Ähnlichem behindert .
Auf der Campact - Internetseite wurde kürzlich eine Online - Aktion gestartet , bei der man im Internet einen Appell an die Düsseldorfer Landesregierung unterschreiben kann .
Enlarge By Brett T. Roseman for USA TODAY Joe Wallace of Hammond , Ind. , lights a cigarette at Crow Bar in Chicago on Dec. 6 .
Bar owner Pat Carroll does not enforce the city 's smoking ban but encourages donations to a " smoke jug " to help offset any fines .
CHICAGO  Smoking in bars has been banned here since Jan. 1 , 2008 , but Crow Bar , a cozy spot on the city 's far southeast side , is still a haven for people who want to light up .
Unless other customers object , owner Pat Carroll usually allows smoking .
He keeps a " smoke jug " in view for $ 5 donations to offset fines .
" It 's good business to allow smoking .
It 's a free country , " says Carroll , owner of Crow Bar for 28 years .
It 's near the border with Indiana , which allows smoking in bars .
He says his customers would patronize bars there if he forced them to smoke outside .
After inspectors found a souvenir ashtray behind the bar , Carroll , a smoker , paid a $ 340 fine .
Repeat violations would mean bigger fines , which he says would make him rethink his leniency .
Twenty - six states and the District of Columbia have passed smoking bans that cover restaurants and bars , the Campaign for Tobacco - Free Kids says .
Four others ban smoking in restaurants but exempt stand - alone bars .
Most inspections and citations stem from complaints , and " non-compliance is a fairly isolated issue , " says Danny McGoldrick , the group 's vice president for research .
" Business owners and patrons are pretty law - abiding . "
Not all of them : • Owner Judy Maxie lets customers smoke at Caddy 's Lounge in Midlothian , Va. , despite a law that took effect Dec. 1 and requires restaurants to allow smoking only in separately ventilated rooms .
" It 's my business , and the government is not going to tell me what to do , " she says .
The $ 25 fine is cheaper than the revenue she 'd lose if she barred smoking , she says .
• Bill Comerford , owner of three Honolulu bars , tried unsuccessfully to get bars exempted from that state 's ban .
When customers light up , he and his staff remind them that smoking is n't allowed — but that 's all they do .
" It 's my business to inform the customer of the law , " he says .
" It 's not my business to enforce the law . " • SmokeChoke.com collects readers ' reports of places in Ohio that violate that state 's ban .
It includes more than 500 reports .
Opponents of smoking bans try novel ways to overturn them .
In St. Louis , Bill Hannegan is challenging a ban set to take effect there in January 2011 by arguing that an exemption for casinos violates the state constitution .
It is , he says , " very difficult to fight " foes of smoking .

Although the current flashpoint is San Francisco , municipalities across the country are looking for places to put their sludge .
The CFS has an on - going , nationwide program to shine light on the environmentally questionable practice , and the Organic Consumers Association , an advocacy group , announced last month that it is about to launch a " major campaign against the sewage sludge industry . "
In September the CFS , joined by the Resource Institute for Low Entropy Systems , ( RILES ) a Boston - based organization that works to protect public health and the environment , petitioned the city to stop the giveaways .
" We 're not telling San Francisco what to do with their sewage sludge .
We 're just asking them to stop the program because of all the unknowns and because of the potential for it to be misleading and deceptive , " Paige Tomaselli , the staff attorney in the CFS 's West Coast office , said in an interview .
" Residents could be at serious risk of poisoning from the application of sludge to crops and gardens . "
In late November the groups got an answer to their petition .
Speaking before a citizens ' advisory committee , Natalie Sierra of the public utilities commission , said that , far from ending the program , the city hoped to expand it ten - fold .
At that point the sludge really hit the fan .
" San Franciscans are getting the wool pulled over their eyes , " said Laura Orlando , the executive director of RILES , in an interview .
" It is a toxic product .
The citizens of San Francisco do n't know what they are getting .
They think they are getting free compost from the city .
They do n't know they are putting sewage sludge on their lawns , and people do n't want to eat food grown in sewage sludge . "
Orlando notes that advertisements put out by the city fail to identify the compost as being based on sludge , instead relying on the term , " biosolids , " a euphemism coined in the 1970s by waste water managers looking for a sanitized word for , well , shit .
Also misleading , according to Orlando , is the term " organic , " used by the city to describe its compost .
" Food that receives USDA organic certification cannot be grown with sludge , " she said .
Phone calls to the Public Utilities Commission were not returned , but in a statement , spokesman Tony Winnicker said , " San Francisco 's biosolids compost is safe , tested , and great for plants .
It is tested for metals and other contaminants and meets or exceeds all standards , " almost making it sound like the eco-friendly flipside of the locavore movement .
Tomaselli of the CFS does not dispute Winnicker 's claim that San Francisco 's sludge might be " greener " than sewage solids from more industrialized and less environmentally enlightened cities , nor does she argue that it fails to meet standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
But , pointing to a 2008 court case where a federal judge ruled in favor of farmers who sued the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) when their cows became ill and died after eating silage grown on land upon which sludge had been applied , she noted that the city was abiding by the " same rules that sickened those cows . "
As the climate change summit meeting moves forward in Copenhagen , it is increasingly clear that more than just the environment is at stake .
The global environmental crisis is at the heart of practically all the problems now confronting us , including the need to create a global economic model grounded in the public good .
It is directly linked to security issues and to increasingly dangerous ethnic and international conflicts ; to mass migrations and displacements of people , which are already destabilizing politics and economics ; to growing poverty and social inequality ; to the water crisis and energy and food shortages .
Excuses and pretexts for not taking action on the environment , and assertions that there are more important problems , are simply no longer credible .
If we fail on this problem , we ’ll fail on all the others .
Saving our planet should be a task shared by governments , the business and scientific communities , and civil society .
Each stakeholder in this noble cause has a role to play .
The main burden of responsibility , however , lies with governments and their institutions .
Take a memo ... then make a bomb threat :
How secretary made sure her boss did n't miss his flight
Claudia De La Rosa :
She phoned and emailed a hoax threat to Miami Airport
When secretary Claudia De La Rosa made a mistake that left her boss in danger of missing his flight , she decided to try to save the day .
So , to give him a better chance of catching the plane , she rang the airline - to say there was a bomb on board .
And just to make sure the plane was delayed , she sent an email to American Airlines reiterating the bomb threat .
Staff at Miami Airport spent four hours checking the plane and the luggage already loaded on the flight to Honduras .
When they realised the bomb threat was a hoax , investigators checked the IP address of the computer used to send the email .
It was traced back to a flat in Sunny Isles Beach , near Miami , where officers found De La Rosa .
Miami Airport : Staff here spent four hours searching a flight to Honduras
The Colombian told police that she had only wanted her boss to catch his flight .
De La Rosa , 34 , has been charged with a false report of planting a bomb and faces up to 15 years in jail .
She is being held in custody .
A month ago Zero Hedge dubbed Gramm - Leach - Bliley the worst Bill ever passed .
Its passage , coupled with a bunch of insane money printing leprechauns , presaged the ultimate collapse of Lehman , and was the main reason why capitalism nearly died last year ( and why contrary to all you hear , is still in critical care ) .
Yet from mere grumblings a month ago , the chorus of voices calling for a repeal of G - L - B , and a renewal of Glass - Steagall has reached a crescendo , and today Majority leader Steny Hoyer said that the renewal of the Glass - Steagall act was a distinct possibility .
The U.S. House is considering reinstituting the Depression - era Glass - Steagall Act , which barred bank holding companies from owning other financial companies , Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said today .
A renewal of the 1933 law “ is certainly under discussion ” by House members , Hoyer , a Maryland Democrat , told reporters in Washington .
The Glass - Steagall law was repealed in 1999 .
Hoyer made the comments when asked whether Congress and the Obama administration could do more to persuade banks to make more business loans to get credit flowing into the economy .
“ As someone who voted to repeal Glass - Steagall , maybe that was a mistake , ” Hoyer told reporters .
The repeal removed a regulatory obstacle to the $ 46.4 billion merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc. to form Citigroup Inc .
This story appears in Wednesday 's Birmingham News :
AUBURN -- Josh
Bynes knew something was wrong with his teammate when he tried to help Zac Etheridge up after a tackle .
" The only thing I saw was his eyes moving , " Bynes said .
Etheridge lay on the Jordan - Hare Stadium turf temporarily paralyzed and scared during Saturday 's win over Ole Miss .
But , three days later , the Auburn defensive back was back with his team mates in a harness - like neck brace he said he 'll have to wear another three or four months because of torn ligaments and a cracked fifth vertebra .
Tuesday , he said he felt lucky he could walk .
He says he plans to play next season .
Auburn coaches have juggled their lineup since Saturday , moving cornerback Demond Washington to Etheridge 's starting safety spot .
But there 's a lot of experience lost and there is even more leadership gone , say his teammates .
But Tuesday was n't for that worry .
" I played a video game with him last night , " said defensive back Walter McFadden .
" He 's still talking trash .
He 's still the same Zac . "
But Etheridge , a recognized voice of the team , was introspective and thankful Tuesday for a series of events that prevented a bad situation from turning worse .
It has , Etheridge said , " been a miracle . "
" We feel like we can play in his honor , " McFadden said .
It was an uneventful event on the play - by - play sheet .
Rodney Scott ran for a yard late in the first quarter , the same Rodney Scott who committed to Auburn last year but picked Ole Miss following Auburn 's coaching change .
Etheridge and Bynes made the tackle .
But Etheridge had collided with teammate Antonio Coleman 's shoulder pads , and he did n't get up .
It happened so fast that , " I thought the guy on the bottom was injured , " Coleman said .
Etheridge knew something was wrong immediately .
" I was in shock just not being able to move , " he said .
" The only thing I could say was , ' Jesus , Jesus ' . . . just calling out his name . "
Etheridge was hurt , and lucky .
He had landed on Scott , but Scott did n't move , and thus did n't jostle Etheridge .
" If I had moved , he could have been paralyzed , " Scott said .
Ole Miss coach Houston Nutt said Etheridge was lucky because " we are always coaching to get off the ground and get back to the huddle .
It was really a miracle he did n't push the guy out of the way like we normally do . "
Bynes , seeing Etheridge was hurt , told Scott not to move .
With members of each team kneeling in prayer , Etheridge and Scott lay together for long minutes until the medical team strapped Etheridge on a board , locked his head and neck down and wheeled him off the field .
" When I was on the ground , I was moving my toes a little bit , " Etheridge said .
" I did n't have much feeling , but when I got on the stretcher , they were like , ' Move your hands and just let everyone know your fine . '
That 's when I was able to put a thumbs - up and that 's when I knew that all the prayers that went up , God answered . "
But could he play again ?
" That was probably the first question I asked , " Etheridge said .
Etheridge was taken to the East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika with his parents following the ambulance .
" All moms , they do n't like to see their child on the ground , " Etheridge said .
Etheridge said " they were trying to hold me down " at the hospital , but showed everybody he was bouncing back .
Against advice , he walked to the rest room .
The doctors wanted to be sure he was OK , so they sent him to a Birmingham hospital by ambulance .
Etheridge put an optimistic spin on what he heard .
" At first the doctor gave me that ' they do n't know , " Etheridge said .
" We got some pretty results from the MRI and the X - rays and the CAT scan -- things look up and I 'll be able to play again . "
Coach Gene Chizik and some teammates went to Birmingham on Sunday and visited him .
He 's been texting his teammates throughout .
Tuesday , he surprised them by walking in on a team meeting .
Then he volunteered to talk to the media to thank the fans who had expressed their concern .
" I told my mom that I got messages from a lot of people , " Etheridge said .
" I want the world to know that I 'm fine .
I want to thank everybody for their prayer requests .
That helped my family out . "
Auburn Athletics Director Jay Jacobs called his Ole Miss counterpart Monday to praise Scott .
Ole Miss Athletics Director Pete Boone said he 's also heard from a lot of Auburn fans .
Etheridge tried to call Scott on Tuesday to thank him for not doing anything .
He missed on his first call , but did talk to Nutt and thanked him for the Rebels ' sportsmanship .
Chizik said Sunday " it was one of the most amazing things I 've seen " the way Scott knew not to move .
Etheridge was with his team as Tuesday 's practice began .
He says he 's under doctor 's orders not to attend Saturday 's homecoming game against Furman .
" They want me on bed rest , " Etheridge said .
That may be a hard pill to swallow .
" I will definitely be at the Iron Bowl , " he said .

An international seed bank has reached its target of collecting 10 % of the world 's wild plants , with seeds of a pink banana among its latest entries .
The wild banana , Musa itinerans , is a favourite of wild Asian elephants .
Seeds from the plant , which is under threat from agriculture , join 1.7 billion already stored by Kew 's Millennium Seed Bank partnership .
The project has been described as an " insurance strategy " against future biodiversity losses .
A wild banana has been chosen as a flagship species
The seed bank partnership , which involves more than 120 organisations in 54 countries , is now aiming to collect and conserve seeds from a quarter of the Earth 's flowering plant species by 2020 .
All the seeds are kept both in their country of origin and in Royal Botanic Gardens Kew 's premises at Wakehurst Place , West Sussex , where they are stored in underground vaults that are kept at - 20C .
The plant material is dried , cleaned and sorted , ensuring only the finest specimens make it into the giant freezers .
There , the cold and arid conditions keep the seeds in pristine condition for anywhere between a few years to thousands of years , depending on the species .
The seeds are painstakingly cleaned and sorted
The aim is that each seed stored in the bank can be regrown , should the need arise .
The wild banana plant from China was selected as the " 10 % species " by the bank 's international collaborators because it fulfilled a number of conservation criteria .
Janet
Terry , the seed processing manager at the bank , said : " It was chosen because it is representative of what the whole project is all about - it is endemic , endangered and it is an economic species .
" And of course , everybody loves a banana . "
Musa itinerans becomes the 24,200th species to have been stored in the seed bank .
Bank on seeds - the world 's buffer The 10 % target was set when the Wakehurst Place facility was completed in 2000 .
At that time , it was estimated that there were 242,000 plant species in the world , although more recently it is thought that there might be 300,000 .
Professor Stephen Hopper , director of the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , told BBC News : " In the next phase , we want to secure another 15 % , so by 2020 we will have a quarter of the world 's seeds banked in both the country of origin and Wakehurst Place .
" And a major focus is going to be a considerable expansion in the sustainable use of seeds for human benefit . "
The researchers will be focusing on food security , biodiversity loss and climate change .
Professor Hopper added : " The thing that has changed over this 10 - year period is a much more acute awareness of climate change as a threatening process , as well as the many others that impact on plant life .
" And the seed bank , as an insurance strategy , is a good sensible way of keeping your options open for the future . "
So far , the project has cost £ 73.6 m ; RBG Kew estimates that it will cost another £ 140 m over the next decade to reach the next set of targets .

No December 7 Sacramento temperature as low as 27 degrees has ever been recorded – since observations started in 1849 .
Carbon dioxide continues to increase , so Al Gore is not worried .
IPCC and Al Gore apologize if anyone is inconvenienced by the rapidly cooling climate .
Please continue not to exhale , or at least send all your cash to save the world from global warming due to greenhouse gas carbon dioxide .

Snow is coming to the Sacramento Valley — but only a light dusting is expected on the streets of Sacramento .
The National Weather Service said today that 2 - 4 inches of snow is expected to fall at the 1,000 - foot elevation , below Auburn and El Dorado Hills .
Cindy Matthews , forecaster , said a dusting of snow is likely to start in the pre-commute hours in Sacramento and should continue off and on throughout the day .
The cold storm system dropping from the northeast out of Canada will be unusual since the coldest temperatures will bypass Northern California communities such as Red Bluff and Redding but drop Sacramento Valley temperatures Monday to a record 27 degrees .
That ’s the coldest for Dec. 7 since the National Weather Service began tracking temperatures in Sacramento in 1849 .
The city of Sacramento last had 2 inches of snow in February 1976 .
Matthews said a trace amount of snow has fallen in the area four times since then – most recently on Jan. 28 , 2002 .

Summary : Research spanning 20 years proves PDFs are problematic for online reading .
Yet they ’re still prevalent and users continue to get lost in them .
They ’re unpleasant to read and navigate and remain unfit for digital - content display .
Jakob Nielsen first wrote about how PDF files should never be read online in 1996 — only three years after PDFs were invented .
Over 20 years later , our research continues to prove that PDFs are just as problematic for users .
Despite the evidence , they ’re still used far too often to present content online .
PDFs are typically large masses of text and images .
The format is intended and optimized for print .
It ’s inherently inaccessible , unpleasant to read , and cumbersome to navigate online .
Neither time nor changes in user behavior have softened our evidence - based stance on this subject .
Even 20 years later , PDFs are still unfit for human consumption in the digital space .
Do not use PDFs to present digital content that could and should otherwise be a web page .
PDF Usability Issues
The usability problems that PDF files cause on websites or intranets are plentiful :
1. Linear and limiting .
PDF files are typically converted from documents that were planned for print or created in print - focused software platforms .
When creating PDFs in these tools , it ’s unlikely that authors will follow proper guidelines for web writing or accessibility .
If they knew these , they ’d probably just create a web page in the first - place , not a PDF .
As a result , users get stuck with a long , noninclusive mass of text and images that takes up many screens , is unusable for finding a quick answer , and boring to read .
There ’s more work involved in creating a well - written , accessible PDF than simply exporting it straight from a word processing or presentation platform .
Factors such as the use of color , contrast , document structure , tags , and much more must be intentionally addressed .
2. Jarring user experience .
PDFs look completely different from typical web pages .
They take users out of a familiar context and into one that is outdated and clunky .
Even if your PDF looks slick and you think users will be able to navigate with shortcuts like Control or Command +
F to find information , think again .
The most polished PDFs still look out of place in a web browser and not all users know keyboard shortcuts .
We ’ve repeatedly observed advanced users get stuck in PDFs and fail to find information this way .
3 . Slow to load .
While the risk of crashing a user ’s browser or computer by serving up a PDF is lower than in years past , PDFs can be excruciatingly slow to load both on desktop and mobile .
In one recent study , a cafeteria menu housed in a PDF on an intranet took almost 3 minutes to download .
Before giving up on the task , the user said ,
“ And we ’re waiting … we ’re waiting …
At about this time I ’d say , I really do n’t care what ’s for lunch . ”
Additionally , if users are forced to download a hefty PDF using cellular data instead of WiFi , they wo n’t be happy if they incur extra charges , as a result .
4. Stuffed with fluff .
PDFs tend to lack real substance , compared to regular web pages .
When you ’re building out a web page , you can visibly see how long it ’s getting and how far users will have to scroll to consume the content .
Methods of structuring and formatting digital content such as chunking , using bullets , subheadlines , anchor links , and accordions help users efficiently skim and scan sections that may contain the answers they seek amid long - form copy .
However , in PDFs , those techniques are n’t always used and content creators tend to favor quantity of content over quality and formatting .
This leads to overwhelmingly long and inane PDFs .
5. Cause disorientation .
Because PDFs are n’t web pages , they do n’t show a standard navigation like a website would .
Users often struggle to stay oriented with where they are , and how to get back to where they were before .
If PDFs open in a new browser tab or window , and users do n’t notice , they ’ll wonder why the browser ’s back button does n’t work and how to get back .
Or , if the PDF opens in the same browser window or tab and the user does n’t notice , they close the window or tab assuming it did in fact open in a new one .
They ’ll then have to start their session all over again .
On mobile this problem is exacerbated , as it ’s much more cumbersome to close a browser window to get back to the previous screen you were on .
The best case scenario for opening a new tab or window is that the user notices and closes out of the window , or moves to the other tab to get back .
The best case scenario for keeping users in the same tab or window is that they notice the back button remains active , and use it to get back to the previous page .
Since we ca n’t rely on best case scenarios , it ’s best to not take users to a PDF within a browser at all .
If you must , do contextual research to understand if your users get stuck in PDFs or separate applications when new tabs or windows open .
6. Unnavigable content masses .
Most PDF files have no internal navigation ; their mini IA is completely hidden and people have no quick way of ( 1 ) understanding the type of content available in the PDF ; and ( 2 ) getting to the interesting bits without scrolling through everything that comes before them .
Many proponents of posting PDFs instead of creating web pages , think that a clickable table of contents will solve this issue , but it does n’t .
Users have to spend much time and effort scanning the table of contents for those keywords that match their task or information need .
Even if users find a promising word , it may be misleading .
We ’ve observed users jump to a section of a PDF , only to find it does n’t contain the information they needed or they miss the answer in all the fluff .
The users are then forced to scroll 75 - pages back to the table of contents to try again .
7 . Sized for paper , not screens .
PDF layouts are often optimized for a printed sheet of paper , which never aligns with the size and scale of the user 's browser window .
Regardless of whether they ’re viewing the PDF on desktop or mobile , users can say “ so long ” to smooth scrolling and hello to tiny , unreadable fonts .
Not to mention having to pinch , zoom , squint , and scroll around out of context to navigate a PDF on mobile .
Users also demonstrate trial - and - error behavior with PDFs in browser windows .
They try to click on items that look clickable , only to disappointedly find out they ’re not .
Users Strongly Dislike PDFs
Burying information in PDFs means that most people wo n’t read it .
Participants in several of our recent usability studies on corporate websites and intranets did not appreciate PDFs and skipped right over them .
They complained woefully whenever they encountered PDF files and many who opened PDFs quickly abandoned them .
Following are behaviors and quotes from business professionals testing the About Us areas of corporate websites .
One user looking for information on the Small Business Administration ’s website got stuck in a PDF .
While she was trying to figure out what exactly the administration did , she said ,
“ I expect it to talk more about what they can do for me .
If the print was bigger , that would be really helpful .
Now , I ’m stuck in a PDF . ”
Another user was looking for information about where Wells Fargo was headquartered and got stuck in a PDF .
He said , “ I expected to see it at the bottom of the contact us page ; it ’s not there . ”
The user proceeded to use site search to try to find the headquarters location .
After typing in headquarters , he was taken to the history section of the website .
He clicked on a link that said , Wells Fargo Today , and said ,
“ Maybe it ’s in Wells Fargo today .
All of a sudden that downloads a PDF , ew !
At this point , I would just Google it . ”
The following user quotes are from several employees testing different intranets :
“ I ca n’t stand that the PDFs open in a different window .
It should open in the same browser . ”
“ Every time you click , it opens a new window or PDF .
I am frustrated because nurses always click the Back button and we want to go back to the previous web page . ”
“ Information is outdated in those PDFs .
So you ’re getting stuff that is n’t current .
They just have n’t taken those links off . ”
“ I do n’t know if they [ a PDF with email - signature templates ] are updated .
I ca n’t confidently share it .
Sometimes there are multiple versions of PDFs . ”
“ All of the PDFs are horrible .
There are so many old forms and version control is so difficult .
We ’re starting to move them into a database but first have to audit them and track down people to ask them if they still need the form .
We ’re taking the top-used forms and tackling those first . ”
“ Again , it seems to be taking me to a lot of PDF documents ... I was hoping the info would just be at the top of the search results . ”
“ I was overwhelmed by the 41 - page PDF of policy procedures . ”
“ It ’s a SharePoint PDF .
I would much rather see all of this in a regular webpage format . ”
“ I do n’t know if it ’s common , but when I ’m looking for content , I find it hidden in a PDF .
I prefer to see that on a web page itself rather than going into PDFs .
It ’s the way I prefer the content rather than switching mediums . ”
“ I did n’t think it would be a PDF document .
Oh , oh , goodness . ”
“ We ’ve come across problems with PDF forms .
Others have to download the form in order to use it the way we want them to use it .
You have to download it to get the features to work , so we always have to specify at the top of our documents that our partners are using these and they might not have the latest PDF readers . ”
“ For our documentation , we use PDFs , but people need a searchable page or an article .
We ’ve been doing PDFs for 10 years and now we ’re wondering how we can make this information more usable and searchable on the site .
We get questions every day about documentation and 99 % of the time , we have the answer , but it ’s buried in a PDF and people do n’t want to have to look for it in there .
Or , if they search for something we have , it does n’t come up in search results because it ’s in a PDF . ”
We 've had similar reactions from users in many other studies , including tests of B2B and ecommerce websites where users complained about sites that presented product specs or customer success stories in PDF instead of on web pages .
Here 's a quote from a customer who shunned the parts of the site that were in PDF :
" It looks like I 'm going to have to go to PDF , which I 'm dreading . "
Use HTML Gateway Pages Instead of PDFs
Given PDFs poor usability for online reading , user - experience designers should either avoid using PDFs altogether in favor of presenting content on web pages , or , in cases where a printable PDF is needed , use an HTML gateway page .
Gateway pages are web pages that summarize the key points and critical information from a PDF , and then they offer users the option to download the full PDF without having to open it in a browser window , where it ’s unfit for consumption .
The PDF file size should be as small as possible to preserve quality , while allowing it to download quickly .
Site search and public - facing search engines should index and link to the gateway page , never the PDF directly .
Unfortunately , through our continued research and content work with clients , it ’s become clear that HTML gateway pages still are n’t used nearly enough to help users avoid or circumvent the issues caused by PDFs .
Findings From Earlier Studies in 2001 and 2010 Still Hold True
Jakob ’s Alertbox article from June 2001 , Avoid PDF for On - Screen Reading , provides an earlier analysis of PDFs based on the studies we did almost 20 years ago , as does our original 2003 assessment that PDF is unfit for human consumption .
Surprisingly , the difference between then and now is not much .
Yes , there are fewer browser and computer crashes as a result of serving up PDFs , but just as much if not more user hostility toward PDF .
People have ever - increasing expectations and more experience with the usability problems associated with PDFs — not only on desktop , but now on mobile too .
Another update to this article in 2010 found similar problems with PDFs as those uncovered in both 2001 and in our most recent rounds of research over the past few years .
Our new studies keep finding the same problems with PDFs in online interfaces .
It ’s time to put an end to problematic PDFs , once and for all .
